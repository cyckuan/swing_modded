 SENATE OKS RATE CUT FOR SAN DIEGO  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state Senate approved a plan Thursday to roll back San Diego
power rates to pre-deregulation levels as legislators held their
first hearings on California's soaring electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado (San Diego County), introduced
legislation to return San Diego's utility rates to July 1999 levels
until lawmakers can decide whether to repeal or revise the state's
deregulation blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Average power bills in the Southern California city _ the first
to feel the full effects of deregulation _ have more than doubled
over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 28 to 0 to send the bill to the Assembly next
week. If it passes there, it would then go to Gov. Gray Davis for
his signature before being enacted as law.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let San Diegans suffer while we sort this whole
thing out,'' Alpert said.
</P>
<P>
   Her bill would be retroactive to June, when San Diego ratepayers
first saw their electricity bills jump as San Diego Gas and
Electric passed along surging wholesale power prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation is vague about how San Diego Gas and
Electric would recoup its costs if a rate limit is reimposed.
Alpert said this is a matter that would be taken up down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably this isn't the utility's favorite bill of the
year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her bill also would require the California Public Utilities
Commission to investigate why electricity prices are going through
the roof and present its findings to federal regulators as part of
a petition to officially determine that the state lacks a
competitive energy market.
</P>
<P>
   The governor already has called on the PUC to make such a
request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can
mandate ``just and reasonable'' rates when a market is deemed
uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Davis asked the PUC to require so-called level
pricing for San Diego Gas and Electric customers, which would
stabilize electricity bills by spreading wholesale costs over
longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, this would reduce bills during the summer but raise
them at other times of the year when usage is comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is scheduled to act on the proposal at a special meeting
August 21.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's legislative hearing, more than a dozen energy
industry insiders, experts and concerned citizens appeared before a
joint meeting of the Senate and Assembly utilities committees to
discuss how deregulation had taken a wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   Most matters discussed were technical in nature and offered no
clues as to what, if anything, the Legislature may do to effect a
long-term remedy for the state's electricity woes.
</P>
<P>
   Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, a
San Francisco consumer group, offered a mixed review of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, she said, legislators appeared to be
showboating to convey to constituents that they take deregulation
seriously. On the other, Hoge said, a number of legislators seem to
genuinely comprehend the complex issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very acute understanding that deregulation is not
working,'' she said. ``But there's a great deal of confusion about
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous questions centered on how California got into this mess
and why San Diego ratepayers have been socked so badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an experiment, and San Diegans were the guinea
pigs,'' PUC President Loretta Lynch told the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   A number of questions focused on whether those in the business
of generating power have been manipulating prices on the state's
wholesale electricity market. Although there is widespread belief
that this is indeed the case, it remained unclear whether such
actions are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the tone of the hearings was subdued and generally
monotonous. An unexpected highlight came when legislators paused
midway through their discussion of electricity for a warning that
their microphones might not be operating properly.
</P>
<P>
   There was a short in the system.

 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RACE KEY TO HOUSE CONTROL  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ Underscoring the national significance of the
campaign to replace Republican Tom Campbell, R-Calif., Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt and two dozen House members rallied for fellow
Democrat Mike Honda Thursday in downtown San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give us Mike Honda, you give us a majority _ and we will
change this country,'' said Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is
expected to become House Speaker if Democrats pick up the seven
seats they need to win a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The South Bay district, which stretches from Great America's
roller coasters to Santa Cruz's wooded mountains, has become ground
zero in each party's efforts to win control of the House. Evenly
split between Democratic and Republican voters, it is currently
represented by Campbell who is leaving the House in an effort to
unseat Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very tough race'' said Commerce Secretary Norm
Mineta, who represented the district for 20 years and joined
Democrats Thursday for a lunch with technology leaders sponsored by
Visa. The lunch and rally were held in the congressional district
represented by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a couple of miles from the 15th
Congressional District that Honda is seeking to represent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 435 House seats subject to election this November, only
several dozen are considered up for grabs, including half a dozen
in California. The huge stakes and the GOP's narrow House majority
has prompted party leaders to spend considerable time in the state
in districts where the outcome is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert was in the South Bay on Wednesday
on behalf of Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, the GOP's candidate. Arizona
Sen. John McCain has made appearances for Cunneen, and is expected
to return in the fall. Virginia Rep. Jim Davis, the head of the
Republican's House Campaign Committee has already made three
visits.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gephardt has made the trip to the
district three times, noting Thursday the potential for Democrats
to have a monopoly on the three Silicon Valley seats (Lofgren and
Rep. Anna Eshoo, both Democrats, represent other portions of the
region.)
</P>
<P>
   ``These are historic choices,'' Gephardt said. ``What we try to
get the voters to understand is the national consequences'' of
their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both Honda and Cunneen serve in the state Assembly. Both &LR;   &LR; They
are regarded as likable moderates, with similar records on issues
such as abortion, guns and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that regardless of Cunneen's moderate record, it
is critical to elect a Democrat to break up the GOP majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no moderate Republican,'' insisted Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., who is the head of Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. ``The majority controls the agenda. From day
one (Cunneen) signs his soul away with the Republican right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunneen, in a phone interview on his way back from Sacramento,
called Kennedy's position ``naive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, people are going to vote on who is
going to best represent Silicon Valley,'' Cunneen said.
</P>
<P>
   The throng of Democrats were in the Bay Area at the invitation
of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, who arranged a three-day
tour of the area's hottest high-tech sights. The gathering was part
educational, part fund-raising, and part a rally for Pelosi's quest
to become the Majority Whip if Democrats win control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the tour has been a fantastic learning experience
for members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day (technology) changes. That's why I wanted people
here. It doesn't matter what anyone knew yesterday, it's about what
you know for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats figure there are five California seats now held by
Republicans which could easily go their way in November _ providing
them most of what they need to win back the House. Republicans
concede they will be lucky to hold their ground in California, but
are hopeful they can contain their losses to just a seat or two.

 HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No suspense at the Democratic Convention?
</P>
<P>
   How about this: Who dyes?
</P>
<P>
   With all the hard-hitting journalists swarming Los Angeles,
someone is sure to blow the lid off the coverup coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore dyes his hair, it would appear, but how, who and why? We
want details. And one reader swears that Joe Lieberman dyes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Are we ready for a Democratic ticket that isn't comfortable with
its collective natural hair color?
</P>
<P>
   Gore reportedly tries to keep his bald spot out of view as much
as possible. One rumor is that he tabbed Lieberman as VP so he
(Gore) could have an excuse to wear a yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   Don't smirk, GOPs. Remember President Reagan, whose hair was
once described as ``prematurely orange?''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, by the way: Natural hair, but he colors his
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   CHUMP CHANGE: Zia Kahn sends an ad that appeared in The
Chronicle's New Homes section.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is for Bridle Creek in Pleasanton, which boasts of homes
``From the low $1,000,000s.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, that would have been an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   PANSY POACHERS and assorted flower filchers, beware:
</P>
<P>
   Flower theft is epidemic. The thieves rob parks and yards and
gardens and sell for big bucks at the Flower Market.
</P>
<P>
   The news is that the cops have come up with a plan that should
result in arrests.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, eventually this will make an exciting episode
of ``Nash Bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   PARKERS WALK: At the Pan Pacific Hotel near Union Square, the
``Motor Court'' crew of about 28 _ valet parkers, bellmen,
chauffeurs _ has been on strike for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Many gripes. The strikers claim the Pan charges an arm and a leg
to park your car, but gives the guys who park it the finger.
</P>
<P>
   RE: REDUNDANCIES returning redux:
</P>
<P>
   Don Fogg writes, ``Redundancies are a very American literary
form,'' and cites: ``(I)n order to form a more perfect union ...''
</P>
<P>
   And: Old adage (Ken Lesher) ... Reflecting back, consensus of
opinion (Sarah Morse) ... Very unique (Tracy Bates) ... ``Have you
risen up or entered into anything lately?'' (Matthew Downing) ...
Traffic jam (Q) ... Future prospects, old traditions (Marvin
Chandler).
</P>
<P>
   And today's educational corner: Do you know what a pleonasm is?
Scott Summerville does. It's ``the use of more words than are
necessary to express an idea.'' Like free gift or fully nude.
</P>
<P>
   Scott S. also notes that near Phoenix there is a flat-topped
mountain (the bottom is probably flat, too) named Table Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't ask what is the diff between a pleonasm and a
redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SCAM? Customer sits down, but there's food on the seat and
he stains his nice pants. He writes a letter to the restaurant's
management, complimenting the place but asking that they pay his
cleaning bill of $13.85.
</P>
<P>
   Most restaurants would shrug and send a check.
</P>
<P>
   Only trouble is, this ``accident'' took place in mid-July at the
Gramercy Grill, which has been closed down all year for remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wren, provider of this item, suggests that if the
stained-pants man was unlucky enough to have 1,000 similar
accidents, he could rake in $13,850.
</P>
<P>
   The receipt submitted with the man's letter is from Privilege
Cleaners in Beverly Hills _ such an exclusive establishment that it
has no phone listing.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, at least Pants Man isn't out stealing flowers.
</P>
<P>
   DANCERS GET BOOT: What's happening in the Mission is being
called a cultural clear-cutting. Everything old and artsy must go.
The latest casualties: Two long-time dance studios.
</P>
<P>
   Dance Mission had its rent jacked up from $5,500 a month to
$20,000. Dancers' Group Footwork, same deal, from $3,000 per to
$15,500. Both are likely to fade away after decades of dance.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, city of homeless hoofers.
</P>
<P>
   To see what you'll sooner or later be missing, take a guided
hike Saturday (11 a.m., corner Mission and 24th), through the 'hood
of endangered species _ artists, small businesses, nonprofs.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE Carmel Pine Cone's ``Police and Sheriff's Log'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman reported someone yelled obscenities at her when she
failed to allow a squirrel to cross the street in front of her.''

   The question is: In Carmel, which of those two crimes is the
more dastardly?

A REPENTANT CLINTON REVIEWS HIS PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 6th and 7th grafs; subs 12th graf starting Aides to
Gore, etc., for rewriting)   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BARRINGTON, Ill. _ Four thousand church members bowed
their heads Thursday and prayed for a sinner in their midst _ a man
who, like them, was struggling in his life with right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guide his path,'' intoned Bill Hybels, senior pastor at the
Willow Creek Community Church. ``Fill him with your wisdom and
cause him to keep growing personally and maturing.''
</P>
<P>
   The man before them was President Clinton, and he had just
described how his life had spun out of control after an adulterous
affair, how his job sometimes overwhelmed him, how the past seven
and a half years had had low moments and wonderful ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not careful when you have this kind of job, it can
overtake you,'' the president said wistfully, sitting on a swivel
chair on a stage in an enormous church. ``You can believe it's even
more important than it is. You can let it take up even more time
than it should. It can crowd out all that other stuff that keeps
you centered and growing and whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has reflected on impeachment before, and he has
discussed his religious beliefs throughout his presidency. But his
reflections Thursday amounted to a live public interview on the
personal travails of his presidency, conducted by a pastor who has
counseled him regularly since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And he went out of his way to give credit to Vice President Al
Gore for the administration's successes and to insist that Gore
should not be blamed for Clinton's personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get enough credit for what we did together that is
good and, surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for any
mistake that I made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can say, `Hey, the state of my spiritual
life is great, it's constant and it's never going to change.' I
think I've learned enough now to know that's not true, that it's
always a work in progress and you just hope you're getting better
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not getting better,'' he said, ``chances are you're
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance at the church came at a delicate time, just days
before the Democrats are to open their political convention in Los
Angeles, and shift the spotlight from Clinton to Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore have expressed their annoyance that Clinton and
his wife, Hillary, plan such a high profile role at the convention,
and the president's headline-grabbing remarks here on the eve of
the convention could add to their annoyance, even if they are
grateful to Clinton for his praise on Thursday for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Gore campaign continued to express frustration over
the repeated dredging up of Clinton's affair _ already back in the
news because Gore's vice presidential pick, Sen. Joseph Lieberman
of Connecticut, had criticized Clinton so openly about it.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore adviser observed drily, ``We're trying to keep the
focus on the future and on the issues that matter to the voters,
and this isn't in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore aide said the campaign hoped that the selection of
Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to chastise the president
openly, would underscore that the ticket was separate from the
president and also that the president's comments clearly reflected
that his affair had been his own problem.
</P>
<P>
   But White House aides said there had been no political
calculation in sandwiching the president's confessional between an
educational event in Chicago and an evening in New York City for
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had promised Hybels _ who described himself as the
president's ``behind the scenes spiritual adviser'' _ that before
he left office he would appear at one of Hybels' leadership
summits, which draw pastors and other church leaders from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the religious retreat had been
contentious. Some conservative pastors had opposed the visit and
had insisted that Hybels not go easy in his questioning of Clinton
in his missteps. And Hybels, in a sympathetic way, obliged.
</P>
<P>
   He asked about the president's dog, Buddy. He asked about the
issues the president cares most about and how he wants to be
remembered. But he asked as well about Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's face appeared on two large screens in the church
auditorium, the kind of close up that the television networks use
to show the awkward, perspiration-inducing moments of an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have given evidence that I need to be in church,''
Clinton said at one point, referring to the fallout from what he
called ``my personal crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he continues to rebuild his life after his affair
with a White House intern, and he said he continues to grapple with
the state of his character and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had also found a silver lining in the whole
uncomfortable public airing of his missteps. ``In a funny way, when
you realize there's nothing left to hide, it sort of frees you up
to do what you ought to do anyway,'' the president said of his
ongoing counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the embarrassing episode had humbled him, and he
encouraged other politicians to seek spiritual advisers to guide
them throughout the pressures of public office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that even presidents must realize that they were
flawed, both as politicians and policymakers. ``I am quite sure
that some of my positions are wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment episode aside, Clinton said the lowest moment of
his presidency came when he learned that 18 U.S. soldiers had been
killed in a military action he had ordered in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the sickest I have been since I have been here,'' he
said, adding that all military actions were a strain on him. ``You
know the chances are some of them are going to die.'' And even if
U.S. soldiers do not die, they are likely to kill someone else, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton rattled off far more positive recollections from his
presidency _ legislation that had passed, foreign-policy successes,
standing with Nelson Mandela in the prison cell where he had spent
so much of his life. And Clinton said he would miss the ups _ and
even the downs _ of being president.
</P>
<P>
   More than riding on Air Force One or hearing ``Hail to the
Chief'' when he walks into a room, or waking up every morning in
the White House, Clinton said, ``what I will miss more than
anything else is the job.''

NASA TO SEND TWIN ROBOTS TO MARS IN '03
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a year after two Mars-bound missions vanished in
space, NASA officials announced they will send two powerful roving
robots to the Red Planet in 2003 to search for evidence of water _
the key ingredient for life.
</P>
<P>
   The twin 300-pound rovers, scheduled to land on Mars within
three weeks of each other in January 2004, will each carry two
cameras, five instruments and a ``abrasion tool'' designed to
scrape away weathered rock surfaces and reveal the chemical
composition of the ancient rocks, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Images transmitted to Earth last June by Mars Global Surveyor,
the orbiting spacecraft, showed the planet to have dramatic
features. According to scientists, they could only have been made
by gullies, channels, trenches and fan-shaped rocky regions where
surging water would have dumped debris the way flashfloods on Earth
fling boulders as big as cars downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Such features were all located in a region near the south pole
of Mars. But the planet and Earth will be in a different alignment
when the twin rovers land, so they will only have access to areas
nearer the Martian equator, Mars Program Manager Firouz Naderi said
Thursday, speaking from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think of a human geologist examining rocks on Earth,''
Naderi said, unable to conceal his excitement over the new project:
``Our Martian rovers will each have eyes to seek out promising
rocks from four feet above the ground, a tool to grind the rock
surfaces, a camera just like a hand lens to examine the fine grains
within the rocks, and five instruments to analyze the chemistry of
the rocks and nearby soil in detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the NASA decision came at a Washington press
conference where Edward Weiler, the agency's chief of space
science, said: ``To have two rovers driving over dramatically
different regions of Mars at the same time, to be able to drive
over and see what's on the other side of the hill _ it's an
incredibly exciting idea.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's schedule for increasingly sophisticated Mars missions had
called for only one landing on the planet in 2004, but the
two-pronged approach ``adds resiliency and robustness to our
exploration program,'' said Scott Hubbard, Mars program director at
NASA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of both rovers will be to learn about ancient weather
and climate on Mars,'' said Steven Squyres, the Cornell planetary
geologist who is chief scientist for the new rover missions. ``You
can think of each rover as a robotic field geologist, equipped to
reach the geologic record at its landing site and to learn what the
conditions were like back when the rocks and soils were formed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Mars-bound spacecraft are scheduled to be launched from
Cape Kennedy aboard Delta II rockets in 2003 _ the first on May 22
and the second on June 4. They will follow identical paths through
space and land on Mars 71/2 months later and 18 days apart.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will not chose specific landing sites for another two
years. First they must do an intensive study of images taken by the
Mars Global Surveyor, which has been orbiting the planet for more
than three years. Additional images are expected to come from a new
orbiting Mars Surveyor craft due to be launched next April.
</P>
<P>
   Both landing sites will lie in an area between five degrees
north of the Martian equator and 15 degrees south, Naderi said, and
both will be within broad regions offering tantalizing glimpses of
what seem to be ancient lakebeds and river channels.
</P>
<P>
   The two rovers will each run on six wheels powered by solar
batteries. Each will be capable of transmitting images and
chemistry findings directly to Earth, where mission controllers can
direct the vehicles toward promising features for direct
examination and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The rovers will be able to travel more than 300 feet in a single
solar day, and will cover at least a half-mile of terrain during
the scheduled 90-day mission, Naderi said. If all goes well and the
rovers are in good shape, the mission could be extended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a disastrous one for NASA's Mars exploration
efforts. In September a $125 million orbiter vanished as it was
nearing the planet, and in December a $165 million lander
disappeared only minutes before it was supposed to reach the
Martian surface. No one yet knows what caused the two failures.
</P>
<P>
   Cost figures have not been firmly set for the two new Mars
landing missions, but according to Hubbard the first rover is
expected to cost between $350 million and $400 million, while its
twin should benefit from economies in testing and development and
cost about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even at those prices the Mars ventures are relatively cheap
compared to some other missions. The cost of a Galileo mission to
Jupiter or a Cassini to Saturn can run a billion dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance to double our science and do it for far less
than twice the cost,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, the images the rovers send back to Earth
will be immediately relayed to a new site on the Internet.

RIO GRANDE OFFICIALS VISIT, HOPE TO NAB COWBOYS

   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Six representatives from a group trying
to lure the Cowboys to the Rio Grande Valley for training camps
paid a visit to the team's Midwestern State University facilities
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a negotiating trip. We're up here strictly to
observe and learn ... to see how it's done,'' said Randy
Whittington, Rio Grande Valley Regional Sports Authority chairman,
adding with a laugh, ``And to see what we've gotten ourselves into,
if it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys break camp one week from today, completing their
third year on a year-to-year lease arrangement with Midwestern
State.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones said he has spent as much as $1 million per
year on training camp, although the cost at Midwestern State has
been estimated at closer to $400,000 _ including food, housing and
security.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande Valley proposal, approved by the McAllen and
Mission city councils last week, would pay Jones $350,000 per year
for three years, and Jones admitted that ``breaking even'' would be
good business. The proposal also includes a promise to have a
state-of-the-art training site in place at Sharyland Plantation's
Pepsi Park by July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Jones acknowledged yesterday that the Cowboys have hired a
representative to check two California sites, but Jones declined to
identify either site.
</P>
<P>
   It might be moot because Jones has made it known that he is
extremely interested in the Rio Grande Valley effort, which
coincides with his fondness for tapping into Mexico as an NFL
market. The proposed site is 10 miles from Reynosa, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A source in camp close to the situation has said that Jones'
``instincts are that it's going to work out'' for the Cowboys to
relocate to the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   However, a deal has not been struck and no timetable has been
set for a decision, according to people on all sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been optimistic since the first time I ever talked to
\RJones\S about coming to the Valley,'' Whittington said. ``There's
still a ways to go ... but I'm still optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharyland Plantation is a 6,500-acre combination community
living/business park created by Dallas oilman Ray Hunt of Hunt
Valley Development. Pepsi Park already is being used by amateur
softball and baseball leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of \Rthe developing\S they're doing, they're going to do
anyway, whether the Cowboys come or not,'' said Whittington,
adding, ``They may be laying the sod for the \Rpractice\S fields as
we speak.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, always complimentary toward Midwestern State and Wichita
Falls as a training site, isn't expected to make his decision known
until after camp breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern State officials were hoping to keep the Cowboys
``three to five years'' when Jones relocated from Austin in 1998,
according to Howard Farrell, the school's vice president of
student/administrative services.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said yesterday that he has not ruled out returning to
Midwestern State. He did say that the ``McAllen people are further
down the road'' than any site in California.
</P>
<P>
   Whittington and his group ate lunch in the Midwestern State
dining hall yesterday and were taken on a tour of the campus
facilities by Cowboys director of sales and marketing John Hickman.
</P>
<P>
   Whittington was joined by Hidalgo County Judge Eloy Pulido,
Steve Ahlenius and Nancy Millar from the McAllen Chamber of
Commerce, Viola Espinosa of the Mission Chamber of Commerce, and
Tony Aguirre, vice chairman of the Rio Grande Valley Regional
Sports Authority.

DEMOCRATS UPSTAGE BUSH WITH CHAVEZ HOLIDAY LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALINAS, Calif. _ Democratic lawmakers upstaged Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's attempts to woo Central Valley Latino voters
Thursday by voting to make farmworker leader Cesar Chavez's
birthday a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush chugged by train through the Central Coast saying he
was proud of his family's ``sangre latino'' _ Latino blood _ the
Democratic-majority Legislature fast-tracked a long-dormant bill
declaring Chavez's March 31 birthday a holiday, at least for some
employees.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of $52.5 million, state workers would get a paid day
off while schools could choose to hold a half-day of instruction,
including an hour about Chavez's life.
</P>
<P>
   Students would be encouraged to spend the rest of the day
performing some community service.
</P>
<P>
   Although backers of the bill say its passage at nearly the same
time Bush whistle-stopped through Salinas was just coincidence, the
vote came at an opportune moment.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it overshadow the Republican nominee's effort to
court Central Valley Latinos, it also underscored the Democrats'
long-standing commitment to farmworkers rights _ on the eve of the
party's national convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say I was that smart,'' said Richie Ross, a
political consultant for the United Farm Workers Union, referring
to the timing of the bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided three or four weeks ago to push the bill out
yesterday to create an opportunity for the governor to sign it
around the convention,'' Ross said. ``Bush was not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis announced he would ``proudly'' sign
the Chavez holiday bill, but probably not at the Democratic
convention, which is designed to be a showcase for Vice President
Al Gore. Davis' office said he could delay the signing until Gore's
first swing through California after his nomination, then sign it
with the vice president at his side.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign trip up the central coast of California from
Santa Maria to Salinas _ where Chavez fought for decades to
organize farm laborers in the lettuce fields _ Bush often
encountered the late farm labor leader's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   And he was met by some sharp criticism from UFW President Arturo
S. Rodriguez, Chavez's son-in-law, who charged that Bush's
treatment of laborers in Texas undercuts the GOP candidate's
efforts to attract farmworker votes here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see a Republican candidate for high office reach
out to Latinos and farmworkers and speak to them in Spanish,'' said
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our people are sophisticated enough to look beyond
(Bush's) rhetoric to the policies he has supported as governor of
Texas,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, traveling from Santa Maria to Lodi and Stockton Thursday,
was accompanied by Arizona Sen. John McCain on the second day of
his train trek.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip _ his seventh to the state since the March primary _
has been carefully shaped to highlight his outreach to
traditionally independent and Democratic voters, particularly
Latinos, and farmworkers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's bunting-draped train has provided the campaign
with rich photo opportunities, including stops in small coastal
farm towns, many populated by farmworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bush addressed thousands in both Spanish and English
at a railway station in Salinas. Asked by reporters his opinion of
Chavez, Bush said the labor leader ``certainly broke new ground
when it came to fighting for individual rights. I have respect for
people standing for what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had signed a Texas proclamation honoring Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at the Republican National Convention, Bush's
24-year-old bilingual nephew George P. Bush appeared to compare
Chavez's leadership to that of his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how, upon the death of Chavez, his Mexican-born
mother urged him to find a leader ``who represents our people, who
represents our culture. That person ... is my uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats vehemently disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Cesar Chavez. I worked with Cesar Chavez. And Gov. Bush
is not, and never will be, Cesar Chavez,'' said Art Torres, who
heads the state's Democratic Party. ``Here's a guy who didn't come
out against Proposition 187, and he comes to Salinas and acts like
he cares about farmworkers,'' Torres said. ``The photo op and the
rhetoric just don't match his deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Grossman, the former spokesman for Chavez and current
spokesman for the UFW, called the comparison of Bush to Chavez
``not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that he's reaching out to Latinos ... but what's
more important are the policies,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, he said, small farmers are exempted from the Fair
Labor Standards Act, with the result that ``the minimum wage for
thousands of farmworkers in Texas is $3.35 an hour _ $2.00 below
the federal minimum wage guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, farmworkers receive the federal $5.75 an hour
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said Bush, contrary to his expressed concern for
Latinos, has never expressed support for a wage increase for such
workers, and their salary hasn't risen in Texas since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an impromptu press conference aboard his Amtrak
campaign train, argued that the exemption to the federal minimum
wage in Texas applies only to ``a small number of people'' _ those
who work on small farms that don't export products outside the
state.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that more than 96 percent of all Texas workers are
paid minimum wage, and insisted he was committed to helping them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of people that come to our state and have been
for generations,'' he told reporters. `Our fundamental question is
how to help the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   And Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said it was unfair to
compare the higher salaries of California farm workers to those in
Texas. ``The cost of living is far less in the rural areas where
this mostly applies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Grossman was unimpressed by Bush's defense. ``How can a
civilized society expect any worker to survive on $3.35 an hour?,''
he asked. ``Is that compassionate conservatism?`
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bush faced questions about his comparisons to Chavez and
his outreach to Latinos, Democrats were already preparing to
counter with the governor's signing of the Chavez bill.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Davis had tried to speed passage of the bill
so he could sign it on Chavez's birthday. Lawmakers didn't oblige
him. The bill remained bottled up in the Assembly Appropriations
Committee until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed the Senate unanimously Thursday with two
Republican votes. Other GOP senators were present but did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the Assembly's 79 members voted against the bill,
including a GOP lawmaker from Fresno who appeared to part ways with
Governor Bush over the memory of Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has there been a figure in human history who will
receive the attention Cesar Chavez will under this bill,'' said
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, in expressing his opposition. ``This bill
gives state workers a day off, not farmworkers. If you want to
honor the farmworker movement, there has to be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Abel Maldonado, R-Santa Maria, accompanying Bush
on his tour, defended the Texas Governor even as he touted his own
upbringing as the son of Mexican farmworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado also defended the comparisons between Bush and Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cesar Chavez was a man who wanted to leave no child behind.
Governor Bush talks about that. Cesar Chavez wanted to help the
voiceless and the vulnerable. So does Governor Bush,'' he said.
`Obviously, he's been getting elected with huge Hispanic votes in
Texas -- 50 percent of that vote...and I think he's done a lot for
Hispanics.''

TORRES' SPARKLING RETURN HOPEFULLY IS REAL DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Four years ago, at the doddering age of 29, Dara
Torres was roundly convinced that she had put the notion of
swimming in the Olympics behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's how far it was from my mind,'' Torres said last night.
``I went to the '96 Games as a spectator, and I went to all the
other events ``except'' for swimming. I didn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``During those seven years off, no, I never thought about
getting back in the water again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a confession that echoed of achievement, but likely will
soon ring with accusation. Torres innocently offered the anecdote
as a way of showing how far she has come, from the comfortable
couch of a seven-year retirement to yet-another place on the U.S.
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials here last night, Torres'
battle with Jenny Thompson in the final of the women's 100-meter
butterfly showed itself to be the arresting head-to-head duel that
everyone hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   The two swimmers _ teammates, only in the broadest sense of the
term _ were never more than an arm's length apart. They finished,
as expected, one-two, with Thompson touching the wall first in
57.78 seconds and Torres reaching for the other Olympic spot in
57.86.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of their rivalry, a cat fight that both
continue to publicly deny, but while still in the water last night
they hugged. They slapped fives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just one big happy team now _ USA,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The roomful of interviewers seemed to smirk as one. I don't
think anyone was buying it.
</P>
<P>
   They asked Torres the same thing a few minutes later, and she
shot back, sarcastically, ``No, it was totally fake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, yes, it was real. I was psyched. I was psyched for
myself and for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The race lacked only the regal trimmings of a record, something
Torres had done in Wednesday's first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Both tried to offer explanations, which sounded more like
apologies. Thompson, whose last Olympic Trials in 1996 had been a
personal disaster _ expected to make the team in four individual
events, she made it in none _ said that she became so emotional
last night at the thought of finally winning the trials, she slowed
down over the final 25 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torres: ``We got to the 75-meter mark. I looked to see
where she was, and I started to rush my stroke and tightened up.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, the ex-Texas and now Palo Alto, Calif., coach
whose attention they vie for, called it an important learning
experience for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got caught up in the race with themselves,'' Quick said.
``I think it's worth reminding that Dara swam her best time in the
prelims \Ran American record 57.58\S when she was just swimming
with rhythm, and Jenny did the same in the semis (57.59). Today,
they tried to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   They share the same coach, but also the same dream. Both have
been to the Olympics and won gold medals, but only in relays, not
in the individual events. Both were also expected to be long since
retired by now.
</P>
<P>
   In Thompson's case, however, the pedigree was there. She went
into the previous Olympic Trials ranked as a legitimate medal
contender in Atlanta in three separate events. Torres, on the other
hand, disappeared from the world swimming scene in 1992, ranked
seventh in the 100 fly, sixth in the 100 freestyle and 15th in what
might now be her best event, the 50-meter free.
</P>
<P>
   She has returned to the global scene not only with new purpose,
but sporting a conspicuous new body. Her arms and shoulders, in
particular, ripple with muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Given swimming's dark headlines over the past eight years, she
can expect to come under more than passing scrutiny in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Richard could pretty much tell you the work I've
done,'' Torres countered last night. ``It's been done through hard
work, dedication and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, this is supposed to happen, and I'm just
enjoying the ride. And I feel great knowing I've done it the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Thompson nor Torres is wont to talk about her new
training regimen, one that reportedly includes a veritable buffet
of pills and natural supplements under the administration of Austin
nutritionist Glen Luepnitz. Everything that the two have put into
their body, Luepnitz has said, is natural.
</P>
<P>
   Natural, however, in recent years has taken on a variety of
meanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you something,'' Quick interrupted. ``If I ever
thought that any athlete of mine was cheating, I wouldn't coach
them one more second.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard work and commitment, Quick contends, can produce
``steroid-like performance.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a regretful commentary on the state of Olympic swimming
that Quick finds himself having to defend his two once and future
Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   The hug, Torres said, was not fake. Let's hope her and Thompson
aren't, either.

 CEO OF CATHOLIC CHARITIES RESIGNS OVER EXPENSES  &HT;     By TOM ZOELLNER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Frank Hudson resigned as the chief executive
officer of Catholic Charities of San Francisco Thursday after the
charity's board condemned his ``lavish and extravagant'' spending
on restaurant meals and cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A Board of Directors investigation into Hudson's spending habits
concluded that he ``melded his professional and personal
lifestyles'' by spending $73,000 of charity money over two years on
gourmet meals at top-tier restaurants such as Stars and Zuni Cafe
and on anti-wrinkle treatments and laser hair removal.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson had said he was dining with politicians and business
leaders in an attempt to boost the charity's visibility. But the
report found that in some cases, he had listed on receipts the
names of people who were not present at the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the receipts were approved not by the board finance
chairman but by Hudson's personal assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have had a wake-up call,'' said San Francisco
Archbishop William Levada, who met privately with Hudson several
times earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sorry for the impact this has had on agency and for the
impact that it has had on donors and the city at large,'' said
Levada, who is head of the charity's board. ``I think he felt that
very keenly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, who had been in his job eight years, could not be
reached for comment at his Petaluma home last night.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities, in existence since 1907, is one of the
largest providers of social services in the Bay Area, running 37
programs that serve 100,000 clients. It also has $10 million a year
in contracts with the city of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson was replaced by Brian Cahill, the former head of the San
Francisco Department of Social Services and the current executive
director of the Catholic Youth Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are angry and upset and feel deceived,'' Cahill
said last night. ``I acknowledge credibility has been lost. But I
believe we can restore trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop's spokesman Maurice Healy said Hudson's resignation
is effective immediately, but that he will continue to be paid
through the end of October. He will be given no severance package,
but was not asked to reimburse any of the money he spent on meals.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson was asked to return his company car, a 1998 Chevrolet
Suburban, leased by Catholic Charities from a Santa Rosa dealership
for $579.75 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Hudson's spending habits were first reported in The
Chronicle on June 22, but Hudson remained on the job for seven
weeks in the belief he could survive the criticism, said some
employees close to him. He repaid $3,158 on cosmetic treatments and
apologized for ``not being sensitive enough'' to public
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But Hudson's fate became apparent last week when Levada called
Cahill to inquire of his availability.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Harry Johnson, who attended Thursday's closed-door
meeting at St. Mary's Cathedral, said there was little question
that Levada had had enough of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hudson had not tendered his resignation, he would have been
fired,'' Johnson said. ``He told half-truths to the board and
squandered agency money.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Brian Swift said, ``People have to understand this
is not like a normal board of directors. In this board of
directors, only one person (the archbishop) makes the decision. The
Catholic Church is not a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added the board should have been paying closer attention to
Hudson's spending. ``We really need to tighten our controls,'' he
said. ``There's a certain mea culpa attitude about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an awkward footnote to the affair, the board accepted
Hudson's resignation the day of a long-scheduled party at the
archbishop's residence to honor the top 25 donors to Catholic
Charities. Hudson had been invited, but neither he nor Cahill was
there, attendees said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said they hoped Cahill's appointment would quickly
restore public trust in San Francisco Catholic Charities, whose
finances suffered from the revelations about Hudson's spending.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, calling Hudson's
spending ``unconscionable,'' reduced a contract with Catholic
Charities to run residential treatment centers for HIV patients to
$1 million from $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Charity staffers said the nonprofit also stood to lose another
$1 million in donations from corporations and Catholic
parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fund-raisers are sort of embarrassed to be promoting the
organization right now, so activity is kind of slowed,'' said one
high-ranking staff member who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill is a native San Franciscan who attended St. Patrick's
Seminary in Menlo Park in the 1960s with hopes of becoming a
priest. But he switched careers before ordination, earned a
master's in social work from San Francisco State University and
became head of the San Francisco Boys home.
</P>
<P>
   After working as the executive director of the California
Association of Services for Children, he served as then-Mayor Frank
Jordan's head of the Department of Social Services from 1992 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said one of his first moves would be to change Catholic
Charities' leadership structure from corporate-based to one more
typical of a nonprofit agency. The leader will no longer be a
``CEO'' but an ''executive director'' and will work under more
scrutiny from the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hudson, Catholic Charities's budget grew from $7 million
to $23.5 million. But critics inside the charity complained the
organization was too focused on winning lucrative government
contracts and too quick to close programs that seemed to be
financial losers.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the controversy surrounding Hudson's spending is
the continued operation of Guerrero House, a home for young
homeless people in the Mission District, which had been slated for
closure. Board members say they will try to find alternative
funding for the center's $480,000 annual budget.
</P>

   ``The bottom line is that we need to be good stewards of
people's money and if we're not, then we're betraying a trust,''
Cahill said. ``We're supposed to be doing what's in the Gospel. The
principle of stewardship has slipped a little and it need to be set
right.''

 BUCHANAN MOVES HIS REFORM PARTY FACTION TO THE FAR RIGHT  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As the Reform Party shattered into two
warring conventions Thursday, Pat Buchanan moved his faction
solidly to the right with a three-page manifesto that laid out his
solidly conservative beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The statement compares abortion to Adolf Hitler's euthanasia
program, describes homosexuality as ``a sign of cultural decadence
and moral decline'' and calls for a ban on women in combat, saying
``a country that sends its women out to defend it is a country not
worth defending.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan acknowledged that the Reform Party platform is silent
on the social, cultural and moral issues that were the basis of his
two campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination. But he
said, ``I do not believe presidential candidates can remain
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon news conference, Buchanan said the statement
``will be binding only on me and the vice presidential candidate''
he is scheduled to name this morning. But he left little doubt that
his campaign as a Reform Party nominee would be the same type of
moral crusade that he and his backers ran in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one political leader can reverse ... moral decline,'' he
said in his statement. ``But a president can put himself in the
vanguard of those who wish to make America God's Country again.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan pledged to use the moral authority of the presidency
``to support a rule of law based on a moral order that is rooted in
Biblical truth and the laws written by God on the human heart.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Reform Party Divided
</P>
<P>
   The former television commentator's conservative beliefs, along
with his hardball political tactics, have helped split the Reform
Party into battling factions that are holding separate conventions
less than a mile apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Buchanan has attempted to corrupt the presidential
process,'' said Jim Mangia, a longtime supporter of party founder
Ross Perot and head of the breakaway group. ``He is the worst
example of politics as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangia and physicist John Hagelin, who is challenging Buchanan
for the Reform Party nomination, led about 200 supporters on a
morning march to the Long Beach Convention Center; where  &LR; they were
turned away when they tried to get into the hall where the
delegates were slated to meet.
</P>
<P>
   After some shouting, fist-waving and a couple of choruses of
``We Shall Overcome,'' the dissidents marched to the nearby
performing arts center, which they had already rented for their
rump convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said official convention delegates were welcomed,
regardless of who they supported, but that security people turned
away protesters who weren't on the list of delegates. The
opponents, he suggested, are merely sore losers who aren't willing
to admit they don't have the delegates to swing the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played by the rules everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way Mangia sees it. To him, Buchanan and his
backers have hijacked the Reform Party and are changing it to
mirror their own conservative beliefs at the expense of the party's
top issues, such as campaign finance reform and nuts and bolts
changes in the way the country is run.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the Reform Party nomination also gets $12.5 million
in federal election funds, money that goes to parties that pull
over 5 percent of the vote in the previous presidential election.
Mangia filed a formal complaint Thursday with the Federal Election
Commission, asking them to bar Buchanan from receiving the money
because of alleged vote fraud in the Reform Party's mail-in
balloting. He said he would rather see the party shut out
completely than have any of the money go to Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pat Buchanan wins the nomination, it's the end of the
Reform Party, because he won't get the 5 percent needed to keep us
as a national party,'' Mangia said. ``Hagelin has a better shot,
because at least he's not the most hated political figure in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he was confident he would win the nomination,
survive any legal challenges and run a full-blown campaign in the
fall. He also  &LR; ridiculed the little-known Hagelin, who is also the
three-time presidential candidate of the tiny Natural Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Hagelin is a log thrown on the railroad tracks, and it
will not even slow our express,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin spoke last night at the rump convention, but Buchanan
was not in the hall when he was nominated by the main body of the
party. He plans to stay away from the convention until he gives
what he says will be his acceptance speech Saturday night.

 UNCONVENTIONAL YOUTH DEFY DEMOCRATS OVER CONVENTION  &HT;     By NEVA CHONIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ Jesse Osorio hangs suspended by a rope 50 feet in the
air, tightening the climbing harness that keeps him from falling.
Once secured, he turns to watch as a procession of young activists
below him advances up a dirt road waving banners and chanting,
``Corporate power _ we say no.''
</P>
<P>
   A line of menacing figures in uniforms blocks their path. One
burly uniformed man advances, shaking his nightstick like a
schoolmarm. ``This is an unlawful assembly,'' he shouts. ``Disperse
or you'll be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists respond by breaking into a chorus of ``Joy to the
World.'' Then a scuffle erupts. Officers wrestle protesters to the
dusty ground, roughly handcuffing their wrists behind them. True to
their nonviolent civil disobedience principles, the demonstrators
go limp while their friends link arms and try to form a protective
circle around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeze!'' calls a trainer. Demonstrators fall silent, the faux
officers pull back their papier-mache billy clubs, and 18-year-old
Jesse starts to rappel back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a real demonstration at next week's Democratic
convention, he would be unraveling a banner down the side of a
building. But right now, he just wants to reach the lunch line
before the potato salad runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Training for the convention protests is in high gear in Malibu,
where Berkeley's Ruckus Society is conducting role-playing
exercises and workshops for high school and college students who
want to make a difference in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse and his fellow Ruckus campers are part of a growing number
of young people responding to the call of nonviolent political
activism. In an era marked by voter apathy, they are challenging
generational stereotypes of dot-com kids out to make a quick buck
or disenchanted outsiders content to slack off into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's camp has a specific goal: Ruckus and other
organizations such as San Francisco's Global Exchange, the Youth
Action for Global Justice Network (JustAct) and the Rainforest
Action Network are preparing attendees for protests outside next
week's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, which is expected to draw 10,000 to 50,000
protesters, young activists will speak for myriad causes. What
joins them is their opposition to corporate globalization, which
they say promotes sweatshops and prison labor, flouts labor laws
and human rights and destroys the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Jesse, are veterans of the huge demonstrations
against the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle or the
International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, D.C. Others will
be confronting teargas, pepper spray and plastic bullets for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be facing potential arrest: An estimated 385
people, including Ruckus Society Director John Sellers, were jailed
during demonstrations at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia. At one point, Sellers' bail was set at an
astronomical $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Young demonstrators are unfazed by such potential hazards. They
just take more first-aid classes and train harder. No one ever
promised that change would come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Menotti, program director for the International Forum on
Globalization, predicts that this generation of dedicated teenage
and post-teenage activists have the potential to shift the
country's political balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a desire,'' he says, ``to defy all the stereotypes
about youth, ... that they're apathetic, that they're slackers,
that they're materialistic. Seattle was a call to action, to come
and resist something, just as Vietnam was.''
</P>
<P>
   And like Vietnam, it's galvanized youth throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse is into his third month as a San Francisco YMCA counselor.
Today he stands surrounded by screeching 6-year-olds in front of
the Commodore Sloat Elementary School, counting heads after a field
trip to San Jose's Raging Waters Park. His dark chin-length hair
cascades around his face as he untangles himself from a sea of
tugging hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta make sure they're having fun and not doing nothin'
crazy,'' he says, herding the undersize kids toting oversize
backpacks into the school gymnasium to wait for their parents.
``They're always trying to test that limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse knows about testing limits. As a kid growing up South of
Market and in Hunters Point, he spent as much time getting drunk
and high as he did in school. He even joined a gang ``for a
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no opening for me to get involved with something
positive,'' he says. ``All I had was the streets, so I basically
lived by the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Jesse joined the Third Eye Movement, a Bay
Area organization that was founded to fight last year's Proposition
21, a juvenile justice measure that many say singles out youths of
color. Third Eye has grown since then and continues to organize
activism within the hip-hop community.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom says you need to take care of family before you can go
out there and take care of the world, and it's true,'' Jesse says,
watching the urban scenery fly past on the freeway ride west to
Hunters Point. ``You have to fix your community first before you
take on global racism, sexism, patriarchy, white supremacy. It all
starts with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Act locally, think globally'' is more than a handy slogan for
Jesse. In the past year, it has increasingly become his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a converted dining area off the main room of the Osorio home,
Jesse's bedroom literally smells like teen spirit. Posters
promoting hip-hop concerts, the World Trade Organization protests
and anti-Proposition 21 events share space on the wall with his
graduation medals. Laundry lies scattered on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse pulls a large, silver letter ``K'' from his shelf and
grins mischievously. ``This `K' came from Seattle. It was part of a
Niketown sign.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Angelina Osorio, shakes her head. As petite and
well-ordered as her two-bedroom house, she surveys Jesse's domain
with large, sad brown eyes. ``My other son,'' she says, ``is very
neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse credits his mother for keeping him alive and healthy until
he found his path as an activist. She moved to California from
Mexico in 1968 and has devoted the past 17 years to supporting her
five children and increasingly frail husband, who was 72 when Jesse
was born, on the thin salary of a nurse's aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was lucky to have a tough mama who cared about me,''
Jesse says. ``She wasn't one of those parents who just tossed me
out and let me do my own thing. No matter what crazy hell I brought
home from school, she always cared about me and wanted me to get my
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning his room is the least of the struggles Angelina and her
youngest child have shared over the years. In middle and high
school, Jesse was called on the carpet for cutting class and being
habitually tardy; throwing water balloons at girls and drinking
beer on school grounds; talking too much in class, and, most often,
mouthing off to teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Angelina was, more often than not, beside herself. ``I said,
`Jesse, why do you talk to your teachers that way?' He said, `Mom,
because I don't want to talk behind their backs. I want to tell
them my feelings to their faces. And I don't like the way they
treat us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse raises his head proudly. ``I don't like it when people
abuse their power to get their own way,'' he responds. ``If you
want to win, then win by your knowledge, not your power. Just
because you can override other people doesn't make you right. I
don't care if you're the top person in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned how to deal with that sense of injustice when he
transferred to McAteer High School for his senior year and
discovered the Third Eye Movement. Suddenly, he says, his
frustration found a focus as he learned about the roots of class,
racism and what many teenagers regard as the criminalizing of youth
through legislation such as Proposition 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the get-go, I knew I fit in perfectly. We were all mad at
the world and were finding ways to channel that anger.'' Soon he
was volunteering for HIV/AIDS education and other community
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of learning all the academic stuff, I learned about
myself and what I wanted to do,'' he says. ``Someone once told me
that you can be a straight-A student and still flunk at life. Well,
if I had to choose one, I'd rather get an A in life. I'd rather
live happy and dumb than smart and lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Third Eye introduced Jesse to a new world of social activism,
from fighting gentrification to opposing corporate lobbies. When a
coalition of Bay Area activists set out to protest the WTO in
Seattle, he went along. What he saw there amazed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so cool,'' he recalls, smiling. ``It showed me for the
first time how powerful people can be if they join together.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother would rather he had just stayed home. ``When those
things happened in Seattle, I was scared,'' she says of the WTO
protests. ``I sat so close to that television, looking for Jesse. I
was so worried about him. Even before he went, I said, `Jesse, I
don't want you to go there. They put students in jail.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I don't want to see that happen to you.' He said, `Well,
Mama, if they put me there, at least it's for something good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She watches Jesse set up a game of Twister with his niece. ``I
liked the way he talked, and I was proud of him, but I worry.
Nothing happened to him, thank God. Then he told me he was going to
Los Angeles. I said, `When are you going to stop this, Jesse? First
Seattle, now Los Angeles. And then?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse stops his game and sits quietly for a moment. ``Mama, the
way I see it, there's a revolution happening. We can't fix things
overnight, so I guess whenever we see an opportunity to make some
noise, we're gonna have to take it. We have to fight for what we
think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   A pause. Then gingerly, his mother suggests, ``But couldn't you
go to college first?''
</P>
<P>
   The sun is setting over the Pacific Ocean as the Ruckus campers
prepare for dinner. The scent of braised tofu wafts through the
cooling mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse, dying for a hamburger but reluctant to insult his
friends' cuisine, sits on a bluff smoking a Chesterfield and
contemplating the coming Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making sure that we create actions that won't have a
high tendency for people getting arrested,'' he says of Third Eye's
contingent. ``We're gonna have some folks who are under 18, so we
want to make sure we bring them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse surveys the hazy downtown L.A. skyline. ``I don't know
what's going to happen down there, but I think we're ready, willing
and able to sacrifice ourselves for what we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   With a final drag, he crushes out his cigarette and heads back
toward camp.

WILLIAMS INCONSISTANT, BUT WINS ANYWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif _ Serena Williams wows the crowd with her
100 mph serves, forceful forehands and ability to run down
virtually every ball. Her power is evident, but it's sometimes raw,
and it might be important to remember that for all of her success _
including the U.S. Open title and the Wimbledon semifinal _ she's
just 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   However, 18 is a veteran age in women's tennis and it was the
veteran in Williams who overcame her inconsistencies and Conchita
Martinez to post a 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 victory Thursday in an estyle.com
Classic quarterfinal at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the defending champion and No.5 seed, played the day's
only quarterfinal. In second-round matches, second-seeded Lindsay
Davenport defeated Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France 7-6 (7-0), 6-7
(7-4), 6-2, Amy Frazier upset seventh-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 and Lisa Raymond swept 17-year-old
qualifier Daja Bedanova 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had her way in the first set, winning the last four
games. But she ran into trouble in the second set, when her
overzealous play led to too many unforced errors. Her approach game
also failed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm strong mentally. I'm staying in there,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   That she did, offsetting a poor service game (just 47 percent of
her first serves landed in) with a solid receiving game. She broke
Martinez seven times, including the final game.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Williams has followed a five-week layoff with a
38-minute breeze and a slightly longer and more difficult match.
Now, she has beaten a ranked player and will face either top-seeded
Martina Hingis or Frazier in Saturday's semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good I had a test,'' Williams said. ``It's good I played
a top player.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top player who struggled yet won was Davenport. She has
faced Sidot twice _ though not since 1997 and won easily both
times. But Davenport is in a mental funk right now, making every
match a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through a cycle where I'm not playing well,''
Davenport said. ``I've got to fight my way through it. I fought my
way out of it in Wimbledon, but I don't feel like I'm hitting the
shots I want.''
</P>
<P>
   She can't take time off because the U.S. Open is in three weeks,
followed by the Olympics. So she has to remember what led to her
previous success.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport also should have remembered Sidot's serve, which kept
the Frenchwoman in the match. Davenport and Sidot held serve
through the first set, but in the tiebreaker Sidot's serve left
her. She double-faulted on the first two and fifth points.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport reciprocated in the second-set tiebreaker with two
double-faults of her own. Otherwise, ``the only reason I won was
holding serve. I only got broken once.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier can't recall a better two weeks in her 10-year pro
career. She beat Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals last week in
Carlsbad en route to her second semifinal berth in 14 tournaments,
and knocked off Sanchez-Vicario to reach today's quarterfinal
matchup (rematch?) with Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nice to be playing good tennis,'' Frazier said,
``and it's so much fun to play so many matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Frazier has beaten Sanchez-Vicario the last three
times they have played, although the two hadn't met since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario trailed 5-1 and faced being broken for the match
in the third set before rallying and closing to 5-3. But Frazier
broke her to win.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond took advantage of Bedanova's weak second serve to win
points with a crafty drop shot. Bedanova appeared to expect either
a deep slice or a powerful forehand, only to watch helplessly as
Raymond dropped balls into the frontcourt. &QL;

CLIPPERS INTRODUCE GENTRY AS NEW COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by LANG partners) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alvin Gentry wasn't the first offered the vacant
Clipper coaching position. A long list of names emerged before
Gentry reach frontrunner status.
</P>
<P>
   But after a tortuous six-month search, the former Piston and
Heat coach was happy to be the one saying, ``I do'' on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I the first person, I don't know,'' Gentry said after being
introduced as the new Clipper coach at the Marina Del Ray Mariott.
``I probably wasn't the first choice of my wife either. We've been
together 10 years and she kinda likes me. ... That doesn't bother
me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry was given a four-year contract, but the dollar amount or
how many years were guaranteed were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching search led Clippers brass from Mike Fratello to
John Lucas to Bob Huggins and finally to Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, who first met with the Clippers at the pre-draft camp in
Chicago, was excited about the young Clippers team, which includes
a roster that in places is younger than some college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, who was an assistant for the Clippers under Mike Schuler
in the 1990-91 season, said he wasn't worried about the negatives
that surround the Clipper organization and often scare coaches and
players away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned what this organization is going to do from
this day forward,'' Gentry said. ``I think as you look, I think
this is a golden opportunity for this franchise. The young players
that we have going for us here. And we have a chance to make this
special over the next couple of years and something that can last
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, Clippers vice president of basketball operations,
watched Gentry since he arrived as a Clippers assistant. Baylor
said Gentry's style fits the young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Alvin, Alvin has patience,'' Baylor said.
``When he has to get tough he can do that. With young players you
have to be careful because you can kill their confidence right
away. I think Alvin is going to relate very well to the players. I
think he is the kind of coach that is going to be able to motivate
players.''
</P>
<P>
   This despite Gentry being fired in Detroit in part because his
players had reportedly tuned him out. Joe Dumars, one of those who
decided to let Gentry go with 24 games left last season, was one of
the people the recommended Gentry to Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations had been set the year before as far as making the
playoffs and getting things rolling,'' Dumars said. ``When it
didn't happen _ the NBA is a long season _ he got caught in
tailspin, guys weren't playing up to their ability. The decision
was made to make a change right now. By no means did anyone say
that Alvin Gentry is a terrible coach and can't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry took over in Detroit for Doug Collins in February 1998.
In the lockout-shorted 1999 season he took Detroit to the playoffs,
losing in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the team lost seven of 10 and 11 straight on the
road before Gentry was let go. Gentry in part blamed the skid on
Grant Hill missing a number of games with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You struggle without Grant Hill out there and they made a move
and you are entitled to do that,' Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry finished with a 73-72 record with the Pistons. He was
also coach of the Miami head for 34 games in 1995, going 15-21 and
bringing his overall coaching record to 88-93.
</P>
<P>
   Despite firing him five months ago, Dumars felt that Gentry
would be able to relate well to oung players because Gentry is the
type of coach players can easily talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know will Alvin the teaching is fundamentally right,'
Dumars said. ``It didn't work out in Detroit. You know what give
him a chance with a young team and high energy guys and this may be
the right fit for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry also had the strong pull of Philadelphia 76ers coach
Larry Brown, who is the only coach to take the Clippers to the
playoffs twice. Brown had lunch with Clippers owner Donald Sterling
this month and when presented with a list of possible coaches,
pushed for Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry was an assistant for Brown at Kansas from 1985-88 _ the
Jayhawks won the national championship in 1988. When Brown moved on
to San Antonio, Gentry moved with him and spent two seasons as an
assistant before joining the Clippers as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Brown recommended Gentry for two reasons: He can teach young
players and he wanted the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would be great with young kids,'' Brown said. ``I
think he would work well with Elgin and (Sterling). I believe he is
a young coach that can teach with the experience he had in college
and the opportunity he had in our league.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added, ``He really wanted the job and I thought that was
very important. A lot of people look down on the Clippers. He's a
very decent guy that loves to teach and coach. I thought with young
kids they would be receptive to that. Not everybody gives us a
chance to teach on our level and I think he enjoys that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of teaching to do with high schooler Miles, who
would be a freshman in college. Keyon Dooling, Quentin Richardson
and Corey Maggette would all be college juniors this season.
</P>
<P>
   Miles, Dooling and Richardson worked out with Gentry before he
was introduced in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Miles and Richardson's agent, David Falk, had openly pushed for
Lucas for the job. But the two said they were happy with the choice
of Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him a thumbs up,'' Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson added, ``I was pretty happy with it. He seemed to
work well with us being young guys and trying to improve on our
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lamar Odom wasn't at the news conference, Clippers center
Michael Olowokandi met Gentry for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Last year) there wasn't any defense,'' Olowokandi said. ``He
said we are going to be playing defense ... to me that is
definitely a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of teaching the young players, Gentry said he won't
stand for players being late for meetings or the team bus. Gentry
said he wants the young players to understand that they have the
responsibilities of a job.
</P>
<P>
   On the court next season, two keys for Gentry are defense and
making it clear that Odom is the focus of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Grant Hill and I see Lamar and I see the same talent,''
Gentry said. ``I think he is a great basketball player. I'm not
afraid to tell the other guys that this is Lamar's team. It will be
his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry said that he will likely retain Dennis Johnson and Rex
Kalamian as assistants and hire a third coach. &QL;

CLIPPERS INTRODUCE GENTRY AS NEW COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alvin Gentry wasn't the first offered the vacant
Clipper coaching position. A long list of names emerged before
Gentry reach frontrunner status.
</P>
<P>
   But after a tortuous six-month search, the former Piston and
Heat coach was happy to be the one saying, ``I do'' on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I the first person, I don't know,'' Gentry said after being
introduced as the new Clipper coach at the Marina Del Ray Mariott.
``I probably wasn't the first choice of my wife either. We've been
together 10 years and she kinda likes me. ... That doesn't bother
me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry was given a four-year contract, but the dollar amount or
how many years were guaranteed were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching search led Clippers brass from Mike Fratello to
John Lucas to Bob Huggins and finally to Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, who first met with the Clippers at the pre-draft camp in
Chicago, was excited about the young Clippers team, which includes
a roster that in places is younger than some college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, who was an assistant for the Clippers under Mike Schuler
in the 1990-91 season, said he wasn't worried about the negatives
that surround the Clipper organization and often scare coaches and
players away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned what this organization is going to do from
this day forward,'' Gentry said. ``I think as you look, I think
this is a golden opportunity for this franchise. The young players
that we have going for us here. And we have a chance to make this
special over the next couple of years and something that can last
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, Clippers vice president of basketball operations,
watched Gentry since he arrived as a Clippers assistant. Baylor
said Gentry's style fits the young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Alvin, Alvin has patience,'' Baylor said.
``When he has to get tough he can do that. With young players you
have to be careful because you can kill their confidence right
away. I think Alvin is going to relate very well to the players. I
think he is the kind of coach that is going to be able to motivate
players.''
</P>
<P>
   This despite Gentry being fired in Detroit in part because his
players had reportedly tuned him out. Joe Dumars, one of those who
decided to let Gentry go with 24 games left last season, was one of
the people the recommended Gentry to Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations had been set the year before as far as making the
playoffs and getting things rolling,'' Dumars said. ``When it
didn't happen _ the NBA is a long season _ he got caught in
tailspin, guys weren't playing up to their ability. The decision
was made to make a change right now. By no means did anyone say
that Alvin Gentry is a terrible coach and can't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry took over in Detroit for Doug Collins in February 1998.
In the lockout-shorted 1999 season he took Detroit to the playoffs,
losing in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the team lost seven of 10 and 11 straight on the
road before Gentry was let go. Gentry in part blamed the skid on
Grant Hill missing a number of games with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You struggle without Grant Hill out there and they made a move
and you are entitled to do that,' Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry finished with a 73-72 record with the Pistons. He was
also coach of the Miami head for 34 games in 1995, going 15-21 and
bringing his overall coaching record to 88-93.
</P>
<P>
   Despite firing him five months ago, Dumars felt that Gentry
would be able to relate well to oung players because Gentry is the
type of coach players can easily talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know will Alvin the teaching is fundamentally right,'
Dumars said. ``It didn't work out in Detroit. You know what give
him a chance with a young team and high energy guys and this may be
the right fit for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry also had the strong pull of Philadelphia 76ers coach
Larry Brown, who is the only coach to take the Clippers to the
playoffs twice. Brown had lunch with Clippers owner Donald Sterling
this month and when presented with a list of possible coaches,
pushed for Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry was an assistant for Brown at Kansas from 1985-88 _ the
Jayhawks won the national championship in 1988. When Brown moved on
to San Antonio, Gentry moved with him and spent two seasons as an
assistant before joining the Clippers as an assistant.

and the opportunity he had in our league.
</P>

   Brown added, ``He really wanted the job and I thought that was
very important. A lot of people look down on the Clippers. He's a
very decent guy that loves to teach and coach. I thought with young
kids they would be receptive to that. Not everybody gives us a

EVERYTHING CLOSE AT U.S. SWIM TRIALS

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Ed Moses won the 100-meter breaststroke by 0.65
seconds Thursday at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials. On this day,
that qualified as a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Every final was so tight and the atmosphere so airless, it was
as if the IUPUI Natatorium had been turned into a giant Tupperware
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100-meter butterfly, Stanford's mismatched pair of Jenny
Thompson and Dara Torres were expected to be separated by little
more than static cling and they didn't disappoint. Thompson edged
her teammate, 57.78 to Torres' 57.86, to avenge the loss of her
American record to Torres the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The width of an eyelash was what separated Diana Munz from 1996
Olympian Brooke Bennett after 400 meters of freestyle. Munz was
declared the winner by 0.05 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And the only things racing faster than USC sophomore Erik Vendt
and Tom Dolan in the 400 individual medley were the hearts of the
4,500 spectators. Vendt and Dolan were within spearing range of
Dolan's six-year-old world record before settling for a photo
finish, Dolan touching in 4:13.72 to Vendt's 4:13.89.
</P>
<P>
   As if the crowd's collective knuckles weren't white enough,
Vendt's Trojan Swim Club teammate Lenny Krayzelburg came within
0.07 seconds of his own world record in the semifinals of the
100-meter backstroke. Krayzelburg's global mark of 53.60 ought to
be put on the endangered-species list immediately. It could be gone
today, when the final is contested.
</P>
<P>
   Other impressive swims were turned in by Kevin Clements of
Industry Hills, who finished fourth in the I.M., and ex-UCLA
standout Richelle Fox and USC's Karen Campbell, who finished fourth
and fifth, respectively, in the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of his USC teammates, who see how hard Vendt works day
in and day out, not too many people expected the Massachusetts
native to be a handful for Dolan or Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   Vendt wasn't even convinced he could stay close to the
front-runners. Vendt's best event, after all _ at least in his mind
_ is the 1,500 freestyle. The 19-year-old looked at the 400 I.M. as
a really grinding warmup for next week's mile.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into a war when Vendt allowed himself a sidelong
glance during the breaststroke leg and saw that he was not only
near Dolan and Wilkens, he was practically even with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pushed off the wall (after the breaststroke leg) and I
was right there with them, I was more excited than anyone on the
pool deck,'' Vendt said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe everyone but Krayzelburg, who was roused from his
warmdown swim by the roar of the crowd. When he glanced at the
scoreboard and saw Vendt's splits, he hopped out of the water and
added his voice to the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost lost my voice,'' Krayzelburg said. ``I couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vendt, at 5-foot-10, gives up eight inches to the wiry Dolan,
but he didn't give up an inch when Dolan found another gear to slip
into with 50 meters to go. Krayzelburg wasn't surprised. ``Erik's
got a heart of a lion,'' he said. ``He's a feisty little guy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Vendt finished and saw the ``2'' next to his lane, he
pumped a fist at his parents in the stands _ just as he imagined
he'd do after making the Olympic team in the 1,500 _ and then tried
hard not to wake up from this wonderful dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to swim that fast,'' said Vendt, who took a
five-second chunk out of his previous personal best. ``I really
thought it was out of my reach. I thought I could sneak in if I had
a great race.''
</P>
<P>
   Today it's Krayzelburg's turn. ``Hopefully,'' Krayzelburg said,
``I can do something special.'' &QL;

LOS ANGELES: people signed on.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, even in a party town like L.A., next week will seem
excessive. You could literally skip the convention and spend the
entire week attending brunches, lunches, receptions, dinners,
concerts and after-hours events scheduled from one morning to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Micucci, founder/owner of Along Came Mary Productions of
Los Angeles, said the DNC is great for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I embrace the opportunities -- and these special event
marathons,'' says the gourmet caterer, who has been part of the
L.A. party experience for the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Along Came Mary is catering and orchestrating 14 parties,
including numerous events sponsored by UAW/General Motors and a
sit-down luncheon for 250, sponsored by Sony Pictures and
California Gov. Gray Davis for the Democratic governors Monday at
Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Trendy L.A. restaurants will be dishing up extra chow, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Patina Group, which owns Patina restaurant on Melrose
Avenue, is preparing the food for Saturday evening's LA Convention
2000 Media Event, Faces of Los Angeles. It's one of the largest
parties, with 20,000 journalists and media representatives expected
to attend at the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a challenge to feed 20,000 people and produce
that much food,'' says Stephanie Edens, the company's director of
catering and special events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the event and broke it into four separate parties of
5,000 each, with each operating with its own chef.''
</P>
<P>
   Latin-American, Asian-American, Southern and Melting Pot are
among the themes featuring such foods as corn tamales with chicken,
beef taquitos, assorted sushi, spicy buttermilk fried chicken,
country coleslaw, black olive focaccia, spicy shrimp with couscous
and cool mint yogurt sauce, vegetable empanadas, Chinese beef salad
and 10 different desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Organization, say party planners, is the key to pulling off six
successive days of parties.
</P>
<P>
   At Someone's In The Kitchen, Roth-Oseary has been working on the
battle plans -- as she calls them -- for months. The firm is
catering 11 events sponsored by UAW/DaimlerChrysler at the Peterson
Automotive Museum from Sunday through Thursday in addition to a
Blue Dogs party Sunday at the Santa Monica Pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've drawn on each and every year of my 20 years of experience
to bring off this feat, which involves close to 400 people in the
production,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be preparing 640 racks of lamb, 550 herb-crusted
roasted sea bass, 600 pounds of filet mignon and 450 pounds of
orzo. We will also be serving 54,000 individual hors d'oeuvres. We
also expect to go through 40 gallons of half-and-half and will
ultimately consume a 14-foot-long truckload each of fresh fruits
and fresh vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you decide which parties to attend? Maybe you don't
have to narrow it down.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some smaller private dinners being held at restaurants
such as Spago, many of the parties are receptions designed to
encourage people to stop by as they are party-hopping all over
town. In some cases, different-size tables will be sprinkled around
the emptied-out restaurants and venues to allow for plenty of
standing room -- and schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients want people to come to their parties but realize
they have other places to go,'' said Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   When the party is over, what happens to the leftovers?
</P>
<P>
   The windfall of prepared foods that never came near the buffet
tables will be picked up by the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank and
distributed to soup kitchens, homeless shelters and other charities
that feed the hungry.

L.A.: A MIX OF HEAVEN, HELL, MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eileen Schaffner still has flashbacks to that
night six years ago when the Northridge Earthquake split her house
in half and wrecked her $300,000 antiques inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Does she love L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't pay me to move back to Chicago,'' said the
61-year-old antiques dealer, who moved to Tarzana from the freezing
cold and Windy City 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mountains, I have valleys, I have oceans, I have scenic
beauty. It's so ... visual! But the main thing is the climate.
That's probably No. 1. I have fine restaurants and enough of a
variety of people to keep it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   From the breathtaking canyons that sometimes erupt in flames to
the majestic valleys that regularly fill with smog, L.A.'s
inhabitants get daily glimpses of heaven and hell, of things they
love and hate. Theirs is a city of Technicolor temptations that
writhe about inside 6.3 million air-conditioned solariums on
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos love their city like a mistress and hate it as they
would an oppressive master. Fortunately, this town isn't about
work, even if there are plenty of jobs to be had these days. This
is a town that plays and -- via cell phones, celluloid and
cyberspace -- a town that tells the rest of the world how it can
play, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Los Angeles is the City of Second Chances, where
everyone can be an emigre but no one is an alien.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't care much about your past and your credentials,''
said Joel Kotkin, an urban planning expert and senior fellow with
the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University
in Malibu. ``It's a very open place, a place that an outsider can
go in and do very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have the sort of social network and structure that
older cities have. It's a great city for self-starters. It can be a
miserable city for those who need a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   And that might explain why this city hates its schools so much.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has the best of the best,
Harvard- and Stanford-bound graduates from nationally ranked North
Hollywood High School. But the same school district gives diplomas
to fewer than half of its high school students. If they all made it
to graduation, there wouldn't be anywhere near enough seats to hold
them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that L.A.'s young people lack inspiration or role
models, as 13-year-old Karin Ventura of Sherman Oaks can attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie stars,'' said Karin. ``I saw 'N Sync at Jerry's Deli in
Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I saw Michael Jordan at Fashion Square Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   The city loves its celebrities but hates its personalities.
Vanity, thy name is Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In the City of Angels, some people make themselves public
figures by putting up busty building-size renderings of themselves,
as did a woman known as ``Angelyne,'' to appeal to motorists who've
seen her billboards along Hollywood Boulevard and the San Diego
Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to put out large sums of money to make it
into television -- even live television -- in greater Los Angeles.
For every luckless fugitive, desperate wife beater or fearless
drunk, there's an unscripted drama in perpetual production.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos love police chases because they give the entire city
an entertainment break, a thrill ride that has neither a 45-minute
queue nor a predictable outcome. With contests like this, who needs
an NFL franchise?
</P>
<P>
   But people also hate chases because they are so unpredictable,
interrupting the kind of television dramas that end the way a focus
group says they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that there's a lot of negative culture here,'' said
Carrie Bragg Vann, who after four years in San Marino is moving
back to Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have the sort of crime and violence and freeway
chases and murders that take place here,'' she said, adding that
where she's going, ``they only have one or two freeways,'' and they
don't go on for 670 miles.
</P>
<P>
   (End of 1st take. Story can end here; optional 2nd take
follows.)
</P>
<P>
   XXX
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone who beds down in this sprawling autopolis what they
hate about it, and the first thing off their lips will be traffic.
</P>
<P>
   From overburdened interstates that squeeze through mountain
passes joining the Los Angeles Basin with the San Fernando Valley,
Inland Empire and assorted lesser valleys to the arrow-straight
boulevards with no left-turn signals, Angelenos live where the
rubber meets the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst in the country, by a number of different
factors,'' said Bill Buff of the American Highway Alliance, which
in November listed four L.A. freeway interchanges among the
nation's 10 worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Transportation Institute, which looked beyond
freeways, found that delays cost each of the 9 million L.A. drivers
two weeks' time and $1,370 a year. That's what drove Lori Lennartz
and her husband to the Rocky Mountains 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much congestion, too many people,'' she said as
she waited for a shuttle bus at Los Angeles International Airport.
Visiting her former home of Thousand Oaks to attend her niece's
wedding, she admitted she did miss one thing about Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost always nice. You can plan a picnic on Sunday
without worrying whether it's going to snow or rain.''
</P>
<P>
   New York gets about 47 inches of rain and snow a year, and in
February the average low temperature is 26 degrees, according to
the National Climatic Data Center in North Carolina. It gets even
colder in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, less than 15 inches of rain falls annually, and
the average low temperature in February is 51 degrees, with highs
near 70.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of many reasons some people don't want to leave, even
if they have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I both consider Los Angeles our home,'' said Beau
Janzen, who's staying in Toluca Hills until the movers come to take
his stuff to New York, where he landed a new job as a computer
animator.

<P>
   ``We'll definitely be back. We're even keeping all of our
furniture in storage. This is the place we're going to end up
settling down and raising a family,'' said the 30-year-old Kentucky
native.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of days, I'm going to be looking at just brick
buildings as opposed to the rolling mountains,'' Janzen said,
adding that he'll miss having ``plenty of hiking trails, great
escapist places to go. There are hiking trails right in the middle
of the city, but after 20 minutes you would swear you were out in
the boonies.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wild city with mountains and canyons and -- as every
David Hasselhoff and ``Baywatch'' fan in Frankfurt, Germany, knows
-- seamless white beaches. The city loves its water and wilderness
so much it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   If you're rich enough, you can buy a house right on the edge of
a canyon or beach, close enough to watch as your house is consumed
by wildfires, washed away by a mudslide or carried off in a
storm-fueled high tide.
</P>
<P>
   But this is, after all, the land of make-believe, of rebirth, of
denial. Or maybe it's just a statistical realism that comes from
surviving scrapes in other towns, past lives and starting anew in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think about it happening again,'' says Schaffner, the
earthquake survivor. ``But I don't think anything could measure up
to that. I don't think the same thing could occur to me again. I'm
a survivor; I came out of it. Within two months of the earthquake,
I was in my new house.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may be what makes Los Angeles what it is -- being in
one's own private space, according to Kotkin.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura Boulevard, like so many boulevards in the city, ``is
decrepit and unremarkable,'' but nearby in Kotkin's Valley Village
home, ``I have a really nice back yard with a Jacuzzi and fruit
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Los Angeles doesn't have the large public spaces or
structures that define other cities, like New York's grand
boulevards, skylines and parks.
</P>
<P>
   But that lack of definition is part of what defines Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of L.A., the narrative of Los Angeles, has not
really been written yet,'' Kotkin said. ``Because it's ill-defined,
new people can come in and help define it.''

LET THE DNC PARTIES BEGIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From chic restaurants like Patina, which plans to
serve 20,000 meals, to hip caterers like Along Came Mary, with 14
parties booked, the Democratic National Convention has taxed Los
Angeles' seasoned catering corps like never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having the Oscars four nights in a row because these
people will be party-hopping all over town,'' said Jondel
Goldsmith, director of special events for Spago Beverly Hills,
which is catering at least a dozen parties.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC is providing such a bonanza to the catering industry
that just about every full-time and part-time waiter, waitress,
bartender, dishwasher, table, chair, fork and knife in Los Angeles
have been called on, with frantic calls sent to other cities and
states for backup equipment.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the 15,000 reporters, photographers and other media
workers already in town and the Democratic delegates arriving en
masse Saturday for a week of partying, it's show time in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Today's arrival of President Clinton and his Senate candidate
wife, Hillary, for a weekend of fund-raising and party boostering
will kick off the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Literally hundreds of parties are scheduled all over town, from
exclusive affairs in the mansions of Bel-Air and the Riviera
Country Club to massive open bashes at the Music Center Pavilion
and the Paramount Studios lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the DNC, we are sold out every day from now through
Aug. 19 -- and I have in excess of 600 active and on-call field
staff,'' said Tracy Adams, general manager of The Party Staff Inc.,
a Los Angeles company providing staffing for caterers and corporate
clients for some 100 events in a 13-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who's nearly spent even before the festivities begin, has
drawn on the company's outlets in Orange County and San Diego to
fill the requests. ``I'm considering early retirement,'' Adams
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor bride and groom trying to get married next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to turn away a lot of nonDNC-related business from
regular clients, like dinner parties, barbecues and anniversary
parties, for months,'' said Joann Roth-Oseary, president of
Tarzana-based Someone's In the Kitchen. ``I even turned down one
wedding eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some clients were able to shift their parties to the weekend
of Aug. 19, and we're catering seven parties that weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The party marathon has also been a bonanza for the equipment
rental business.
</P>
<P>
   Stand-up bar tables (1,000 needed), buffet tables and smaller
round tables have been sent in from Orange County, Arizona and New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several large events that have used up quite a bit
of equipment -- and then there are various home parties for
delegations -- and various fund-raisers that have compounded the
problem,'' said Jeffrey Williams, vice president of Regal Rents
Inc. in Los Angeles. ``On the larger events, we had two to three
months' notice, but the smaller ones came in later. We are in good
shape now.''
</P>
<P>
   As all party organizers know, they must expect the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   United Jewish Communities expected some 2,000 people at its
party at the Sony Pictures Studio in Culver City. But after Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut was selected as the Democratic
running mate for Vice President Al Gore, an additional 1,000 people
signed on.

JEWISH GROUP EVENT JOINS A-LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Up until last week, the United Jewish Communities
organization's plans for a celebration on Sunday were going well,
with some 2,000 people planning to attend the event at the Sony
Pictures Studio in Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Tuesday's announcement that Sen. Joe Lieberman of
Connecticut was being selected as the Democratic running mate for
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to count the number of calls we got,'' said
Diana Aziz, director of the Washington office of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had originally intended to keep it at 2,000. But now it's
over 3,000 people and counting. We're trying to accommodate
everyone, and we're telling them just wear short sleeves, because
it will be crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   That's even without Lieberman confirming an appearance. Still,
the group had a pretty good draw already with President Clinton and
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the first Jewish American to run on a major
presidential party ticket and is seen not only as boosting
enthusiasm in the Jewish community but in other minority
communities as well for breaking a barrier to high public office.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many Jewish activists believe it will have an impact on
the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as they
attempt to broaden their reach into minority communities as well as
keep GOP Jewish voters in their party.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of the event for the United Jewish Committee is an
example of the role ethnic politics plays in both parties, but
especially for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Separate events have been scheduled for various groups of
activists, including Armenian-Americans, African-Americans,
American Indians, Italian-Americans and Irish-Americans, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic diversity is so prominent that next Wednesday, the
party is holding one luncheon of all the different groups called
Ethnic America 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties do this, but the Democrats do it more and
better,'' said Democratic political consultant Joe Cerrell, who is
hosting a luncheon for Italian-American office holders on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have an ethnic coordinator, and it's important
for these different groups to get recognition that they wouldn't
get otherwise if they just attended the convention. It
reinvigorates them to know that the party has to respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it makes the party aware that different groups want
special attention and have their own concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz agreed with that assessment but said her experience has
been that the United Jewish Communities -- created by the merger of
the United Jewish Appeal, the Council of Jewish Federations and the
United Israel Appeal -- draws from a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people who have similar concerns as we do coming to our
events,'' Aziz said. ``They feel they are connected through an
affinity group.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said the various ethnic
groupings play a more practical role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that a lot of money will be raised,'' Jeffe said.
``This is the big enchilada as far as Democrats are concerned. If
you consider the party one big pie, they are slicing it as many
ways as they can to get the biggest bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do it differently because the party is not as
diverse, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it corporate constituencies,'' Jeffe said. ``That's
what you saw in Philly, where it was the lawmakers who were
invisible, but were raising lots behind the scenes.''

NATION'S REPORTERS TAKE WHACK AT DEFINING L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democrats' coronation bash doesn't commence
until Monday. But the East Coast media, long suspected of a bias
against the Left Coast, already kicked sand in the host's face.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, the gray business bible, said in a
front-page story this week that Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
``melds brains and bumbling'' and nicknamed His Honor the ``City
Slipper'' for his inclination to sometimes mangle people's names.
</P>
<P>
   The angle taken by the Journal is not a surprise, though,
because here in Los Angeles the horizon separating reality from
perception is often blurred.
</P>
<P>
   With 15,000 journalists hitting town -- outnumbering delegates
almost 4 to 1 and turning the convention center into the world's
biggest press room -- that horizon will be stared at more than
ever. The city will be scrutinized as much as the Democratic
platform.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the paper noted that Riordan is a brilliant
businessman and rich enough to basically run the city for free. But
the paper also said the Republican mayor is ``not poised and
polished ... and basic etiquette sometimes eludes him.''
</P>
<P>
   Journal spokesman Dick Tofel said the paper did not take a
similar whack at Philadelphia -- or its mayor -- before the
Republican love fest two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the thousands of other journalists covering the
convention are still working on their L.A. scene stories, to run in
papers across the world in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Barnes, a reporter for the National Journal, a Washington,
D.C.-based political magazine, is comparing the personalities of
L.A. and D.C., saying the two cities are woven from different
cultural fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is a more formal place with a more clearly defined
power structure. Los Angeles is, well, not.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is certainly seen ... as this exotic spot on the Left
Coast,'' he said. ``Los Angeles has a very different society to it.
We're Brooks Brothers, and L.A. is more Armani.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was also surprised by the city's new subway system.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things that made an impression on me was
the subway and not going through a turnstile. The honor system was
pretty interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of the Houston Chronicle might also get a surprise this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The paper sent Washington-based reporter Patty Reinert into the
neighborhoods around downtown on Thursday to assess what Los
Angeles is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out L.A and Houston are a lot alike, she's writing.
They're both sprawling, culturally diverse metropolises with bad
air.
</P>
<P>
   Reinert notes that lots of people outside of Los Angeles are
familiar with the city's tawdry resume, which includes the Rodney
King beating, riots, earthquakes and the O.J. Simpson trial, as
well as the glitzier Hollywood stuff.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour sponsored by the Convention and Visitors Bureau, she
saw a resurgent downtown and much more.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a city that looked like a lot of other cities that
people call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was diverse in every way,'' Reinert said after visiting
neighborhoods like Little Toyko and Boyle Heights. ``I guess I saw
more harmony than we have seen in recent years. Today what I saw
was much more of an integrated culture, a lot of groups of people
coexisting very close together.''

L.A. BOOSTERS' EFFORT ARE AN UNDERWHELMING SUCCESS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With 15,000 journalists hitting town for the
Democratic National Convention, civic boosters saw a prime
opportunity Thursday to turn the spotlight on the city's leading
industry -- entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A press tour called for a free lunch, behind-the-scenes access
to Universal Studios and the ear of some Hollywood insiders, so
space was limited to a manageable 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Six showed up, another four straggled in later.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers, whose staff and handlers nearly outnumbered the
guests, were somewhat disappointed with the turnout but said the
effort was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a positive message about Los Angeles out
to the world, so if it's just two people who write good stories,
that's better than 100 journalists who weren't impressed,'' said
John Duel, media relations manager of one sponsor, the Los Angeles
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the attending journalists had the opportunity to
carry L.A.'s message far -- Germany, China and Japan, among others
from their bureaus in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Milker, bureau chief of German television production
company GTP-MEDIA, said the convention would provide a good reason
to turn his cameras on Los Angeles in general, to show the side his
countrymen may not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already have a very good opinion of L.A., even though I
interview German tourists who are very disappointed with Hollywood
because it's kind of dirty and not as nice as they see in the
movies,'' Milker said.
</P>
<P>
   The revitalization of Hollywood was a theme in Thursday's tour,
which concluded with a hard hat tour of the TrizecHahn project at
Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue -- the future home of the
Academy Awards and a focus of the area's renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The tour started in North Hollywood with a round-table
discussion at the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences featuring
executives from Technicolor Inc. and other production and Internet
entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by lunch at CityWalk and a VIP tour of
Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Other tours in the weeklong L.A. Industry Showcase fared only
slightly better in terms of attendance.
</P>
<P>
   A science tour Monday with stops at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab
and the California Institute of Technology drew about 20 members of
the press corps, about the same as Wednesday's focus on new media
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers with LA TradeMark, a consortium of the visitors
bureau, Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and Mayor Riordan's
Business Team, said the low attendance was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Many journalists were not expected to arrive until today, and
those that are already here have time constraints, deadline
pressures and political angles to cover, said tour organizer
Jennifer Zabriskie.

SATURN REGAINS RANKING IN CUSTOMER SALES SATISFACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Saturn has regained its top position on
the latest J.D. Power and Associates customer sales satisfaction
index, recovering from a slip to sixth place in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus and Cadillac tied for second place this year.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed Saturn was particularly strong in the purchase
transaction area.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Denove, a partner at J.D. Power, said most buyers surveyed
felt they were treated honestly and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people will be surprised to hear the great
majority of buyers were satisfied with the process of buying a
car,'' Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   When people felt they were treated unfairly, dealerships failing
to live up to commitments made during the sales process was the
most serious complaint.
</P>
<P>
   An unhappy purchaser translates to loss of service business and
loss of potential sales through recommendations to friends, Denove
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealers need to understand that they might be able to pressure
the customer into spending a few extra dollars on a vehicle today,
but they're probably going to be hurt in the long run because
they'll lose business in the future,'' Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   It costs a small fortune in advertising to acquire new
customers, so it's critical to keep customers coming back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nitowski was at Saturn of Thousand Oaks on Thursday getting
one of his family's two Saturns serviced.
</P>
<P>
   Nitowski said he bought one in 1995 and had no problems with it,
so he got another one in 1998. The cars were for his college-age
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them stuck on the freeway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nitowski liked the no-haggling policy at Saturn. When he bought
a previous car, he said he couldn't sleep that night for worrying
that he had been cheated.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Bohn, partner and sales manager at Saturn of Thousand
Oaks, said his dealership ``never, ever'' pressures a customer and
makes sure any problems that arise are resolved to the customer's
satisfaction as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically treat people the way they want to be treated,''
Bohn said. ``We respect their time, their budget and their
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The J.D. Powers study showed auto companies raking in the most
sales had declines in customer satisfaction. Denove attributed that
drop to delays in delivering cars to customers and a decrease in
some dealers' willingness to negotiate when demand for their cars
is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Customer satisfaction with the sales process also decreased when
the time required to complete the sales transaction increased.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the respondents said knowing the dealer invoice
price was important. When they learned it from their dealer rather
than through their own efforts, they were more likely to be
satisfied with the sales process.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn led or tied for the sales satisfaction index from 1995 to
1998, then slipped to sixth place. This year, it edged out Cadillac
and Lexus to regain the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Cadillac, Volvo and Jaguar were tied for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the 23 nameplates that placed above the
industry average in 2000, in order of ranking, were: Infiniti,
Buick, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Jaguar, Oldsmobile, BMW,
Lincoln, Porsche, Saab, DaimlerChrysler, GMC, Mercury, Jeep,
Pontiac, Audi, Chevrolet, Acura and Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Powers has produced the Sales Satisfaction Index for 13
years. This year's survey was a random sample of 41,358
respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, the survey separated car and truck satisfaction and
sometimes added other categories. In the early to mid-1990s, Lexus,
Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti showed up frequently in the
new car sales satisfaction category. In the truck category,
Pontiac, Ford, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Land Rover were winners.

COMMUNITY CENTER CELEBRATES HEALING ON ANNIVERSARY OF ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a gesture of healing, camp staffers at the
North Valley Jewish Community Center planted a flowering tree
Thursday on the first anniversary of a gunman's rampage there that
left five people wounded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles away, postal workers at the Chatsworth office
unveiled a plaque in memory of letter carrier Joseph Santos Ileto,
39, whom Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. is accused of killing after
shooting the three children, a counselor and a receptionist at the
Jewish center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This murderer came to our community for the purpose of
shooting children of one ethnic group, and he had so much hate in
his heart that he ended up killing a member of a second group,''
said Rep. Brad Sherman, who gave the postal workers an American
flag that had flown over the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This illustrates that we are all in this together, because
those with hatred will find a reason to hate each and every one of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman and officials at the Jewish Community Center urged
people to promote love over hate in ``the most diverse city of Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not consider the JCC or my family as victims of causeless
hatred, but rather beneficiaries of unconditional love,'' said Nina
Lieberman Giladi, assistant executive director at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great success of love over hate is this: We did not panic,
we made a chain of love. We were not intimidated, but emboldened.''
</P>
<P>
   As two camp staffers finished planting a purple-flowering potato
plant tree, dozens of camp counselors, parents and others repeated
in unison a ``Sh'hecheyanu,'' or blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Shamoleth, the community center's longtime receptionist
who was injured in the shooting, stood close by, crying at the
ceremony's end.
</P>
<P>
   Others injured at the center included Mindy Finkelstein, a
teen-age counselor; James Zidell and Joshua Stepakoff, both then 6;
and 5-year-old Benjamin Kadish, the only one who went to another
center after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of parents Thursday, the community center kept
the children's activities private. As part of their remembrance of
the one-year anniversary, the children released scores of
butterflies as they sang songs to mark a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, letter carriers wore T-shirts with Ileto's name and
photo emblazoned on front as they delivered mail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him a lot. Not only was he a co-worker, but a friend,''
letter carrier Juan Saenz said while on his route. ``I played chess
with him after work in the parking lot. He was one of those unique
people. No matter what kind of day he had, he always had a smile on
his face and never had an unkind word to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ileto's brother, Ismael, his mother, Lilian, and twin sisters
also attended the unveiling of the plaque Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of healing this past year,'' said Ramona
Franco, postmaster at the Chatsworth office. ``They're very proud
that Joe's being memorialized. It's a bittersweet sort of
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Furrow admitted to killing Ileto because he was
a federal employee who was not white. Ileto was Filipino-American.
He was filling in for another carrier on his normally scheduled day
off.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow allegedly also admitted to the Jewish center shootings
and said he did so as a ``wake-up call'' for Americans to start
killing Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow faces trial in the shootings in February.

CALIFORNIAMAKES LABOR LEADER'S BIRTHDAY A PAID HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ State legislators Thursday overwhelmingly
approved a new paid holiday marking the birthday of the late union
leader and human rights activist Cesar Chavez, making him the first
Latino ever to receive that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by state Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, and
pushed by Democrats, the bill also includes provisions for
educational material and community activities for California
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis has vowed to sign the bill within the next 12
days, possibly at a ceremony during next week's Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is looking forward to signing the bill, and he
feels strongly it could be next week,'' said Davis spokesman Roger
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   The bill designates the Friday preceding or Monday following
March 31 a paid holiday for state employees. Public schools would
be encouraged to teach students about Chavez's life.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the talks that created the bill, the state also
approved some $45 &UR;  &LR; million in housing subsidies for farm workers,
and legislators are looking at developing a job program for migrant
workers for work between crop seasons, said Polanco aide Bill
Mabie.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes $5 million for such nonprofit organizations as
the Conservation Corps to develop community service programs for
schoolchildren to participate in the holiday, and $1 million for
the state to develop and distribute a Chavez-related curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of no better way to honor the selfless mission of
Cesar Chavez than inspiring young people to emulate it,'' Polanco
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad the Legislature moved forward on this,'' said Los
Angeles school board member David Tokofsky. ``What we'd ideally
like to see is a ninth-grade social studies class that embodies the
work of Chavez, like a local government course shaped for each
district across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who died in 1993, entered the national spotlight in the
1960s as a co-founder, along with Dolores Huerta, of the National
Farm Workers Association, later to become the United Farmworkers
Union that today represents 26,000 people. The union achieved
historic pay raises and improved work conditions for hundreds of
thousands of farm laborers in the decades that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was able to mobilize thousands of workers in marches
against difficult work conditions and the use of toxic pesticides
in agriculture. The most famous UFW action was the powerful grape
boycotts of the 1970s that affected dozens of vineyards and rallied
support from non-Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Rodriguez, the UFW president and husband of one of
Chavez's daughters, said the holiday ``gives a chance for our young
people to learn more about a mentor figure like Cesar, who made
great strides for working people in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   One great victory for the union came in 1976 with passage of the
California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, which laid out
specific laws protecting farm labor elections and boycott rights.
</P>
<P>
   The law came at a time when California voters up and down the
state first began to elect Latinos, many of whom got their
political start in the farm labor movement known as ``La Causa,''
as local and statewide government representatives call it.
</P>
<P>
   There are already city holidays honoring Chavez in San Fernando
and Sacramento, and remembrance days in Texas and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts have the option of declaring the day a
holiday, but it is not required. A state analysis found that a paid
state holiday would cost the state some $46.5 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Evelina Alarcon, who heads the Cesar E. Chavez Holiday Campaign
in East Los Angeles, has pushed for the holiday for the past two
years, helping to collect more than 160,000 signatures and local
government resolutions around the state supporting the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to eventually see this as a national holiday,''
she said. ``The phrase 'Si se puede' that people relate to Chavez
has become a common phrase for human dignity for hundreds of
thousands.''

 &HT;    `BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER' NOT MUCH TO CHEER ABOUT(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your story goes here.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)But I'm a Cheerleader (enditalic)is a confused
movie about a confused young woman.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, you can understand the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the movie plays as broad satire, lampooning
intolerance against homosexuality. In other places, it seems to
lash out at gay males, portraying them as mincing stereotypes.
Embossed atop the whole thing is a love story that seems more
suited to a John Hughes movie, if he ever made a film about
same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a movie that tries to be about something but will
probably just offend everyone. That's a shame, because director
Jamie Babbit had some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts out in amusing fashion, as we meet Megan
(Natasha Lyonne), a cheerleader who's confused about her sexuality.
Her boyfriend loves to make out, but she couldn't be more bored
with him. In fact, she's more interested in her fellow
cheerleaders, but she's not quite sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Megan's ultraconservative parents, who immediately arrange
an intervention (a hilarious scene by itself) and ship Megan off to
a homosexual deprogramming camp. There she meets counselor Mike
(RuPaul, out of drag and wearing a ``straight is great'' T-shirt)
and Mary (Cathy Moriarty), who runs the home while trying to
deprogram her own hunky son (Eddie Cibrian).
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a ``message'' movie, the counselors are portrayed
as unsympathetic, tin-plated ideologues who spout ridiculous
theories on sexuality. Much of this is played for laughs, though it
often flies way over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The sets are fun, done in bright colors with a sort of Kmart
chic. The house where the camp is held is even surrounded by a pink
picket fence. The costumes (blue for the boys, pink for the girls)
add a few laughs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Those touches give the movie an unconventional tone, somewhat
akin to John Waters' (beginitalic)Hairspray(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   For the first half-hour, (beginitalic)But I'm a Cheerleader
(enditalic)is mostly a farce, as Moriarty tries silly methods to
make her charges behave ``normally.'' There are plenty of sight
gags and double entendre, all aimed at showing that the treatment
isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's almost having the opposite effect as Megan strikes
up a friendship with Graham (Clea DuVall), a girl who doesn't buy
the brainwashing but pretends to go along. At this point, the film
starts to unravel, lurching from satire to a serious love story.
</P>
<P>
   We also have to endure Babbit's strident, off-putting depiction
of heterosexual sex, as the students try to simulate guy-girl
relationships. This is Babbit telling us that society has no
business trying to force homosexuals to be hetero, and it has all
the subtlety of an anvil dropped from a great height.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the trouble with much of the movie. By the end of it,
we're not so much enlightened as we are sore from being beaten over
the head.

 &HT;    `BLESS THE CHILD' POSSESSED BY FORCES OF DOPINESS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some notes on battling Satan in the movies, for the producers of
(beginitalic)Bless (enditalic)(beginitalic)the Child:(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Prince of Darkness cannot be defeated with
conventional weapons. Pistols and tear gas are no good. You need
some sort of ancient dagger or book of runes.
</P>
<P>
   When arriving at Satan's residence to serve an arrest warrant,
do not enter the premises without backup, especially if said backup
disappears into some sort of evil mist.
</P>
<P>
   Do not, under any circumstances, sneak into a house full of
devil worshipers armed only with a kitchen knife and a winning
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid the room with the big altar in it. Bad things happen
there.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Satan plays poorly with a lead. As soon as he gets the
upper hand, his imps start strutting around and talking trash. This
is the time to act.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the makers of (beginitalic)Bless the Child
(enditalic)didn't remember many of these important guidelines and
ended up with a pretty dopey movie, which is watchable just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Basinger stars as Maggie, a nurse who raises her infant
niece, Cody (Holliston Coleman), after the girl is dumped on
Maggie's doorstep by her druggie sister (Angela Bettis). By age 6,
we learn, Cody is ``special,'' that is, she can make objects spin,
reanimate dead animals, simple stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cody is also the target of evil Eric Stark (Rufus
Sewell), a cult leader with a direct line to Lucifer. Stark wants
to kidnap Maggie and turn her to evil, much like Darth Vader tried
with Luke Skywalker, except with less stuff blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie gets some help from handsome FBI agent John Travis (Jimmy
Smits, who apparently never turned in his (beginitalic)NYPD Blue
(enditalic)trench coat). Travis is trying to solve a series of
child murders, and - well, you can see where all this is going.
</P>
<P>
   That's sort of the fun of (beginitalic)Bless the
Child(enditalic). Hokey and contrived, yes. But it holds your
attention, in that Saturday-matinee sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Like dozens of Satan-battling movies before it,
(beginitalic)Bless the Child (enditalic)comes with the
(beginitalic)Exorcist (enditalic)starter set: crying statues,
self-lighting candles, sinister ancient symbols and the handy
all-knowing priest. The dialogue is uniformly weak, when it's not
simply lifted from other films.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the internal logic makes no sense. The devil worshipers
constantly capture Maggie but never finish her off. Maggie meets a
street urchin (Christina Ricci) who knows everything but hasn't
bothered to tell the cops. Satan can conjure hundreds of demons but
is easily thwarted by the closing door of a subway car.
</P>
<P>
   While Basinger thrives in certain roles (case in point, her
Oscar for (beginitalic)L.A. Confidential(enditalic)), she doesn't
really have the range to carry a whole movie. Smits is serviceable
as the FBI agent but tends to fade into the woodwork on the big
screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the movie gets a lift from Sewell
((beginitalic)Dark City(enditalic)), who plays a pretty good imp.
And Coleman, who is only 7 years old, does a splendid job as Cody.
</P>
<P>
   All told, (beginitalic)Bless the Child (enditalic)is a pretty
mindless movie. But it has some thrills and chills, and doesn't
descend into quite the gorefest of films such as (beginitalic)End
of Days(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   If only they knew the rules.

<P>
   (Undated) - Federal mining regulators Thursday fined an Asarco
copper mine near Tucson nearly $250,000 for safety violations
discovered after a Jan.31 accident that killed one miner and
severely injured two others.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration also will issue
further fines for eight more alleged safety violations at the mine,
MSHA attorney Tom Mascolino said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition Thursday, the mine was cited for 24 more MSHA
violations after a surprise inspection this week in the wake of
(beginitalic)Arizona Republic(enditalic) reports about the January
death of Jose Villanueva.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had a chance to review the reported new MSHA
citations issued at our Mission mine,'' Asarco said in a written
statement. ``But given the political pressure generated by
(beginitalic)The Arizona Republic's(enditalic) recent biased
articles, we aren't surprised that they were issued. MSHA has been
under heavy pressure to `do something' to `atone' for its supposed
earlier laxity.''
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Republic (enditalic)reported that the January
accident occurred after Villanueva and others repeatedly complained
about unsafe conditions, complaints they said were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Mascolino said the newspaper's stories had nothing to do with
this week's citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspectors write citations when there is a need to do it,'' he
said. ``Our job is to protect people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Citations pile up for Asarco.  &UR; A14 &QC;

 &HT;    A FASCINATION WITH SLAYINGS(a)

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a)

<P>
   (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - Serial killer trading cards. Knives that
scream and ooze fake blood. T-shirts with real bullet holes in
them.
</P>
<P>
   Society is fascinated by murder. We flock to murder mystery
dinner theaters, read comic books about killings and buy beach
towels imprinted with chalk body outlines and never give any of it
a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   But to such people as Dan Levey, the products that glamorize or
trivialize murder are painful reminders of the brother who was
slain nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it insensitive,'' Levey said. ``Just like you wouldn't
glamorize rape or incest or child abuse, we shouldn't glamorize
this. It desensitizes society to the horrific real-life tragedies
that we went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wish you could, for just a minute, let those
people know what it feels like.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the National Organization of Parents of Murdered
Children Inc. has taken aim at ``murdertainment,'' writing
objection letters, organizing protests and encouraging boycotts of
products that make light of murder. And while the group has had
some successes, murder continues to be a multibillion-dollar
entertainment industry, video games become more violent, and people
now bid online for locks of hair, foot scrapings and artwork from
killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we as human beings have what may be
considered a morbid fascination with the dark side,'' said Steven
Pitt, a local forensic psychiatrist. ``We as human beings realize
there is this dark side to us, and at times there is a very fine
line that we walk between towing the line and acting on
unacceptable fantasies or impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   People simply are fascinated by bizarre killings, serial murders
and multiple shootings, the same way that they're entertained by a
horror film, said James Alan Fox, the Lipman Professor of Criminal
Justice at Northeastern University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so unusual that they might as well be fiction,'' Fox
said. ``In most people's minds there really is no difference
between a serial killer like Jeffrey Dahmer and (the fictional
movie cannibal) Hannibal Lecter.''
</P>
<P>
   For most people, the fascination is harmless, but the problem
comes in when society trivializes murder, insults the memory of
victims and turns serial killers into heroes that other people want
to emulate, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the killer a platform, a pedestal that they don't
deserve,'' Fox said. ``It's unfortunate and it's sad, and as far as
the victims are concerned, it adds insult to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director of the parents group, said
that ``murdertainment'' revictimizes those who have lost loved ones
to violence and desensitizes children to murder and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhe-Munch, who teaches a program across the country called
Murder Is Not Entertainment, has boxes full of offending items.
There's toe tags, books for children as young as 3, a travel guide
to murder scenes across the United States and games about killing
your boss and your mother-in-law .
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never play rape. You would never play incest. You
would never play Clue if Professor Plum sexually assaulted Miss
Scarlett in the Billiard Room with a lead pipe. You would never
play airplane crash,'' Ruhe-Munch said. ``When it comes to murder,
we are very insensitive to what family members go through.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 through 1998, 443,610 people were murdered in the
United States, according to the group. Last year, for the first
time in American history, people were more likely to be murdered by
a stranger than somebody they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't make fun of the mentally handicapped. We wouldn't
make fun of the hearing impaired. We've become a society that is
very politically correct, but we'll make fun of murder,''
Ruhe-Munch said. ``If you saw the realities of murder, I don't
think any of this stuff would be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mystery Mansion Dinner Theater in Phoenix has sold
out all of its last 178 performances of Murder at Greystone Manor.
The country group Dixie Chicks sings a hit song about two women who
murder an abusive mate. And the gift shop at the Los Angeles County
Coroner's Office has raked in more than $2 million during the past
five years to help fund its Youthful Drunk Driver Visitation
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Harvey, the chief coroner's investigator for Los Angeles
County, points out that police agencies don't even use chalk
outlines anymore. The toe tags his office sells carry such safety
messages as ``Don't drink and drive'' and ``Don't let this happen
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these products glorifies murder,'' Harvey said. ``It's
more of an affinity thing, just like somebody would buy an Oakland
Raiders jersey or a Lakers jersey. Pick anything that you'd like to
associate with. It's simply trading on the name of this office and
what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beckie Miller, whose son Brian, 18, was murdered in 1991,
can't understand why people would buy any of the ``sick stuff'' out
there, particularly, clothing riddled with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   The parents group still has the shirt Brian was wearing when he
was shot to death by a robber while walking his girlfriend home
from her job at a bowling alley. The bullet holes in the black
shirt are real. So is the dirt on the front and the blood stains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain things are just not funny. They're not entertaining.
There's just no social value to them,'' Miller said. ``I just wish
there wasn't a market for any of it.''

   QIUBAN VILLAGE, China _ It's election day in this watermelon-
and peach-growing village of 660 people and the elementary school
is festooned with colorful flags. One by one, peasants file into a
classroom and step behind the pink sheets to enter the voting
booth.
</P>
<P>
   To Charles Costello, director of the Carter Center's Democracy
Program, those pink sheets are a small but sure sign that democracy
is developing in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most organized I've seen it,'' he said, looking at
villagers lined up outside to await their turn.
</P>
<P>
   Costello was impressed: Qiuban not only provided secret voting
booths, but when it was all over, ballots were sorted and counted
in public, each vote hand-tallied on a large piece of paper posted
on the wall while villagers watched under the beating sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it is the other way around _ public voting, secret
counting,'' according to a January Carter Center report.
</P>
<P>
   While all of China's 930,000 villages are required by a 1987 law
to hold elections for village chief, only an estimated one-third to
two-thirds have actually done so. And when they do, the elections
are often full of irregularities, not just on election day, but in
the whole nominating process leading up to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious problems of village elections _
acknowledged even by Chinese officials _ is interference from local
Communist Party bureaucrats. They often make it clear to voters
which candidate to support; in some instances, they have even
kicked an elected village chief out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts both inside and outside of China believe the
decade-long experiment with village elections has yielded real
steps toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot say all these elections are just meaningless,''
said Yawei Liu, a history professor at Georgia Perimeter College
who helps lead the Carter Center's China village elections project.
``To a certain extent, that's true. But you've got to see the other
side of the coin. These elections have empowered the villagers.
They've become bolder in demanding better accountability, demanding
the party can't be there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what the party had in mind when it introduced village
elections in 1987. The Chinese leadership saw them as a way to
maintain control and stability in the restive countryside, where
three-quarters of the population lives. It was also a way to make
villagers more accepting of unpopular policies, such as increased
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit last week to three villages in Fujian province, the
Atlanta-based Carter Center, which is working with the Ministry of
Civil Affairs to computerize election data and develop voting
procedures, was treated to a stack of letters from villagers
complaining about manipulation of elections and other problems. Liu
saw that as a good sign _ that villagers take the elections
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Fujian is a prosperous coastal province that may be best known
for sending emigrants to every corner of the world. In the
countryside, peasants have enough to eat, children go to school,
young adults find jobs in nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   But the villages still lag far behind urban areas. The road to
Qiuban is not paved. Of the 169 households, only about 20 have
phone lines. In Linxian village, portraits of Marx, Lenin and
Stalin hang on the classroom walls.
</P>
<P>
   In Qiuban, three men declared their candidacy for village chief
_ a farmer, a mini-bus driver and a shop owner _ none of them party
members. Official campaigning consisted of one evening of
speech-making and question-answering. A week later, all but 25 of
the 444 eligible voters cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   An edited video-tape of the speeches was shown to the Carter
Center delegation. For more than four hours, villagers peppered
candidates with questions: ``How will you raise our income?''
``What will you do for the elderly?'' ``How will you resolve
conflicts between the village committee and the party?'' ``How will
you fulfill your duties in the village if you work in town?''
</P>
<P>
   The three answered mostly with general pledges to do the best
job they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was satisfied with the answers, but whether the candidates
can fulfill their promises in uncertain.'' said Wang Zipai, a
village farmer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a run-off had to be held between the farmer and the
mini-bus driver because neither got a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Jimin, the village party chief, says elections are ``the
demand of the villagers.'' To him, democracy means that, ``all of
the people will be the master of the state, and they can chose a
leader that they trust on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   That Fujian is generally agreed to be leading this nation of 1.2
billion in electoral work is due perhaps to people like Zhang
Xiaogan, a 26-year veteran of the People's Liberation Army, who has
run the province's grassroots democratic work for 15 years as an
official of the Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In response to villagers' complaints, he has helped implement
some fundamental changes, such as requiring public posting of
village finances and allowing villagers a say in who is selected
party chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide glasses for people in case they need them,'' he
says excitedly while giving a tour of a polling site to an
observer. ``For those who are illiterate and can't write the name,
we have teachers to help them. If they don't trust the teachers,
they can choose any two people they want.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Shi Tianjian, a professor of political science at Duke
University who has researched village elections, said villagers
need to vote several times before they grasp what elections can do
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you need three rounds of elections to make the Chinese
peasants realize this is their opportunity to get rid of the bad
guy and get the good guy in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shi believes China is developing along the lines of Taiwan and
South Korea, where pressure from the grassroots level eventually
brought about open elections and an end to their authoritarian
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In mainland China, after more than a decade of voting at the
village level, direct elections have just recently begun to trickle
to townships, the next administrative level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether village elections will indeed one day lead to the
dreaded ``D-word'' _ democracy _ is not something openly discussed
among Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Ministry of Civil Affair)'s perspective is, you don't
have to talk about what it's going to lead to,'' Liu said. ``You
de-emphasize the political meaning. The more you talk about it, the
more scared the opponents of those elections are going to become.
So you just keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, village democracy has been getting
attention not just from foreign NGOs but from scholarly circles
within China as well.
</P>
<P>
   An independent project to promote village autonomy was started
up last December under the Unirule Institute of Economics, a
liberal Beijing think tank. ``Univillage'' has run into a few
snags, including a lack of financing and the project head getting
detained by Beijing police for a few weeks in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhou Hongling, a former bank manager from Hebei who says he
has been working for democracy in China for many years, insists the
police detention was due to a misunderstanding and the project is
on track. To him, the countryside is China's best hope for
political reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too optimistic about working for democracy in the
cities,'' he said. ``But rural democratization will surpass urban
democratization.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then add, ``It already has.''

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC IN TALKS TO BUY ISRAELI STENT MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp., which has lost market share in the
fast-growing cardiovascular stent market due to difficulties with
Medinol Ltd., its major supplier, has quietly begun talks to
acquire the Israel-based business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that has happened in the last three weeks,''
James Tobin, the president and chief executive of Boston
Scientific, said of the negotiations. ``We both engaged bankers and
those bankers are dealing with each other. The process is moving
forward as quickly as anything like this can. But it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Medinol, a five-year-old privately held company based in Tel
Aviv, supplies Boston Scientific with the NIR line, its
top-of-the-line cardiovascular stents. These stents _ small tubes
used to prop open once-clogged arteries _ are used to treat
diseases of the cardiovascular system, which affects 7.2 million
Americans. About 350,000 new cases of coronary artery disease are
diagnosed each year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boston Scientific received $410 million in revenues
from selling Medinol stents, according to the Wall Street
investment firm ABN AMRO Inc. That accounted for about 14 percent
of the Natick, Mass. firm's worldwide revenues and about 27 percent
of its SciMed division revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this year, however, its cardiovascular
stent revenues slipped because of shortfalls in sales, competitive
pressures, and delays in getting new stents from Medinol. ``It's
been no secret that the two companies have had a somewhat
tumultuous relationship,'' Daniel T. Lemaitre, first vice president
at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., wrote in a report to investors. ``The
channels of communication between the two have been spotty in the
past, which had resulted in longer than expected development cycles
and suboptimal inventory management.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Boston Scientific's three major rivals _ Guidant
Corp. of Indianapolis, Medtronics Inc. of Minneapolis, and Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, the world's biggest medical device maker _ manufacture
their own stents and thus receive higher profit margins. By not
owning Medinol, Boston Scientific can't be as competitive because
its 60 percent profit margin is about 10 to 15 percent lower than
its competitors on stents that command $1,300 to $1,800 each.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific officials acknowledge that the fast growth of
the cardiovascular stent market has surprised them. So when a
best-selling NIR stent was recalled in 1998 by the company and the
US Food and Drug Administration, the company not only lost market
share, but also had to delay the introduction of new stents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the size of the market,'' said Peter
Nicholas, the Boston Scientific cofounder and chairman, noting the
cardiovascular stent market is about $2 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 13 months ago, the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported
that Boston Scientific, which owns about 22 percent of Medinol, was
trying to buy the entire company. Boston Scientific officials said
the report was untrue but did not rule out the possibility of
eventually acquiring Medinol.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the ``rocky partnership'' in the past has changed
recently. Medinol's founders, Israelis Kobi and Judith Richter,
have agreed to sell ``because the time was right,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had changed since last summer, Tobin said Kobi
Richter considered a new NIR stent under development a breakthrough
device that will give both firms a leadership position. Tobin said
Richter believes the device, the subject of much industry buzz,
could enable Boston Scientific to regain its lead in sales and
market share when it gains FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so the time to start the (acquisition) discussions is
now,'' Tobin said of Richter's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Owning Medinol would also solve a major problem for Boston
Scientific, permitting them to boost profit margins on stents by
eliminating the markup. Last month, the company announced a
manufacturing reorganization that would save it $250 million a year
and consolidate production. Over the next 17 months, Boston
Scientific will close its manufacturing operations in Watertown,
Mass., Plymouth, Minn., and Redmond, Wash., which together employ
1,900 workers.

 &HT;    LIFE IS EASY IN TECH'S FUTURISTIC 'COOL TOWN'
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (l) lifestyle categories for release

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ With technology stock prices falling sharply
in recent months, some Americans might think the tech revolution is
cooling off.
</P>
<P>
   But in Silicon Valley, laboratories are exploding with new ideas
and products for the 21st century. ``Things are moving faster than
ever,'' said Jamie Beckett, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard Co.
``There is no sense of anything slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent tour for journalists, the gadget geeks at
Hewlett-Packard eagerly showed off some of the new products they
hope will shape the Internet Age. The devices are being tested in
the company's ``CoolTown'' laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   If the Hewlett-Packard vision becomes reality, our lives will
resemble one long episode of ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips will be embedded in our watches, refrigerators,
clothes, vending machines, even the tires on our cars. In this
wireless Internet-connected world of ``pervasive computing,'' our
possessions will be ``thinking'' for us.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day might go something like this: Your smart alarm
clock will consult your electronic calendar to determine what time
to wake you. But because it also will be aware of traffic reports,
the clock will wake you a bit earlier if the freeway is jammed.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, when your wrist watch updates you with breaking
news about worsening traffic, you may decide to take the bus
instead of driving. Just glance at your Web-enabled watch to find
out how soon the bus will be coming by. An embedded computer in the
bus will keep updating its location, using a Global Positioning
System transmitter over a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the bus is still 10 minutes away, you'll have time
to pull out your palmtop computer to order a double latte at the
coffee shop near the bus stop. By the time you get there, the
coffee will be ready, its price deducted from your online bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   And on your day will go, with computer-enhanced devices
streamlining your life at every turn. Your car tires will let you
know when they need air. The mannequin in the store will sense you
approaching and offer an instant electronic coupon. Everything from
your telephone to your toaster will be able to sense what you want,
and will be eager to please.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard hopes to make the devices _ which they stay will
start appearing on store shelves within a few years _ ``context
aware,'' so they know who you are and what you want to do.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be surrounded by sensors providing constant streams of
information about location, temperature, light and sound. Those
sensors will make the products tailor themselves to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   But how will the devices know who we are? The answer is
``biometrics,'' measurements of our body parts. Car keys and
refrigerator door handles may recognize our fingerprints or palm
prints, while telephones and radios will recognize our voices.
Desktop and palmtop computers may look us in the eye to size up our
irises.
</P>
<P>
   Those body measurements will free us from having to use
passwords and PIN numbers, making our interactions with
computer-embedded devices much less aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   They also will forever change our notions about privacy. When
the tiny chips in the bed sheets can instantly sense who is rolling
on them and transmit that data over the Internet, life may get much
more complicated for some people.

cities,'' he said. ``But rural democratization will surpass urban
democratization.''

 &HT;    LIFE IS EASY IN TECH'S FUTURISTIC 'COOL TOWN'
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (l) lifestyle categories for release
Sunday, Aug. 13.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ With technology stock prices falling sharply
in recent months, some Americans might think the tech revolution is
cooling off.
</P>
<P>
   But in Silicon Valley, laboratories are exploding with new ideas
and products for the 21st century. ``Things are moving faster than
ever,'' said Jamie Beckett, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard Co.
``There is no sense of anything slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent tour for journalists, the gadget geeks at
Hewlett-Packard eagerly showed off some of the new products they
hope will shape the Internet Age. The devices are being tested in
the company's ``CoolTown'' laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   If the Hewlett-Packard vision becomes reality, our lives will
resemble one long episode of ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips will be embedded in our watches, refrigerators,
clothes, vending machines, even the tires on our cars. In this
wireless Internet-connected world of ``pervasive computing,'' our
possessions will be ``thinking'' for us.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day might go something like this: Your smart alarm
clock will consult your electronic calendar to determine what time
to wake you. But because it also will be aware of traffic reports,
the clock will wake you a bit earlier if the freeway is jammed.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, when your wrist watch updates you with breaking
news about worsening traffic, you may decide to take the bus
instead of driving. Just glance at your Web-enabled watch to find
out how soon the bus will be coming by. An embedded computer in the
bus will keep updating its location, using a Global Positioning
System transmitter over a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the bus is still 10 minutes away, you'll have time
to pull out your palmtop computer to order a double latte at the
coffee shop near the bus stop. By the time you get there, the
coffee will be ready, its price deducted from your online bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   And on your day will go, with computer-enhanced devices
streamlining your life at every turn. Your car tires will let you
know when they need air. The mannequin in the store will sense you
approaching and offer an instant electronic coupon. Everything from
your telephone to your toaster will be able to sense what you want,
and will be eager to please.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard hopes to make the devices _ which they stay will
start appearing on store shelves within a few years _ ``context
aware,'' so they know who you are and what you want to do.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be surrounded by sensors providing constant streams of
information about location, temperature, light and sound. Those
sensors will make the products tailor themselves to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   But how will the devices know who we are? The answer is
``biometrics,'' measurements of our body parts. Car keys and
refrigerator door handles may recognize our fingerprints or palm
prints, while telephones and radios will recognize our voices.
Desktop and palmtop computers may look us in the eye to size up our
irises.
</P>
<P>
   Those body measurements will free us from having to use
passwords and PIN numbers, making our interactions with
computer-embedded devices much less aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   They also will forever change our notions about privacy. When
the tiny chips in the bed sheets can instantly sense who is rolling
on them and transmit that data over the Internet, life may get much
more complicated for some people.

 &HT;    AMID SOARING PRICES, PATIENTS DISCOVER FREE DRUG PROGRAMS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Melba Gann, widowed and disabled at age 60, didn't
know where to turn. She had too much income to qualify for
Medicaid, yet not enough to afford insurance for prescription
drugs. And her two medications cost $167 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Wiggins, a 37-year-old father of two, decided that the
daily pills his doctor prescribed at $5 apiece were too much for
his family's tight budget. He was going to skip taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wiggins family and Gann, who all live in the southern
Missouri town of Doniphan, found out something that most people
don't know: Many U.S. pharmaceutical companies will give free drugs
to customers who are financially strapped.
</P>
<P>
   As of last spring, Gann began receiving from Parke-Davis, a
division of the Warner-Lambert Company, a three-month supply of a
medication that normally costs $88 a month. Wiggins received a
four-month supply of his medication and expects to get more.
</P>
<P>
   Even as politicians make promises about future relief from
soaring drug costs, millions of Americans are finding practical
help now, thanks to an Internet-driven movement that is spreading
the word about patient assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has received a boost from tiny Doniphan, where
retired Realtor-builder Danny Hogg and his wife, Cindy, heard a
mention of ``free drugs'' on cable TV about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Researching the idea, they found that companies had been
operating these programs for many years. ``They just didn't tell
anybody,'' Danny Hogg said this week. ``I'm in the business of
telling people about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoggs set up a website (www.themedicineprogram.com) and a
help line (573-996-7300) to spread the word and guide applicants
through what can be a tangle of red tape. Each company has its own
criteria for participants and its own list of drugs that are
included in the give-away programs.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the assistance is available to those who are not on
Medicaid, who have no private insurance for medications and who
find paying for medicines a hardship. Income levels that qualify
have ranged from poverty level to, in rare cases, as high as
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, whose Medicine Program now has a dozen employees in
their home-based office, estimate that their operation has doubled
in the past year. Last month, 6,200 people applied for help.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which at first processed the applications for
free, now charges a $5 application fee to defray costs. An
applicant who is turned down is entitled to a full refund, Hogg
said. But he added that applications are overwhelmingly accepted
and said that he has had to refund only about 9 percent of the
fees.
</P>
<P>
   His program has drawn the attention of many in the federal
establishment, starting with the Clinton administration. One woman
who wrote to the White House to tell of her plight received a
letter from the Department of Health and Human Services suggesting
that she try the Medicine Program, which she did.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., wrote the program
last year, calling it a ``valuable resource'' to constituents and
sought more brochures for his office.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican lawmaker, Rep. Ron Paul, who is a physician,
has gone a step farther by launching workshops for senior citizens
in his southeast Texas district to invite them to seek the private
prescription drug assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the approach first, Paul's office helped five
constituents apply through their doctors to various companies. ``It
was very labor intensive,'' said aide Jackie Gloor. Still, within a
month the office helped find assistance for one person with drug
costs of $2,200 a month, for a young person who had a prescription
costing $800 and for a senior citizen who had a monthly income of
only $462.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 drug companies offer some form of assistance, said Mark
Grayson, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association. Some of the programs date back many
years. However, as drug prices rose and public criticism has
increased, the companies have responded with more formalized aid.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Grayson bristled at the suggestion by Hogg and others
that the programs have not been well publicized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors all know about it,'' he said. Pointing to his
organization's website (www.phrma.org/patients), which includes a
34-page booklet listing the participating companies, which can be
downloaded for free, he said, ``That's not really a secret. I can't
imagine that that's a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he acknowledged that the drug companies have focused on
telling doctors about the program, not the general public.
</P>
<P>
   With drug prices going off the charts, the word is getting out.
In 1997 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association
estimated that companies gave 1.14 million people a total of $375
million in medicines. This year the industry projects that it will
give drugs valued at $935 million to 2.4 million patients.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson cautioned that consumers should be wary of some scam
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups that promise to help applicants charge a hefty share
of the savings. Also, some insurance salesmen have been reported to
offer ``prescription coverage'' which customers later discover to
be nothing more than a guide on applying for drug company patient
assistance plans.

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In the midst of the most prosperous U.S. economy
in history, the 2000 presidential campaign hinges in large part on
the concern, shown in poll after poll, that America has lost its
moral compass -- and on voters' perceptions of which party can best
point the country toward true north.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have dissected the surveys and
carefully tailored their messages to win a national referendum on
faith, values and character. The wholesome appeals aren't aimed at
the religious right, but at the morally anxious middle and the
swing voters, most of them women, who could determine the
election's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The contest pits Vice President Al Gore, a Southern Baptist
family man trying to escape the lingering shadow of President
Clinton's sex and lying scandal, against the born-again Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who preaches a gospel of ``compassionate
conservatism'' in contrast to the less-forgiving tone of
Republicans past.
</P>
<P>
   Add a Democratic running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, an Orthodox Jew who gives ``Silver Sewer'' awards to
Hollywood's worst moral offenders, and you have the makings of a
campaign for piety as well as for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections of the past have been based mainly on the economy,''
said John C. Green, director of the Ray Bliss Institute of Applied
Politics at the University of Akron in Ohio. ``But this time
around, values questions may get equal billing.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives, who were mostly muzzled at the
Republican National Convention, are delighted to see more of their
issues on center stage, even if they're advanced by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shifts the whole debate on these issues radically to the
right, in my opinion,'' said Christian conservative activist Paul
Weyrich, who in the past has bemoaned the faltering political
influence of the religious right. ``Whereas these were the unspoken
issues before, they suddenly have become central to the
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues aren't about hard values, such as abortion and gay
rights, which tend to divide, but softer values that have the
potential to unite over topics like community, fatherhood, media
sex and violence, and an overarching need for responsibility during
booming economic times. Thus the Bush slogan: ``prosperity with a
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, long associated with religion and the accusation
that they viewed the GOP as ``God's Only Party,'' have already seen
Bush tone down judgmental rhetoric, replacing it with lofty
statements about an American moral ideal that indirectly indicts
Clinton and implicates Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Several lines from Bush's convention acceptance speech
illustrate the strategy and tone:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``An era of tarnished ideals is giving way to a
responsibility era.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential
values -- to show we have grown up before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Greatness is found when American character and American
courage overcome American challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``We must give our children a spirit of moral courage,
because their character is our destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has long had its own strategy on morality and
the uncomfortable subject, especially for liberals, that often
shapes it -- religion. In a moment of candor, Elaine Kamarck,
Gore's senior policy adviser, revealed the intent more than a year
ago when she told the Boston Globe, ``The Democratic Party is going
to take back God this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Topics such as the environment and race are being couched in
spiritual terms. The new Democratic platform asserts that
``Democrats believe that God has given the people of our nation'' a
mission for racial and ethnic unity. And Gore stresses
environmentalism as a responsibility to take care of God's
creation, as he has since writing his 1992 book, ``Earth in the
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic emphasis on values has other antecedents. In
1996, Clinton broke what was seen as a Republican monopoly on
family values with a campaign targeting cigarettes, hard liquor,
deadbeat dads and trash on television. For several years, Lieberman
has joined with conservative culture warrior William J. Bennett in
bestowing a ``Silver Sewer'' award on entertainment entities that
provide an ``outrageous contribution to the degradation and
coarsening of our culture.'' Winners include CBS for endorsing
shock jock Howard Stern and highlighting ``Dr. Death,'' Jack
Kevorkian, on ''60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different in this campaign is the Democrats' overt
appeal to religion.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman, the first Jew on a major presidential ticket,
was introduced as Gore's running mate, he invoked ``Lord'' and
``God'' 13 times. Lieberman even asked the crowd to ``let the
spirit move me'' as he read from the Book of Chronicles: ``To give
thanks to God and declare his name and make his acts known to the
people. To be glad of spirit. To sing to God and to make music to
God, and most of all, to give glory and gratitude to God from whom
all blessings truly do flow.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman continued, this time in prayer, with Gore nodding
approvingly: ``Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for
bringing me to this extraordinary moment in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kilgore, policy director at the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council, which Lieberman chairs, said Lieberman's
religiosity was no mere display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing him as I do, he was genuinely very excited,'' Kilgore
said. ``He was expressing thanks. There wasn't anything calculated
about it. He did it in a natural way, and he's always said that
most people have no problem thanking God. But he also makes it
clear that he doesn't want an imposition of religion by government.
That's why this sounds different from him than from a Republican,
because Joe doesn't support any sort of theocratic agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Democratic Leadership Council has been
conducting seminars teaching elected officials how to develop their
values vocabulary. The main metaphor is a ``values tree,'' in which
the roots are values, the trunk is policy goals and the branches
are programs. In the past, Democrats have been guilty of speaking
what Kilgore calls hard-to-understand ``programese.''
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP has its own deficient dialect regarding values,
Kilgore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have always been overrated on this stuff,'' he
said. ``They may be pretty good about talking about religion and
faith, but they're not necessarily good about explaining why they
have the public policies they have and how they connect that to
their faith. It's never been terribly clear why faith in God means
you need to have a big tax cut, or a missile defense system for
that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans have acknowledged that their values
language, with Pat Buchanan's 1992 ``cultural war'' speech the most
notable example, has come across as too absolutist, as if they were
trying to impose a moral standard on the country that they
themselves couldn't meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans think of themselves as reasonably moral people but
they don't like to be preached to beyond a certain point,'' said
Robert Heineman, a conservative political scientist at Alfred
University in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A humbler tone has come after GOP scandals, such as the
revelation that former House Majority Leader Newt Gingrich was in
the midst of a six-year affair with a congressional staffer while
he lambasted Clinton for infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in a God who calls us, not to judge our neighbors,
but to love them,'' Bush said in his speech at the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The more positive approach seems to be working. In 1992, 56
percent of those polled after the Republican convention said the
GOP had been too negative. Only 38 percent said that just after
this year's convention, according to a Gallup Poll done for CNN and
USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans seem to recoil at an ``I'm right, you're wrong''
approach to values, polls show their assessment of their personal
faith as strong and remarkably unwavering over the years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Gallup survey conducted at the end of 1999, 86
percent of Americans believe in God, even when given the choice of
saying that they ``don't believe in God, but believe in a universal
spirit or higher power.'' About two-thirds of Americans claim to be
a member of a church or synagogue, a number that has stayed
constant throughout the years.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Gallup has been asking Americans, ``What is the
most important problem facing this country today?'' The most recent
response came in late June, when the leading answer was ethics,
morality and family decline, cited by 14 percent surveyed. That
ranked ahead of crime and violence (12 percent), education (11
percent) and health care (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Other polls have shown the same concern about values for more
than a year now, with politicians taking notice, even if the media
haven't highlighted it with the prominence given other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to think about this,'' said Green, ``is that when the
economy is good and we have peace abroad, people have the luxury to
think about the quality of their lives. Morality is an important
part of quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore, illustrating the Democrats' commitment to values
issues, calls that popular explanation ``a dismissive attitude, the
idea that things are so good that real issues aren't around anymore
so we're going to have these bogus issues that are important to
people when they don't have anything else to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Shaune Henry, an Almond, N.Y., mother of four children ages 5
through 15 and busy real estate agent, has plenty to worry about,
despite the healthy economy. She worries about keeping her kids
away from drugs and alcohol, and is concerned about the values that
the culture models for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things that are allowed on TV during what I
consider children's time concern me,'' she said. ``The general
entertainment kids are exposed to concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry is not alone. Barbara Whitehead, a Democratic policy
analyst from Amherst, Mass., has written extensively on family
issues and sees widespread worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, the source of this general anxiety over morality
is rooted in a specific and legitimate concern over the rearing of
children and teen-agers and the many adverse forces that shape
their environment,'' Whitehead said. ``This concern is most acute
among the over 65-year-olds, a big segment of the grandparent
population, and parents. Both groups rank high among likely
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Whitehead sees what both campaigns have long
recognized: Values voters could decide this presidential election.

illustrate the strategy and tone:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``An era of tarnished ideals is giving way to a
responsibility era.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential
values -- to show we have grown up before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Greatness is found when American character and American
courage overcome American challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``We must give our children a spirit of moral courage,
because their character is our destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has long had its own strategy on morality and
the uncomfortable subject, especially for liberals, that often
shapes it -- religion. In a moment of candor, Elaine Kamarck,
Gore's senior policy adviser, revealed the intent more than a year
ago when she told the Boston Globe, ``The Democratic Party is going
to take back God this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Topics such as the environment and race are being couched in
spiritual terms. The new Democratic platform asserts that
``Democrats believe that God has given the people of our nation'' a
mission for racial and ethnic unity. And Gore stresses
environmentalism as a responsibility to take care of God's
creation, as he has since writing his 1992 book, ``Earth in the
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic emphasis on values has other antecedents. In
1996, Clinton broke what was seen as a Republican monopoly on
family values with a campaign targeting cigarettes, hard liquor,
deadbeat dads and trash on television. For several years, Lieberman
has joined with conservative culture warrior William J. Bennett in
bestowing a ``Silver Sewer'' award on entertainment entities that
provide an ``outrageous contribution to the degradation and
coarsening of our culture.'' Winners include CBS for endorsing
shock jock Howard Stern and highlighting ``Dr. Death,'' Jack
Kevorkian, on ''60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different in this campaign is the Democrats' overt
appeal to religion.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman, the first Jew on a major presidential ticket,
was introduced as Gore's running mate, he invoked ``Lord'' and
``God'' 13 times. Lieberman even asked the crowd to ``let the
spirit move me'' as he read from the Book of Chronicles: ``To give
thanks to God and declare his name and make his acts known to the
people. To be glad of spirit. To sing to God and to make music to
God, and most of all, to give glory and gratitude to God from whom
all blessings truly do flow.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman continued, this time in prayer, with Gore nodding
approvingly: ``Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for
bringing me to this extraordinary moment in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kilgore, policy director at the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council, which Lieberman chairs, said Lieberman's
religiosity was no mere display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing him as I do, he was genuinely very excited,'' Kilgore
said. ``He was expressing thanks. There wasn't anything calculated
about it. He did it in a natural way, and he's always said that
most people have no problem thanking God. But he also makes it
clear that he doesn't want an imposition of religion by government.
That's why this sounds different from him than from a Republican,
because Joe doesn't support any sort of theocratic agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Democratic Leadership Council has been
conducting seminars teaching elected officials how to develop their
values vocabulary. The main metaphor is a ``values tree,'' in which
the roots are values, the trunk is policy goals and the branches
are programs. In the past, Democrats have been guilty of speaking
what Kilgore calls hard-to-understand ``programese.''
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP has its own deficient dialect regarding values,
Kilgore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have always been overrated on this stuff,'' he
said. ``They may be pretty good about talking about religion and
faith, but they're not necessarily good about explaining why they
have the public policies they have and how they connect that to
their faith. It's never been terribly clear why faith in God means
you need to have a big tax cut, or a missile defense system for
that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans have acknowledged that their values
language, with Pat Buchanan's 1992 ``cultural war'' speech the most
notable example, has come across as too absolutist, as if they were
trying to impose a moral standard on the country that they
themselves couldn't meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans think of themselves as reasonably moral people but
they don't like to be preached to beyond a certain point,'' said
Robert Heineman, a conservative political scientist at Alfred
University in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A humbler tone has come after GOP scandals, such as the
revelation that former House Majority Leader Newt Gingrich was in
the midst of a six-year affair with a congressional staffer while
he lambasted Clinton for infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in a God who calls us, not to judge our neighbors,
but to love them,'' Bush said in his speech at the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The more positive approach seems to be working. In 1992, 56
percent of those polled after the Republican convention said the
GOP had been too negative. Only 38 percent said that just after
this year's convention, according to a Gallup Poll done for CNN and
USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans seem to recoil at an ``I'm right, you're wrong''
approach to values, polls show their assessment of their personal
faith as strong and remarkably unwavering over the years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Gallup survey conducted at the end of 1999, 86
percent of Americans believe in God, even when given the choice of
saying that they ``don't believe in God, but believe in a universal
spirit or higher power.'' About two-thirds of Americans claim to be
a member of a church or synagogue, a number that has stayed
constant throughout the years.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Gallup has been asking Americans, ``What is the
most important problem facing this country today?'' The most recent
response came in late June, when the leading answer was ethics,
morality and family decline, cited by 14 percent surveyed. That
ranked ahead of crime and violence (12 percent), education (11
percent) and health care (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Other polls have shown the same concern about values for more
than a year now, with politicians taking notice, even if the media
haven't highlighted it with the prominence given other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to think about this,'' said Green, ``is that when the
economy is good and we have peace abroad, people have the luxury to
think about the quality of their lives. Morality is an important
part of quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore, illustrating the Democrats' commitment to values
issues, calls that popular explanation ``a dismissive attitude, the
idea that things are so good that real issues aren't around anymore
so we're going to have these bogus issues that are important to
people when they don't have anything else to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Shaune Henry, an Almond, N.Y., mother of four children ages 5
through 15 and busy real estate agent, has plenty to worry about,
despite the healthy economy. She worries about keeping her kids
away from drugs and alcohol, and is concerned about the values that
the culture models for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things that are allowed on TV during what I
consider children's time concern me,'' she said. ``The general
entertainment kids are exposed to concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry is not alone. Barbara Whitehead, a Democratic policy
analyst from Amherst, Mass., has written extensively on family
issues and sees widespread worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, the source of this general anxiety over morality
is rooted in a specific and legitimate concern over the rearing of
children and teen-agers and the many adverse forces that shape
their environment,'' Whitehead said. ``This concern is most acute
among the over 65-year-olds, a big segment of the grandparent
population, and parents. Both groups rank high among likely
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Whitehead sees what both campaigns have long
recognized: Values voters could decide this presidential election.

 BUSH HITS THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ARMED WITH THE `CHARACTER ISSUE'

 C.2000 Newhouse News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (WASHINGTON) -- George W. Bush rides the Republican presidential
campaign trail packing the ``character issue'' at his side like a
trusty six-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   His stump speeches are chock full of words like ``honor,''
``dignity'' and ``values,'' and while the word ``Clinton'' never
comes up, it would be difficult for anyone to miss the references
to the president's moral lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush insists that he is not criticizing Clinton. Instead,
Bush said, he is just giving voters a preview of his own moral
conduct inside the Oval Office -- a claim critics say is so
disengenuous it calls Bush's own honesty into question.
</P>
<P>
   While it might seem a foolproof campaign strategy to impugn the
integrity of the only impeached president of the 20th century,
political experts say Bush needs to be careful. Despite Clinton's
troubles, he remains popular and voters are in no mood to recall
the dark days of the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, experts say, Bush could appear heavy-handed if he tries
to tar his rival, Vice President Gore, with Clinton's personal
problems. The risk, the experts say, is that Bush could become the
target of a character campaign himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that character is the subtext of this
election,'' said Robert Denton, a professor of political
communication at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University. ``The question is, how hard can he push it? He knows
it's a very fine line and he damned near crossed it. No one likes
to see you hit a dog when he's down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has certainly given his opponents plenty of ammunition.
Even before he took office in 1992, questions swirled about his
marital fidelity and political shenanigans while governor of
Arkansas. His White House administration was dogged by allegations
of fund-raising improprieties as Democratic donors swarmed to
private coffees with the president or spent the night in the
Lincoln bedroom. Clinton's reputation for moral rectitude hit
bottom in 1998 when he admitted having an affair with a White House
intern and was impeached by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore's selection Tuesday of Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman as a running mate was widely seen as an effort
partly to shield himself from broad character attacks on the
Clinton administration that could stain his own candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was never connected to the scandal, but his Achilles' heel
may be the way he reacted to it. At the height of the scandal, Gore
defended Clinton as ``one of the best presidents.'' Lieberman,
meanwhile, was denouncing the president's behavior from the floor
of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Having Lieberman at his side isn't likely to innoculate Gore
from questions about his own ethical problems, which mostly involve
dubious fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush's character campaign has been waged with a wink and
a nod. He has barely mentioned Clinton or Gore by name. His
acceptance speech last week contained more than two dozen
references to character issues, but only two explicit mentions of
the ``Clinton/Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody missed the point. When Bush called for a new ``era
of responsibility,'' the partisan Republican crowd roared. They did
the same when Bush said, ``Times of plenty, like times of crisis,
are tests of American character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one thing that has dominated the news about the
presidency since 1998, it was that whole matter of the personal
behavior of President Clinton,'' said Charles Jones, a presidential
scholar with the Brookings Institution. ``People do not have to be
reminded of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say that Bush is courting trouble if he is too coy.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week with The Washington Post, Bush
insisted that his promise to bring ``honor and dignity'' to the
White House was not aimed at the president, an assertion that
elicited guffaws in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost insulting,'' said Denton, the political scholar
from Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't speak well for Bush's own candor and honesty,''
added Bill Benoit, a professor of communication at the University
of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush can't be too explicit, either. Focus groups listening
to Bush's acceptance speech responded favorably when he sketched a
broad vision of strong leadership and morals in the White House.
But as soon as the comments appeared to stray too close to a
personal attack, voters tuned out.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   It's likely, the experts say, that Bush will continue to make
glancing references to character, but leave the more stinging
attacks to his lieutenants. Among the candidates: Vice Presidential
nominee Dick Cheney,the Republican governors and congressional
Republican leaders like Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi and Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, experts say, that the Bush character campaign may
dodge the impeachment altogether. Even though it was championed by
his own party and was the final chapter in the sordid sex scandal
Bush continues to hint at, pollsters and political scientists say
that voters don't want to be reminded of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are pretty much tired of all that. They want to
put it behind them,'' said David Allen, a political science
professor at Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a Republican, believes that Bush's character campaign is
targeted at those who already have a low opinion of Clinton and
Gore: The Republican constituent base. He said the comments are
intended to energize the core believers to get them involved in the
campaign and to vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   But, Allen also said it could backfire, especially if Bush is
seen as unfairly attacking Gore. Despite the fund-raising
questions, Allen said that no one has ever questioned Gore's
morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people recognize that it is Lieberman and Gore and not
Clinton-Gore,'' Allen said. ``Bush can use that to drum up the
faithful, but I don't think it will garner them votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some believe it could open the door to Bush's own,
admittedly, dark past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has acknowledged that in college and in the years before
being elected to public office, he was a heavy drinker. He has
studiously avoided saying whether he experimented with drugs,
saying he hasn't used any since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   His ``frat boy'' image has been muted somewhat by a religious
awakening that saw him embrace Christianity and eschew alcohol.
But, experts say, in the heat of a campaign that already seems to
be turning negative, anything is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be above moral reproach today, but it wasn't always
so,'' said Judith Trent, a political scientist at the University of
Cincinnati. ``While most people aren't that concerned about his
past, he risks being seen as a hypocrite. He has to tread very
carefully.''

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ ``Unless we take action now, our
nation may confront a situation similar to the Great Depression _
and maybe even worse.'' The presidential candidate who made this
frightening prediction is lying low. His political party, however,
currently has a high profile. It is being torn apart from within.
It turns out that Ross Perot's leadership was not needed to save
America from another Great Depression. But Perot may be needed to
keep his Reform Party from crumbling to pieces. (Rowland Nethaway

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ ATLANTA _ As a born and
bred Southsider I can't help but get a chuckle out of the Great
Pink Flamingo Controversy north of here. In case you haven't been
following major news events lately, here's the story. Doug and
Ellen Henry bought a home in what I take to be a subdivision.
Hoping to spruce up their front yard, which likely had been left
bare of trees by greedy developers, they paid $15 each for a pair
of pink flamingos. They described the colorful birds as ``lawn
decoration.'' Their neighbors, certainly not Southern-born, thought
the colorful birds were tacky eyesores. (Jim Minter is a former

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Texas _ When Al Gore introduced his new
running mate Tuesday _ Joseph Lieberman, America's first Jewish
vice-presidential candidate _ the mood in Nashville was jubilant.
The theme of the party: ``Isn't it great that we live in America,
where such a thing can happen?'' Meanwhile, in the months and weeks
leading up to the election, as the two major parties moved
inexorably to the nomination of yet another daring combination of
Four White Guys, I've found myself asking a different question:
``This is America! Why can't we get some semblance of diversity on
the ticket?''(McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

drink to sip on the way home, or be 65 cents ahead tomorrow. I
decided I needed the change more than the soda. As I pulled out of

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Undermined by votes in the Knesset and betrayed
by a one-time coalition partner in filling the nation's figurehead
presidency, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been left holding an
empty political bag. The question now is whether Barak, after a
series of political defections, can cobble together a functioning

   But some say that Bush is courting trouble if he is too coy.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week with The Washington Post, Bush
insisted that his promise to bring ``honor and dignity'' to the
White House was not aimed at the president, an assertion that
elicited guffaws in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost insulting,'' said Denton, the political scholar
from Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't speak well for Bush's own candor and honesty,''
added Bill Benoit, a professor of communication at the University
of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush can't be too explicit, either. Focus groups listening
to Bush's acceptance speech responded favorably when he sketched a
broad vision of strong leadership and morals in the White House.
But as soon as the comments appeared to stray too close to a
personal attack, voters tuned out.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   It's likely, the experts say, that Bush will continue to make
glancing references to character, but leave the more stinging
attacks to his lieutenants. Among the candidates: Vice Presidential
nominee Dick Cheney,the Republican governors and congressional
Republican leaders like Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi and Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, experts say, that the Bush character campaign may
dodge the impeachment altogether. Even though it was championed by
his own party and was the final chapter in the sordid sex scandal
Bush continues to hint at, pollsters and political scientists say
that voters don't want to be reminded of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are pretty much tired of all that. They want to
put it behind them,'' said David Allen, a political science
professor at Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a Republican, believes that Bush's character campaign is
targeted at those who already have a low opinion of Clinton and
Gore: The Republican constituent base. He said the comments are
intended to energize the core believers to get them involved in the
campaign and to vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   But, Allen also said it could backfire, especially if Bush is
seen as unfairly attacking Gore. Despite the fund-raising
questions, Allen said that no one has ever questioned Gore's
morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people recognize that it is Lieberman and Gore and not
Clinton-Gore,'' Allen said. ``Bush can use that to drum up the
faithful, but I don't think it will garner them votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some believe it could open the door to Bush's own,
admittedly, dark past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has acknowledged that in college and in the years before
being elected to public office, he was a heavy drinker. He has
studiously avoided saying whether he experimented with drugs,
saying he hasn't used any since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   His ``frat boy'' image has been muted somewhat by a religious
awakening that saw him embrace Christianity and eschew alcohol.
But, experts say, in the heat of a campaign that already seems to
be turning negative, anything is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be above moral reproach today, but it wasn't always
so,'' said Judith Trent, a political scientist at the University of
Cincinnati. ``While most people aren't that concerned about his
past, he risks being seen as a hypocrite. He has to tread very
carefully.''

 &HT;    More diversity please
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Texas _ When Al Gore introduced his new running mate
Tuesday _ Joseph Lieberman, America's first Jewish
vice-presidential candidate _ the mood in Nashville was jubilant.
The theme of the party: ``Isn't it great that we live in America,
where such a thing can happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the months and weeks leading up to the election,
as the two major parties moved inexorably to the nomination of yet
another daring combination of Four White Guys, I've found myself
asking a different question: ``This is America! Why can't we get
some semblance of diversity on the ticket?''
</P>
<P>
   So it's at once heartening that Lieberman is in the race and
disheartening that everyone is making such a big deal of it. That
what Lieberman describes simply as ``my faith; it's who I am'' is
being debated as a potential political liability.
</P>
<P>
   ve ahead with where we need to be in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore/Lieberman ticket would say that's exactly what they're
doing. ``We're the American dream team,'' Lieberman exulted
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His selection is a step in the right direction. Still, when
countries from Israel to Pakistan, from England to India have
elected women as leaders, it's hard to feel too exuberant about
America's record. When will women and blacks get serious
consideration on the ticket _ and not just for the No. 2 spot? How
many more decades, how many more elections will we have to wait?
</P>
<P>
   We have, for the first time in history, a Jewish vice
presidential candidate. Isn't it great that we live in America,
where such a thing can happen?
</P>
<P>
   Yes it is. But wouldn't it be even greater if we lived in an
America where such a thing happened so routinely that it barely
seemed worth noting?

 &HT;    A-flutter over flamingos
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a born and bred Southsider I can't help but get a
chuckle out of the Great Pink Flamingo Controversy north of here.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't been following major news events lately,
here's the story.
</P>
<P>
   Doug and Ellen Henry bought a home in what I take to be a
subdivision. Hoping to spruce up their front yard, which likely had
been left bare of trees by greedy developers, they paid $15 each
for a pair of pink flamingos.
</P>
<P>
   They described the colorful birds as ``lawn decoration.'' Their
neighbors, certainly not Southern-born, thought the colorful birds
were tacky eyesores.
</P>
<P>
   The Towne Park Homeowners Association, although not mentioned in
the U.S. Constitution or appointed by Gov. Roy Barnes, has a lot of
power. It started fining the Henrys $25 a day for every day the
flamingos stayed on their lawn. Pretty soon, according to news
reports, they owed $3,400 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   I don't blame the Henrys for being angry, although they brought
a lot of their trouble on themselves by their lack of judgment. I
would never join a homeowners association, or any other association
that spelled ``town'' with an ``e.'' Being a born and bred
Southsider, I would immediately sniff a dose of ersatz elitism.
</P>
<P>
   The Henrys got their fines reduced to $1,100, but they had
enough of Towne folks. They moved, taking the flamingos along. When
a new baby boy arrived, their neighbors, instead of complaining
about tacky yard decorations, draped blue ribbon over the birds.
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy the Henrys are happy, but I wish they had moved to my
county, just to see if we still have our values intact. Lately we
tend to get a little highhanded ourselves about who can put what
where. We should not throw rocks at people who have special
prejudices. We have our own. Being as David wears no pants, my
hometown certainly wouldn't permit Michelangelo's statue of him on
the courthouse lawn, or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brooks is a longtime county resident, proprietor of the
highly respected Whitewater Country Club, a generous contributor to
civic causes. He also is a good-old-boy graduate of Clemson
University who eats breakfast at the Waffle House.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bob wanted to open one of his Hooters restaurants, a
crowd of protesters showed up at a downtown rally. Something about
waitresses wearing skirts so short they could be cheerleaders for
the high school football team.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters is out, but I think pink flamingos are OK. I'm no
lawyer, but my lay opinion is that while plastic varieties might
not be constitutional in some parts south they are perfectly legal
in other parts of the county _ at least until the commissioners
meet again.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, flamingos would be fine if they were made of terra
cotta and cost more than $15.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic flamingos at $15 would be well received in the
semi-rural part of the county where we live. We aren't many years
away from old automobile tires painted white with tulip beds
inside. Rocks washed with white mud dug out of creek banks made
fine borders for whatever flowers our grandmothers had blooming.
</P>
<P>
   We decorated a lot in the old days. Even a sophisticated city
like Fayetteville boasted streets with oak trees painted white
three-quarters of the way up the trunk. I remember going to town
with my daddy on Saturday afternoons and wishing we lived in a big
city with white-tailed oak trees like Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't gone back to whitewashed automobile tires, but pink
flamingos for decorative purposes have been in resurgence for some
time. They often are rented for festive occasions like weddings and
birthday parties. They are especially popular for birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   Since he is in New York on temporary duty and won't read this, I
can confide that we are planning to help our semi-city son
celebrate his 40th by placing several rent-a-birds on his front
lawn. His boss in Atlanta has been invited down to dinner and we're
sure he wants to make a good impression.
</P>
<P>
   I hope we come out better than well-meaning friends of Bobby
Mobley, my fellow traveler to the Australian Outback and other
exotic vacation spots most Americans visit only when ordered to go
in time of war.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark of night, when Bobby was about to celebrate a
significant birthday, Carolyn Croft and other devoted friends
placed 60 rented pink flamingos in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   When Bobby woke up, he loaded the flamingos into his pickup
truck and headed for Alabama, where such yard decorations sell for
a premium. I understand he wrote nice notes, thanking his friends
for their thoughtful birthday gifts.

 &HT;    Reformers in desperate need of Ross Perot now more than ever
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Unless we take action now, our nation may
confront a situation similar to the Great Depression _ and maybe
even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidate who made this frightening prediction
is lying low.
</P>
<P>
   His political party, however, currently has a high profile. It
is being torn apart from within.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Ross Perot's leadership was not needed to save
America from another Great Depression. But Perot may be needed to
keep his Reform Party from crumbling to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Perot was a surprisingly strong candidate for the
presidency, he told American voters that the nation's economy was
``perched on the edge of a cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, Perot was heading up a ``Straight Talk
Express'' eight years before Sen. John McCain gave that name to the
bus that carried his own maverick presidential campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans once thought Perot actually had a good chance to
win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   BUTTER OFF BISCUIT
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the campaign was long enough for voters to figure
out that most of the butter had slipped off the Texas billionaire's
biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   Perot received 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 presidential
election even after he unexpectedly quit the race and spouted off
about several conspiracy theories worthy of the aluminum-foil hat
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Perot said was well received.
</P>
<P>
   Perot talked about the need to balance the budget, get out of
debt, kick the lobbyists out of Washington, provide Americans with
quality health care and give American children the best education
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years before McCain used campaign finance reform to
torment his Republican primary opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
Perot called for the elimination of all political action
committees. He supported passage of laws ``eliminating all
possibilities for special interests to give large sums of money to
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain showed that idea remains popular today. Who could doubt
it as Americans continue to watch Republicans and Democrats rake in
mountains of cash from special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Perot was far ahead of McCain when he called for laws requiring
the return of all excess political campaign funds to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Perot also sought laws reducing the time for federal election
campaigns, reducing the cost of federal campaigns and creating
equal opportunity for all new candidates by providing equal
television time.
</P>
<P>
   Short campaigns are appealing to Americans who grow weary, bored
or angry with this nation's lengthy political selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Perot may have won the 1992 election had the
campaign process been shortened to only a couple of months. It took
time to discover that this fast-talking quipster with a lot of good
ideas actually was a bit balmy.
</P>
<P>
   Balmy may be fine for entertainers, but not so fine for
commanders in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's appeal, money and organizational skill quickly got him
on the ballot in nearly every state. He showed there are a lot of
Americans frustrated with both major political parties, Washington
gridlock, finger pointing, red ink, political name-calling,
bureaucracy and neglect of important domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of Perot's success, his Reform Party now qualifies for
more than $12 million, which is being fought over by two Reform
Party factions.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan, who must be the famous crazy aunt living in
Perot's basement, is trying to make off with the Reform Party and
millions in federal campaign funds so he can spread his narrow
message of cultural warfare, isolation and division.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Perot looks like a solemn statesman. Where is
Perot when we need him?

 &HT;    Helping solve a problem is satisfying work
 &HT;    By Jack Warner

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are very few things in this line of work more
rewarding than actually being able to help somebody. I hand out
advice in this space every week and almost never know whether it
did anyone any good.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, I received this e-mail from a local woodworker
named Johnny Herron:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am having trouble with something that is supposed to be easy
to do _ a simple jig for a router table to make a circle cut.
Directions call for a piece of 1/4-inch plywood with a small nail
through it, then into my wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'm supposed to slowly turn the blank to cut a circle. My
problem is that I can't seem to keep the nail steady. It gives and
I have a flat spot or router chatter and small nicks in the wood.
How do I keep the nail from moving?
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, in cutting an inside circle, do I need to drill a hole
for the blade to rise through or do I just raise the blade and push
down on the blank. This seems to jerk the wood in the wrong way. I
then have to stop the kickback and go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   We would have gotten it worked out sooner if I had not gotten
hung up on the question about drilling a hole in the workpiece.
</P>
<P>
   My reply:
</P>
<P>
   You don't say what sort of router, or what bit and shank size
you're using, or how thick the workpiece is. However, it sounds as
though you're trying to make the cut in a single pass. A cut of 1/4
inch is the deepest I'd ever consider making with any size router
and a 1/2-inch shank bit. One-eighth inch at a time would be a lot
easier on the machine, the bit and you. If you do it that way,
there should be no need to drill a starter hole.
</P>
<P>
   Further, I don't quite understand how this jig works. How small
is the nail? I wouldn't use a very small nail for this. I can't
hold nail sizes in my head, so I can't be exact, but I'd use a nail
with a shank about 1/8-inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Herron replied that his was a small router running a 1/4-inch
shank, but that he knew well enough to take the cut in small
increments. The project, he said, came from a very popular magzine
devoted entirely to projects, but only specified a ``small nail.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there appeared to be nothing wrong with my correspondent's
technique, then the problem had to lie with the jig. It is very
surprising that the project plans did not specify a size for the
nail; after all, ``small'' depends on who is making the definition.
</P>
<P>
   I replied:
</P>
<P>
   I'd say the problem lies primarily with the small nail. The
smaller the nail, the more likely it is to begin wiggling; the more
it wiggles, the more it enlarges the hole in the plywood, and
everything gets worse exponentially. From your description of the
project, a bigger nail isn't going to deface anything.
</P>
<P>
   Herron took the suggestion to the next level, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading your response about using a larger nail I
thought about it and came up with using a short piece of dowel for
the pivot point. Since the middle would be scrap, I drilled a
5/16-inch hole to match a piece of scrap dowel. I cut it to 1
1/4-inch long and epoxyed it to the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``WORKS WELL!!''
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, this was a very wise move. Even a stout nail
might be subject to vibration and movement when held in something
as thin as 1/4-inch ply.

   (UNDATED) As unlikely as it may seem, genetics researchers and
young Harry Potter fans share a dilemma when it comes to satisfying
their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Mad-about-Harry readers itching for the new Potter book ``The
Goblet of Fire'' can peruse it for free at the public library but
may have to wait months for a copy to become available. Or they can
get the 734-page tome immediately by forking over $25.95 at the
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, scientists who want to pore over the just-completed
map of all human genetic material can wait until the government's
Human Genome Project is made available at no cost on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can pay thousands of dollars to get it from the maverick
Rockville, Md., biotech firm Celera Genomics.
</P>
<P>
   Many academic researchers had criticized Celera for its plans to
restrict access to the genetic blueprint for life that is present
in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, they are beginning to sign on with the company,
wooed by its ability to analyze and display the massive amounts of
data rapidly or worried that without immediate access, they'll lose
an advantage to competing researchers. In some cases, scientists
will be paying for repackaged genetic information their own labs
helped compile.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State University and the University of Cincinnati reached
agreements with Celera two weeks ago, paying $150,000 apiece for a
three-year subscription to the company's computer database. Each
university signed up 10 researchers at an individual subscription
cost of $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and Vanderbilt universities and Texas' state colleges
have signed up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celera has made itself almost the sole supplier of information
that everyone else wants,'' said Thomas H. Murray, president of the
Hastings Center, which studies ethical issues in medicine and
society. ``It's a very clever plan.''
</P>
<P>
   If a certain similarity to Microsoft comes to mind -- an
arrogantly brilliant business plan, scorched-earth market tactics,
a Fort Knox-sized budget and the ability to trump competitors by
bettering their original idea -- Celera wouldn't discourage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to become the definitive portal'' for genetics
information, said Daniel Clutter, a Celera regional account
manager. ``No matter what the Human Genome Project does, we'll be a
year or two ahead of them. They're so far behind, it's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   To a nonscientist, the material at the heart of this dust-up
doesn't look like much to fight over. Accessed by computer, it's a
bewildering mix of jargon -- ``blasts,'' ``contigs,'' ``snips'' --
and screenfuls of the same four abbreviated chemical letters, A, C,
T and G, repeated in endless, eye-glazing columns: gatctcggct
cactgcaacc tctgcctcct ...
</P>
<P>
   What it represents, though, is a coming revolution in the
diagnosis and treatment of disease, the formulation of personally
tailored drugs and the understanding of how a dizzying array of
life forms evolved on Earth. The secrets are in our genes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a group of government and academic scientists led by
the National Institutes of Health began the biological equivalent
of the moon-landing program. They started trying to decipher the
makeup of the genetic material that carries instructions for
assembling and operating all living creatures, from simple bacteria
to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight years, the Human Genome Project moved at a
methodical pace, aiming to finish in 2005 and make its findings
available to anyone who wanted them. The researchers picked a
slow-but-sure technique for teasing out the secrets locked inside
the twisted coils of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of their own had rebelled. J. Craig Venter, an
NIH scientist who had developed a much faster but less thorough way
of decoding DNA, became frustrated with the Human Genome Project's
gene-mining.
</P>
<P>
   He started a for-profit company, Celera (a form of the Latin
word for ``quick''), intending to beat the Human Genome Project at
its own game. With tens of millions of dollars in investment money
and the most powerful computers available, Celera would use its
shortcut approach to crack the human genetic code within three
years, Venter declared at the company's 1998 launch.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists fretted about the potential for Celera to horde
the treasures it might unearth in human DNA, either by patenting
unique genes linked to disease or behavior or by restricting access
to the entire decoded genetic sequence. The Human Genome Project
ramped up its effort and moved up its timetable to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides declared a tie in June when they simultaneously
announced completion of a ``rough draft'' of the full complement of
human genetic material. But the information is in fragments that
still have to be assembled, checked for errors and sorted to
determine which portions of DNA are nonfunctioning ``junk'' and
which are genes.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project has finished 22 percent of that final
draft and says it will be done by 2003. Celera claims it will have
the completed human sequence available for its paying customers
this fall, as well as details about gene products and genetic
variations between people. Later, the company intends to add the
decoded genetic blueprint for mice, rats, cats, dogs and other
higher animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're paying for a time advantage. You're paying for what you
could get for free in a year or two,'' said Gerald M. Rubin, vice
president for biomedical research at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, a major nonprofit medical research organization.
``People have to make a decision whether it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, some scientists and the company itself contend,
the product Celera is selling isn't much different from a
subscription to a stock market service that provides almost
immediate access to trading results and prepares market information
suited to a customer's interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Celera likely wouldn't have had a database to sell -- at
least not as quickly -- without using information from the
taxpayer-funded $300 million Human Genome Project to fill the gaps
caused by its shortcut decoding method. So, in essence, academic
researchers are paying for an encyclopedia containing chapters
they've written, although Celera has assembled the material and
devised ways of searching and analyzing it.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting issue,'' said Richard P. Lifton, chairman
of the genetics department at Yale University School of Medicine
and an adviser to the Human Genome Project. ``There certainly are
scientists who will say, `Over my dead body' -- it would be
anathema to subscribe. My personal perception is that Celera has
every right to package the data and try to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifton, however, said that as an individual scientist, he
``would see it as a sign of disloyalty to sign with Celera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dean would say $50,000 is a small price to pay if you can
get a million-dollar grant from it,'' said Huntington F. Willard,
chairman of Case Western Reserve University Medical School's
genetics department and director of University Hospitals' Research
Institute in Cleveland. CWRU is considering signing up with Celera.
``If there's value added -- and that's a big `if' at this point --
I have no objection to taking sequence information from my lab,
turning around and paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``value-added'' part is a sore point with some academic
scientists. Much of what they're being asked to buy, using scarce
research dollars -- the human and mouse blueprints, the specifics
of genetic variation -- isn't ready yet. There's no pre-purchase
test drive of the data, but Celera isn't shy about reminding
potential customers of the consequences of not signing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research is a competitive business,'' said the company's
Clutter, a biochemist turned salesman. ``There's limited grant
money out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have a legitimate fear that they'll be left behind,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of Celera's pitch is intrinsically clever -- fear of the
unknown,'' Lifton said. ``You won't know what's in it until you buy
it. (But) gosh, all of your competitors will be light-years ahead
because they have access.''
</P>
<P>
   In a mix of altruism and savvy advertising, Celera partnered
with academic researchers in March to decode and make available
without charge the genetic blueprint of the fruit fly. It was a
valuable contribution to science because of the fly's genetic
similarity to humans. It also boosted Celera's credibility and
whetted appetites by proving its shortcut approach works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad marketing technique,'' Clutter said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The company eventually will provide free access to the ``raw,''
unanalyzed human genetic blueprint but probably never will give
away more specialized data, Clutter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a business aspect,'' he said. ``We do have to make a
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some researchers can accept paying for Celera's
information, they worry about the effect it might have on the
publicly funded gene-mapping effort. The Human Genome Project
intends to do much of the same analysis as Celera. It doesn't
object to commercial firms repackaging the genetic information but
wants to ensure the data is freely available, said project
spokeswoman Cathy Yarbrough.
</P>
<P>
   But if Congress, the project's ultimate financial overseer,
decides that duplication is unnecessary -- that genetic information
already is available, albeit at a price -- will it scale back or
shut down the project?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfortunate if the government pulled the plug on
the public effort,'' said Dr. Sanford Markowitz, a CWRU cancer
genetics researcher and Howard Hughes Medical Institute scientist.
``You want this to be available to the assistant professor just
starting a lab and to whom $15,000 (for a Celera subscription) is
not a doable number.''

   ASSERTING YOURSELF: HOW TO SAY `NO' AND MEAN IT
</P>
<P>
   BC-JUST-SAY-NO-HARVARD-BUSINESS-PUBLISHING-NYTSF _ Are you
uncomfortable when you have to assert yourself in a tricky
emotional situation? Do you sometimes say ``yes'' when you mean
``no'' to avoid an ugly confrontation in the workplace? Many people
find it difficult to be assertive in one-on-one or group
situations. Here are some steps experts recommend to become more

 FROM: THE HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Are you uncomfortable when you have to assert yourself in a
tricky emotional situation? Do you sometimes say ``yes'' when you
mean ``no'' to avoid an ugly confrontation in the workplace?
</P>
<P>
   Many executives find it difficult to be assertive in one-on-one
or group situations. Instead, they'll ignore the poor performance
of a senior staff member, say ``yes'' to an impractical team
decision and even do their own clerical work rather than delegate
it to a hot-tempered assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some steps experts recommend to become more assertive:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMIT TO CHANGING YOUR BEHAVIOR. &LR;  If you think you have a
problem, don't just promise yourself you'll try to change; do
something about it, says Mildred 0. Saunders of Milsaun &AMP; Co., a
New York-based management consulting firm. Otherwise, it's no
different from saying you'll go on a diet next week while gorging
yourself on a six-course meal.
</P>
<P>
   Judith C. Tingley, president of Performance Improvement Pros in
Phoenix and author of ``Say What You Mean, Get What You Want''
(AMACOM, 1996), suggests you advise your management team about your
plan to change. Letting others know ensures a sincere effort at
change. Besides, it may be wise to let them know what's coming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEARN TO VALUE YOURSELF. &LR;  Do an inventory of your strengths to
rebuild your self-confidence. If you can't turn off the negative
voice in your head, seek out people whose judgment you trust to
give you a more positive assessment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN. &LR;  This should not focus on addressing
your weaknesses but on providing you with more opportunities to
shine by playing to your strengths, according to Jeff Davidson, a
conference and convention speaker based in Chapel Hill, N.C. The
purpose is to create a foundation on which you can build feelings
of assurance, competency and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't shine, say, when you're discussing a problem in a
large crowd, you can work on that from now until the end of your
days yet never feel totally at ease,'' he says. ``If you're more
effective on a one-to-one or small-group basis, create those
circumstances to deal with awkward or unpleasant communications.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS ON THE BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS OF YOUR ANSWER. &LR;  Don't fill
your mind with thoughts that have nothing to do with the decision,
like fears of retaliation and rejection. You can't please everyone,
and sometimes making the right decision won't please anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The higher you move in an organization, the more isolated you
may feel. ``But senior managers need to remember that saying 'yes'
won't end that isolation,'' Tingley says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAY `NO' IF IT'S THE BETTER ANSWER. &LR;  Follow your response with
a single explanation. Multiple reasons, a longwinded explanation or
the word ``no'' followed by an apology can weaken the response and
encourage a plea for a change of mind.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DON'T GET PRESSURED INTO SAYING `YES.' &LR;  If you are asked for an
immediate reply but you don't have enough information to make a
``yes'' or ``no'' decision, say ``no.'' Later, if you decide that
``yes'' is a more suitable reply, it will be better accepted than
if you say ``no'' after having said ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DON'T ALWAYS WAIT TO BE ASKED SOMETHING TO SAY `NO.' &LR;  Take the
initiative if you sense a request coming. Phrase your ``no'' as a
directive or observation. This way you increase the likelihood that
work will be done to your specifications without creating
disappointment or ill will, Tingley says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DON'T LET SOMEONE PUSH YOU INTO CHANGING YOUR MESSAGE. &LR;  When a
``no'' with a single explanation isn't enough, use what Tingley
calls the ``broken record'' technique by repeating your response.
In short, the person is trying to wear you down. Worst-case
scenario: the other person will be disappointed or angry with you,
Tingley says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REHEARSE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. &LR;  For instance, if you have
avoided discussing an employee's poor performance, open the
conversation by admitting your failure, then assertively set the
agenda: to agree to a timetable for performance improvement.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the script, Saunders says, anticipate how you will
respond to a variety of reactions, from put-offs to ``poor me'' sob
stories. Have crib notes with you if you are worried that you might
forget some key point when caught up in the emotion of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BE CONSCIOUS OF YOUR BODY LANGUAGE. &LR;  Eliminate nonassertive
behaviors, such as looking away from the person, covering your
mouth or wetting your lips. Also, consider voice pitch and speed.
For example, if you're too loud, you may sound angry; speak too
quickly, and you may seem impatient.
</P>
<P>
   A passive stance or timid voice may encourage a more aggressive
reaction from the other party, thereby putting greater pressure on
you.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be passive, or nonassertive, to be uneasy
delivering bad news or rejecting someone's idea or request. Both
the stress in today's organizations and movement toward a more
collaborative workforce make it harder, as a leader, to stand apart
from the group and say ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognize that others have the right to ask, but you have the
responsibility to say, `No,''' Tingley says.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Y2K has come and gone, and corporate information technology
departments are turning their attention to that perennial
technological stepchild, the intranet. Their findings? A company's
internal Web site can be a powerful tool for sharing and managing
information of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intranet is the communications platform for group work _
the `electronic brain' that employees tap into,'' says Steve
McCormick, a consultant with Watson Wyatt Worldwide's Washington,
D.C., office.
</P>
<P>
   What's new here isn't groupware, which Lotus Notes broke ground
on a decade ago. The novelty is putting everything on the same
Web-based system.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some examples of well-designed intranets at major
companies and the features that make them special.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP PEOPLE IN TOUCH
</P>
<P>
   At MadeToOrder.com, a Redwood City, Calif.-based seller of
corporate logo apparel, the intranet is the key to efficient
functioning of the company's newly created _ and widely distributed
_ work force.
</P>
<P>
   The intranet allows ``remote employees to feel part of the
company,'' says Weston Rose, president and CEO of MadeToOrder.com.
</P>
<P>
   Intranets hardly remove the need for face-to-face interaction,
but _ paradoxically _ they can improve on-site gatherings. ``The
meetings you do have are more meaningful,'' Rose says. ``You don't
have to spend a lot of time catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite intranet site of J.C. Penney managers is the
company's Knowledge Management System. After signing in, each
manager views a desktop customized by his or her function and
level. The desktops contain training programs and management tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't publish or mail training materials any longer,'' says
Deborah Masten, director of human resources communications and
development at J.C. Penney's corporate headquarters in Plano,
Texas. That's a huge savings for a far-flung retailer that hires
between 400 and 700 management trainees a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful feature: asynchronous discussion. J.C. Penney
managers can ask questions of their peer group, and other managers
can answer when they log in.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOMATE ROUTINE TASKS
</P>
<P>
   ``At Microsoft, we're doing everything on the intranet,'' says
Mary Lee Kennedy, director of information services at the software
company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's intranet contains about 1,000 sites, more than 2
million pages and dozens of applications and functionalities. Every
day, roughly a third of the company's 30,000 employees log on to
MSWeb, the most general-purpose site.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite: MSMarket, an intranet where employees can buy
office supplies and book travel tickets. The site is a time-saver
for employees and a purchasing department's dream, seamlessly
integrating vendors.
</P>
<P>
   PROVIDE EASY ACCESS TO INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, managers at Kraft Foods saw a need to coordinate
Web usage among different divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the groups were developing Web pages at the same time. We
wanted to make sure that not all of them were reinventing the
wheel,'' recalls Karen Isaacson, director of human resources
information and technology at the company's Northfield, Ill.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft set up an intranet committee composed of representatives
from corporate affairs, human resources, legal and IT. The result:
the Kraft Intranet Cafe, a striking Web site that is the default
home page for every Kraft employee. The cafe provides access to the
rest of the company's intranet sites, such as HR Online.
</P>
<P>
   CUT OVERHEAD COSTS
</P>
<P>
   Veritas, a storage-management software maker based in Mountain
View, Calif., uses the intranet to reduce administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we in HR are overhead. We have to think of
ways of doing things better and reducing the percentage of overall
costs that HR accounts for,'' says Elizabeth Grover, vice president
of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   She began by putting basic HR information on the intranet, then
added a Web application that managers use to figure merit raises.
The intranet version of the merit calculations contains several
improvements over the spreadsheets Grover formerly sent to
managers, and at the same time streamlines HR's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ORGANIZE _ AND COMMUNICATE _ DATA
</P>
<P>
   For many industries, the need to manage data goes beyond a
nicety. Intranets linked to several databases can organize the
voluminous material.
</P>
<P>
   For example, J.C. Penney managers can look at sales reports
through the company's Infovision intranet site and can share
information (such as reports on slow sellers) with peer groups
through the Knowledge Management System.
</P>
<P>
   WIN-WIN MARKETING
</P>
<P>
   MadeToOrder.com creates intranet sites for its clients free of
charge, allowing the clients' employees to order corporate-logo
shirts, hats and more with a few clicks.
</P>

   FILM-CHILD (Undated) _ The most entertaining thing about ``Bless

QUEEN LATIFAH PRACTICES TV SURVIVAL SKILLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Changes are ahead for ``Queen Latifah.'' ``Big Brother'' kind of
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay current, stay with the times,'' said
Latifah, who is barnstorming the country to promote her talk show's
second season. ``We're going to try some experiments this time
around with some reality-based TV, in the `Big Brother,' `Survivor'
sort of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the show to sometimes devote one or more of its
segments to video of an ongoing or upcoming story _ using footage
obtained from wiring houses with microphones and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have an issue, we'll go in and wire a person's house for
a period of time, just let them be in their own environment and let
them go about life as they ordinarily go about it,'' Latifah said.
``We'll check up on them maybe once or twice a week, and until the
time comes when it's time for them to come to the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it's spanking the kids _ should you or not _ and some guy
says, `Oh, I spank my kid all the time.' Well, we want to see it.
We want to see how you do behave with your son or daughter. And
that gives us a better base from which to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Latifah is an unabashed admirer of reality programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like `Survivor.' I haven't really watched `Big Brother.' I
watch `The Real World.' This is kind of a `Real World' thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those who watches `World's Scariest Police
Chases,''' she said. ``I'm fascinated by stuff like that. I watch
`Trauma: Life in the ER.' I watch Discovery and TLC all day. I like
to learn about other things. Human behavior is very interesting
because it's never what you expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're going to try this and see what happens. I mean, we're
still a talk show. We're not a `Big Brother.' So we'll only use it
in the way we feel is necessary for the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which begins a new season Sept. 11, also will adopt a
documentary style from time to time. But Latifah plans to keep it
as fun, irreverent and dotted with celebrities as ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, ``Queen Latifah'' could indeed be classified as a
``Survivor'' type of show. Though only a marginal success in the
ratings in its first year, it's around for another season _ a fate
such shows as ``Roseanne,'' ``The Martin Short Show'' and ``Later
Today'' cannot claim.
</P>
<P>
   Latifah, 30, has been reaping headlines for her work. Most
famously, she stood firmly by an overweight girl who dropped out of
school after being mercilessly teased. She offered the student
suggestions on dieting and food preparation, and told her she would
escort her back to school when she was ready to go back. And she
did.
</P>
<P>
   Another show was devoted to a black Houston woman who treated
her two dark-skinned daughters like Cinderella, while a lighter
daughter was treated like a queen. Latifah urged the woman to seek
counseling, and out of that she learned that the woman had been
treated the same way growing up; the woman's lighter-skinned
brother could do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Her shows have helped get girls out of gangs, and prostitutes
and drug addicts off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a regular person with an extraordinary
job,'' Latifah said.
</P>
<P>
   She can call herself a regular person, but not many people can
match her versatility. She's made a name for herself in films
(``Set It Off,'' ``The Bone Collector''), TV series (``Living
Single'') and TV movies (``Mama Flora's Family,'' the upcoming
miniseries ``The O.Z.'').
</P>
<P>
   Her greatest love, she said, is music. Her latest rap album,
tentatively titled ``Elevation,'' will be released in November _
and she's proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tight,'' she said. ``All the beats are hot, all the words
are hot, the hooks. It's real melodic.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to tour with that next spring.
</P>
<P>
   And she's still got her eyes peeled for any TV or movie projects
that might come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born to perform,'' said the Newark, N.J., native, born
Dana Elaine Owens. ``I watched a lot of TV as a kid and was just
fascinated by it. I would get in the mirror sometimes and make up
these dramatic stories, and my imagination would go so far with it,
I would make myself cry. I'd do it just to see if I could do it. I
was always into it.''

<P>
   This is the breakfast of the near future: Everything is good for
you, even food that used to be bad. You treat your high cholesterol
with a bagel and cream cheese. The cream cheese lowers your
cholesterol, thanks to an ingredient from pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Wash down the bagel with juice. The juice lowers cholesterol,
too, and it has an ingredient to prevent deteriorating eyesight. It
doesn't have any parts from a pine tree in it, just soybean
extracts. Finish with yogurt that helps control ulcers and a bowl
of cereal that contains weight-loss supplements.
</P>
<P>
   With the cereal, have some milk. There's nothing special about
the milk _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of functional foods, where groceries and
pharmaceuticals meet. Instead of taking a pill with your meal, the
pill can be (begin ital) in (end ital) the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Functional food is regular food that has been engineered to
address health problems. Functional food used to mean breakfast
cereal fortified with vitamins and minerals. Now, that same cereal
might contain ingredients that help people lower cholesterol or
lose weight. These products can be found in Europe, and they're
starting to appear here.
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods arrive as a growing number of consumers are
practicing what food trends expert Elizabeth Sloan calls ``self
care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are actively treating themselves first before seeking
medical help,'' said Sloan, whose Florida marketing and consulting
firm, Sloan Trends &AMP; Solutions, Inc., tracks what's new in food,
pharmaceuticals and supplements. ``There's a backlash, and people
are trying to avoid prescription drugs or the over-the-counter
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan put it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't seem to be a society that likes a lot of pills,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And functional foods are supposed to taste better than pills.
Viactiv ``candy'' delivers the same benefits as calcium tablets.
One chocolate or mochachino candy chew provides half of the
recommended daily intake of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   At the Institute for Preventative Medicine at Houston's
Methodist Hospital, medical director Dr. Peter H. Jones recommends
that patients use margarine substitutes and salad dressings that
actually reduce cholesterol. The brands are Benecol (made by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson) and Take Control (made by Lipton). Both can be
found in grocery stores here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (begin optional trim) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jones not only recommends Benecol products, he's a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salad dressing clearly tastes better than the no-fat
alternatives, and the Benecol margarine tastes great as well,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (end optional trim) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Using these products regularly can lower LDL cholesterol (the
bad cholesterol) by 10 percent to 15 percent, ``which is pretty
good, considering it's a natural substance,'' said Jones, a
physician and associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The key ingredient in Benecol is an extract from pine trees. In
Take Control, it comes from soybeans. Scientific evidence indicates
that Benecol and Take Control work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those contain ingredients that have been tested for 40 or 50
years,'' said David Schardt, associate nutritionist for the Center
for Science in the Public Interest. ``There's a lot of research in
them. They may be beneficial for people, depending on their
(health) situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and colleagues at Baylor conducted a study in 1998 and
1999 that found a 12-percent reduction in participants' LDL
cholesterol levels after using Benecol spread instead of corn-oil
margarine. All of the subjects had high cholesterol levels but no
other health problems and adhered to a low-fat diet.
</P>
<P>
   As margarine substitutes, Benecol and Take Control seem to pass
the taste test, but two problems are hard to miss.
</P>
<P>
   One is price. They cost four to six times more per ounce than
light margarine. Take Control costs as much as $3.99 for 10 ounces.
Benecol costs $4.99 for 8 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is serving size. To lower cholesterol, a
person must consume at least 2 tablespoons per day _ more than
twice the average amount of margarine an American eats daily,
according to the National Association of Margarine Manufacturers.
And they should spread it out to eat it three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the issue a lot of my patients ask is, `Gee whiz, I
don't think I'll do it three times a day, every day,''' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Is the product still worthwhile? ``I think the answer is yes,''
he said. ``Because if you're going to use this instead of butter or
margarine, you're adding something useful and taking away something
detrimental.''
</P>
<P>
   If patients reach for Benecol or Take Control instead of
margarine, Jones said, they'll be eating healthier, even if it's
only once a day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (begin optional trim) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Quan saw his cholesterol level drop from 320 to 260 after
two months of eating Benecol. Quan, a 36-year-old resident of the
Dallas suburb of Rowlett, started eating Benecol as part of a study
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't much of a butter person,'' he said. ``I'm now in the
habit of eating wheat toast every morning. I spread it on there.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes his daily three servings of Benecol on two slices of
wheat toast. Quan, who has used Benecol now for more than a year,
said his cholesterol level now is about 230.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (end optional trim) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some view Benecol more cautiously. Dr. James M. Wilson, a
physician at the Texas Heart Institute, emphasized that Benecol is
a high-fat food _ something he would prefer that his
high-cholesterol patients avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Three servings of Benecol contain 27 grams of fat. That's 42
percent of the recommended daily fat intake in a 2,000-calorie
diet. (Take Control suggests eating two serving per day with a
total of 12 grams of fat.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no long-term data that shows that it makes anybody any
healthier or lowers heart attacks,'' said Wilson, a clinical
researcher and assistant professor with Baylor College of Medicine.
``It is a logical conclusion, but there's no proof. Once it can be
proved, I'll recommend it, but right now, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions also linger about Benecol's marketability. Benecol and
competitor Take Control each started with a common goal: Build a
better butter substitute, and hope the $1.2 billion margarine
market beat a path to their door. The American Heart Association
says that 40 million American adults (roughly 1 in 5) have high
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol and Take Control launched last year with fanfare from
publicity campaigns. Benecol came from Finland, where it reportedly
sold so fast stores couldn't keep it on their shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In their first year in the United States, Benecol and Take
Control accounted for a combined 4.5 percent of total sales of
margarines, spreads and butter blends, according to Information
Resources, Inc., a market research firm. Neither was close to
becoming one of the Top 10-selling brands.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies also introduced cholesterol-lowering salad
dressings. Slow sales have resulted in the dressings being ``phased
out,'' meaning they might still be available in stores, but they
aren't being manufactured any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol snack bars also have been phased out. Benecol cream
cheeses and yogurt, available in England and Ireland, haven't been
introduced here.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the first functional foods to meet resistance.
Kellogg's withdrew its Ensemble line last year because of weak
sales. Ensemble products included breakfast cereals and frozen
entrees, all containing soluble fiber from the grain psyllium,
which also reduces cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   The problem may be that functional foods sound too good to be
true, said Robert L. Heath, professor of communications at the
University of Houston. Heath has researched corporate communication
strategies, including how organizations communicate with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   People are becoming more suspicious of ads for ``healthy''
foods, Heath said, especially since the debate over genetically
modified crops. Opponents of so-called ``Frankenstein foods''
believe that tampering with nature carries dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Heath said, people tend to worry about long-term
side effects and avoid new, unproven products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to be incredibly complicated,'' Heath said.
``It's almost like we're asked to be quasi-medical types and
quasi-pharmacist types. So what do we do? We're very skeptical
about product advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the skepticism is justified, said nutritionist Schardt,
because not all functional foods are backed by years of research.
Messages on product labels also can be suspect. If a label says
``fights heart disease,'' the product's health claim must be
approved by the FDA. If a label says ``maintains a healthy heart,''
no FDA approval is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Bencol and Take Control declined to talk about
future functional-food products from their companies, citing a need
to protect that information from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Food trends researcher Sloan has some guesses. The diet market
is as big as it's ever been, she said, and companies will try to
sell other foods that can lower cholesterol or help people lose
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan predicted the children's market will be big as companies
search for ways to make medicine and nutrition taste better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making lollipops that aid sore throats,'' she said.
``It's happening with fun foods. (Kids) don't want to go out and
eat soy milk; they want something familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan also said that foods will be developed to replace
over-the-counter products. She pointed to Europe, where people can
buy yogurt that does the job of an antacid.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, scientists at the Boyce Thompson Institute
for Plant Research at Cornell University are working on ways to
deliver vaccines by putting them in foods like potatoes and
bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge remains: Does health food have to taste so
healthy? Big companies hope the answer will be no. Instead of a
spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down, maybe a spoonful of
yogurt contains all the medicine people need.

&HT;     GM HAS HIGH HOPES FOR `UGLY' AZTEK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some love it, some hate it.
</P>
<P>
   But General Motors is betting that those who love the design of
the new Pontiac Aztek will make the car a hit, something that GM
really needs after going out on a limb to build a vehicle that some
critics have called ``just plain ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aztek, which is based on the chassis of the Montana minivan
but looks more like a small wagon or hatchback, is aimed at young
people with active lifestyles who like the great outdoors. Pontiac
calls it a sport-recreation vehicle; the fusion of ``the driving
excitement of a sport sedan, the rugged capability of a
sport-utility vehicle, and the people/cargo flexibility of a van.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Aztek is specifically designed for
outdoor activities, and even comes with an optional camping
package: a tent that attaches to the rear hatch and a mattress that
fits into the cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac unveiled the Aztek at the North American International
Auto Show in Detroit in January with a stage presentation that
included black-clad ninjas rappelling onto the stage from high
above, and a horde of young people oohing and aahing over the cars.
</P>
<P>
   It went on sale in mid-July as a 2001 model, and in some areas,
sales have been steady if not brisk, Pontiac dealers say.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the vehicles were shipped to dealers in Texas and
the Southwest, as well as in California, which are expected to be
among the hottest markets for such a car.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nissan made a big splash with the introduction of the
Xterra sport-utility, also aimed at a 20- or 30-something age group
with active lifestyles, and one of its most popular options was a
first-aid kit built into the rear hatch. The Aztek's built-in
camping gear just seems to take that theme a lot farther, adding
functionality to a vehicle to make it into something different,
something special.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen had its popular bus camper package in the '70s and
'80s, but the Aztek has better styling and performance for today's
active generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztek comes with a 185-horsepower, 3.4-liter V-6 engine and
four-speed automatic transmission. An all-wheel-drive system is
optional.
</P>
<P>
   In fuel economy, Aztek is expected to top practically every
six-cylinder SUV on the market. And its 26 miles per gallon highway
fuel economy equals that of the four-cylinder, 150-horsepower PT
Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Though young people are its target, there are others interested
in the car, dealers say. In Mesa, Ariz., a woman in her 70s bought
an Aztek with the camping package, and even in San Antonio, older
couples with motor homes are looking at the Aztek as a vehicle to
tow, dealers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling ours at $500 off sticker,'' said Mike Hennigan,
the sales manager at Gunn Pontiac in San Antonio. He said the
dealership has fixed prices on all of its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A fully equipped model runs about $25,000, while the base prices
for the Aztek begin at $21,995 plus $550 transportation.

   JETTA WAGON DUE EARLY IN 20001
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen will begin selling a wagon version of its popular
Jetta compact in North America in February or March as a 2001
model, and it will be similar in design to the VW Bora Variant
small wagon now on sale in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta wagon will help dealers satisfy customers who need a
more versatile vehicle than a sedan or hatchback. VW doesn't have a
sport-utility or a minivan, which puts dealers at a disadvantage in
today's SUV- and minivan-crazy market. Volkswagen does offer the
larger Passat wagon and the Eurovan, a mid-size, front-engine van.
But prices for the van begin at just over $30,000 and sales have
been sparse. And prices of a fully equipped Passat wagon are near
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta wagon will give consumers a lower-priced alternative.
Jetta sedan prices begin under $17,000. VW says the Jetta wagon
would cost about $500 more than a Jetta sedan, which is the
company's most-popular car in the U.S. market.

   VOLVO S80 GETS HIGH CRASH RATING
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has modified the air-bag system on its flagship S80 so the
2001 models of the sedan were able to earn the top crash-safety
rating and be designated a ``best pick'' by the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The institute earlier had dinged the S80 on its safety ratings
because air bags in test vehicles had deployed at speeds of 5 mph
during a simple bumper test, even though the car had done very well
on the higher-speed concrete-barrier crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the institute's safety ratings are primarily based on
the 40-mph barrier test, the ``best pick'' designation was withheld
from the S80 because of the low-speed air-bag deployments. The
institute said deployment of the air bags would cause about $4,000
damage to the vehicle. In addition, there have been reports of
deaths or serious injuries to children or small adults in some cars
that had inadvertent air-bag deployment at low speeds (although not
specifically in the S80).
</P>
<P>
   There also were concerns about the high temperature of the air
bag gas as it escaped near the hands of the dummy in the 40-mph
test. Volvo has redesigned the air-bag system to address those
concerns, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, funded by the auto insurance industry, operates a
state-of-the-art crash-test facility near Charlottesville, Va.

 &HT;    CASA GRANDE'S DIRTY SECRET(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By EDYTHE JENSEN(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Casa Grande, Ariz.) - A racially charged prank by two Casa
Grande police officers has exposed a history of bizarre practical
jokes, police misconduct and racial tensions in this rural
community south of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Two Casa Grande officers who were punished for impersonating
Blacks and Hispanics while making prank calls to their own
department were told Wednesday night by the city personnel board
that they would learn before the end of the month whether the
disciplinary action taken against them would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Galen Flynn and Chris Western's 10-day suspensions and pay
reductions were unfair, attorney Armand Salese said, because the
department has for years condoned officer-initiated crank calls,
racial slurs and even illegal conduct - some of it aimed against
racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all cases of police misconduct in Casa Grande are racists;
some are just bad,'' Salese noted.
</P>
<P>
   He then cited reports of police brutality against a restrained
suspect, allegations that an officer solicited sex from a homeless
person, an officer's felony misuse of confidential police records
to investigate his daughter's boyfriend, and a prank during which
an officer set off a firecracker to make another policeman believe
a gun had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Robert Huddleston said the incidents cited by
Salese happened over a 20-year-period. The officer was disciplined
for records misuse, the sex allegation was deemed unfounded and the
other two accusations were not reported to supervisors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel hearing at Casa Grande City Hall was opened to the
public Tuesday and Wednesday at the two officers' request and
attracted more than 100 spectators, some of whom said recordings of
the prank brought to light years of police harassment of minority
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tapes make me sick to my stomach,'' Casa Grande native
Rose Gibson said. ``But Black people here have known this has been
going on for a long time; it's really coming out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In one tape, Flynn and Western summon officers to a home by
pretending to be one of the occupants and speaking in an
exaggerated Black dialect. Huddleston said the two officers were
punished for endangering residents and other police officers with a
false call.
</P>
<P>
   Salese called the pair's prank ``a stupid-human trick'' in an
atmosphere where that kind of behavior was encouraged. He played a
tape of another Casa Grande officer mimicking a Black man as he
called for a female officer to help him change a child's diaper.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who made that call to his own department is Rudy
Reyes, son of Pinal County Sheriff Frank Reyes. Salese said the
tape has been played for years at police briefings and parties for
laughs, leading officers to believe it was acceptable to ridicule
minorities in fake calls to the department.
</P>
<P>
   Huddleston said he first heard it two years ago and laughed at
it; no disciplinary action was taken against Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud to talk about any of this,'' Huddleston said of
the Reyes incident. He said Reyes went out of his way not to give
an address, and his call did not endanger residents or other
officers - a key difference between Reyes' action and that of Flynn
and Western.
</P>
<P>
   The chief said Reyes' tape is not an example of police racism
because the comments were not made in public and were not directed
at minority residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultural sensitivity is a big issue, and I would be foolish to
say it's not an issue in this department. It's probably something
we need to improve,'' Huddleston said.
</P>
<P>
   By appealing their punishment in public, Flynn and Western are
trying ``to embarrass the department, the city and our officers in
order to get concessions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unfair,'' Huddleston added.
</P>
<P>
   Huddleston said he is now working on changes in departmental
conduct guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Salese said an undercurrent of racism in the department needs to
be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some supervisors have permitted a racist attitude in the
department, and that sends a negative message about Blacks in the
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salese is hopeful that Flynn and Western's appeal will bring
change to department practices.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Grande employs 55 sworn police officers; two are Black,
Huddleston said.
</P>
<P>
   Called to support the two officers' contention that other
misconduct goes unpunished, Casa Grande Police Sgt. Dennis Mercer
said that it was a common practice among Casa Grande officers to
make prank phone calls, and that supervisors knew about them.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by City Attorney Kay Bigelow, Mercer
acknowledged that he had been the subject of police brutality
complaints and that some were determined to be founded.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow also brought out the fact that Western and Flynn had a
history of disciplinary problems. Both had been reprimanded for
leaving a narcotics training class in Scottsdale early and going to
a topless bar. Flynn was disciplined for leaving a department
machine gun in his open garage, from which it was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Western was reprimanded for pursuing a suspect in a high-speed
car chase through a residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Records also show the pair are the only two officers in
department history to receive medals of valor. The two ran into a
burning building to save a resident.

TWO THONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sat., Aug. 12.) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Reality TV'' reaches its sexual peak with ``G-String Divas,''
HBO's latest wallow in ``adult'' prurience. Produced and directed
by Patti Kaplan, the brain _ if that's the overriding organ at work
_ behind HBO's ``Real Sex,'' ``G-String Divas'' documents the lives
of strippers at a Pennsylvania ``men's'' club.
</P>
<P>
   The ``documentary'' series, which runs in 13 episodes, looks at
the lives, the souls, but mainly the anatomy _ explored in
near-clinical detail _ of women who are pneumatically enhanced,
both between their shoulders and between their ears. We're given
endless tours of this club's ``Champagne Court,'' where the women
drag johns _ er, admirers _ for lap dances that are hardly confined
to the lap. Booze is charged by the half-hour there, and it's not
cheap _ $60 _ and the dancers go for three or four times that. But
they work hard for the money.
</P>
<P>
   In two screened episodes, one of which airs tonight and the
other on Sept. 2, we meet Ginger and Chrissy, women who are both
straightforwardly honest about their work and yet guileless about
how manipulative they truly are.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger is a barracuda of a performer with a Villanova diploma
and an acute sense of what it takes to coerce a man into coughing
up some serious money into her purse. ``Give me a little present,''
she bosses Carl, the most pathetic man to grace a TV screen since
``Big Brother's'' Ian O'Malley, and certainly the most deluded _ he
discusses his relationship with Ginger by suggesting, utterly
misguidedly, love might be in the air. ``I was really appreciating
the money he was giving me and he was thinking I was taking
advantage of him,'' Ginger grouses after someone else estimates
Carl has dropped a cool $800 on her in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissy, on the other hand, is in a lesbian relationship, which
neither adds to nor detracts from her ability to arouse her male
clientele. She even recruits another dancer to perform a lap dance
for her girlfriend, who edits a feminist newspaper, and says the
dance ``felt like a massage on my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you get to see it? Indeed you do. But be warned: Chrissy's
gal has dumped her by that episode's end, so maybe it wasn't that
great after all.
</P>
<P>
   Of her job, Chrissy enthuses, ``It's almost like a real
office,'' as she wears nothing but a black bra and panties. She
also disingenuously insists that her clients are more interested in
just chatting in the Champagne Court than anything else _ real
therapists don't even cost that much (nor, in many cases, do
hookers), but they don't come with a bottomless glass of booze,
either _ but alas, the show doesn't devote its energies to covering
that aspect of her job as assiduously as it does the main part of
her job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``G-String Divas'' is fascinating in that train-wreck kind of
way, but here's the question: Would anyone care what these women
have to say were their observations not interspersed with footage
of their nether-regions being thrust into guys' faces? (Here's the
answer: Get serious.) If it's a shot of the women chattering while
driving their car, it's a sure sign you can feel free to zone out
momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, when the gals aren't jabbering, the show is at least
incredibly true to what it's about, with plenty of in-your-face
anatomy _ none of that endlessly tedious titillation with no
follow-through that ``Big Brother'' continues to foist upon
viewers. (And, hey, wasn't it a little creepy when ``Big Brother''
tried to squeeze a dance out of Jordan before she got bounced? As
reported, Jordan's ouster was a fait accompli as soon as she was
``marked for banishment,'' so BB clearly realized that it was now
or never in terms of eking out one last little humiliation from
America's favorite exotic dancer.)
</P>
<P>
   The women come off fairly sympathetically here, even if there
are classier jobs available. But you really have to wonder what if
anything was going on in the minds of the guys on hand here, who
allowed themselves to be depicted _ before television cameras
clearly in operation _ as abject losers who have to pay strippers
for a little female attention. What are their friends going to tell
them? _ ``No, dude, honest, you only looked kinda pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it all feels a little manufactured to me _ it's a nice,
justice-is-served myth that these women enjoy wielding their power
over men, but for many women, it's a myth all the same. I lived
next door to a stripper back in the '80s, and it was nothing like
TV; her fingernails, for example, over which she pasted chunks of
exotic red plastic, were gnawed to their nubs.
</P>
<P>
   She would complain to me bitterly of her objectification at the
club, and how hard it was to both dance and pretend to enjoy it,
which her bosses were always on her about _ a complaint that seems
to bother none of the women on this series a whit. She groused in
particular that the married club owner had given her roommate _
whom, by the way, he was dating _ the cushy and, relatively
speaking, far more lucrative and far less immodest job of waitress.
</P>
<P>
   This melodrama went on for a few weeks; her roomie even drove
their boss's Porsche home until his wife found out and the waitress
rebelled against his dumping her. Then, the next morning, the
neighborhood awoke to find said Porsche uselessly up on blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a scene like that on ``G-String Divas'' and I'll start
believing.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     MAZDA PAYS `TRIBUTE' TO SUV CRAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, Mazda officials counted themselves among the
small group of people predicting the impending end of the
sport-utility-vehicle craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SUV is just a fad,'' these people have been saying for the
past couple of years. They insist that the runaway popularity of
sport-utilities soon will be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   These vehicles, they believe, will return to their former niche
status or even eventually be relegated to the annals of automotive
history along with the big station wagons of the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, they say, will soon tire of these car-truck hybrids
that now appear in almost every suburban driveway and will again
embrace the traditional family sedan as the most practical choice
for everyday needs.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Mazda had a sport-utility to put on its
dealers' lots.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Navajo, which was a two-door version of the Ford
Explorer that Mazda sold in the mid-90s, the only truck product the
company has offered is the MPV minivan.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Mazda finally has a sport-utility of its own, the
compact 2001 Tribute.
</P>
<P>
   And with that comes the prediction from Mazda that the SUV is
here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that those most likely to proclaim the impending
doom of the sport-utility are automakers who haven't yet jumped on
the bandwagon, Steve Odell, vice president of marketing and sales
for Mazda North American Operations, said the Tribute and Mazda's
all-new 2000 MPV minivan are expected to fuel a 10 percent annual
increase in Mazda's North American sales over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 48 SUV models on the market now, and there will be
63 within the next couple of years,'' Odell said last week as the
automaker rolled out the Tribute, which goes on sale this month at
U.S. dealerships. ``There is no sign of a slowdown in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tribute has some heady competition, however. And it's not
just from Mazda's usual Japanese competitors, Toyota and Honda _
both of whom have small sport-utilities, the Toyota RAV4 and the
Honda CR-V, already well entrenched in the U.S. marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co., which owns controlling interest in Mazda, has
its own new compact SUV this summer _ the Escape _ and it is a
virtual clone of the Tribute (or vice versa).
</P>
<P>
   The two companies collaborated on the vehicles, which are the
same underneath, but which have slightly different external styling
and different options packages.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Tributes destined for the U.S. market will
be built on the same assembly line with the Ford Escape in Kansas
City, Mazda is building Tributes in Japan for its home market as
well as for other worldwide markets, including Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, Mazda hopes to differentiate the Tribute from
the Escape _ and other competitors as well _ by focusing on its
unique styling and Mazda's brand image, which emphasizes fun and
sportiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape, therefore, is for average folks who want just
another sport-utility, while the Tribute is for people who might
rather have a Miata sports car, but who need the practicality of an
SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Introduction of the Tribute coincides with a new national ad
campaign designed to help Mazda build on that sporty image.
</P>
<P>
   With a recurrent theme using the words ``zoom, zoom,'' Mazda
will attempt to strengthen its position as the sporty, fun import
brand, a continuation of the company's long-running ``Get in, be
moved'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribute could benefit the most from this push, with TV ads
such as one that shows the new SUV in the middle of a pack of Mazda
sports cars, with the question being asked: ``What would happen if
an SUV were raised by a family of sports cars? Zoom, zoom.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``zoom'' theme doesn't signify speed as much as it means a
car that embodies amusement, Odell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the Tribute is a Japanese import, and that's good,'' he
said. ``But it's almost got a twinkle in its eye. It doesn't
conform to other Japanese imports.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's own research with consumer focus groups showed that the
Tribute was perceived ``to have a sportier feel in the way it
drives'' than the Escape, Odell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has SUV capability with sophisticated, refined style like
an RX7 or Miata,'' he said. The RX7, which isn't sold in the United
States now, is Mazda's rotary-engine sports car that dates to the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, Tribute is going to appeal to compact-SUV buyers
who want an import rather than a domestic model _ people who still
don't trust U.S. automakers to build quality, dependable products.
Those who don't automatically gravitate toward imports, or who
insist on ``buying American,'' probably will choose the Ford model.
</P>
<P>
   But even up against the Japanese competition, the Tribute should
easily score lots of conquests _ if consumers give it a close
enough look.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from a base of $17,005 for an entry-level
two-wheel-drive DX model with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and
manual transmission to $23,025 for the top-of-the-line ES
four-wheel-drive version with a 3.0-liter V-6 and automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   A fully equipped high-end model will top out at about $25,000.
That's a bargain when compared with high-end models of popular
midsize SUVs such as the Ford Explorer, which can run more than
$36,000.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the Tribute right in the game with the CR-V, RAV4,
Jeep Cherokee, Isuzu Rodeo, Nissan Xterra, Hyundai Santa Fe and
Suzuki Grand Vitara/Chevrolet Tracker.
</P>
<P>
   But the best-selling imports from Honda and Toyota don't even
offer a V-6 option; they come only with four-cylinder engines.
Mazda predicts that 80 percent of its Tribute sales will beV-6
models, because American consumers are hungry for the extra power.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Tribute's engines come from Ford. The four-cylinder
cranks out 130 horsepower and 135 foot-pounds of torque, which is
about par for the mini-SUV class, while the V-6 turns out 200
horsepower and 200 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual transmission, available only with the
four-cylinder engine, is made by Mazda, while the four-speed
automatic _ optional with the four cylinder and standard with the
V-6 _ is a Ford product.
</P>
<P>
   That extra power from the V-6, plus the Tribute's ample
dimensions, push it up into the compact class with the Rodeo,
Xterra and Cherokee, rather than the mini-SUV group that includes
the RAV4, Vitara/Tracker, CR-V and the Kia Sportage. (The Vitara
and Tracker are the only ones in that group that have an available
V-6 engine, but their interior dimensions keep them in the mini-SUV
class.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Tribute is six inches longer than the Jeep Cherokee
and has more front and rear leg room than the $35,000-plus Lexus RX
300. It seats five full-size adults in comfort, and a
four-by-eight-foot piece of plywood will fit through the rear
liftglass.
</P>
<P>
   To help maximize interior space, the Tribute's
automatic-transmission shifter is on the steering column instead of
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The engines are transverse mounted to accommodate the Tribute's
normal driving mode, which is front-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The optional four-wheel-drive system works automatically to send
up to 50 percent of the power to the rear wheels if the front
wheels begin to lose traction. A dash-mounted switch allows the
driver to lock the vehicle into four-wheel drive for special
situations, such as mud, sand or snow driving.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the viscous couplings that most others in this class
have, the Tribute's four-wheel-drive operates from a specially
designed mechanical ``rotary blade'' coupling.
</P>
<P>
   With the V-6 engine and towing package (which includes hitch and
heavy-duty oil cooler), the Tribute can tow trailers of up to 3,500
pounds. That's enough capacity to pull a trailer carrying two
personal watercraft, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda expects to sell at least 35,000 of the Tribute in the
United States annually, not an overly ambitious goal considering
that Honda sells 120,000 CR-Vs, all with just four-cylinder
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our vehicle looks nicer, too,'' said Gary Roudebush,
Mazda's assistant program manager for the Tribute.

 ANGELES-2ND   TAKE-BOS  
 LOS ANGELES: ... pleasantly routine.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out here, where the big beasts of entertainment and media
converge, where the city is a 24-hour continous newsreel, image is
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Deculus-Johnson is the proprietor of ``Sable Images'' on
Crenshaw Boulevard. Her store sits in the heart of a black
community. She deals in memorabilia that show blacks in an often
brutish and stereotypical light. The words ``Nigger'' ``Coon''
``Slave Auction'' ``Pickanninny'' fly out from posters. There are
stomach-churning photographs of blacks bent over in laughter in the
face of pending disaster. It's the kind of store that Walter
Mosley's fictional Los Angeles detective, Easy Rawlins, might
stumble into and raise an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   But Deculus-Johnson, who has lived here all her life, sees an
analogy between the way ugly images of blacks threaded their way
into the nation's psyche and the way stereotype warps the way many
see the city. ``All those negative black images I relate to some of
the same negative media images about LA. Obviously San Francisco is
stereotyped as a gay city with interracial couples. As for LA _
it's gangs and police. It's a result of what the media is showing
people.'' And, she goes on, ``There's also the images of people
being plastic, not friendly. If you have that prejudgment, that's
what you'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   She says folk ask her if it is safe being on Crenshaw Boulevard.
``I'm in the heart of Crenshaw and I feel fine. A German man came
in to me and said, `What's the relation between blacks and whites?'
And he had heard that Crenshaw was the bad street. Well, I asked
him, `What's the relationship in Germany between Jews and Germans?'
''
</P>
<P>
   She went to Atlanta once and the city left her feeling odd;
somehow the social divisions between races seemed more absolute.
``Back there, they don't want you living next door. Here, they
don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Deculus-Johnson thinks the world of LA. To her, outsiders just
don't get the place. ``I'm really suspect about people writing
about cities and projecting the negatives,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, outside LA, that the Crips and Bloods _ two gangs
here that were notorious for bloodletting in the early '90s _ have
had a kind of truce in recent years, that there's been a dramatic
decrease in gang-related deaths?
</P>
<P>
   Bervick Deculus is Gail Deculus-Johnson's son. He's 23 years
old. A decade ago, when Bervick was a teenager, she worried herself
sick about the gangs. Bervick was lucky: He got home every night
just fine. His mother would hear the key and feel her chest lift up
like a flower: her boy was safe. Bervick graduated from Howard
University last year. He has also studied film at USC.
</P>
<P>
   Bervick Deculus says the enticements of this city _ endless
nightclubs, endless dating, the dangers that lurk in those velvety
night drives along Sunset Boulevard, the money that seems to be
everywhere, just out of reach _ have not derailed him. ``I kind of
look at LA like: LA can make love to you, or LA can break you. But
it's truly based on the path you take in making yourself successful
in this city. It's about how disciplined you are, and how hungry
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here, images ricochet back at you from the TV screen.
Bervick knows. ``I look at TV shows, all the negativities. I see
through it. We have kids without a support system. Yes, I had
friends who were gangbangers. I was growing up in the middle of it.
I had gangbanger friends but also friends who were, well, geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be a film director. He goes around with a digital
camera. He has an idea for a film about parolees who get released,
make a small mistake, and land back behind bars. People like his
friend Cornelius, who got out last year after doing prison time. He
got a job, but was caught outside Los Angeles County, doing yard
work, a parolee out of his work-allowed jurisdiction. He was sent
back to prison and never recovered. His spirit, already as fragile
as a baby bird, was broken. Drugs filled the void.
</P>
<P>
   Bervick imagines either a short film or a documentary, but he
worries about finding a patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nepotism is heavy in the industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Many of those who can afford it have moved outside of Los
Angeles. It's the traffic, the human congestion, the scary feeling
that occasionally wells up. But Peggy Grossman won't be joining the
exodus. ``I live on the westside, which is so much different,
safer,'' she is saying, standing in the yard of property she owns
in an area populated by white Angelenos. ``Most of the time I feel
like I live in a bubble. I don't listen to the news in the morning
because I'd be so paranoid I wouldn't leave the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Grossman, 56, can talk and sound calm as a demographer.
She's talking about the Fairfax Avenue area, how it has changed.
``It used to be our bagel belt, but a lot of it has been taken over
by blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   But she knows it can be a dazzling city. ``One of the reasons
I've stayed here is I like what the city has to offer. Performing
arts, the proximity to the ocean, the weather,'' she offers,
brightening. But then in the next breath: ``If you're not scared to
death to go out of the house because you're going to get hit in the
head with a bullet, it's a great place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to Grossman, the city remains complex. ``I think there are
many souls of LA,'' she says. ``I don't know if we have one soul.
We're so much more hetereogenous than we used to be. I went to a
white elementary school, a white junior high school. In those days
the gardeners were Japanese. The help was black or Mexican. It's
such a different world now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Spanish who founded the Los Angeles area in 1781. The
United States took it in 1846. The Mexican soul in this city is
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the city's Hispanics reside in East Los Angeles. Bria
Carrasco was born in Mexico and came to Los Angeles with her family
when she was a child. She's proud of her heritage, but senses
success lies with another group. ``I just want to be like them, the
whites,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   On a calm afternoon, her neighborhood can seem safe, still as a
lake. ``But you should come here at night,'' Bria says. ``Go in the
apartments and you'll see the bald-headed gangsters. There's a lot
of violence here.''
</P>
<P>
   She's sweet 16, soon to be a senior in high school. Bria
Carrasco has a dream. It is not to get to Hollywood. Or to the
westside of LA. Or to some distant place called New York City. No.
She wants to draw a line in the sand between justice and injustice,
right here, in East LA. ``It's where people need more help,'' she
says. ``It's the ghetto over here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a sad reality in her voice, but indomitability, too.
Bria Carrasco wants a badge. LAPD. Never mind the headlines. She
wants to handcuff gangsters. Bring them to their knees. ``I want to
be a police officer,'' she says, standing in a pool of beautiful
and wondrous sunshine.

&HT;     ONCE-STAID IMPALA GETS A SPORTIER MAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Impala is back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet reintroduced the Impala nameplate for model year 2000
in a modified and extended version of the midsize Lumina sedan that
is roomy enough to be classified as a full-size car by EPA
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Impala isn't anything like its predecessors: It's
not a huge boat and it doesn't have rear-wheel drive, a V-8 engine
or a four-on-the-floor transmission.
</P>
<P>
   What it offers is a favorite nameplate from the childhoods of
today's aging baby-boomers, in a modern, front-wheel-drive package
that incorporates engineering features of the best-selling Japanese
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's just about the only formula that makes sense
for today's automotive marketplace, in which Toyota and Honda
sedans rule.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy tried selling big cars well into the '90s with the
Caprice, the upside-down bathtub that, although it was a fine
automobile, was soundly snubbed by boomers. The big Caprices ended
up primarily in police and taxi fleets; the few that were sold to
consumers primarily went to golden-agers who refused to cram
themselves into today's smaller, sleeker cars.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1958 on an up-level coupe and convertible variant
of the Bel Air, then in 1959 on a sedan and wagon, the Impala name
was last used on a souped-up SS version of the Caprice that ran for
three model years _ 1994-96 _ and was produced in Texas at the
Arlington plant. Production of these Impalas was limited and they
already have become something of a collector's item.
</P>
<P>
   Impala purists _ especially those who liked the Super Sport
models of the '60s _ won't be excited by the new model, but the
2000 Impala does give Chevrolet a family sedan that can compete
well against the popular Ford Taurus and even, perhaps, the Toyota
Camry and Honda Accord. The somewhat plain-looking Lumina has never
been a major player in the midsize segment, so Chevrolet
desperately needs the Impala to make some headway against these
formidable competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 model, which goes on sale this fall, is identical to
the 2000 model except that some new colors have been added, and the
General Motors OnStar live navigation and information system has
been included as standard equipment on the up-level LS model. That
system, which allows the driver to talk with an OnStar operator 24
hours a day, seven days a week, uses GPS satellites to tell the
operator exactly where the car is. The system will be optional on
base models.
</P>
<P>
   Also for 2001, Chevrolet is selling a police version of the
Impala _ GM's first police car since the Caprice went away (and the
first police vehicle since an attempt a couple of years ago to sell
Tahoe sport-utilities with a police package). It remains to be seen
as to whether the Impala will catch on as a cop car, considering
that it has only a V-6 and front-wheel drive, compared with the V-8
and rear-wheel drive in the competing Ford Crown Victoria police
car.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 122 cubic feet of interior space, the Impala is
roomier than any of its midsize competition. Along with all of that
space, it brings a combination of styling, performance and value
that today's new-car buyers crave.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not exactly an exciting car _ the kind that inspires
Beach Boys songs like ``409,'' which glamorized the 409-cubic-inch
engine in the first Impala Super Sport. But it's a car that will
give families the option of a sedan that can carry as many people
and nearly as much stuff as a midsize sport-utility, yet maintain
good handling, sporty looks and much better fuel economy than an
SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Overall length is almost 200 inches _ an inch shorter than the
Lumina. But the wheelbase is three inches longer, and very
efficient use of space has created a roomier interior than that of
the Lumina.
</P>
<P>
   With a bench seat up front, the new Impala seats six adults
rather comfortably, but its turning radius is the same as that of
the smaller Taurus. The trunk is huge _ 17.6 cubic feet (vs. 15.5
cubic feet for the Lumina and 15.8 for the Taurus). The interior is
as roomy as that of the larger Buick Park Avenue, except that the
Park Avenue has slightly more rear-seat leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling is more reminiscent of the Chevy Malibu of the
early '70s than the early Impalas. Still, there are some design
cues taken from the Impalas of the past, including the round tail
lights, chrome center bar and Chevy bow tie emblem in the grill, as
well as the muscular exterior lines.
</P>
<P>
   Value is stressed by Chevrolet in all of its literature about
the Impala.
</P>
<P>
   This is a full-size car that carries a base price under $20,000
_ fairly well-equipped.
</P>
<P>
   For a list price of $19,265 (including transportation), the base
Impala comes with a 3.4-liter, 180- horsepower V-6 engine (the same
one used in the Venture minivan), four-speed automatic
transmission, power windows and door locks, six-passenger seating,
air-conditioning, power steering, cruise control, four-wheel power
disc brakes, and an AM/FM radio. The LS model lists for $22,365
plus $560 transportation
</P>
<P>
   For $22,925, the up-level LS model _ our test car _ comes with a
bigger engine, the 3.8-liter, 200-horsepower V-6 also used in the
Park Avenue, as well as traction control, antilock brakes,
dual-zone temperature controls, a side air bag for the driver,
bucket seats up front (with power adjustments for the driver's
side), and a firmer ``touring'' suspension that helps the vehicle
hold the road better during cornering.
</P>
<P>
   The interior isn't as luxurious as those of some competitors,
and the instrument-panel materials are rather plain. But Chevy had
to cut corners somewhere to keep the price down, and this was the
most likely place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cabin is very quiet at highway speeds, the seats are
as comfortable as any in this class, if not more so, and the ride
in our LS was cushy, but not overly so.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't tested the base model, but the 180-horsepower engine
should provide plenty of power for most people's needs. The bigger
engine in our LS is quite a capable performer, however, adding some
measure of excitement to the driving experience. The transmission
shifts smoothly and almost seamlessly, and with the touring
suspension, the Impala LS corners much better than most of its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is impressive, and will be one of the top selling
points for the Impala. The base engine is EPA rated at 20 miles per
gallon in the city and 32 on the highway. The bigger engine is
rated at 20 mpg city/29 highway. The average sport-utility vehicle
has fuel economy ranging from about 14 to 18 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment on our LS model included the Passlock
theft-deterrent system, daytime running lights, 16-inch aluminum
wheels, power trunk opener, variable intermittent wipers, fog
lamps, rear spoiler, body side moldings, tilt steering wheel,
remote keyless entry, heated electrically remote-controlled outside
mirrors, rear-window defogger, and split-folding rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   LS models come with cloth-trimmed front bucket seats, but ours
had the optional leather-trimmed seats ($625), which adds leather
to the front seating surfaces only. An AM/FM/cassette six-speaker
stereo is standard, but ours came with the optional audio system
with cassette and compact-disc players and eight speakers ($223).
</P>
<P>
   Other options on our test car included an electric sun roof
($700); a comfort seating package ($425), including heated front
seats and a six-way power front passenger seat; and the LS
preferred-equipment group ($517), which added an electronic
driver-information system that monitors 17 items, including tire
pressures, an alarm system, an automatic-dimming rearview mirror,
and steering-wheel radio controls.
</P>
<P>
   Total price for our fully-equipped LS test car was $25,415,
including $560 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Impala is built at Oshawa, Ontario.

FORD THE LAST OF A GOOD BREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PHILADELPHIA _ Good old Gerry Ford, hard luck Gerry Ford, left
this city under his own steam, reminding me that the doughty
ex-president keeps having these near-miss experiences at Republican
national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he came within a whisker (OK, 80-odd votes out of a
couple of thousand) of being denied the party's presidential
nomination by a rampaging Ronald Reagan. In 1980, he was within a
hair's-breadth of being named Ronald Reagan's running mate until a
late-night deal fell through in the Gipper's Detroit hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   And nine days ago, amid a grueling series of interviews on
behalf of the son of the guy who aced him out of being Reagan's No.
2 man, Ford walked his 87-year-old body into a local hospital for
treatment of a stroke. He got released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's long career was marked by a remarkable series of
accidents, coincidences, and hard-to-explain events. But he is the
last major Republican figure to personify the Old Guard of moderate
Republicanism, the remnants of the wing of the party that included
the congressional leaders of a half-century back, plus moderate
stalwarts like Christian Herter, Leverett Saltonstall, Edward
Brooke, Elliot Richardson, and Frank Sargent of Massachusetts, New
York's Nelson Rockefeller, Vermont's George Aiken.
</P>
<P>
   When weird things happened to Republicans, Ford happened to be
in the neighborhood. When Richard Nixon needed a clean-jeans
sure-to-be-confirmed replacement for the corrupt Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew _ Nixon and Agnew are nonmentionables in this
scrubbed-up Republican made-for-TV commercial of a convention _
Nixon plucked Ford from the House minority leader's office.
</P>
<P>
   When lightning struck twice, and Nixon was forced to walk the
plank of impeachment, Ford got promoted to his second job _ the
only man ever appointed both president and vice president. It was
Ford who gave George Herbert Walker Bush the diplomatically
challenging but politically irrelevant job of special
representative of the US in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   When Ford and Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state Ford
inherited from Nixon, flew to China in December of 1975, Bush was
at the tarmac to greet them upon the 2 a.m. arrival at the shabby
old airfield of the capital of the Middle Kingdom. Ford then named
Bush to head the Central Intelligence Agency, riddled by scandal
and wracked by ridicule for its Cold War excesses. After Ford
narrowly lost the '76 election to Jimmy Carter, Bush went to the
president-elect and asked to be allowed to remain on as CIA chief.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first politician ever to run CIA, and Carter rejected
his request. Bush offered to promise that he wound not run for
president against Carter, if the Democrat would let him stay on at
CIA. Carter still refused. The Washington Post said Bush was ``a
little shocked'' at Carter's refusal, and wanted to remain CIA
chief ``desperately.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Bush campaigned hard for president,
castigating Carter, who could have kept Bush out of the fray by
icing him at CIA. Bush won Iowa, but was upset in New Hampshire by
Ronald ``I'm paying for this microphone'' Reagan, who came to
Detroit as the nominee. The night he won nomination, Reagan
dickered with Ford and Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Allen, Reagan's foreign policy adviser, wrote in a
recent New York Times Magazine that Reagan was on the verge of
naming former President Ford to be his running mate. Ford and
Kissinger had come up with a scheme that these two Ford
administration vets, plus Alan Greenspan, would be a package deal
for Reagan, with specific roles and veto powers over Reagan's
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Allen claims he ``had the clearest channel to Bush and knew him
the best,'' but in the running mate derby, ``George Bush was not
really on Reagan's radar screen,'' and would be ``a hard sell.''
Allen says he contacted the Bush camp to plant the seeds of Bush as
running mate, in place of Ford. Reagan was never fond of Bush,
particularly after Bush's humiliating night in the Nashua, N.H.,
high school gym where Bush had denied Bob Dole and three other GOP
candidates the right to debate Bush and Reagan.But by the summer of
'80, Reagan needed a so-called ``moderate'' like Ford or Bush to
win.
</P>
<P>
   It was after midnight when Reagan vetoed the Ford-Kissinger
``co-presidency'' scheme. But Reagan still balked at Bush. Allen
writes: `` `I can't take him,' Reagan said of Bush. ``That `voodoo
economic policy' charge and his stand on abortion are wrong.' ''
But after being assured Bush would embrace every word of the right
wing platform, Reagan gave in.
</P>
<P>
   The Gipper drove to the convention hall to inform the delegates.
Allen: ``And so it came to pass that Ronald Reagan averted what
would have been a disaster for his candidacy and the Republican
party,'' if that cockeyed shared-presidency scheme had
materialized. Gerry Ford came that close, again.
</P>
<P>
   This year Ford came to a convention even more firmly in the grip
of the party's right wing than ever. Ford had publicly urged Bush
Jr. to choose a running mate who does not want to outlaw abortion.
But the nominee did not take Ford's advice. Instead, he picked Dick
Cheney of Wyoming, who had been Ford's chief of staff at age 36,
and is far more conservative than Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ex-president played the part of the good soldier,
making the rounds of parties and interview sites, talking up the
ticket, urging on the troops, until he was slowed and then felled
by his stroke. He remains the last link to the old GOP, the
let's-make-a-deal party.

SHOE MAKERS SEEK FOOTHOLD IN TOUGH MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Two makers of sensible shoes have new ad campaigns. One wryly
romances the clog and the chukka; the other seems poised to focus
as much on beefcake as on leather.
</P>
<P>
   Ads from the Dexter Shoe Co. of Dexter, Maine, are all shoe and
no people. A new ad from the Rockport Co. of Marlborough, Mass. is
all people and no shoe.
</P>
<P>
   In magazines, a Dexter ad shows a photo of a big shoebox.
Inside, there's a shoe and a hammock. ``Comfort in every box,''
says a headline created by Mullen of Wenham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Rockport, a division of Reebok International Ltd. of Canton,
Mass., also has a new campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A billboard ad features a photo of a young man cuddling a
woman's foot to his face. How do motorists know this isn't an ad
for a bath gel or a condom? The only tipoff is Rockport's new
modernized logo.
</P>
<P>
   Created by AG Worldwide of New York, the new campaign is about
adding a ``sensuous and emotional'' component to a brand long
associated with comfort, said Stefanie Lucas, Rockport's vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   New ads, she says, are ``about loving your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   A reader of the business pages might think these would be great
days for casual-shoe companies. The economy is booming, and dress
codes are relaxing. Wingtips and pumps are out, and what's
fashionable are brown shoes that look good with khakis.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, casual-shoe sales are barely growing, said Steve
Lunder, Dexter's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In borrowing ideas from sneakers, casual shoes have become more
durable. Partly because these shoes last longer, and partly because
consumers no longer feel the need to own a pair of shoes for every
occasion, annual sales in the casual-shoe category have been
increasing by only 1 or 2 percent, Lunder said.
</P>
<P>
   One of several shoe companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
the holding company run by investment guru Warren Buffett, Dexter
does not break out its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Employing large numbers of US workers to make many of its
products, Dexter faces pressure from rivals that rely on cheap
foreign labor. As Dexter tries to improve sales, ads look to
lionize Dexter shoes as ``icons of comfort,'' Lunder said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Edward Boches, Mullen's chief creative officer,
many rival shoe campaigns are fond of building ads around
inspirational themes. Dexter slyly spoofs that approach with ``ads
that are likable and make people smile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dexter and Rockport count middle-aged consumers as some of
their best customers. And once again, Rockport seems to be
attempting to increase disappointing sales by convincing young
folks its shoes are as trendy as they are comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   With sales off about 7 percent for the most recent quarter,
Rockport's cobblers have again taken up the tough challenge of
transforming a comfort shoe into an essential accessory for a hip
lifestyle, all while staying true to Rockport's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In wooing the young, ads consciously strive for unisex appeal.
Some previous ad campaigns, Lucas said, resonated more with men
than with women, and they failed to make an ``emotional
connection'' with the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Future ads will unveil the theme ``Don't just walk,'' and they
may exhibit more sightly young people not wearing much.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes themselves should make a cameo appearance in the next
round of ads.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking to portray its stores as a safe haven from the daily
grind, Dunkin' Donuts USA of Randolph, Mass. will introduce a new
$60 million ad campaign around Labor Day with the theme ``Loosen up
a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is being developed by Dunkin Donuts' ad agency,
Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new ads are a reflection of how our customers feel about
us and how we fit into their lives,'' Dunkin Donuts' director of
advertising, Maura Reardon, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company retired Fred the Baker as its pitchman in
1997, many Dunkin' Donuts ads have run without a tagline in recent
years, said Hill Holliday group creative director Marty Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Loosen up a little'' will be a ``rallying cry'' for the
brand, he said. It tells consumers: ``Don't take life so seriously.
Come on out and have a doughnut or a bagel.''

WEST WAS A WORTHY MODEL _ ON AND OFF THE COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not exactly privileged information that the silhouette of
a player comprising the official NBA logo is that of Jerry West, a
man who resides in the inner sanctum where only the truly great
players in NBA history can claim a spot.
</P>
<P>
   But were there an official scout's logo (a guy taking notes at a
college game?) or general manager's logo (someone making a deal
over the phone?), Jerry West could have been the most likely model
for those, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I can think of anyone with his range of
credentials,'' confirms Jan Volk, the former general manager of the
Celtics. ``There is no one else who was an extraordinary player and
also an extraordinary executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, I don't like this past tense business, the need
to say ``was,'' rather than ``is.'' Jerry West is only 62. He is
far too young, with too much more to give, to be retiring from the
Los Angeles Lakers after 40 years of consecutive service.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not any one of the next 100,000 people you might see
walking down the street. He is Jerry West. His noted teammate Elgin
Baylor once told Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Jim Murray that
Jerry needs to go to a movie seven times in order to see it,
because ``he can't sit still more than a few minutes.'' That was 35
years ago. West's restlessness grew more acute with time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was the team's general manager, he would never
accompany the Lakers east during those memorable series with the
Celtics in 1984, 1985, and 1987. Watching his team on the road in
those kind of big games was too much for his system. I begged him
to come, and I'm sure I was not the only one. I wanted Jerry West
to come to Boston in order to find out how beloved he was in this
town. He was then, and still remains, the single most revered
Celtic opponent of all time. No Celtic opponent has ever had more
fans wishing he would switch uniforms, and that includes Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noble'' doesn't begin to describe the level and style of his
performances against the Celtics in the '60s. His LA teams lost
Finals series to Boston in '62, '63, '65, '66, '68, and '69. His
scoring averages in those six series were 31, 29, 34, 35, 32, and
38. Young-uns, do I now have your attention?
</P>
<P>
   It gets better. During those six series, the Lakers won 13
games. In those victories, West's average was 38. The fewest points
he scored in victory was 26. His totals in the other 12 victorious
Laker efforts ranged from 32 to 53. And that's without even
discussing such losing efforts as 40, 42, and 45 (twice). That 42,
incidentally, was part of a triple-double (42 points, 13 rebounds,
12 assists) in Game 7 of the 1969 series.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he did this to everybody, not just the Boston
Celtics. He retired in 1974 with career averages of 27.0 points in
the regular season and 29.1 points in the playoffs. After averaging
17.6 points his rookie season, he never again fell under 20. He was
over 25 a game 11 times and over 30 four times. In the 54-year
history of the NBA, only two men have retired following seasons in
which they averaged 20 or more points. Those men are Michael Jordan
and Jerry West. Oh, and the only reason he was first-team
All-Defense only four times was that they didn't invent the award
until he was 30 and had been in the league eight years.
</P>
<P>
   It probably smacks of redundancy to point out that there is no
guard in the league today as good as Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   And now there will be no one running an NBA team on his level,
either.
</P>
<P>
   He is getting out, I can only assume, because he feels he has
enough money and he simply doesn't need it any more. The guy who
needed seven movie screenings 35 years ago and who couldn't bear
the thought of traveling to Boston to see his team play 15 years
ago had become so overwrought that he couldn't even attend the home
games during the final two rounds of the 2000 playoffs. Frankly,
that scares me, and if things are that bad for him, then he
probably should get out.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves on top. The current Lakers are his creation. He
created the salary cap space to get Shaquille O'Neal. He identified
the latent greatness in Kobe Bryant and worked the trade with
Charlotte that made Jellybean Bryant's gifted son a Laker. He
scouted or drafted or traded for everyone on the roster. He has
rebuilt a team that as recently as the 1993-94 season was a
complete non-factor (33-49, and no playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   It has long been publicly acknowledged that Jerry West was a
great judge of talent. But the general public only knew half the
story. They didn't know how much the insiders respected his
tenacity and his willingness to do the same kind of scouting grunt
work some low-paid scout was doing for another team. You think some
of those guys didn't go back to the bar or their hotel rooms after
watching a college game and say, ``Good Lord, was I really just
hanging out with Jerry West?''
</P>
<P>
   But there was yet another Jerry West persona. This was the Jerry
West who went to league meetings and assorted league gatherings,
representing the Los Angeles Lakers by wearing his GM's hat. ``He
has a grace and a style that was almost regal,'' recalls Volk. ``At
league meetings, he wouldn't talk much, but when he did, everybody
listened. He was so subtle and laid-back. It was a style that was
easy to take and easy to listen to. And this was, of course, Jerry
West, who had established his credibility as a player. That was
built-in. Now you combine that with his style and he had total
credibility. And it never appeared to be ego-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ego-driven? The man didn't even appear at his own retirement
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   He had no Farewell Tour as a player and they don't have Farewell
Tours for executives. But somebody's got to do something. The logo
has just walked out the door.

`THE REPLACEMENTS' IS SURPRISINGLY ENTERTAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE REPLACEMENTS 
Directed by: Howard Deutch 
Screenplay by: Vince McKewin 
Starring: Gene Hackman, Keanu Reeves, Brooke Langton, Orlando
Jones, Jon Favreau, Rhys Ifans, Michael Jace, Troy Winbush, Michael
``Bear'' Taliferro, Faison Love, David Denman, Ace Yonamine, Jack
Warden, Brett Cullen 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some crude sexual humor and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies don't get more shamelessly manipulative than ``The
Replacements.'' On the other hand, it pushes all of its formulaic
buttons _ it has no other kind _ effectively. It's often
entertaining despite itself, thanks mostly to a screenful of
surprisingly engaging performances. Let's start with Gene Hackman,
who trades pretty outrageously on his role in ``Hoosiers.'' Here he
plays the coach of a team of scrubs hired to play out the season
for Washington, D.C.'s pro football franchise during a players'
strike. His little trademark humorless chuckle, a device designed
to give this or that character time to think his way out of a jam,
is worth whatever the producers paid him.
</P>
<P>
   If Hackman is reliable, Keanu Reeves is the surprise. Usually,
Reeves' performances run a narrow gamut from wooden to comatose.
Here, however, he's never seemed less zombified and more relaxed.
Perhaps it's the unchallenging nature of the material. As a college
quarterback, Shane Falco, who gets a second chance to show what he
can do after destroying his football career with a disastrous Sugar
Bowl game, Reeves is simply more present than he's ever seemed
before, even in his embarrassing love scene. What's embarrassing is
that the film's producers have seen fit to move the quarterback in
for the big kiss to a counterpoint of Jack Madden's voice on TV
saying, in the context of a game broadcast, ``All it takes is one
big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the quarterback win the big game and get the head
cheerleader (played with blue-collar sparkle by Brooke Langton)?
One needn't be a seer to guess the answer. There's nothing subtle
about ``The Replacements.'' All the plays are photogenic long
passes, runs, and field goals. No mundane grinding out a few yards
at a time. Nor is there any doubt that the film, at its most basic
level, is about establishing your manhood by pulping the other
guys, whether it's the striking players waiting menacingly in a
parking lot and then walking into a bar, looking for trouble, or
merely the other teams from Detroit, Phoenix, San Diego, and,
climactically, archfiends from Dallas who dress like the Oakland
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sting is removed from the neanderthal material by
the charisma of the various players, who look more convincing doing
a disco dance to ``I Will Survive'' than on the field. These range
from Jon Favreau's mad-dog defensive lineman to Faizon Love's and
Michael ``Bear'' Taliferro's hulking brothers to Rhys Ifans'
cigarette-puffing placekicker from Wales to Brian Murphy's
brilliant but deaf athlete denied a chance until now. The cliches
in ``The Replacements'' pile up more relentlessly than a herd of
linesmen as the losers bond and become winners, playing for pride
because they know they'll be unemployed as soon as the strike is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: ``The Replacements'' is more entertaining than it
has any business being, especially when Hackman's coach is forced
to verbalize the words to ``You Gotta Have Heart,'' originally sung
by a Washington Senators baseball manager in the musical ``Damn
Yankees.'' The film's heart-hitting temps don't have to work nearly
as hard to overcome the other teams as they do to overcome the
script's blatant rigging. Although ``The Replacements'' is easier
to take than I would have thought possible, any ESPN commercial at
all leaves it in the dust when it comes to imaginative firepower.
In the end, ``The Replacements'' made me wonder if I wasn't perhaps
too hard on ``Any Given Sunday.''

`DEMENTED' ISN'T AS CRAZY AS IT WANTS TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
CECIL B. DEMENTED 
Written and directed by: John Waters 
Starring: Melanie Griffith, Stephen Dorff, Alicia Witt, Adrian
Grenier, Erika Lynn Rupli, Zenzelle Uzoma, Larry Gilliard, Jr.,
Eric M. Barry, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jack Noseworthy, Harriet Dodge,
Mike Shannon, Mink Stole, Ricki Lake, Patricia Hearst, Kevin
Nealon 
Running time: 89 minutes 
Rated: R (strong crude sexual content, violence, language and drug
use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Waters' new ``Cecil B. DeMented'' has fun with both ends of
the moviemaking spectrum _ megabore mainstream and sanctimonious
indie. It also ought to earn Melanie Griffith a good-sport award as
a Hollywood star kidnapped by self-proclaimed guerrilla filmmakers.
She starts out with a cliche movie star hissy fit in Baltimore,
when a white limo is sent to pick her up instead of a black one.
``Do I look like Liberace's boyfriend? Do I look like a coke
dealer?'' she harrumphs, only to be kidnapped minutes later and
hustled off to a crumbling theater by underground filmmakers who
live in a heavy-metal goth dream world. They take a thumbs-down
attitude toward mainstream culture _ thumbs and other assorted body
parts being tattooed with the names of Fassbinder, Otto Preminger,
David Lynch, Spike Lee, Herschel Gordon Walker, Sam Fuller, and
other cinema gods.
</P>
<P>
   Don't arrive too late for the funny opening credit montage, a
series of theater marquees boasting such divertissements as a Pauly
Shore festival and the English-dubbed version of ``Les Enfants du
Paradis.'' One plot bit involves the guerrillas crashing a strip
mall multiplex showing the director's cut of ``Patch Adams.'' Even
without being reminded that John Waters regular Patty Hearst
appears as the straight mom of one of the film guerrillas,
cognoscenti will have picked up on the fact that the film's plot
loosely echoes the real-life kidnapping of Hearst by the Symbionese
Liberation Army, and her subsequent temporary conversion to their
cause. It's fun to watch Griffith segue from a sensible survivor
mode to something like sympathy for the group because the diva side
of her realizes that she not only looks good in the guerrilla
project, but looks younger than she has looked in her last few
Hollywood features.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dorff is a nonstop caricature of Mansonesque energy in
the title role, a man who can say with a straight face that
technique is nothing more than failed style. But the very nature of
his character hints at the film's shortcoming. Essentially, it's
Waters looking back at his younger self affectionately, but also
with a mature sense of how silly he was in his rebellious youth.
The film's heart is in the right place, and the cast is sunnily
engaging. But the film can't sustain its initial high attack, and
ends up seeming a bit of a fizzle, mischievous rather than
genuinely wild.
</P>

   Ultimately, ``Cecil B. DeMented'' suffers from a split
personality. It admires the energies of guerrilla filmmaking, but
can no longer recapture them. And it's fully aware of the emptiness
of Hollywood spectacles, but doesn't try to conceal a sneaking
fondness for them, expressed at a sharply campy level. Even the
music over those not-to-be-missed opening credits is a sonic
montage of inspired cheesiness. But ``Cecil B. DeMented'' deals in
affection, not firepower. It's the cinematic equivalent of one of
those prop guns where you pull the trigger and a little flag comes
out of the barrel, waving gaily.

FED'S SOFT LANDING ASIDE, CAUTION NOW PREVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news for investors could hardly be better.
</P>
<P>
   The hope for a soft landing seems to have arrived. The economy
is slowing, inflation is under control, and the Fed probably won't
raise interest rates later this month. Earnings in the second
quarter were terrific, especially in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   So how has the stock market reacted to all this good fortune?
</P>
<P>
   With a yawn. You'd think investors were watching the Republican
convention. The market averages have barely moved for weeks and all
remain slightly negative for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Are we in the August doldrums or is there a reason to think we
may be stuck here for a while? ``You have to ask: Is this as good
as it gets?'' said William Braman, chief investment officer for
John Hancock Funds.
</P>
<P>
   First the news.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Wednesday reported that the economy is
slowing. Consumer spending, manufacturing, and construction are all
losing steam, the Fed reported in its ``beige book.'' Wages are
still rising, but thanks to a combination of competition and
productivity gains, prices are holding steady.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government Tuesday reported that productivity is
rising at the fastest pace in 17 years. Strong productivity growth
means the economy can grow without triggering inflation. On a scale
of 1 to 100, the productivity report was a 96.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been looking for moderation in growth and stability
in prices. With evidence of both in hand, the central bank likely
will do nothing at its Aug. 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On the earnings side, profits in the second quarter grew
slightly more than 20 percent, ahead of estimates. The performance
of some key technology companies was truly eye-popping. Cisco
Systems this week said its sales grew 61 percent in the quarter.
Applied Materials, a key supplier to the semiconductor industry,
had a revenue gain of 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So why the ho-hum reaction?
</P>
<P>
   Lauriann Kloppenburg, director of equity research at Loomis
Sayles, has one answer. ``People are cautious,'' she said. ``Some
of this news is almost too good to be true. People aren't sure it
can last.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed may be on hold for the moment, say money managers, but
there is no guarantee there won't be more rate hikes down the road.
The economy, like the stock market, might just be taking a
breather.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain amount of caution about earnings as well.
Sure they are wonderful today, but can they stay wonderful?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks a few technology giants, including
wireless leaders Nokia and Ericsson, have warned of slowing sales
in the second half of the year. A handful of analysts also have
predicted some easing in demand for semiconductors, another
mainstay of the technology business.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting disaster, but it wouldn't take a disaster,
just a mild slowdown, to knock technology stocks off their lofty
perches.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks are already priced with the expectation of some
very good numbers,'' said Hancock's Braman, who notes that the top
tech stocks still sell for stratospheric multiples. Cisco, for
instance, trades at 87 times earnings. EMC, another high-flier,
sells for 117 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Blow-out-the-doors sales and profits don't push these stocks
higher because it takes terrific performance just to keep them
where they are. Said Braman, ``We have a battle between earnings
and valuation.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications going forward aren't inspiring. As Rodgers and
Hammerstein once said of Kansas City, stock prices may ``have gone
about as far as they can go.'' The tremendous runup in the markets
over the past five years was predicated on a world of strong
growth, low inflation and good earnings.
</P>
<P>
   We've got that world, but what do we do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisors, suggests that the current pause may be a good thing.
``This is healthy,'' Riley said. ``In the tech area especially,
expectations got way out of line with reality. Now we are getting a
narrowing of the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, earnings can catch up with stock prices and the
market can make another move forward.
</P>
<P>
   How long could this consolidation period last? A month? Six
months? A year? No one has a clue. But in the meantime, get used to
boring. You can practice by watching the Democratic convention next
week.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MASSACHUSETTS IS LEFT OUT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, cruel, cruel fate. A state in which Potomac Fever is more
prevalent than the flu could now be the worst place from which to
launch a national campaign. Any candidate who hails from it must
first overcome that most dreaded of labels: ``Massachusetts
Liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   The grim, frozen faces of US Senator John F. Kerry and his wife,
Teresa Heinz, tell the sad story. The Vietnam war hero and longtime
junior senator from Massachusetts did not make the cut for this
year's national Democratic ticket. The honor went to Senator Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, a political centrist with credentials as
an upholder of high moral standards. (The proof: He took on Bill
Clinton and Hollywood.)
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Kerry's activities as a quasi-swinging single
may have factored into Al Gore's decision to choose Lieberman. But
the biggest negative for Kerry harkened to his Bay State roots.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gore considered it less politically risky to choose
Lieberman, the first Orthodox Jewish vice presidential candidate,
than it would be to choose Kerry and the liberal Massachusetts
legacy he would represent.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since Lieberman's selection, he has been flying high
above politics. It remains to be seen how his religion ultimately
plays in November. But Gore's instincts about the Bay State baggage
carried by Kerry were correct. Last week in Philadelphia,
Republicans attending the GOP convention were openly joyous at the
thought of a Gore-Kerry ticket. It would have been easy to position
Kerry, who was boxed by his liberal voting record. It's much harder
to position Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the birthplace of Camelot and four US
presidents _ John Adams, John Quincy Adams, John Fitzgerald
Kennedy, and George Bush. Within its borders are untold numbers of
politicians and their aides who envision themselves in the Oval
Office, with their finger on the button, or at least near it.
</P>
<P>
   Politics here spurs a booming cottage industry of consultants
and pollsters. Many of them are playing leading roles on Gore's
campaign team. Others who are unofficially involved are probably
puffing on cigars and writing brilliant strategy memos to the Gore
campaign at this very moment.
</P>
<P>
   There are networking opportunities galore in Massachusetts.
Virtually any out-of-work politician with Washington experience or
the right friends can find a friendly berth at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government, which now even courts Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Commonwealth retains its reputation as a political
extreme and that hurts the cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   It started in 1972, when the state stood alone in voting for
George McGovern instead of President Richard M. Nixon, prompting
the ``Don't blame me _ I'm from Massachusetts'' bumper sticker.
Fallout from the Nixon-McGovern race allowed Milton native and Yale
graduate George Bush to paint Michael S. Dukakis as a left wing Ivy
League goo-goo in the 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The state voted twice for Ronald Reagan for president and for
William Weld for governor. In Paul Cellucci, it still has a
Republican governor. But Massachusetts Republicans are considered a
different breed from their brothers and sisters in other states and
traditionally don't count much with the national party. That is
somewhat different this year, given that the inner circle around
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, includes
Massachusetts native sons like Andrew Card, Ron Kaufman, and
Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   As political analysts keep reminding us, Democrats and
Republicans are searching for the center in Campaign 2000. The
Republicans are moving from the right; and the Democrats are taking
Bill Clinton's lead and moving from the left.
</P>
<P>
   The movement at the national party level is probably better news
for Massachusetts Republicans than it is for the Democrats, who are
basically labeled as ``Massachusetts Liberals'' once they leave
state borders. As such, those Democrats with national aspirations
are in a kind of political limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, for how long must they pay for the liberal sins
of George McGovern and Michael Dukakis?
</P>
<P>
   Another question is, is there anything worse in politics than
being a Massachusetts liberal? Sure there is _ being a woman from
anywhere.

   KIPP-EDUC (Berkeley, Calif.) _ With the national political
debate increasingly focused on education, perhaps the most divisive
question has been how to raise achievement among poor and minority
children. One experiment has drawn keen attention from both
liberals and conservatives. KIPP Academy, a pair of remarkably
successful middle schools in the ghettoes of Houston and New York
City's South Bronx, was highlighted at this month's Republican
National Convention by Laura Bush and earlier rewarded by the
Children's Defense Fund, an organization close to the heart of
Hillary Clinton. The question is whether it can be replicated. Now,
in an unprecedented effort to build hundreds of KIPP clones around
the country, Donald G. and Doris Fisher, the owners of The Gap

increase in what has been the biggest public fight over Japanese
economic policy this century. After 17 months of near-zero rates,
the central bank raises its target for overnight lending to 0.25
percent _ the first rate increase in a decade. While ruling party
leaders have inveighed against a rate increase, calling it
irresponsible at a time when the economy is undergoing a fragile
recovery, many economists say that the move will have little
impact. The decision, however, is a significant show of

US WOMEN WILL FACE THE IRON IN THEIR QUEST FOR THE GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States women's national team is receiving little
respect and no sympathy from Olympic soccer organizers. The US will
meet Norway and China _ the runners-up in the 1995 and '99 Women's
World Cups and 1996 Olympics _ in its first two games.
</P>
<P>
   But the US apparently is anticipating the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the single most difficult and challenging draw FIFA
has ever put out to a team that was ranked No. 1 in the world,''
coach April Heinrichs said after announcing the team members during
a conference call Thursday. ``FIFA has provided us the greatest
challenge and the most hurdles and we love it. Every time something
or somebody says that this team can't do something they prove them
wrong and we hope that trend continues.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few changes from the '99 Women's World Cup team that
defeated China on penalty kicks in the final, with all the starters
returning and only reserve Tisha Venturini excluded. Every starter
from the '96 Olympic final team remains. And six starters from the
'91 Women's World Cup final team remain, including Michelle Akers,
who scored both goals in a 2-1 win over Norway in Guangzhou, China,
and Heinrichs, who was named coach in January.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the holdovers _ Akers (shoulder) and Carla Overbeck
(knee) _ were questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Michelle Akers and Carla Overbeck on this team was a
decision that I made in my mind two or three months ago because of
Carla's leadership,'' Heinrichs said. ``Carla's knee might be about
70 percent but her will and power among these players, along with
her leadership, makes her the glue of this team and every team has
a glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle is a world-class player. I think what we will see
over the next couple of weeks is that she will get better and
better every time she steps out on the field. What I know about
Michelle is that she always overcomes adversity and I think she
will again.''
</P>
<P>
   The US will meet Norway Sept. 13, the first of a possible five
games in 15 days. The 18-player roster limits options.
</P>
<P>
   Siri Mullinix, an active and aggressive goalkeeper, will likely
be the starter ahead of Briana Scurry. Goalkeeper Jenni Branam was
named an alternate and will travel with the team along with
midfielder Michelle French, 23. The other alternates are defender
Nandi Pryce, 18, and forward Christie Welsh, 19.
</P>
<P>
   The most important transitional players will be Mullinix, 22;
midfielder Nikki Serlenga, 22; and defender Danielle Slaton, 20,
the active roster's youngest player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have more than two or three younger players we've made
too much of a jump, we were too quick to change, and we were
careless,'' Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   The US will meet Russia in Annapolis Sunday; Canada in Kansas
City, Mo., Aug. 20; and Brazil in San Jose, Calif., Sept. 1 before
traveling to Melbourne Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the final tournament for many of the veteran
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's over we will be kind of sad because I don't know how
many of us will be around,'' Overbeck said. ``But the younger kids
are very athletic, very driven, and they've learned something from
residency camp. They've learned about dedication and what it takes
to make it. This team will keep rolling on. April is one of the
best motivators and she knows what it takes to win and I am
confident the younger players will be prepared for the next few
years.''

AWAITING TRIAL OF EX-BOYFRIEND, WOMAN GOES INTO HIDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The police were searching for Angelique Uhlmann's body
when she arrived, trembling, at her Beacon Hill apartment last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:30 Saturday morning, shortly after Uhlmann says she was
awakened by the voice of her ex-boyfriend, who had called the home
of her new boyfriend to say that he was in her apartment and
planned to kill him, her, and himself.
</P>
<P>
   She rushed across town to her home, where she was met by police
who'd arrived minutes earlier to find a blood-soaked scene so
disturbing that they believed a particularly horrible murder,
perhaps a mutilation, had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   A trail of blood led up a stairwell to Uhlmann's shattered
apartment door, ripped off its hinges so forcefully that two
deadbolts dangled inside, according to a police report. The
apartment had been ransacked, its floors strewn with shards of
glass and plastic left from a smashed telephone and wine glasses. A
garbage bag had been ripped open, its contents dumped on a deck.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the blood, smeared on every conceivable
surface: walls, furniture, appliances, framed photographs, even
receipts and credit cards pulled from Uhlmann's wallet, according
to police.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting shirtless and blood-splattered on the apartment's front
steps was Uhlmann's ex-boyfriend, Vincent J. Froio Jr., a former
competitive bodybuilder who, according to a police report, was in
an ``agitated and uncooperative state'' when officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested and appeared in Boston Municipal Court Monday
morning, charged with breaking into Uhlmann's apartment, trashing
it, and threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asked the judge to hold Froio, 33, without bail,
arguing that he was too dangerous to release. But Judge Mark
Summerville did just that, also refusing a request that Froio be
tethered to an electronic bracelet before trial. Bail was set at
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Froio, a lawyer with the downtown law firm of Foley, Hoag &AMP;
Eliot, made bail and was freed later that day after promising to
check himself into a New Hampshire psychiatric hospital _ something
he didn't do for 27 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now a terrified Uhlmann, a fourth-year medical student at Tufts
University, is in hiding, frantic that Froio will make good on his
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only goal now is to keep myself safe and to be able to live
until my medical school graduation without him killing me,'' said
Uhlmann, 32, who has temporarily dropped out of her surgery
rotation. ``He showed that he had the rage, the ability, the
temper, and the loss of control to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Froio's defense attorney, Desmond Fitzgerald, insisted that
Summerville's decision to release Froio on bail was appropriate,
noting that Uhlmann was not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Even James Borghesani, a spokesman for the Suffolk district
attorney's office, called the $30,000 bail ``very high'' when
considering the nature of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to minimize the nature of this crime,''
Borghesani said. But Froio has no criminal record and no history of
not appearing in court, he said, two main considerations in setting
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Uhlmann's charge that Froio threatened to kill her is
``unsubstantiated,'' Fitzgerald said, adding that he believes she
lied to police about the threat because she was distraught over
their breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole thing is about a girl whose boyfriend was
cheating on her, or who thinks her boyfriend was cheating on her,
and she's upset,'' Fitzgerald said. ``And sometimes when people
feel jilted they will say things that aren't necessarily true, and
I think that's what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   But Uhlmann says she was the one who ended their 2 1/2-year
relationship six weeks ago. About two weeks after the breakup,
Uhlmann said, Froio began to call her repeatedly, prompting her to
call one of his friends and ask him to tell Froio to stop
contacting her. He also sent a threatening e-mail, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the calls continued, including one in which Uhlmann says
Froio told her, ``I know you're dating another guy,'' identifying
the man by his first name.
</P>
<P>
   Uhlmann believes Froio got the man's name by gaining access to
her phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening before Froio allegedly broke into her apartment,
Uhlmann had dinner with her sister and the man she was dating.
</P>
<P>
   The three later returned to his apartment and, when her sister
fell asleep, Uhlmann says she decided to spend the night rather
than return to her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 4 the next morning the phone in her new boyfriend's
apartment rang repeatedly. Uhlmann said she answered it and heard
Froio's voice, screaming racial slurs, obscenities, and threatening
to kill her, the new boyfriend, and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone in his voice was just rage,'' Uhlmann recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When Uhlmann called police and returned to her apartment, ``It
was like a scene from a horror movie,'' she said. ``I have never
seen that kind of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Froio was arrested and taken to jail, where he called her, she
said, and pleaded, ``Please come down and get me. You're the only
one who can do this. You know how much I love you'' _ this despite
orders from police not to telephone her.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said that Froio had fallen while walking to Uhlmann's
house and cut his finger. Noting that Uhlmann is training to be a
surgeon, Fitzgerald said it is ``quite possible he was going there
for assistance with his injury.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the blood had been intentionally smeared on
Uhlmann's possessions. ``I would say that when I walk upstairs, I
put my hand on the railing and wall to balance myself, so if my
finger's bleeding, there's going to be blood on the wall,''
Fitzgerald said. ``And if I touch a photo or a couch, the blood is
going to mark that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Uhlmann had no reason to fear for her safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald Stewart, the supervising assistant district attorney
for Boston Municipal Court, thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that in order to ensure the safety of the victim,
holding him without bail was appropriate,'' said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot, where Froio has worked as an associate
since April, referred questions on the case to Gerri Denterlein
Worldwide, a public relations firm. Denterlein called the charges
against Froio ``serious'' and said the case is ``under review at
the highest levels of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after learning that Froio had not been admitted to
a psychiatric hospital until 27 hours after his release on bail
because of problems finding a bed, Summerville held a hearing to
amend the conditions of Froio's release. He ordered that Fitzgerald
provide additional information about the psychiatric facility where
Froio was admitted, Elliot Hospital in Manchester, N.H. Summerville
said he will review that information to determine if the facility
provides adequate security.
</P>
<P>
   If he determines that it does not, he may revoke Froio's bail
and order him jailed before trial.
</P>
<P>
   Uhlmann said she fears she'll be emotionally imprisoned for much
longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will forever have to look over my shoulder because of this
guy, because nothing he can tell me will convince me that he won't
snap like that again at some point,'' she said.

 ANGELES-2 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mesmerizing, kinetic, dangerous, hip, heavenly,
mad, new and eternal, sunshine and stoplights without end, amen.
</P>
<P>
   It is all still here.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kennedy turned the place out the last time the Democrats
convened in LA for their national convention. That was 1960. Back
then, movie moguls ran the town, not the stars. Back then, the LAPD
was still regarded as a sleepy police force.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Democrats begin their presidential convention
here, hoping to erase the nation's memories of the recently-ended
festivities in Philadelphia, where George W. Bush received his
party's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   Being here should help. Philadelphia, as a city, was all blue
notes and earthiness, a neighborly place, trying hard to please,
despite the rain. This city errs on the side of the exotic, of
scandal and stars, mystery and improbable success. Marilyn Monroe
is long dead, but the Marilyn knockoffs in this city are
astonishing. Here, the ghosts have ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place of art and creative energy. Sometimes that's
seen as a positive, sometimes as a negative,'' says Democratic
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who represents a district here and was
home on a recent Saturday afternoon rallying the faithful. Waters
is mindful of the city's image, battered one year, beloved the
next. ``I'm sure for someone who lives in `Timbuktu,' Iowa, or
`Somewhere,' Nebraska, they would be alarmed that we have rap
artists amongst us. They wouldn't know how to manipulate this
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting: 469 square miles, a place with sharp geographical
demarcations that divide the populace. And the people _ dreamers,
schemers, do-gooders, urban wanderers, the brilliant, the lost _
keep coming, arriving down at Union Station, at LAX, as if coming
to Xanadu. The sun shines 325 days a year, and it can distract the
mind from even the deepest wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can rot here,'' John Rechy, who wrote a novel about this
city, once said, ``without feeling it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As an American city, LA actually has no peer, so sophisticated
and resourceful it has hosted not one, but two Olympiads. It can
produce raw magic from its movie kingdom. You can ride in most
directions and spy jaw-dropping wealth, mansions with trees
smelling of fruit. You can ride atop the city, along the curves of
Mulholland Drive, look down upon the place, and wonder: How does it
work? There's the traffic, the people, the busyness. But it does
work, in a kind of nervous urban calypso.
</P>
<P>
   The city's public relations honchos are out in full force now,
with all the conventioneers coming. There are dazzling treats to
show off: museums, the landscape, knockout institutions of higher
learning: USC, UCLA. A guru came from the Midwest last year by the
name of Phil Jackson and coached the LA Lakers to a championship. A
place in the sun suddenly got that much hipper.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city of 3 1/2 million, you can feel swallowed up,
lonely as an owl.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats will convene near downtown, at the Staples Center.
Rose Appelbaum lives nearby. She's just another voter trying to
keep a life in LA together. The Democrats might bellow about
inclusion, but the word, here in this city, bothers her at times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951 Appelbaum arrived here from Missouri and was swiftly
swallowed up. She took some odd jobs, ended up doing work for a
wealthy couple with children. She lives near downtown now, in one
of those old apartment buildings that has a film noir feel about
it: glass, rich carpet, dark hallways where mystery hangs like
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Appelbaum is white in a city that is increasingly becoming black
and brown. The transition to a minority majority, an ongoing
movement in many other American cities, is an old story here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the minority, and I'm on the lower economic
spectrum,'' she says. The imbalance is starting to make her fret.
``I ride the bus every day,'' she goes on. ``It's mostly minorities
on there. And sometimes you're treated very badly. It's rough
riding buses. I'm like in a prison here. I used to go down to the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. But if you watch news here, it's murder
and mayhem every day. It seems like I'm pulling in more and more
every day. Sometimes, I carry a stun gun. It's against the law. But
some of these bus lines are very rough.''
</P>
<P>
   She's sitting in the lobby of her building, sunlight catching
her hair, which is the color of a cloud. Sometimes she'll take the
subway. The subway in this city is an oddity, derided by many as a
boondoggle, going to not enough places in a city with too many
faraway places to get to. ``This white woman was coming out of the
subway station with me the other day,'' Appelbaum says. ``I said,
`Gosh, everything's getting sleazy.' She said, `What do you expect?
We're paying for them to ride the subway. They're bringing graffiti
and trash.' I didn't know what to say. But they do bring their
culture here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Appelbaum is single now. There were marriages. Oh, were
there marriages. Six of them. ``I had marital problems, which I
always seem to.'' Her voice has a breathless quality to it; imagine
Marilyn Monroe, if she had lived to Appelbaum's age. ``These guys I
married were rough. What, back then, you would call hoods. They
died on the streets. You know what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't had a man to call her own since 1991. ``I'm like
Elizabeth Taylor,'' she says of the many marriages. ``Back in those
days you didn't shack up. You married. We didn't do anything
illegal. We just did it a lot. I'm sorry I look like a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Appelbaum has two sons, Joe and Richard. They steer clear of
mother, and she is not happy. ``I have a strange relationship with
my boys. They married sisters. These two sisters are quite heavy.
See, I take very good care of myself. They seem to be antagonized
by my presence. We really don't communicate much.''
</P>
<P>
   Appelbaum swears she'll survive. ``I have to keep my head. I
cannot be friendly. Because you never know if somebody is gonna
turn on you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out here, the headlines tend to be loud.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, 1991, several police officers stopped a 25-year-old
motorist by the name of Rodney King after a traffic chase. He was
severely beaten by the officers, kicked and punched. A videotape
caught the beating. It was as if Marshall McLuhan's premonition of
the all-seeing eye had come true, and in the place _ LA _ where you
would expect it to come true. There were convictions in the King
aftermath, state acquittals, bloodcurdling rioting, and then
federal convictions and sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, 1994, the earth cracked under this city and its
nearby valleys. Sixty died. A good many packed suitcases and
bolted. Xanadu felt scary and looked unforgiving. It can seem, at
times, that the city must pay for its beauty, its conceits.
</P>
<P>
   Just now the city is undergoing deep soul-searching in
connection with yet another police imbroglio, the Rampart scandal,
where 70 cases of police misconduct have come to light as officers
planted evidence and lied to frame innocent civilians. The scandal
was touched off by the arrest of Officer Rafael Perez. ``The most
important thing to come out of the Perez case is that every single
case of police misconduct is going to be investigated thoroughly
now,'' says Winston Kevin McKesson, Perez's lawyer. ``Police
officers are hopping mad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also, of course, a city with many defenders. ``The
exposure people receive is from the difficulty of life _ and
scandals,'' concedes Bishop Charles Blake of the 18,000-member West
Angeles Church of God and Christ. ``Overall,'' he says, ``life in
LA is pleasantly routine.''

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The biggest thing to happen all week for Johnny Ruiz
is that he got sued by an old promoter. In boxing, getting sued is
one sign you've hit the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to see your name on a huge billboard near the
McCarren Airport when you finally land in the Nevada desert and
head to the Strip at three in the morning, as Ruiz did last Sunday
after he arrived in town bleary-eyed following nearly three hours
of flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Or to keep running into pictures of yourself at a Las Vegas
casino, pictures of you right next to three-time heavyweight
champion Evander Holyfield. Ruiz sees this every time he walks
around the Paris Hilton or the adjacent Bally's casino. The posters
are like postcards to himself that carry home one message. He's in
the big time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ten times a day, 20 times a day, however many times a day John
Ruiz leaves his room, the pictures tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign, and in Ruiz's case the most important one, will
come Saturday night when he finally hits Holyfield in the face for
the first time or vice versa. At that moment, a kid from Chelsea,
Mass. who had a dream all his life will have officially grown into
a challenger for the heavyweight title. He will have officially
earned $1.5 million regardless of what follows that first punch. He
will have officially begun fighting with a legend for the World
Boxing Association heavyweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, little has changed for The Quiet Man except that
Panos Eliades, a former promoter, is suing him for $10,000, which
he claims he's owed from a past fight against Jerry Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz never looked at the papers when they were served on his
manager. It's not a problem he thinks about, just like the lights
of Las Vegas are not something he thinks about. Ruiz may be living
on the Strip this week, but he could just as easily be in Lunenberg
for all the difference it's made to him. This week, like all weeks,
The Quiet Man has stayed quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly I play gin in my room with Stoney (manager Norman
Stone) and Gabe (trainer Gabe Mari) or I watch TV,'' Ruiz said when
asked about his big week in the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't gamble. I don't go to shows. I go for a couple of
walks after I eat with Stoney and Gabe. I sleep a lot. That's about
it. This fight could be anywhere as long as I have a room.''
</P>
<P>
   A room with a view. A view of Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm alone I focus on the fight,'' Ruiz said. ``That's
really all I do. I think about the fight and what to do. What I've
been surprised about is I haven't been nervous. I haven't been
nervous for the last few fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a guy who would sit wracking his brain all day
before a fight, thinking about this and that and what if. Then all
of a sudden, three fights ago, it was like I suddenly felt
comfortable. That's why I think this fight came at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   If it did, Ruiz is well rested for it. Unlike Peter McNeeley
when he swept through Las Vegas a few years ago before he fought
Mike Tyson and was everywhere, including the ``Tonight'' show, Ruiz
has been seldom visible.
</P>
<P>
   On walks people recognize him as ``the guy who's fighting
Holyfield.'' They ask for his autograph, but unless they're from
New England they ask who he is after he walks off. To them, he is
the bull's-eye Holyfield will be hitting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That is what it means to be a challenger facing arguably the
greatest heavyweight of his time. Ruiz understands that and thinks
nothing of it. He takes a picture when asked, he signs autographs
when asked, he smiles always, he says little to anyone but
``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We taught him to play gin at Logan,'' Stone said. ``We boxed
Saturday night and were supposed to leave at around 9 but the plane
was delayed forever so we taught him how to play. We never should
have. He's up about 40 bucks and we're only playing for $2 a game.
He doesn't say much then, either. Just takes the money. It's just
five of us. There's no entourage, no family.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but Holyfield and the effort to prepare for him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each morning since his arrival, Ruiz has gotten up to run, then
found some place to work out each evening. Between the morning run
and the 7 p.m. workouts, he sits in a room at Bally's and thinks of
Holyfield, or he goes for a meal and an hour walk and he thinks of
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, Holyfield. Holyfield is his constant companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else is there to think about?'' Ruiz jokes. ``Lennox
Lewis?''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the reigning World Boxing Council and International
Boxing Federation champion, a former stablemate of Ruiz who refused
to give him a shot at the unified title after beating Holyfield
even though he was contractually obligated to do so. Since then,
Lewis has repeatedly referred to his former sparring partner as
``Johnny Louise,'' a fact not lost on The Quiet Man.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't often talk about that, but he does talk . . . and
think . . . about all that has been said about him since this fight
was announced. Little of it has been good. Probably the kindest
thing is that he is a hard-working journeyman. The rest has
centered on claims that he didn't deserve a title shot (as if Frans
Botha, who Lewis just cold-cocked in one round, did?). They say he
got a title shot only because his powerful promoter, Don King, got
him the No. 1 ranking through careful maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz may be quiet but he's not deaf and he has been answering
these charges the best he can both at the final press conference
Wednesday and during phone interviews (in his room, of course)
arranged by the promoters. He's talked with a half-dozen Spanish
language TV and radio stations that are here because Ruiz could
become the first Hispanic fighter to win the heavyweight
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Usually Ruiz softly accepts praise and just as softly defends
himself against his critics, saying we'll soon see if he deserves
to be here.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath, as he sits in his room alone, a fire burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is on my mind,'' Ruiz admitted. ``The only thing it
does is fuel the fire. I've been fighting professionally for eight
years. I'm 36-3. I knocked out 27 guys. I've fought three ranked
fighters and beat them, but I know I've got a lot more to prove
this fight than Evander does.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff just makes me more determined to go out and win
this fight. It does make me angry but I've been the underdog since
the day I was born, so any other way would be uncomfortable for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why his routine has varied little since arriving
in Las Vegas. Walks in the desert, walks in the casino, the
occasional autograph to sign or interview to be done, jogs at a
city park at sunset, meals with his five-man entourage that
includes no family. Other than that, TV, sleep, gin, and thoughts
of Evander Holyfield occupy his time.
</P>
<P>
   That was John Ruiz's big week until Thursday's weigh-in at the
showroom at the Paris Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz tipped the scales at 224, four pounds lighter than he was
when he left Boston. For some, this was a sign that nerves were
eating away at him. To Stone, it was what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be faster,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing until after Holyfield weighed in at 221. Then Ruiz
surprisingly hung around the stage to do interview after interview.
Al Bernstein from ESPN. Local and national TV. Print media. Spanish
media. British media. Surrounded by microphones, The Quiet Man
suddenly had a lot to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what he's thinking but I hope he's ready because
I know I'm ready,'' Ruiz told a group of reporters. ``I'll try and
set the pace and work him as much as I can to see what he has left
in his tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that any way for The Quiet Man to talk? As he does, Stone
turns to a friend and says, ``This is great. Johnny is ready to
fight this guy. I've never seen him this confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Not once does Ruiz disparage Holyfield. That he will not do. But
he mentions that he's 28 and Holyfield is nearly 38 and that
everyone has their time. What he implies without saying it is that
this is no longer Holyfield's time, which means, it stands to
reason, it is his.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect The Quiet Man to say it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Ruiz talks, Stone's ear is constantly glued to a cell phone.
Calls from home. Calls from King's representatives. Calls from the
media looking for Johnny.
</P>
<P>
   Calls, calls, calls. Few get through to Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   That will continue even Saturday when Stone says he will be ``in
constant cellular contact'' with his wife. The reason is she's
hiding a gift for Ruiz that he will not get until this fight is
over.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is the presence of his wife, Sahara. As far as Ruiz
knows, his wife and children are not coming to Las Vegas. He is
against the kids seeing him fight and his wife hates to watch,
although at times she has.
</P>
<P>
   A family decision was made to avoid the pressures and problems
of bringing his family on this business trip, so Ruiz expects to
talk to them sometime after he becomes heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   He will. But it will be face-to-face with his wife, although he
doesn't know it yet. All he knows is that his prefight routine will
not change, just as little else has all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay up later the night before the fight so I can get
some good sleep during the day,'' Ruiz said. ``On the day of a
fight, that's what I do. I sleep until they call us to go to the
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   On the biggest day of his professional life, that is what The
Quiet Man plans to do. He'll sleep until it's time to punch Evander
Holyfield in the face.
</P>
<P>
   When the punching stops, the outcome will be known and Ruiz will
return to his life. It will be changed forever if he wins because
it would mean more title fights and bigger purses. Millions upon
millions.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, things may change for John Ruiz but the changes
will come like everything else has this week.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly.

SOFTCOM NOTHING BUT A `CLASSIC' SALES JOB

<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas Warshaw is a pretty smart guy. Oh, he graduated from
Princeton and worked as a producer for ABC Sports for years, but
that is not why he is smart guy.
</P>
<P>
   He knows things. Cool things. Like the time Elvin Hayes played
in a game and touched the ball 41 times. Hayes shot it 40 times and
lost it out of bounds on the 41st. Or the time Caldwell Jones,
starting center for the great Philadelphia 76ers teams of the
1970s, told a reporter that the highlight of his life was when the
Flintstones went from 30 minutes to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get him started. Warshaw can go on for hours. In fact, his
lasting legacy is ``Classic Sports,'' the Old School paradise. Two
of his friends, Steve Greenberg and Brian Bedol, called him in 1995
and told him about their plan for the cable network. Warshaw was so
excited he immediately told his wife he finally had a place for all
the useless information in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN bought Classic in 1997, reportedly for $175 million. As one
of the founding partners, Warshaw had some cash but no job. Two
years ago, he installed a cable modem at his home, and that sparked
what would become a new career. ``I got up around 11:05 p.m. and
woke up my wife,'' Warshaw said. ``I told her it was 1939 and
someone had invented the television and we still had a radio.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife rolled over with nothing but thoughts of her husband
working at another start-up business. Six months later, in July
1999, Warshaw found another job as executive vice president of
content strategy and production with a New York-based Internet
video company, Softcom.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Softcom was a start-up company. Warshaw was the 15th
employee. And yes, it's a gem. The company already has attracted
$30 million in investments, and just last month Softcom merged with
Los Angeles-based Interactive Video Technologies and now goes under
its name.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all the corporate ties, what Softcom does is put meat
on the bare bones of television. It also gives viewers the ability
to get what they want when they want it.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is complicated, but the result is quite simple.
For example, ``The Sopranos'' is a hit series on HBO. Unless a
viewer has watched the show from the beginning, it's a little hard
to follow all the relationships within the mob families. Softcom
produced the ``Sopranos Family Tree'' to enable viewers to follow
the show better. Traffic increased four to five times on HBO.com,
in part because of that interactive video.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to replicate what's already on television,''
Warshaw said. ``We use our technology and applications to create
the most complementary and compelling programming.''
</P>
<P>
   E! Online's Enhanced Oscars hired Softcom to produce an
interactive component for its coverage of the Academy Awards. Lew
Harris, E! Online editor in chief, said in a published report that
about 5,000 users took part in the Oscarcast chat, about two to
three times the traffic of a regular chat site.
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday, HBO.com will unveil its latest product with
Softcom for the Prince Naseem Hamed-Augie Sanchez fight. HBO.com
will offer prefight information with fighter stats, profiles, and
interviews as well as weigh-in footage the day of the fight. During
the bout, the site will offer round-by-round scoring and chats and
clips from past fights. And while the site will not have live
video, it will have audio of the trainers of both fighters between
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to just have cool stuff on our clients' Web
sites,'' said Warshaw. ``We want stuff that makes viewers smile and
say, `I want to use that' or `I need that.' We understand better
than anybody the relationship between technology and content. It's
not 1939 anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The interactive programming enables networks to extend the life
of their programming. Instead of a show appearing only for 30
minutes or two hours, the programming now has another life on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sports TV on steroids,'' said Warshaw. ``The parade is
about to take off. You don't want to be too far in front. But as
the pipes get fatter and the technology gets thinner, and the
people that control content get smarter and more visionary, we will
see this explosion.''

&HT;     SOUTH FLORIDA RESTAURANT PLANS EXPANSION TO SAN ANTONIO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Descendants of the Somoza family that ruled
Nicaragua for more than 40 years plan to open a restaurant on San
Antonio's popular River Walk.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, Los Ranchos restaurant, is to be the first built
outside of South Florida. There, brothers Julio and Carlos Somoza
operate six of the award-winning South American steak restaurants
in the Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Ranchos restaurant announcement completes a four-year
dream by the Somoza brothers, who are nephews of the Anastasio
Somoza Debayle, the last in the line of Somoza family members who
ruled Nicaragua for most of the period between 1936 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasio Somoza was assassinated in 1980, a year after he left
Nicaragua in exile. Jose Somoza, the father of the U.S.-educated
Somoza brothers, was a military general during Anastasio Somoza's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Somoza said he has harbored a desire to open a River Walk
restaurant since 1986, when he visited the city as a tourist. The
River Walk is a mainstay of San Antonio's tourist trade, lined with
restaurants, clubs, shops and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Julio, 49, and Carlos, 48, own 50 percent of the six Los Ranchos
restaurants in the Miami area, but they have secured a licensing
agreement from their partners to operate the San Antonio restaurant
under their name.
</P>
<P>
   Los Ranchos was named by Gourmet magazine as the best restaurant
for families in a 1999 readers' survey for the Miami/Fort
Lauderdale area.
</P>
<P>
   The moderately priced restaurant chain is known for its
tenderloin steak cuts marinated in chimichurri sauce, as well as
for its cheeses and sweet milk-drenched cake desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Another Los Ranchos restaurant also is planned for a 2001
opening in Coconut Grove, Fla., but the San Antonio restaurant is
the first outside of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Somoza said he favored San Antonio for its ambiance and
its Latin culture and population. Another plus, he said, is that
the city draws a large number of Hispanic tourists, while the
Convention Center expansion is expected to help San Antonio become
one of the top 10 U.S. convention cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 7 million River Walk visitors a year,'' Julio Somoza
said. ``We are very enthusiastic (that) we will be very successful.
We have been patient because (the Peterson Building) is an
outstanding location.''

IT'S BACK TO BASIC TRAINING FOR FRIESZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM KALEC  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ After spending the last 10 summers in NFL
training camps, John Friesz has gotten used to a routine.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up every morning, head to the field, stretch, practice,
watch some film, and go to sleep. The sites may change (the
Patriots are Friesz's fourth team), but the routine always remained
the same.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the routine changed.
</P>
<P>
   Friesz was lost.
</P>
<P>
   In every other camp, Friesz had plenty of conversations with the
head coach and offensive coordinators, letting Friesz know how
things were progressing, what they liked and disliked, and what was
expected of him during camp.
</P>
<P>
   It was never anything complicated or enlightening, but these
brief talks helped put the veteran quarterback at ease _ a sign
that he was once again in familiar surroundings working through his
familiar football custom. This year, however, new head coach Bill
Belichick and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis remained silent
for the first week.
</P>
<P>
   Friesz's comfort level dropped, and the mind games began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't being informed of how things were going, so you kind
of start thinking to yourself,'' Friesz said. ``You start thinking,
`This scenario, that scenario. This is what they are thinking.' And
it is just nice to know what the news is. Good, bad, or indifferent
_ be honest with me. Just tell me what the news is.''
</P>
<P>
   While his teammates went through drills when camp opened in
Foxborough, Friesz was isolated. Instead of strapping on a helmet,
Friesz pumped his legs on an exercise bike and was forced to run
the perimeter of the field over and over in front of hundreds of
fans after he failed to meet Belichick's desired time in the
50-yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   That was Friesz's first sign that things were not going well.
But still he was never told so, leaving him time to do two things _
get in shape and think.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the mind games, Friesz engaged in his own brand
of mental warfare and it helped tremendously when Weis finally
broke the news that Friesz would not be getting any playing time
for the first two exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   As the Patriots' only experienced backup to Drew Bledsoe, Friesz
knew his time would eventually come. And when it did, he was
determined to make sure his mind games kept him on top of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the situation right now, with the limited amount of reps
I have received in the last two weeks, and I guess, really
nonexistent reps, I have had to try harder than ever to stay into
it mentally . . . to get mental reps,'' Friesz said. ``I have had
to spend extra time in the playbook because I have not been able to
do it on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Monday) felt like the first day of training camp because it
was the first time in 16 days that I got in the huddle and actually
called plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesz shared the majority of snaps with Bledsoe in practice
and, despite his lack of time under center, looked relatively
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to spend extra time studying. You have to spend extra
time, literally, visualizing what you are going to do on the
plays,'' Friesz said. ``Sometimes it is the simple stuff like
running plays. You tend to forget about running plays but we have
different footwork. Sometimes you are opening to the hole, away
from the hole, reverse pivoting, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the sudden, when you are back under center, you catch
yourself going, `Hold it, here.' You forget the most basic things
just because you have not physically done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night against a revamped Washington Redskins defense,
Friesz will get his chance to combine the physical and mental
preparations. He will most likely relieve Bledsoe to start the
second half. Friesz should see playing time in the final exhibition
games against Tampa Bay and Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the physical action will cease and X's and O's will
fill Friesz's thoughts once more.
</P>
<P>
   In seven seasons, Bledsoe has played in 106 of 112 possible
regular-season games. Friesz appeared in only one game last year
and didn't attempt a pass.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves these exhibition games as Friesz's best chance to
compete and make amends for the problems a couple of tenths of a
second caused for him when camp opened.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this could be Friesz's best chance to get out of
the doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what Friesz is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply football. A chance to forget the games Belichick,
Weis, and even Friesz himself waged in July in his own head and
continue playing the real games on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an opportunity to go play football again,'' Friesz said.
``It is fun. I enjoy the game and I am not going to make a big deal
out of this. I am going to go out there and try and be 100 percent
on getting the play called correctly and going about my read
correctly. The physical part has always taken care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, so has the mental.

RULES OF COOL GET A WARM COMEUPPANCE IN `TAO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE TAO OF STEVE 
Directed by: Jenniphr(cq) Goodman 
Screenplay by: Duncan North, Jenniphr &AMP; Greer Goodman 
Starring: Donal Logue, Greer Goodman, Kimo Wills, Ayelet Kaznelson,
David Aaron Baker, Nina Jaroslaw, John Hines, Selby Craig, Craig
Lafayette 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great thing about ``The Tao of Steve,'' Jenniphr Goodman's
smart, sparkling, convention-defying romantic comedy, is the way it
flies in the face of genre expectations. Actually, it may be a
stretch to use the word ``flies'' in the case of the film's
protagonist, Donal Logue's Dex. He shows up at his 10th-anniversary
high school reunion in Santa Fe in a scruffy beard and a Hawaiian
flowered shirt that barely covers the sizable beer gut he has
acquired since his glory days as the school's babe magnet. As one
fellow alum puts it upon sighting the new Dex: ``You used to be
Elvis, man! What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing is not that a few of the women at the reunion
admit to having slept with Dex when they all were in school, but
that Dex is still pulling women into his orbit. As his
ex-classmates momentarily interrupt their palaver about their
start-ups and IPOs, they look on in disbelief as Dex puts some
moves on the cute student bartender and obviously seems to be
getting somewhere. How does he do it? That's where the film's title
comes in, or at least Dex thinks it does. His sex life is as active
as it is, he's convinced, because he plays it cool.
</P>
<P>
   The Tao part has to do with never trying too hard, at least not
overtly. Steve is Steve McQueen, Dex's god. The way to seem sexy,
Dex repeatedly instructs his roommate, Kimo Wills's good-natured
but hopelessly dim Dave, is never to push things, or even appear to
try at all. Instead, he explains to Dave, whose nonstop
incomprehension is one of the film's ongoing sources of mirth, do
something excellent to demonstrate your sexual worthiness. Dex is
clever, charming, witty, and smart enough to come on
self-deprecatingly. But, of course, there's a gap between what he
says and what he does.
</P>
<P>
   He's actually interested in Greer Goodman's Syd, the snazzy
blond playing drums at the reunion, and his attentions to her are
filled with virtuosic indirection. Things all but blow up in his
face when she informs him that they slept together in high school,
after it's obvious that he doesn't remember. Then the film moves
from clever to really interesting, as Dex is really challenged to
impress Syd, who's too aware to be scammed by the glib verbiage of
the glib, potbellied one-man love boat. He does have a few
qualities that are more than redeeming. Some he doesn't even know
about. Or is it just that he's shrewd enough to exploit them? His
clumsiness and physical limitations, for instance, which bring out
Syd's maternal side after a disastrous camping trip.
</P>
<P>
   Dex can be captivating and disarming. What he has to learn is to
trust to his innate appeal and not think he has to scam his way to
love. Just how smart and insightful the film is about what really
counts, and how accurate it is about women's patience in waiting
for men to catch up to them emotionally, is proof that it can only
have been written from a woman's perspective (or at least clarified
by such, since it was based on the experiences of the Goodman
sisters' friend, Duncan North). Logue's Dex reminds us that the
ability to make someone laugh can be sexier than any bicep.
</P>
<P>
   You'll care whether he can work his way past his own cleverness
and become the most improbable romantic hero of the season if he
can prove himself worthy of a woman's mercy and desire to bet on
heart, not slickness. Logue and the Goodman sisters reinvigorate
the genre, not because they're avant-garde, but because they
convince us they're of the here and now, while the rest of the
genre has become derriere-garde. One of the year's most winning
performances, Logue's Dex will grow on you as he stumbles toward
emotional fullness. Greer Goodman is a dynamite combination _
savvy, sexy, and kind _ and Jenniphr Goodman reminds us, as too few
filmmakers do, that sentient can be sexy, too. Maybe this really is
a new millennium. Already this year we've had three terrific
romantic comedies: ``Wonder Boys,'' ``High Fidelity,'' and now
``The Tao of Steve.''

   DON'T UNDERESTIMATE AOL LATIN AMERICA, by David Kurapka
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster reception of investors to the initial public
offering AOL Latin America (AOLA on the Nasdaq) speaks less about
America Online and its strategy in the region then about interest
in Latin American Internet plays in general.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Latin America may never be able to dominate the region the
way its parent company has dominated the U.S. Of course, that does
not mean that their regional hopes will come to naught, just that
they are coming to the party while everyone is still nursing a
hangover. And sooner or later the party will start again.

OPTIMISM WINS IN `WONDERLAND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
WONDERLAND 
Directed by: Michael Winterbottom 
Screenplay by: Laurence Coriat 
Starring: Shirley Henderson, Gina McKee, Molly Parker, Ian Hart,
John Simm, Stuart Townsend, Kika Markham, Jack Shepherd, Enzo
Cilenti, Sarah-Jane Potts, David Fahm, Ellen Thomas 
Running time: 108 minutes 
Rated: R (some strong sexuality, and for language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Mike Leigh's camera regularly prowled the streets of
Margaret Thatcher's England has a film so convincingly plunged into
bleak urban life with the ensemble zest of Michael Winterbottom's
``Wonderland.'' It's not as different as you might suppose from
Winterbottom's best-known film, ``Welcome to Sarajevo.'' There, the
bombings and cannonings were literal. Here, they're emotional and
psychic. The wonder in ``Wonderland'' is that the characters
flailing around in it haven't slashed their wrists. But then the
film isn't really about the misery in which they're all sloshing
around. It's about the less immediately apparent resilience with
which they strive to surmount it.
</P>
<P>
   The great paradox of postwar English drama is the gusto with
which it pursues its theme of national devitalization.
``Wonderland'' is very much of this hardy ilk. It's carried by a
raw, documentary flavor _ this is one of the few films in which
hand-held camera technique doesn't seem an irritant. Instead, it
propels the multi-track efforts of a dozen or so characters as they
try to fill some yawning emotional gaps in their lives. In the
hands of a less engaged director, a less artful screenplay and a
less energized ensemble that obviously takes to the sometimes
spiky, sometimes despairing, always prickly emotions they're given,
``Wonderland'' could easily crash and burn. Instead, it keeps
going, all the way to something that could almost be called an
optimistic ending.
</P>
<P>
   At its core are three women whose relationship is clarified as
the film progresses. Shirley Henderson's single-mom hairdresser,
Debbie, would seem to be facing the longest odds. Her ex, an angry
lout played by Ian Hart, is unreliable about spending time with
their 11-year-old son on weekends, which complicates Debbie's
spirited efforts to sleep with whomever she fancies and leaves
their son on his own more than he wants to be. She's all too aware
that whatever she's making in bed with this bloke or that, it isn't
love. Yet she's not resentful of Molly Parker's sweet, pregnant
newlywed (also named Molly) whose husband has a steady job and
whose future seems, if not golden, at least stable.
</P>
<P>
   But Molly's husband hates his job and feels the walls closing
in, and is ready to bolt. Although both women have men, they're no
better off than Gina McKee's Nadia, whose Olive Oyl body language
and Raggedy Ann hairstyles emphasize her gawkiness as she tries not
to let her desperation show each time she follows up a personal ad.
McKee, who will be remembered as the hostess to Hugh Grant's
friends in ``Notting Hill,'' reinforces the strong impression she
made in that film. Then there's an older couple, Kika Markham's
Eileen and Jack Shepherd's Bill, draining the life out of one
another in a marital standoff of years' standing in a dreary
council flat. There's also a sketchily drawn young couple, Enzo
Cilenti and Sarah-Jane Potts, who check into a hotel under veiled
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   You can small the symbolism when you learn that the film's
chilly November action takes place on the eve of Guy Fawkes Day,
when bonfires are traditionally lit to commemorate an aborted
17th-century anarchist plot to blow up Parliament. More to the
point, you'll care what blows up here and what doesn't and which
fires can be put out, and why. ``Wonderland'' is not a work of
existential resonance; it's soap opera shot in unvarnished verite
style. But it's lively soap opera, ratcheting up the intensity with
freshness and immediacy. Give it a chance and you'll probably share
the cast's collective impulse to dive in and embrace it, even if
the it in question turns out to be what Langston Hughes once called
the sweet flypaper of life, and even if that flypaper is just as
sticky in Tony Blair's London as it was in Margaret Thatcher's.

   If you absolutely cannot wait until next month's ``Exorcist''
reissue, there's always ``Bless the Child,'' latest in a long and
apparently unending line of ``Exorcist'' and ``Omen'' knockoffs.
The computer graphics-assisted differences here are that the forces
of good are more apparent than usual and that Kim Basinger's
madonna figure does most of the work of taking on Rufus Sewell's
devil's disciple, who more than meets his monthly overhead by
fronting a self-empowerment cult. Holliston Coleman manages to look
both adorable and empathetic as the child with special powers
they're both fighting over. But the air pretty quickly goes out of
an initial attempt at characterization and what follows is more
hollow than scary.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a much more secure grip on dark, sleek urban
visuals, starting with a lingering pan around a stone gargoyle,
shiny with rain, looming high over the streets of New York at
night. Cut to the doorway of the shabby Brooklyn apartment house
where Basinger's nurse, Maggie O'Connor, lives. When she sees a
stranger huddled in her doorway, she draws back, only to recognize
her drug-addicted younger sister bearing a baby wrapped in a
blanket. This promising twist on an urban nativity scene quickly
becomes ordinary as the sister departs. The childless Maggie raises
the girl, who turns out to be slightly autistic, but can do things
like telekinetically make plates spin. Cut to six years later, when
the sister returns on the arm of Sewell's well-to-do empowerment
guru.
</P>
<P>
   They remove the child by force, and a tug-of-war ensues, with
Maggie enlisting the aid of Jimmy Smits' FBI agent attached to New
York's finest to help solve the serial killings of children with
the same birth date as Maggie's young niece. The FBI man
understands all possible supernatural dimensions of the situation,
having conveniently been provided with a background as a
seminarian. So it's them and the police, augmented by a few angelic
interventions, against the forces of darkness, predictably togged
out as a black-clad heavy metal group with a suburban goth look.
</P>
<P>
   A few killings, car chases, and conflagrations later, it all
comes down to a confrontation in a neo-medieval chapel following
episodes squandering Ian Holm and Christina Ricci in minor roles.
Smits is pretty monochromatic, but he'd have to be a miracle worker
to do much more than he does with the perfunctorily written role of
the lawman. A bravely deglamorized Basinger's heart seems to be in
the right place, but the pedestrian script locks her into an
unvaryingly mundane mode. The deflatingly ordinary ``Bless the
Child'' causes one to wish, not for the first time, that movies
about the supernatural could make contact with supernatural script
doctors.

STRING CHEESE GETS MILEAGE OUT OF VARIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the start, members of the String Cheese Incident knew what
they wanted. The idea was to build a fan base through live shows
rather than hustling after radio airplay or making videos. In
short, they set out to follow the same jam-band tradition that has
held true from the Grateful Dead to Phish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot in common with the Dead, actually,'' says String
Cheese Incident bassist Keith Moseley. ``We play long shows and we
have people following us on the road. They know that we're more
interested in the shows than in jumping through record-company
hoops.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed seven years ago in Colorado, where band members first
went to pursue recreational lifestyles in skiing and bicycling, the
Incident has played up to 230 shows a year. It is now down to about
125 (``A couple of us are married now and are trying to spend some
time at home,'' says Moseley).
</P>
<P>
   What separates the String Cheese Incident from the pack,
however, is its musical variety. How many bands can cover songs by
bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe and jazz god Miles Davis? The
Incident can. The band can also branch into Latin jazz, world beat,
classic rock (it opened with an Afro-spiced version of Bob Dylan's
``Tom Thumb's Blues'' at the Newport Folk Festival last weekend),
plus who knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might do a loping, 6/8 Afro-pop tune _ you don't hear that
from most jam bands,'' Moseley says. ``Then we might go into
something with a Cajun or Latin feel. We spend a lot of time on our
set lists, and we like to have everybody in the band singing every
night. Also, there are songs with jams built in every night. We
might say, `Let's jam on a particular chord progression' or `Let's
do something that sounds like Pink Floyd here.' The jam part of the
night is really hit or miss.''
</P>
<P>
   He's being modest, because the jams usually hit more often than
miss. Just ask anyone who has seen the String Cheese Incident
lately, because the group has improved vastly since just a couple
of years ago. And it has come eons from its first gig at a talent
show at the Crested Butte Center for the Arts in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really liked our music right away, but we couldn't
figure out why at first,'' says guitarist Bill Nershi with a laugh.
``When we started, it was more acoustic-based. We were doing
Newgrass and David Grisman-style jazz and swing. Then we added a
drum kit and electric mandolin and some rock-based stuff with
vocals. And when Kyle Hollingsworth (the keyboardist) joined in
1996, he brought in the Latin and Afro styles.''
</P>
<P>
   The band really started to pick up with the addition of
Hollingsworth. ``He has a degree in jazz piano, so that has really
helped,'' says Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the group's Web site, at www.stringcheeseincident.com
generates 1 million hits a month. The band also has its own label
(Sci Fidelity Records) and its own ticketing service and travel
agency. Call it grass roots with a capital G.
</P>
<P>
   The group is presently pooling tracks for a double live album
due this fall _ and has hired Steve Berlin (saxophonist for Los
Lobos) to produce the next studio album. These are exciting times
for the Incident _ and definitely not bad for a band that started
as a side project.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Counting Crows come aLive: The Counting Crows are skilled at
choosing compatible bands to bring on tour. Their last summer tour
found them paired with the Wallflowers. This time it's with the
band Live, whose singer, Ed Kowalczyk, has become a good friend of
Crows vocalist Adam Duritz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first met Ed years ago at a festival in Holland,'' says
Duritz. ``I was at his show with a video camera, shooting up at him
from the pit. He looked down and recognized me. At first he said,
`Who is the (expletive) guy with the video camera?' Then he said,
`Oh, I know you from TV.' Then we ran into each other back in Los
Angeles and we've since become friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Counting Crows and Live play the Tweeter Center on Wednesday
(with a third act, Galactic, a New Orleans band also friendly with
Duritz). The tour so far has been highlighted by Duritz joining
Live on their song ``Dolphins Cry,'' and Kowalczyk joining the
Crows on ``Hanginaround.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed and I thought our bands would be a good fit, but it's been
even better than we expected,'' says Duritz. ``And I get inspired
by watching Live's set. Halfway through it, I'm completely feverish
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences are responding too. The Crows/Live tour has been
averaging 12,000 to 15,000 people per night. ``It's been great,
especially because neither of us has a record in the Top 100 right
now,'' says Duritz.
</P>
<P>
   It's further evidence of how the Crows continue to do things
their way _ and get away with it. As Duritz says, ``I don't want to
shill for MTV. I don't want to go to (MTV's) beach parties or award
shows just to make it. I'm thinking of this in the long term. I
don't want to burn out. A lot of the music scene can be
soul-killing, but I'm still pleased and proud to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Duritz admits, however, that in the media the Crows are
``probably more respected than liked. I think a lot of journalists
and radio and TV people feel that way. But we know we're loved by
our fans and by a lot of other musicians. That keeps us going.''

PERFECT CIRCLE TAKES A RIGHT-BRAIN APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trends suggest that bands have to be loud, angry, and
belligerent to gain success in rock today, but, thankfully, that's
not always true. Artistic merit can still count for something, as
shown by A Perfect Circle, an alluringly mysterious Los Angeles
group that has become one of the breakthrough acts of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Deemed an ``art-rock'' or ``art-metal'' band, terms not heard
much anymore, A Perfect Circle features an unlikely teaming of
singer Maynard Keenan (best known as the singer of Tool) and
guitarist Billy Howerdel, a former guitar tech for Nine Inch Nails,
Fishbone, and Smashing Pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   The band opens a national headlining tour with a sold-out date
at Avalon in Boston next Friday. This follows a sumptuous album,
``Mer de Noms'' (translation: ``Sea of Names''), which improves
with repeated listens and stands freshly apart from the relentless,
often calculated anger that dominates rock radio.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's surprised to be doing so well and to have received
such a boost from the group's hit, ``Judith,'' Keenan says, ``No,
not really, considering the current state of music. There's nothing
out there right now. It's all posturing. A lot of these bands are
like businessmen. There's less focus on art, and more on
business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the name A Perfect Circle connotes a natural resolution,
the band actually came together by accident. Howerdel, who had also
worked as a guitar tech for Tool, wrote some instrumental songs
that Keenan chanced to hear and really liked. The pairing proved
fateful, for Howerdel was ready to pursue his dream of rock
songwriting (``I wasn't a frustrated guitar tech who wanted to get
onstage, but I was a frustrated writer who wanted to get back to
the hotel and write some more'') and it enabled Keenan to take a
break from being Tool's frontman. Keenan is a less central force in
A Perfect Circle, adding lyrics and layered vocal harmonies to
music Howerdel has already written.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing is being more interpretive rather than being
the centerpiece,'' says Keenan. ``It's the role I'm comfortable
with. I'm not comfortable with being the frontman, but I like using
my voice as an instrument. I can't play guitar or flute or anything
of that stuff. I'm a klutz with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare A Perfect Circle with Tool, Keenan hems and
haws, then answers, ``Every band has a different personality and
approach. If I have to be cornered into commenting, I'd say that A
Perfect Circle has more of a right-brain feminine approach. It's
more emotional and intuitive. And Tool is more mechanical and more
left-brain masculine, with an esoteric edge.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for another Tool album, but Keenan dispels
rumors that it's because of writer's block. ``We (Tool) have over
40 songs, so we have too many options. But I'm really not here to
talk about Tool right now,'' he says during a phone interview from
Winnipeg, where A Perfect Circle is wrapping up the Canadian
``Summersault'' tour opening for Smashing Pumpkins and the Foo
Fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile Howerdel is also a sound engineer who recently
finished two years of computer programming for the long-awaited and
still-delayed Guns N' Roses album. There he met ex-Vandals drummer
Josh Freese, who was auditioning for Guns but ended up in A Perfect
Circle. Freese had also played drums with Devo when the latter was
on the Lollapalooza tour. The other Perfect Circle members are
bassist Paz Lenchantin (who also plays violin) and guitarist Troy
Van Leeuwen.
</P>
<P>
   The group's evocative music is not always easy to grasp _
Keenan's vocals are often submerged in the mix, making it hard to
understand the words _ but, as Keenan says, the music is all about
``feeling'' and about ``the beauty and originality of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are an afterthought,'' he says. ``It's really about
getting the five of us in a room, reacting to sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The sounds are an atmospheric melange, ranging from the
old-school art-rock of ``Renholder'' (with guitar arpeggios
enhanced by violin) and the screeching guitars of ``Magdalena,'' to
the modern, drum-machine-spiked ``Thinking of You,'' a hopeful love
song that has Keenan singing ``Taking time to look into your eyes .
. . sweet revelation, sweet surrender.'' Many tracks have a hopeful
tone, especially compared with the disaffected nature of many Tool
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier art-rock of bands such as Yes and Emerson, Lake
&AMP; Palmer, some songs have a mythological bent, including
``Orestes'' and ``Sleeping Beauty.'' It figures that Keenan is a
big student of author Joseph Campbell, an expert on mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The band's main attribute, however, is the dramatic, sweeping
guitar lines of Howerdel, who says his chief influences are the
Cure and Ozzy Osbourne, specifically Ozzy's early guitarist, Randy
Rhoades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the biggest Randy Rhoades fan you could find,'' says
Howerdel, who grew up in New Jersey. ``I literally locked myself in
the basement for two years to learn every note he played. I was
also a big Blue Oyster Cult fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated now to presenting its songs on the road, A Perfect
Circle is looking forward to starting its headlining tour at the
sold-out Avalon, the smallest venue on its ever-increasing
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled and surprised at how quickly we've gotten the
band to this point,'' says Howerdel. ``I hope that people don't
burn out on us.''

`OPPORTUNISTS' A GEM OUT OF QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE OPPORTUNISTS 
Written and directed by: Myles Connell 
Starring: Christopher Walken, Peter McDonald, Cyndi Lauper, Vera
Farmiga, Donal Logue, Jose Zuniga, Tom Noonan, Anne Pitoniak, Olek
Krupa 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Victor Kelly's landlord sneers at him and calls him a loser
in ``The Opportunists,'' the label is not easy to refute.
Christopher Walken's Victor, trying inauspiciously to make a living
with a car repair shop after serving time for a botched
safecracking attempt, slogs around his Sunnyside neighborhood in
Queens like a man who asks only to be spared further hammerings. He
has put his life back together and achieved what might be called a
solid fragility. He knows how easily it could all be taken away
from him, how illusory the outward stability in his tight little
blue-collar enclave. And yet his back is being broken by
depressingly modest debts: $800 here, $1,700 there. Pride forbids
him to accept a loan of $2,000 his girfriend had put aside to
remodel the tavern she owns.
</P>
<P>
   He knows only one way to quickly get money. As hot and cold
running dread fills his veins, he succumbs to a plan by a couple of
pals who work as low-rent security guards. They are not the best
and the brightest. But, having just been put next to lots of money,
they can't resist trying to grab it. It's at this point that ``The
Opportunists'' takes on some of the gritty momentum of ``The
Asphalt Jungle'' _ with the asphalt cracked and weed-strewn.
Writer-director Myles Connell is Irish, although you'd think he
lived in Queens all his life, so easily and thoroughly does he
capture a believably idiosyncratic and specific corner of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Walken and Cyndi Lauper, who plays Vic's apprehensive
girlfriend, do come from Queens. But the thing that makes their
work here so deeply satisfying is not their regurgitation of the
speech and gestures of a world they remember well. Rather, it has
to do with their innate understanding of the attitudes that give
rise to their characters' speech and behavior patterns. Although
Vic is not beyond a degree of swagger, he's a guy for whom things
mostly have gone wrong, a guy who has learned to be careful and
wary. Lauper's Sally, meanwhile, practically doesn't need dialogue.
You can see everything she's thinking and feeling on her expressive
face. Not that every sound she makes isn't note-perfect. ``The
Opportunists'' is a film that's sensitive to the music of the
mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly it's because Connell grew up in Ireland romanticizing
America. In the film, his surrogate is a cheeky young immigrant
named Michael who shows up on Vic's doorstep, declaring himself the
son of Vic's dead uncle Frank back in Ireland, with whom Vic hadn't
kept in touch. Michael had heard stories about what a big-time
gangster Vic was, and he's jolted to find the truth so deflating.
That doesn't stop him from insinuating himself into the fold,
especially after he meets Vic's independent-minded grown daughter,
Miriam, compellingly played by Vera Farmiga, whose career is going
to take off sooner rather than later. Eyes bright with several
kinds of greed, Peter McDonald's Michael also writes himself into
Vic's safecracking caper, bringing to the job more cockiness than
competence.
</P>
<P>
   The gang that couldn't steal straight adds to the flavor and the
fun. Donal Logue, so terrific as the unlikely babe magnet in ``The
Tao of Steve,'' pungently plays a greasy slob hustler here, the
kind of guy who's mouthy with his friends, but likely to implode
when confronted by someone outside his safe little circle. Tom
Noonan is a huge asset, too, as the seedy safecracking expert to
whom Vic turns for a refresher course. ``The Opportunists'' goes
soft in the end, but not ruinously so. Meanwhile, its loose cannons
bounce off one another deliciously. To those familiar with his
acting only from highly stylized and highly armored gangland
kingpins, Walken's beleaguered role, so superbly acted and
unexpectedly moving in his appreciation of little comforts and
reassurances most of us take for granted, is a revelation.

HUMAN ISSUES, NESTLED IN A FISHING TOWN

GRAVESEND LIGHT 
By David Payne. 
Doubleday, 382pp. $$24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Payne is a writer whom readers take personally, a novelist
who speaks to their lives, whose books become part of their
experience. He began with a flourish in 1984 with the publication
of an exuberant fabulation, ``Confessions of a Taoist on Wall
Street.'' This was followed by another large novel, ``Early from
the Dance'' and, in 1993, a shorter country cousin, ``Ruin Creek,''
which was announced as the opening volume of a projected trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravesend Light,'' another wonderful book, now appears without
reference to a trilogy, and it can certainly be read independently,
although it picks up many of the principal characters and issues of
``Ruin Creek,'' while advancing the time 17 years, to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The setting again is the Outer Banks of North Carolina, to which
Joe Madden, now 28 and an anthropologist by profession, has
returned with personal and professional objectives. He wants to
study the isolated fishing community in Little Roanake before its
individuality and identity disappear in the common culture; he is
also on a journey of self-discovery, although he would probably
deny this, because he has closed off his emotional life. His
temperament and experiences have taught him to examine both sides
of every question _ except for those he's made his mind up about,
and in them there is no room for controversy. In a way he's like
Little Roanoke, although the community seems eager to accept the
benefits of progress while ignoring some of its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's experiences on a fishing boat and in the town, and a love
affair with a feisty feminist doctor, draw him out of his shell and
into the community of humanity. There are several stages in this
journey, and many key players. Some of them, like Joe's parents and
younger brother, return from ``Ruin Creek,'' altered but still
recognizeable as the figures in the old photographs that play a
role in the story. Some of them are new, like Ray Bristow, an
ex-con fisherman. Ray awkwardly tries to befriend Joe, who finds it
so hard to read the code of male friendship that there's no
possibility the the two will connect.
</P>
<P>
   What Ray wants, and fears, is to be seen for who he is, and to
be accepted; this, of course, is what Joe wants, and fears _ just
like his father, Jimmy, his mother, May, the woman he loves, Day
Shaughnessy, and just about everyone else in the book. Ultimately
nearly everyone comes to a new level of self-understanding and
therefore compassion for others. A violent storm, more terrifying
than anything the summer screen has provided, is the catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   Payne tells the story in alternating chapters, some from an
omniscient narrator tracking Joe, some in Day's buoyant but
anchored voice. Here she is at a community meeting. ``As we sat
down on the left, I saw . . . several men I'd dated _ mostly blind
and seldom twice. With their gold signet rings and graphite golf
clubs rattling in the Beamer's trunk, they tended to blur into a
single image: Topsiders without socks, a starched madras shirt, a
belt with yachting flags, a haircut like a twelve-year-old's, that
Tefloned, ultra-Southern, almost military-style politeness, so
friendly on the surface, to a true and searching intimacy so
opposed.``
</P>
<P>
   Joe and Day find themselves strongly drawn to each other,
despite conflicting views on just about everything. ``To him,
Little Roanoke was like a rare and precious ecosystem in a state of
fragile balance that had taken generations to create. When he
looked, that was what he saw: simplicity and character, old
folk-ways, seafaring traditions dating back to Devonshire in Walter
Raleigh's time; Joe saw the villagers' originality and ferocious
independence, their unwavering certainty as to who they were. When
I looked, I saw patriarchalism, religious dogma, bigotry toward
blacks and women. Our difference as lovers and human beings somehow
boiled down to our different views about this town . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Both views, of course, are accurately observed, and complement
each other, as Day and Joe must learn from a series of conflicts
over community issues and personalities, pregnancies past and
present, and a family Christmas as emotionally charged as the
earlier one depicted in ``Ruin Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Early from the Dance'' was an overpowering experience because
it was full of loose ends, like life. ``Ruin Creek'' and
``Gravesend Light'' are more schematic, like a movie script or a
``well-made'' play. But this characteristic isn't the liability it
often proves in popular fiction because Payne sees and hears the
human reality in every situation he has so painstakingly set up;
the book is certainly the captivating summer read promised in some
of the early publicity, but it is also something different from,
and more than, that.
</P>
<P>
   Payne pegs all of his characters as adroitly as a casting
director, but then they surprise us with things that don't
``belong'' there; he hears the variety and music of different kinds
of speech; he knows what things look like and how they feel in the
hand; he has learned how a fishing boat works and how complicated
the human heart is. His words are like stones, polished smooth,
then dropped into great depths, leaving every-widening ripples of
implication.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to make another comparison, his words are like fundamentals
in a musical bass, releasing many overtones, some of them
dissonant, but affecting the character of the harmony. The book
demonstrates the value of instinct, the virtue of thinking twice.
Payne sees his characters for who they are, accepts them, loves
them, and joins their voices in a hymn of life.

   THREATENING-BOYFRIEND (Boston) _ For Angelique Uhlmann, the
nightmare began at 4:30 a.m. last Sunday morning, when her
ex-boyfriend, an intellectual property lawyer, phoned her at her

stigma on a land management tool that maybe could have diminished
the fuels - overgrown brush and trees that have grown unchecked for
decades - that have fed this summer's burns. ``We have been in the

try to stamp out a widespread, and often fatal, parasitic disease,

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ ``Unless we take action now, our
nation may confront a situation similar to the Great Depression _
and maybe even worse.'' The presidential candidate who made this
frightening prediction is lying low. His political party, however,
currently has a high profile. It is being torn apart from within.
It turns out that Ross Perot's leadership was not needed to save
America from another Great Depression. But Perot may be needed to

Ellen Henry bought a home in what I take to be a subdivision.
Hoping to spruce up their front yard, which likely had been left
bare of trees by greedy developers, they paid $15 each for a pair
of pink flamingos. They described the colorful birds as ``lawn
decoration.'' Their neighbors, certainly not Southern-born, thought
the colorful birds were tacky eyesores. (Jim Minter is a former

where such a thing can happen?'' Meanwhile, in the months and weeks
leading up to the election, as the two major parties moved
inexorably to the nomination of yet another daring combination of

&HT;     NEW OWNER NAMES EDITOR, MANAGER FOR SAN FRANCISCO DAILY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIN McCORMICK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Martha ``Marty'' Steffens and Robert McCray have
been named the editor and general manager of the San Francisco
Examiner under its new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives, whose appointments were announced Thursday,
will be key leaders in the remaking of the Examiner under Ted Fang,
the publisher of a three-times-a-week newspaper in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp., which recently bought the San Francisco
Chronicle for $660 million, is transferring the Examiner to Fang
and his family _ along with a $66 million subsidy for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle and Examiner have operated under a joint operating
agreement since 1965, combining business operations and splitting
profits while maintaining separate editorial staffs. The agreement
was to run through 2005 but was terminated by the sale, which
formally occurred last month after a bitter court fight over
whether the deal violated anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens and McCray hint at ambitious plans for reshaping the
newspaper in a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at places like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles,
these are major metropolitan cities that support multiple daily
newspapers,'' said McCray, 42, who will take over the Examiner's
business operations in November. ``I think San Francisco is the
kind of city that can support more than one newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   McCray is currently general manager of the Blade in Toledo,
Ohio. He has also worked at the Los Angeles Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens, 47, the former editor of the Binghamton (N.Y.) Press &AMP;
Sun-Bulletin, will take charge of the Examiner's editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   Both acknowledge they face a huge challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very, very busy,'' Steffens said.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner was acquired by Fang and his politically prominent
family as part of Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. To avoid
anti-trust problems with the U.S. Justice Department, Hearst
transferred the smaller Examiner to the Fangs. Hearst is running
the newspaper during a four-month transition period.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs have said they intend to convert the Examiner from an
afternoon newspaper to morning publication focusing on San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the newspaper will start its new life with a big
influx of cash from its former owner, journalism experts say it has
some major hurdles to overcome to survive in the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a very tough road ahead of it,'' said Ben Bagdikian,
former dean of the journalism school at the University of
California at Berkeley and the author of ``Media Monopoly.'' ``It's
going to be up against a very big newspaper, owned by a very rich
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bagdikian said it is encouraging to see the Fangs hiring
people who are nationally established in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are serious about putting out a paper, this is the
first step,'' he said. ``You bring in a general manager who has
some experience and an editor who has some experience, and you
begin remaking the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Both managers said they would conduct national searches to build
a quality staff.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Examiner employees can join the
Chronicle, which has the same union contract _ an opportunity most
are expected to take. The Fang family, which currently runs the
free community paper, the Independent, is not expected to have a
unionized staff.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless Steffens invited current Examiner staff members to
apply for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think money will be a problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While she would not be specific for ``proprietary reasons,''
Steffens said her goal will be to find ways for the newspaper to
reach new audiences in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens, who has worked at the Orange County Register and the
Los Angeles Times, has long been a supporter of civic journalism,
which advocates that newspapers work to improve the cities they
serve.
</P>
<P>
   At the Binghamton paper, she created a local forum and related
newspaper series focusing on what could be done to prevent the
community from being hurt by economic downsizing, according to
Schaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is doing journalism that is being used for text books,''
Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   McCray became general manager of the Toledo Blade just eight
months ago, after working at its sister paper, the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. McCray was praised by those who had worked with him
in the past, as being one of the rarest types of business managers:
one who understands newspapering.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Leader, a current Los Angeles Times editor and former
Examiner staffer, praised McCray's work at the Blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed that he very much recognized the importance of
journalism,'' Leader said. ``This is a high-energy guy.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is the oldest house in San Francisco and it
sits on top of what is arguably the city's most expensive three-car
garage.
</P>
<P>
   It is 1032 Broadway, a home on the saddle of Nob Hill originally
built in 1853 with subsequent additions designed by architect
Willis Polk at the turn of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   It earned a nickname as the ``Flag House'' in the fiery
aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this piece of Bay Area history has become the latest
sample of Mitch Menaged's love affair with San Francisco's old
houses. The painstakingly restored home will go on sale next week.
The asking price is $4,995,000.
</P>
<P>
   To the highest bidder will go a four-bedroom, four-bath,
five-fireplace home with sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay
and downtown.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a three-car garage cut into the hillside and an
elevator to whisk homeowners to and from their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two years to do this project,'' said Menaged, leaning
back against the granite kitchen counter top. ``It's one of best
I've worked on and one of the most challenging,'' said a man who
views his work with a mixture of enthusiasm and modesty.
</P>
<P>
   Menaged's company, Historic San Francisco Homes, has an
established reputation for restoring older homes _ and for
providing surprising entertainment at the openings. This event will
be no exception. When asked what it will be, Menaged grinned and
simply said: ``It will be the best we've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   A preview for invited guests will be held at the house on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent tour of the older part of the house, Menaged
pointed excitedly to the brass plaque near the front door bearing
the 1853 date; to the hand-carved pillars at the foot of the
interior staircase; and to the original flooring.
</P>
<P>
   Beams from a ship's cabin brace the dining room ceiling. The
wood has been carefully cleaned and covered with a protective
stain.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper floor of the original section of the home, Menaged
led a visitor to the master bathroom. ``You really have to see
this,'' he said. And there stood a corner bathtub with a view of
the Bay on one side and of the Financial District on the other, a
clear glass-enclosed double shower, separate sinks and smooth stone
floors.
</P>
<P>
   While the restoration work below breathed history back into the
building, the upper floors glowed with luxury. The high ceilings
and tall doors have been kept; hardwood floors and fireplace
mantles have been stripped and cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely love of art and history of the old house that
has made Menaged take such pains with the restoration. ``This is a
registered historic landmark and the landmark preservation people
had access during the work here,'' he said. ``It also means that
there is an oversight provided to assure we maintain the historical
integrity of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The house was originally built for Joseph H. Atkins, a brick
contractor. After the 1906 earthquake and during the ensuing fire,
the army was ordered to dynamite the house on Nob Hill. But Aktins'
descendants raised the U.S. flag over the house and the soldiers
refused to destroy the home.
</P>
<P>
   It was Atkins' daughter, Catherine, who hired Willis Polk to
expand the house at the turn of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   For Menaged, this project now ends, but others he is working on
continue around San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 2,500 of these historic homes in San Francisco. In
the past several years, my company has done 100 restorations. There
are still lots to do.''

&HT;     EVEN THE KID CAN'T SAVE `BLESS THIS CHILD' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRIS WORRELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The most entertaining thing about ``Bless the
Child'' is that Satan's last stand takes place in a creepy mansion
off Route 17 ``just outside Albany.'' It's a rare and
unintentionally hilarious moment in an otherwise hollow and
familiar film. Never mind that the real Route 17 is closer to New
York City than the state capital. Bad geography is the least of
this film's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of ``Bless the Child'' seems more like a haunted house
at an amusement park than a genuinely scary good-vs.-evil movie.
It's as if the filmmakers went down a checklist of things generally
found in horror and supernatural films and then crammed them all
into one movie. Rats? Check. Rolling heads? Check. Flying demons,
bats and gargoyles? Check, check, check.
</P>
<P>
   The story revolves around Maggie O'Connors (Kim Basinger), a
nurse in a New York hospital whose stringy-haired, strung-out kid
sister, Jenna (Angela Bettis), shows up on her doorstep one rainy
Christmas Eve and saddles Maggie with an autistic newborn named
Cody.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie mothers the abandoned baby until six years later, when
Jenna suddenly reappears and, with her mysterious new husband, Eric
Stark (Rufus Sewell), abducts Cody (Holliston Coleman). Despite the
fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, FBI agent John Travis
(Jimmy Smits), an expert in ritual homicide and occult-related
crime, takes up her cause when he realizes that Cody shares the
same birth date as several other recently missing children.
</P>
<P>
   But Cody is different. She revives dead birds. She makes plates
spin. She hugs people. She is obviously mankind's last hope. Sound
familiar? Screenwriters Clifford and Ellen Green also wrote ``The
Seventh Sign,'' a 1988 movie starring Demi Moore as the mother of
mankind's other last hope.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key elements of bad horror movies is that they must
feature a completely idiotic heroine, someone so empty-headed that
she trusts the wrong people, walks into abandoned alleys and opens
doors that any fool knows should be left closed. Hmmm, should she
confront Satan's foot soldiers alone, in the dark (gasp!) woods?
Why of course! What could happen? Everybody loves a blonde!
</P>
<P>
   Basinger does her best Stepford-wife imitation here. Without
even a hint of personality, Basinger sleepwalks her way through
encounters with some of horror's greatest hits: Druid symbols,
Satanic teenagers, creepy cults.
</P>
<P>
   The considerable talents of Ian Holm (``The Sweet Hereafter'')
are wasted in his role as Rev. Grissom, a wheelchair-bound
ex-priest who is meant to lend moral heft to the movie but instead
merely delivers more hocus-pocus.
</P>
<P>
   And poor Jimmy Smits. The talented actor left his role as a
strong but caring detective on television's ``NYPD Blue'' only to
be cast in this movie as a strong but caring detective who isn't as
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Director Chuck Russell, who also directed the fast-paced films
``The Mask'' and ``Eraser,'' takes the opposite approach here,
slowing down the action to a painful crawl. He even filmed some
segments in slow motion, perhaps to detract from the robotic
Basinger.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 7-year-old Holliston Coleman, who plays Cody, delivers
the best performance of the film. She's cute, and you can tell she
really wants to save the world. She just couldn't save this movie.

HILLARY REVISITED
</HEADLINE>
  Time for a second look at first lady 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Rob LowmanJust in time for the this week's Democratic Convention in
Los Angeles is the release of the paperback version of Gail
Sheehy's look at the first lady, ``Hillary's Choice'' ($16;
Ballantine).
</P>
<P>
   The book brought mixed reviews when it was released last year,
but Sheehy has made some revisions and has added a chapter now that
the first lady is running for a U.S. Senate from New York State.
</P>
<P>
   In the new material, Sheehy discusses: why Hillary is running;
whether the withdrawal of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from the
race over health and marital woes has helped or hurt her cause;
what the president feels now that the roles are being reversed;
what professional women in New York think about her; and what she
has learned now that she's out in the spotlight instead of being
behind the scenes managing Bill's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The book also dives into the Clinton marriage, which has been
rocked more than once by the president's affairs, and why Hillary
has stayed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is in many ways the classic philanderer, like a
little boy who comes back after being bad and looks for Mother's
forgiveness. Hillary provides it,'' Sheehy writes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you buy that or not is up to you, but with Bill and
Hillary running around town this week, it makes for interesting
reading.

ROBOTS LEND A HAND _ AND AN ARM _ TO AID DOCTORS

<P>
   ``Paging Dr. D2. Would Dr. R2-D2 please report to the operating
room stat _ without stopping for refueling, reprogramming or an
electrical tune-up?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. For your next surgery, the
surgeon may handle the questions and consultation, but a robot
could be the one stitching you up. Where the very thought of
doctors using computerized equipment once seemed like something out
of an Arthur C. Clarke fantasy, medicine has now gone a step
further. Claiming advanced technology benefits both surgeon and
patient, doctors throughout Europe and at a handful of hospitals
throughout the United States are using robots to surgically correct
heartburn, affect weight loss, gall bladder removals and certain
gynecological procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The robotic instruments also have been used for select cardiac
surgeries _ such as heart bypass _ in Europe and as part of a
clinical study in the United States. In the future, robotics will
likely assist in prostate surgery, beating heart bypass and
anything else that involves a lot of delicate movement, which tiny
robot fingers _ as guided by a human being _ are well-equipped to
do.
</P>
<P>
   As the operating surgeon watches an enhanced 3-D image on a
computer monitor, the robotic arm inserts a tiny camera inside
small incisions. Tiny surgical tools are then used to reroute the
flow of blood or repair a damaged valve as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and patients alike will benefit, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   For the patient, the term ``minimally invasive surgery'' (MIS)
will become even more true to its name. Smaller, pencil hole-sized
incisions will mean minimal scarring, swifter recovery time and,
ultimately, less financial cost. For surgeons: no more concern
about trembling hands or tired wrists. A robotic arm, controlled by
the operating doctor to mimic his or her own wrist movements, will
be ultra efficient in laying sutures and tying knots. Nurses and
assistants will no longer experience the fatigue of having to hold
a camera in a fixed position for long periods of time. A
robot-controlled camera placement system moves the camera in
response to the surgeon's voice commands. And robots don't get
tired.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the operating room no longer of the future but of the
present, say doctors who liken the experience of operating the
device to playing a high-tech video game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very comfortable and immersive. It makes you feel like
you've climbed inside the patient in a way that you don't get from
traditional means,'' says Dr. Barry N. Gardiner, director of
minimally invasive surgery at San Ramon Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   SRRMC is the only California hospital and one of five in the
nation cleared to use the newly FDA-approved da Vinci Surgical
System manufactured by Intuitive Surgical. Several others _ many in
Northern California _ use Aesop, the robotic, voice-activated
camera placement system manufactured by Intuitive rival, Computer
Motion of Santa Barbara. The company's Zeus system, a three-armed
robotic system similar to da Vinci, has not yet received clearance
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for procedures on human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a barrage of publicity since the FDA cleared
Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System last month and the first
operation _ a gall bladder removal _ using the device was performed
in Virginia, quickly followed by other such surgeries. Still, the
technology is in its infancy. Critics argue that the machinery is
expensive ($65,000 to $1 million), largely untested and best used
on procedures that even a surgeon without access to robotics would
find easy to perform.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have been at the controls of a robot say the
technology's benefits are immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're more ergonomically comfortable, you see better, you
have more flexibility, dexterity, precision, control and
accuracy,'' Gardiner says. ``I would contend those are good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zeus system at Loma Linda University Medical Center has been
used exclusively in lab trials and never on human beings. Although
the hospital's administration hopes to use the Zeus for beating
heart bypass surgery, Dr. Steven Gundry, head of the division of
cardiothoracic surgery, says the machinery _ for all its potential
advantages _ won't be brought into the operating room until all of
the kinks have been worked out. Gundry cited a hospital in Canada
that has performed a number of beating heart coronary bypass
surgeries using the Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing they're encountering right now is the
incredible length of time that operation takes,'' says Gundry.
``The patient is under general anesthetic for 7-10 hours to do a
single coronary bypass, and that's clearly unacceptable. You could
do a single bypass using a small incision in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we can make this technology more friendly to the
patient in terms of how long he will be under general anesthesia,
we can do a lot more in the laboratory,'' he adds. ``We're not in
any rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at USC Medical Center, which is exploring avenues of
tele- medicine and virtual reality, say they are watching the
advancement of robotic medicine with considerable interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of hype now. I haven't seen a lot of science,''
says Dr. Namir Katkhouda, professor of surgery and chief of
minimally invasive surgery at USC. ``I'm not saying it won't have a
role, but we need to define where it sits.''
</P>
<P>
   Katkhouda has discussed robotic devices with Dr. Vaughn Starnes,
chief of USC Medical School's division of cardiothoracic surgery
with the thought of different medical divisions using the equipment
for different procedures. SRRMC's Bay Area Heart Institute expects
to use the facility's da Vinci when the FDA approves the technology
for cardiac surgery.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Charlene Olden of Richmond, Calif., became the first
patient in the United States to have a reverse tubal ligation via
robot. ``It wasn't something that made me scared,'' says Olden,
speaking a few days before she was scheduled to undergo the
procedure at San Ramon Regional Medical Center. ``The recovery time
seems to be a lot faster, and the risk factors are just about the
same as if it was done normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that, with robotics, the operating doctor never
actually touches the patient, medical researchers say the
implications are far reaching. If through Zeus or da Vinci, a
surgeon can be seated a few feet away from his patient, guiding the
robotic arm with a joystick and watching and watching the action on
a video monitor, why does he even need to be in the same room with
the patient? Or the same city? Or even necessarily the same
country?
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet and tele-conferencing, doctors are already
able to consult in operating rooms halfway around the world. A
logical next step would be to have a doctor performing a
long-distance operation, although doctors say there would likely
always need to be at least one human being present in the operating
room acting as an interface between doctor and robot.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario would require a greater comfort level with
robotics from patients, says USC's Katkhouda.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're boarding a plane, you don't want the plane to be
on autopilot,'' Katkhouda says. ``If I was a patient, I would be
more comfortable having the surgeon sitting 6 feet away and relying
on the machine to do the job.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ The girls giggle in their classroom. They
laugh and joke with each other as they mop the floors and clean the
bathrooms of the large, comfortable house where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita, who is 14, arranges her teddy bears on her bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' she says of the shelter for homeless girls
run by the Salvation Army on the outskirts of this capital city.
``It's much prettier than the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just six months ago, Juanita was a troubled runaway, standing on
a darkened corner in San Jose's tourist district, offering to have
sex with foreign men for money.
</P>
<P>
   Children's' advocates say Central America has become a Mecca for
the sex tourism industry, fed by graphic sites on the Internet that
advertise an anything-goes atmosphere, cheap travel costs and
crackdowns in more well-known sex tourism centers like Thailand and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation of children _ both boys and girls _ is the seamier
underside of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   As Central America's most prosperous, stable nation and its top
tourist destination, Costa Rica has been at the center of an
international spotlight on the problem. Prostitution is legal and
regulated by the government here _ but only for women 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedophiles look for three things _ anonymity, poverty and
impunity,'' said Bruce Harris, director of Latin American
operations for Covenant House, a private group that works with
troubled teens in several U.S. cities, as well as in Central
America. ``They find them here. These children are desperate and
vulnerable, and the government has not assumed its responsibility
for taking care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris cites a U.S. State Department report that estimates as
many as 3,000 underage children may be sexually exploited in Costa
Rica, as well as a United Nations committee that expressed concern
over the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican officials say the numbers are a gross exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give that type of number is irresponsible,'' said Lilliam
Gomez(CQ Both), the country's top prosecutor for sex crimes. ``It's
clear the problem exists, but not in that dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of their country's reputation as a family-oriented
tourism gem, government officials have taken steps to combat the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   New laws have been passed outlawing sex with children, and
perpetrators face prison terms of up to 10 years. Gomez has been
promised that her understaffed division will be beefed up, although
she has yet to see any increase in resources.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also funded a national ``Save Our Children''
advertising campaign, featuring television and print ads reminding
the public that children are the nation's most valuable resource.
Brochures will be printed for distribution to arriving visitors,
warning that sex with children is unlawful, while government
Internet sites pushing Costa Rican tourism will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want those kinds of people coming here, and we don't
want our country known for that type of activity,'' said Costa
Rica's Tourism Minister, Walter Niehaus. ``We take this very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have also cracked down on San Jose's red-light district.
While visitors can still find legal prostitutes in a number of bars
and casinos that cater to tourists, the bands of underage boys and
girls who only a few months ago roamed the district and brazenly
propositioned foreign men are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Several well-publicized raids have swept them from the streets
and also hampered the operation of private homes that serve as
brothels.
</P>
<P>
   But under-age prostitutes are still available. Visitors need
only ask a taxi driver outside any of the downtown bars, and they
will be taken to a private home where girls clearly under the age
of 18 make themselves available, sometimes for as little as US$16.
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus says he'll soon start a program in which taxi drivers
will display stickers warning their passengers not to ask for help
in finding young girls for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says the government efforts are inadequate, aimed more at
spiffing up Costa Rica's image than helping the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' he said. ``Until we see a big sign at
the airport showing the pictures of foreigners behind bars instead
of this dancing around to protect the country's image, nothing will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Vargas, director of children's' programs for the Salvation
Army and a former governor of San Jose province, says the problem
is part of a wider crisis of delinquency and drug-use among Costa
Rica's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has lost its values,'' he said. ``We need a change
in attitude by the public. This problem can't be solved by the
police alone. Society must understand that if we don't help these
children, they will only grow up into lives of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural Costa Rica, girls have traditionally married at a young
age, and while there are no hard statistics, there are reports that
sexual abuse of children within families is not infrequent.
Nationwide, a quarter of Costa Rican mothers have their first child
between the ages of 15 and 18, and 41 percent of children are born
to single mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita _ a fictitious name, since Costa Rican law protects the
identity of minors _ began her prostitution career at age 12.
Living in a rural province, she rebelled against her parents,
sleeping with boys for fun and for pay. She ran away, lived with
the family of a friend, and then was turned over to the child
welfare agency when she got caught having sex with that family's
15-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She was sent to the Salvation Army shelter in San Jose, but ran
away for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to be a prostitute,'' she said. ``I went to a park
and asked around and they told me where to go. I would stand on a
corner. All my clients were foreigners. I made about 30,000 colones
(US$100) a night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her money went for clothes and drugs for her friends. But she
gave it up after growing tired of the hard life on the streets.
</P>

   ``It was ugly and cold,'' she said. ``I like it better here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricela Barboza, a psychologist at the shelter, said most of
the girls come from broken families, where many were sexually
abused by relatives. Some, like Juanita, stay for months at the
shelter and seem ready to turn their lives around.
</P>
<P>
   But others stay only a few days to rest, clean up and eat well,
before running away again to lives of drugs and exploitation on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard for us to keep them here,'' she said. ``These
girls can make as much in one night as they would earn in one month
in a regular job.''

``The Thin Blue Lie'' _ a cunning take on ``The Thin Blue Line,'' a
phrase once used to describe the difficult position police find
themselves in, separating us from anarchy and also on the '80s film
of that name _ is an almost stirring yet all too familiar story
about a renegade journalist bucking the odds and effecting social
change.
</P>
<P>
   This film opens with a montage essaying recent examples of
police brutality and corruption, L.A. and New York obviously
earning the most screen time. The point is to imply that the story
herein _ set in 1976 in Philadelphia _ is the granddaddy of all
these cases, as if corruption didn't exist until then. Indeed, many
of the journalists depicted here are clueless dunderheads trying to
maintain the status quo until the heroes of this film venture onto
the scene and put things right.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Morrow (``Northern Exposure'') stars as Pulitzer
Prize-winning social advocate Jonathan Neumann, who single-handedly
busts open a scandal involving cops beating suspect confessions out
of sometimes innocent suspects. No one, naturally, is interested in
his theories _ in fact, other journalists dump threats on his head
as unambiguous as those of the corrupt cops themselves _ yet he
perseveres and ultimately triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the film's veracity, it all plays as awfully
self-serving and programmatic. Neumann seems to operate in a
bizarre vacuum in which his uniquely selfless deeds protect him
from both horribly violent cop threats and his own editors'
involvement, or lack thereof. Every other reporter in town _ even
Phil Chadway (Randy Quaid), who joined forces with him on his quest
for truth and shared his Pulitzer _ is depicted as a clueless
moron.
</P>
<P>
   Only Paul Sorvino's eccentric turn as psycho-mayor Frank Rizzo
offers any color to a story perfunctorily rendered. Neumann is even
allowed a vaguely romantic encounter with a vapid blond who comes
to realize the purity of his mission. Journalists, of course,
fantasize about such nonsense; only middling TV movies allow them
such luxuries. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``The Thin Blue Lie.'' &QL; 
What: Docudrama about corruption among Philadelphia homicide
detectives in the '70s. &QL;

   ``Running Mates'' is standard-issue Hollywood glop that reveals
virtually no insight into the world it describes, which is doubly
disappointing, as it couldn't be more timely. In an acting stretch,
celebrated conservative Tom Selleck stars as Jim Pryce, a
presidential aspirant on the eve of the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, surrounded by questions who will he
select as his running mate? and a bevy of past and present
paramours. Well, he !ital!is!off! a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The sinister big-money forces (lacking only handlebar mustaches
to twiddle) will bankroll his entire campaign if Pryce selects
Texas Sen. Morris (Bruce McGill), a guy who oozes evil like a Lone
Star well oozes oil it's a wonder anyone ever ventured near this
guy, let alone elected him. Lauren Hartman (Laura Linney), his
loyal and whip-smart (yet not so smart that she didn't have an
affair with him) campaign manager, wants him to pick the upright
Sen. Randall (Bob Gunton, and damned if he doesn't look a little
like Joseph Lieberman), who's passionate about campaign finance
reform. A former mistress from his distant past, the boozy Meg
Gable (Faye Dunaway), wants him to go with her louse of a husband
(Robert Culp). Shawna Morgan (Teri Hatcher), a Hollywood ditz who
just happens to be another prior lover, aches to help her buddies
rub elbows with all that power, while his wife (Nancy Travis) is
vaguely resentful of the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   All this has the makings of a serviceably farcical satire,
maybe, but none of it plays as remotely credible. Campaign finance
is a crucial issue that affects whether people or corporations run
our country an overly simplistic statement to be sure, but it's
handled even more simplistically here. Pryce's late crisis of
confidence is a joke did the guy !ital!really!off! just realize how
corrupt the system is?
</P>
<P>
   as is the moment when the women all get together to compare
notes. Backhanded political maneuvering that could affect the
outcome of the election is in the offing, so of course they all
discuss how good Pryce is/was in the sack. (Selleck manages little
chemistry with any of them.)
</P>
<P>
   The pin-headed depictions of Hollywood imbeciles come off as
particularly callow (not to mention stultifyingly unfunny), with
the portrayal of the Washington media not far behind. When one
reporter aboard Pryce's plane mentions the issues, another
reproaches him, burbling, ``A week in L.A., fat expense account
maybe we'll get laid!'' His buddy eyes the leggy Linney and leers,
``I wouldn't mind eight years of that.'' You WILL mind two hours of
this gibberish. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show ``Running Mates.'' &QL; 
What: Dramedy about the pressures and women surrounding a
presidential candidate. &QL; 
Who: Tom Selleck, Laura Linney, Nancy Travis, Teri Hatcher, Faye
Dunaway. &QL; 
Where: TNT. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL;

CLINTON WILL TELL CONVENTION OF HUGE DIFFERENCES WITH BUSH &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
 &HT;    By HELEN THOMAS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will use his farewell address to
the Democratic National Convention on Monday night to lay out his
accomplishments of the last few years and speak out on what he
believes are the ``profound philosophical differences'' between the
two political parties.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton believes
Americans have ``a clear and very distinct choice this year''
between building on the economic and social success of his years in
office, or making ``U-turn back to policies that have failed in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect any more apologies from Clinton for the Monica
Lewinsky affair as a couple of close friends have suggested,
Lockhart said, adding ``and 600 others in the White House think
would be crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Give him a break. What can you say after you've said you are
sorry?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton probably also is counting on ``Monica fatigue'' by
Americans who believe enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, didn't Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to succeed
Clinton, take a giant step to remove himself from Clinton baggage
when he named Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate?
Lieberman's one claim to national fame is that he denounced
Clinton's behavior as ``immoral'' in stunning speech on the Senate
floor which was a curtain raiser to Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's devastating lecture was widely interpreted as a slap
at Clinton. The president responded by turning the other cheek and
praising Lieberman's selection, calling him a ``good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In his sentimental valedictory, Clinton will be stressing the
``huge differences'' with the Republican ticket, headed by Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, in terms of economic, crime, health and
education policies. He also plans to sound a warning that ``the
next president will make two to four appointments to the Supreme
Court'' which he said would assure a conservative majority on the
high bench.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gore camp seems less than gracious in seeking to
dissociate the Democratic presidential hopeful from the president,
Clinton is taking it all in stride, knowing the exigencies of
politics, not to mention the opposition attempts to make him the
issue in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say that Clinton will be lavish in his praise of Gore and
toss him many bouquets when he walks on the convention stage in Los
Angeles Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   That is more generous than the parting shots of some of his
predecessors. Clinton aides have been gleaning the farewell
convention speeches of some other presidents. They found it notable
that outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower's lengthy address to
the GOP convention on July 26, 1960, failed to mention Vice
President Richard Nixon who hoped to succeed him in the fall
election that year.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not surprising in view of one of his last news
conferences as president, Eisenhower was asked what Nixon had
contributed to his administration as vice president. Eisenhower's
famous reply: ``If you give me a week, I'll think of something.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, 1988, President Ronald Reagan strongly supported
Vice President George Bush as his successor in the White House and
told the convention that Bush had helped him to overcome ``liberal
opposition to put our programs in place.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added ``without George Bush to build on those policies,
everything we've achieved will be at risk. All the work, sacrifice
and effort of the American people could end in the very same
disaster that we inherited in 1981.''
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton, it's payback time. He is sparing nothing
to try to help his wife Hillary win a Senate seat in New York,
particularly in the fund-raising department.
</P>
<P>
   It's a turnabout since she has devoted most of her married life
pitching in to promote her husband's political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seems particularly anxious to cut off at the pass her
critics who claim she has not done anything on her own.
</P>
<P>
   He told a recent New York fund-raising dinner that he and his
wife had been looking forward to relaxing ``a little bit'' during
his last months in the White House but when a group of New York
Democrats asked her to run, ``she understood it was important to
carry on the work that we have been about these last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this,'' he said, ``for 30 years all he ever did
was help everybody else and I'm kind of proud of her for sort of
venturing out on her own now and trying to do something for
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   He then proceeded to tick off all of the work the first lady had
done to promote the Family Medical Leave Act, the Children's
Insurance program, as well as her efforts to promote adoption of
children with disabilities and foster care for needy kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people that are trying to beat her will spare no
effort or no expense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the potential donors that his wife ``won't let you
down, and she'll be great in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart is taking his
predecessor Mike McCurry's word for it: ``There is life after the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry is now running a lucrative consulting business, hitting
the lecture circuit and getting with it in the dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   What's more he also gets to see his children now, a difficult
feat when he was at the beck and call of a president and the
Washington press corps.
</P>
<P>
   So Lockhart is sorting out several offers, mostly in the
communications field and looking forward to quitting his
high-profile position in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is always a glorious occasion for the nation to see that all
of our heroes are not from battlefields. True humanity and
sacrifice are on display when a president hands out the Medal of
Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, at White House
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, humor is injected in the solemn occasion.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton presented the medal to famed economist
John Kenneth Galbraith, he said: ``It is ironic that John Kenneth
Galbraith actually coined the term 'conventional wisdom,' since he
spent his entire life challenging it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also evoked laughter when he said it was suspected
that President John F. Kennedy sent Galbraith to India as the U.S.
Ambassador ``to be free of his political advice and policy ideas.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   RANADA, Nicaragua -- Like a starving dog, a small boy steals
into the trendy restaurant at dusk, slinking across the floor
toward the nearest table. His eyes dart around the room before he
reaches up to touch the arm of a tourist tasting filete jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   The startled American looks down, and the Nicaraguan boy
flinches as if expecting to be struck. ``Comida?'' he whispers,
cocking his head to one side. ``Comida?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants something to eat,'' says a woman at the
table. The man starts to break off a piece of bread, but another
customer, loosening his belt, interjects, ``No, don't. You'll just
encourage them.'' With a wave of his hand, he shoos the small
beggar away.
</P>
<P>
   As he heads toward the door, the boy looks back at the bread and
then disappears into the night, his hunger compounded by
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who looks about 8, is part of a growing army of
school-age children who roam the streets each day, begging,
performing menial tasks and selling trinkets or themselves. Hordes
pick through garbage cans, sometimes fighting with dogs or other
youths for scraps of rotting food.
</P>
<P>
   Many sniff cobbler's glue, kept in baby food jars. The vapors
ward off hunger pangs and give them a feeling of euphoria, an
escape, at least for a few hours, from the harsh reality of the
street.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to spot them: They pull their T-shirts over their
faces when inhaling the deadly vapors. Soon their eyes become
vacant, glazed over. They lie down in doorways or on sidewalks,
flies buzzing around their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly disturbing,'' said Dr. Frank Incaprera, a
retired New Orleans internist who has treated Granada street
children during medical missions sponsored by the Archdiocese of
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The future for these children is grim. ``Most already suffer
from malnutrition and intestinal parasites,'' he said. ``The glue
causes liver and irreversible brain damage. Their life spans are
not long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a shabby bunch of kids,'' he said, ``yet all lovable,
with delightful smiles. They really tug at your heartstrings.''
</P>
<P>
   According to UNICEF, 40 million children live or work on the
streets of Latin America, more than half of whom sniff glue. The
explosion of street children has been called the dark side of
globalization, paralleling the rise in unemployment and poverty
levels in many Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, where half of the country's 5 million people are
under 17, the per capita income is little more than $1 a day, and
unemployment has soared as high as 60 percent in the decade since
the Sandinistas were defeated, ending an 11-year effort to build a
socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   Crippling foreign debt coupled with the ravages of Hurricane
Mitch have kept Nicaragua the second-poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, after Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to implement austerity programs to obtain loans through
the International Monetary Fund, the government has drastically
slashed social programs, leaving the fate of the poor largely in
the hands of charities.
</P>
<P>
   In Granada, one of the few refuges for street children is Cristo
Sana-Los Ninos, a center established by the New Orleans
Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The program is a spinoff of the archdiocese's Nicaraguan medical
mission launched in the early 1990s by Bishop Gregory Aymond and
Marianite Sister Mary Bertilla McNeely, a nurse who had worked in
famine-ravaged Somalia as well as at health clinics in poor New
Orleans neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   When the medical teams returned increasingly disturbed by the
street children, Aymond sent a social worker to do a needs
assessment and then recruited Sister Renee Daigle to set up Los
Ninos for boys ages 6 to 15. The nun, now the vocational director
for the Marianites, contacted Granada's wealthier women for
donations and obtained a rundown building that New Orleans
seminarians helped renovate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center gives them some safe space, adults they can
trust,'' Sister Daigle said. ``The ultimate goal is to get them
back home, in drug rehab or in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds, she realizes, are not auspicious. Many of the boys
fled abuse at home, the rehab facilities are few, and most cannot
afford the school book and registration fees the government charges
to cut public spending. Although the constitution guarantees every
child a free education, hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan
children are not in school, child welfare agencies say.
</P>
<P>
   Los Ninos provides some educational instruction, but because of
limited money, the center is open only from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
During that time, dozens of boys are given breakfast and lunch,
take showers, and receive lessons in personal hygiene, social
skills and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   The center, located on a busy street not far from the town
square, is run by a Salvadoran nun, Sister Ana Rosa. She is helped
by Adela Lacayo, a former New Orleans resident who heads the
archdiocese's Cristo Sana board in Granada and helps coordinate its
medical missions.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, boys, hungry and happy to have survived another
night on the street, wander over to the brown and white stucco
building with its high arched doorway and wait for the nun to open
the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Those reeking of glue aren't allowed in, but can stay in the
entrance hall where they are fed. Those who are glue-free are
greeted with a large welcoming banner reading ``Bienvenidos'' and
the warm friendliness of Sister Ana Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulars these days is 7-year-old Manuel. Sitting at a
table in an open room with tile floors and padded benches, he's
eagerly attempting the schoolwork the nun has given him. He boasts
he can write his name and proudly holds up his paper, but it's
filled only with a string of OOOOOs.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Ana Rosa said he's one of nine children in his family.
Six of his brothers live on the street. One of them is languishing
on the floor of the entrance hall with the other glue-sniffers
behind a red iron gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mother has no husband. She's desperate and sends her
kids out to beg. Manuel sometimes sleeps at a park,'' she said,
voicing her wish that Los Ninos could provide sleeping
accommodations. Every afternoon, she said, ``it breaks my heart to
turn them back out onto the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day that may change,'' said Lacayo, the granddaughter of a
former Nicaraguan president, who promised Sister McNeely before her
death last year that she would help the street children. ``The land
has been purchased, but we are still trying to raise money to
build'' a residential facility, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, we do what we can,'' Sister Ana Rosa said, walking
down a hall to a small room where some boys are making a Winnie the
Pooh pinata to sell. Outside on a patio under a tin roof, other
boys make hemp wall hangings by wrapping pieces of colorful rope
around nails hammered in various designs on plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to make crafts not only adds to the family income, but
can lower the level of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many poor women can't find jobs,'' the nun said. ``They can't
afford to feed their children and send them out to beg.'' When they
come home empty-handed, the mothers sometimes abuse them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One Los Ninos boy, now 14, is a case in point. ``When he was 5,
he came home with nothing to show for the day,'' she said. ``His
mother strung him over firewood, built a fire and burned his feet.
He still has the scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the horrible poverty that is the root of the abuse,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   James Wright, a sociologist at Tulane University in New Orleans,
agreed: ``Conditions of extreme poverty and deprivation lead to
desperate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The brutal reality for many Nicaraguan youths is that their
childhood ends at the age American children begin kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children in Latin America can be an economic asset by the time
they're 5,'' said Wright, co-author of a study on street children
in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason, he said, ``you see them swarming everywhere:
in the street, in the markets, at the airport, hanging around
churches. They come up to carry your bag, to sell you chewing gum,
to sell you candy. Everywhere you go, there's just these swarms of
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A child's meager earnings can make a significant difference to a
family. School becomes secondary to survival.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by the twisted logic of the streets, children, the
younger and cuter the better, are the most effective beggars. When
they get older, they're seen as a nuisance, even a threat. And with
little education and little opportunity to earn money, they often
resort to petty theft or prostitution to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Wright sees little chance of an economic turnaround in Nicaragua
any time soon. ``Everyone understands that as long as poor nations
are saddled with the kind of foreign debt that they're saddled
with, they're never going to get anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the economic changes undertaken to reduce that debt --
slashing of publicly financed social services and privatization of
state-run industries -- tend to drive up unemployment, at least in
the short term.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of street children grows, especially
as land reform efforts fail and rural migrants keep flowing into
cities looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   While severe poverty may be the underlying factor, for many
children the more immediate reason for living on the street is to
flee physical, emotional or sexual abuse at home, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the abuse doesn't end when they leave home. Out
on the street, they fall easy prey to sexual predators. And they're
frequently targeted by police whom merchants hire to clear the
streets in front of their shops, human rights groups say. In one
high-profile incident in 1993, eight homeless children were shot to
death by off-duty policemen in Brazil as they slept across the
street from a church that was a prominent tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, politicians have recently scapegoated street
children for an increase in serious crime, said Bruce Harris,
executive director of Casa Alianza, the Latin America arm of
Covenant House, the largest privately-funded childcare agency in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   More than 95 percent of serious crime in Nicaragua is committed
by adults, Harris said, and if officials want a crackdown, it
should be aimed at poverty and unemployment, the roots of the
growing violence.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal as police can be, a lack of law enforcement can do
violence of another kind, some child advocates say, especially when
it comes to the sale of glue.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   RANADA, Nicaragua -- Like a starving dog, a small boy steals
into the trendy restaurant at dusk, slinking across the floor
toward the nearest table. His eyes dart around the room before he
reaches up to touch the arm of a tourist tasting filete jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   The startled American looks down, and the Nicaraguan boy
flinches as if expecting to be struck. ``Comida?'' he whispers,
cocking his head to one side. ``Comida?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants something to eat,'' says a woman at the
table. The man starts to break off a piece of bread, but another
customer, loosening his belt, interjects, ``No, don't. You'll just
encourage them.'' With a wave of his hand, he shoos the small
beggar away.
</P>
<P>
   As he heads toward the door, the boy looks back at the bread and
then disappears into the night, his hunger compounded by
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who looks about 8, is part of a growing army of
school-age children who roam the streets each day, begging,
performing menial tasks and selling trinkets or themselves. Hordes
pick through garbage cans, sometimes fighting with dogs or other
youths for scraps of rotting food.
</P>
<P>
   Many sniff cobbler's glue, kept in baby food jars. The vapors
ward off hunger pangs and give them a feeling of euphoria, an
escape, at least for a few hours, from the harsh reality of the
street.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to spot them: They pull their T-shirts over their
faces when inhaling the deadly vapors. Soon their eyes become
vacant, glazed over. They lie down in doorways or on sidewalks,
flies buzzing around their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly disturbing,'' said Dr. Frank Incaprera, a
retired New Orleans internist who has treated Granada street
children during medical missions sponsored by the Archdiocese of
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The future for these children is grim. ``Most already suffer
from malnutrition and intestinal parasites,'' he said. ``The glue
causes liver and irreversible brain damage. Their life spans are
not long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a shabby bunch of kids,'' he said, ``yet all lovable,
with delightful smiles. They really tug at your heartstrings.''
</P>
<P>
   According to UNICEF, 40 million children live or work on the
streets of Latin America, more than half of whom sniff glue. The
explosion of street children has been called the dark side of
globalization, paralleling the rise in unemployment and poverty
levels in many Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, where half of the country's 5 million people are
under 17, the per capita income is little more than $1 a day, and
unemployment has soared as high as 60 percent in the decade since
the Sandinistas were defeated, ending an 11-year effort to build a
socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   Crippling foreign debt coupled with the ravages of Hurricane
Mitch have kept Nicaragua the second-poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, after Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to implement austerity programs to obtain loans through
the International Monetary Fund, the government has drastically
slashed social programs, leaving the fate of the poor largely in
the hands of charities.
</P>
<P>
   In Granada, one of the few refuges for street children is Cristo
Sana-Los Ninos, a center established by the New Orleans
Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The program is a spinoff of the archdiocese's Nicaraguan medical
mission launched in the early 1990s by Bishop Gregory Aymond and
Marianite Sister Mary Bertilla McNeely, a nurse who had worked in
famine-ravaged Somalia as well as at health clinics in poor New
Orleans neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   When the medical teams returned increasingly disturbed by the
street children, Aymond sent a social worker to do a needs
assessment and then recruited Sister Renee Daigle to set up Los
Ninos for boys ages 6 to 15. The nun, now the vocational director
for the Marianites, contacted Granada's wealthier women for
donations and obtained a rundown building that New Orleans
seminarians helped renovate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center gives them some safe space, adults they can
trust,'' Sister Daigle said. ``The ultimate goal is to get them
back home, in drug rehab or in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds, she realizes, are not auspicious. Many of the boys
fled abuse at home, the rehab facilities are few, and most cannot
afford the school book and registration fees the government charges
to cut public spending. Although the constitution guarantees every
child a free education, hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan
children are not in school, child welfare agencies say.
</P>
<P>
   Los Ninos provides some educational instruction, but because of
limited money, the center is open only from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
During that time, dozens of boys are given breakfast and lunch,
take showers, and receive lessons in personal hygiene, social
skills and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   The center, located on a busy street not far from the town
square, is run by a Salvadoran nun, Sister Ana Rosa. She is helped
by Adela Lacayo, a former New Orleans resident who heads the
archdiocese's Cristo Sana board in Granada and helps coordinate its
medical missions.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, boys, hungry and happy to have survived another
night on the street, wander over to the brown and white stucco
building with its high arched doorway and wait for the nun to open
the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Those reeking of glue aren't allowed in, but can stay in the
entrance hall where they are fed. Those who are glue-free are
greeted with a large welcoming banner reading ``Bienvenidos'' and
the warm friendliness of Sister Ana Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulars these days is 7-year-old Manuel. Sitting at a
table in an open room with tile floors and padded benches, he's
eagerly attempting the schoolwork the nun has given him. He boasts
he can write his name and proudly holds up his paper, but it's
filled only with a string of OOOOOs.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Ana Rosa said he's one of nine children in his family.
Six of his brothers live on the street. One of them is languishing
on the floor of the entrance hall with the other glue-sniffers
behind a red iron gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mother has no husband. She's desperate and sends her
kids out to beg. Manuel sometimes sleeps at a park,'' she said,
voicing her wish that Los Ninos could provide sleeping
accommodations. Every afternoon, she said, ``it breaks my heart to
turn them back out onto the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day that may change,'' said Lacayo, the granddaughter of a
former Nicaraguan president, who promised Sister McNeely before her
death last year that she would help the street children. ``The land
has been purchased, but we are still trying to raise money to
build'' a residential facility, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, we do what we can,'' Sister Ana Rosa said, walking
down a hall to a small room where some boys are making a Winnie the
Pooh pinata to sell. Outside on a patio under a tin roof, other
boys make hemp wall hangings by wrapping pieces of colorful rope
around nails hammered in various designs on plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to make crafts not only adds to the family income, but
can lower the level of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many poor women can't find jobs,'' the nun said. ``They can't
afford to feed their children and send them out to beg.'' When they
come home empty-handed, the mothers sometimes abuse them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One Los Ninos boy, now 14, is a case in point. ``When he was 5,
he came home with nothing to show for the day,'' she said. ``His
mother strung him over firewood, built a fire and burned his feet.
He still has the scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the horrible poverty that is the root of the abuse,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   James Wright, a sociologist at Tulane University in New Orleans,
agreed: ``Conditions of extreme poverty and deprivation lead to
desperate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The brutal reality for many Nicaraguan youths is that their
childhood ends at the age American children begin kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children in Latin America can be an economic asset by the time
they're 5,'' said Wright, co-author of a study on street children
in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason, he said, ``you see them swarming everywhere:
in the street, in the markets, at the airport, hanging around
churches. They come up to carry your bag, to sell you chewing gum,
to sell you candy. Everywhere you go, there's just these swarms of
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A child's meager earnings can make a significant difference to a
family. School becomes secondary to survival.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by the twisted logic of the streets, children, the
younger and cuter the better, are the most effective beggars. When
they get older, they're seen as a nuisance, even a threat. And with
little education and little opportunity to earn money, they often
resort to petty theft or prostitution to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Wright sees little chance of an economic turnaround in Nicaragua
any time soon. ``Everyone understands that as long as poor nations
are saddled with the kind of foreign debt that they're saddled
with, they're never going to get anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the economic changes undertaken to reduce that debt --
slashing of publicly financed social services and privatization of
state-run industries -- tend to drive up unemployment, at least in
the short term.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of street children grows, especially
as land reform efforts fail and rural migrants keep flowing into
cities looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   While severe poverty may be the underlying factor, for many
children the more immediate reason for living on the street is to
flee physical, emotional or sexual abuse at home, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the abuse doesn't end when they leave home. Out
on the street, they fall easy prey to sexual predators. And they're
frequently targeted by police whom merchants hire to clear the
streets in front of their shops, human rights groups say. In one
high-profile incident in 1993, eight homeless children were shot to
death by off-duty policemen in Brazil as they slept across the
street from a church that was a prominent tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, politicians have recently scapegoated street
children for an increase in serious crime, said Bruce Harris,
executive director of Casa Alianza, the Latin America arm of
Covenant House, the largest privately-funded childcare agency in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   More than 95 percent of serious crime in Nicaragua is committed
by adults, Harris said, and if officials want a crackdown, it
should be aimed at poverty and unemployment, the roots of the
growing violence.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal as police can be, a lack of law enforcement can do
violence of another kind, some child advocates say, especially when
it comes to the sale of glue.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Tabor, a former Peace Corps volunteer who works with
street children and helps Sister Ana Rosa at Los Ninos, said:
``I've watched police in Granada's central park turn a blind eye to
these children and to the street vendors who sell the glue to them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - With no national army, a prosperous
economy and an enviable record of free, fair elections, Costa Rica
has been a beacon of peace and stability in a region beset by
military coups, civil wars and corrupt dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months this tranquil oasis and beloved tourist
destination has been shaken by a crimewave against residents and
visitors, triggering worries that some of the outside world's
problems may finally be catching up to once-isolated, idyllic Costa
Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have been filled with stories of a few
sensational crimes, including a July kidnapping that resulted in a
shoot-out that left one hostage dead and three police officers
wounded. The country also saw a flurry of unflattering
international stories following the murders of two American college
students on the Caribbean coast in March.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile cases have sparked a round of national
soul-searching in this country of 3.5 million residents, which
prides itself on being known as the ``Switzerland of Central
America'' because of its long tradition of neutrality and peace.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a national debate over the causes and proposed
solutions to the crimewave has swirled through this capital city,
with some leaders calling for more police, more prosecutors and
stiffer penalties for criminals. Others say what is needed is a
return to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Even an annual religious festival in early August drew attention
to the problem, as Costa Rica's top Catholic cleric prayed for the
country to find a way to end the violence that has upset so many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of the citizens about the problem of insecurity
is very high,'' said Rogelio Ramos, Minister of Public Security.
``It's because we have such a long tradition of peace that a small
number of incidents can leave the country shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is quick to point out that even with the recent spate of
crimes, Costa Rica is still one of the safest countries in the
hemisphere, with an enviable record of catching and convicting
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the lowest index of murders in the hemisphere, less
than six for every 100,000 residents,'' he said. ``Besides that,
the judicial police solve more than 90 percent of the murders,
which means that if you commit murder here, you have a 90 percent
chance of going to jail for it. And more than 70 percent of all
crime here are property crimes that don't involve violence,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Those facts seem lost in the wave of public concern, however.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, one of the country's top law-enforcement officials
told reporters her agency doesn't have the resources to meet the
growing crime problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is worrying,'' said Lineth Saborio, head of the
Costa Rican Office of Judicial Investigations, the country's
equivalent of the FBI. ``The level of violence is beyond the
ability of the police to cope with.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plea for more resources came just as the government is
discussing budgets for next year. While there have been reports
that the agency might suffer some funding cuts, Ramos insisted that
the resources would be found to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a new investigative team is being formed to fight
kidnappers, he said. The group will receive special training from
the Colombian police, who have lots of experience as their country
suffers the highest rate of kidnapping in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican leaders say the increase in crime is due to several
factors, many of which plague other countries, including the United
States. The list includes poverty, a loss of traditional values of
respect for others, the influence of violent television and movies,
violent games and sites on the Internet, and an influx of mostly
poor immigrants from other countries _ some of whom turn to crime
out of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome is the fear that juvenile delinquency _
among both boys and girls _ is on the rise. While no hard
statistics are available, news accounts paint portraits of boys
involved in petty theft and even armed crimes, while girls as young
as 12 and 13 have become part of the sex trade. Many of the
customers are foreign visitors attracted to Costa Rica because
prostitution is legal for women 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Vargas, former governor of the province that includes San
Jose and now director of youth programs for the Salvation Army,
says the problems stem from broken homes and dysfunctional
families. He worries that the nation is already facing a generation
of lost kids who are growing up to lives of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing those that 10 years ago were delinquents are
20 years old and involved in serious crime,'' he said. ``In the
last 10 years the problem with drugs has become more acute, but
unfortunately neither the state or society gave it the proper
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major worry for many in Costa Rica is that the growing
crime rate will hurt tourism, which has become one of the nation's
top industries along with agriculture and light manufacturing. Last
year, more than 1 million visitors came to Costa Rica, spending
nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The March murders of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky. and Emily
Eagen of Ann Arbor, Mich., both of whom had attended Antioch
College in Yellow springs, Ohio, stunned Costa Rica and triggered a
torrent of international publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two young men for the crime, one of whom was
recently convicted and sentenced to 15 years in jail _ the maximum
allowed in Costa Rica for a juvenile. The other youth, who is an
adult, faces trial soon. Police are still seeking another man, a
Nicaraguan, in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The two 19-year-old women were staying near the Caribbean resort
of Puerto Viejo when the crime occurred. The area is popular with
college students and young tourists seeking the exotic rhythms and
Caribbean flavor there, but it is also known to be more
crime-ridden than the rest of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Niehaus, head of the Costa Rican Institute for Tourism, a
Cabinet-level agency, said tourist bookings dropped by about 1
percent in the months immediately following the killings but have
since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Costa Rica was shocked by the killings, and we gave our
true feelings to the families,'' he said. ``But it was an isolated
incident. The police acted immediately and two men are now in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus and other top officials reacted aggressively to reassure
would-be travelers that Costa Rica is still a safe destination.
Responding to an invitation from former Florida Gov. Kenneth H.
``Buddy'' MacKay Jr., who is now President Clinton's special envoy
for Latin America, Niehaus headed a delegation of officials to
Miami-Dade County in June. There they studied South Florida's
response to a rash of tourist killings and crimes in the early
1990s that triggered a similar round of negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very helpful,'' Niehaus said, noting that Miami had set
up special signs to help guide tourists around the city. ``We are
going to have security brochures printed for visitors to advise
them about how to travel safely, along with information on the
Internet. We're also using more bicycle police, and will have a
special branch of tourist police stationed at the most popular
destinations in Costa Rica.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have also cracked down on the exploitation of
under-age girls for sex, making several street sweeps and raiding
brothels where the girls were available. Visitors will also soon be
given brochures at the San Jose airport _ the primary gateway for
international tourists _ warning that having sex with under-age
girls is a crime and that if caught they will be punished, Niehaus
said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the publicity and public debate, officials insist that
seasoned travelers recognize that Costa Rica's reputation as a
safe, easygoing place is still deserved. While tourists have always
been warned to watch out for pick-pockets and petty thieves, the
government seems serious about taking firm steps against the more
serious crimes that could turn their tourist-rich paradise into a
less-than-desirable destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as it has been made to sound,'' Niehaus said.
``But we are taking action. Because of our peaceful reputation, if
we have one high-profile crime, it gets

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - With no national army, a prosperous
economy and an enviable record of free, fair elections, Costa Rica
has been a beacon of peace and stability in a region beset by
military coups, civil wars and corrupt dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months this tranquil oasis and beloved tourist
destination has been shaken by a crimewave against residents and
visitors, triggering worries that some of the outside world's
problems may finally be catching up to once-isolated, idyllic Costa
Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have been filled with stories of a few
sensational crimes, including a July kidnapping that resulted in a
shoot-out that left one hostage dead and three police officers
wounded. The country also saw a flurry of unflattering
international stories following the murders of two American college
students on the Caribbean coast in March.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile cases have sparked a round of national
soul-searching in this country of 3.5 million residents, which
prides itself on being known as the ``Switzerland of Central
America'' because of its long tradition of neutrality and peace.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a national debate over the causes and proposed
solutions to the crimewave has swirled through this capital city,
with some leaders calling for more police, more prosecutors and
stiffer penalties for criminals. Others say what is needed is a
return to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Even an annual religious festival in early August drew attention
to the problem, as Costa Rica's top Catholic cleric prayed for the
country to find a way to end the violence that has upset so many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of the citizens about the problem of insecurity
is very high,'' said Rogelio Ramos, Minister of Public Security.
``It's because we have such a long tradition of peace that a small
number of incidents can leave the country shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is quick to point out that even with the recent spate of
crimes, Costa Rica is still one of the safest countries in the
hemisphere, with an enviable record of catching and convicting
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the lowest index of murders in the hemisphere, less
than six for every 100,000 residents,'' he said. ``Besides that,
the judicial police solve more than 90 percent of the murders,
which means that if you commit murder here, you have a 90 percent
chance of going to jail for it. And more than 70 percent of all
crime here are property crimes that don't involve violence,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Those facts seem lost in the wave of public concern, however.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, one of the country's top law-enforcement officials
told reporters her agency doesn't have the resources to meet the
growing crime problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is worrying,'' said Lineth Saborio, head of the
Costa Rican Office of Judicial Investigations, the country's
equivalent of the FBI. ``The level of violence is beyond the
ability of the police to cope with.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plea for more resources came just as the government is
discussing budgets for next year. While there have been reports
that the agency might suffer some funding cuts, Ramos insisted that
the resources would be found to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a new investigative team is being formed to fight
kidnappers, he said. The group will receive special training from
the Colombian police, who have lots of experience as their country
suffers the highest rate of kidnapping in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican leaders say the increase in crime is due to several
factors, many of which plague other countries, including the United

   With the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their convention
next week, America's voters will have before them four men bidding
to lead their country. Should they choose the pragmatic politician,
the co-chief executive of their country, who has supervised eight
years of staggering prosperity? Or what about the dreamy idealist,
the policy wonk absorbed by technology and the environment? Or
perhaps the sour, partisan reactionary _ a brutal attack dog who
specializes in ripping apart the ``risky'' dreams of others? Or
then again, there is the panicky panderer, who changes his mind
about a small Cuban boy's future just to win a few votes in Miami.
It shouldn't be too difficult, but for one thing: all four of these
men are Al Gore. &QL;

   After barely a fortnight of frail life, the peace process in
Jammu and Kashmir is officially dead. The conflict seems to be back
to the same hopeless state in which it has languished for 53 years
_ except that nowadays, on a whim of either India or Pakistan, it
could turn nuclear. Even if the past hopeful fortnight's events
turn out to be no more than a feint in the direction of peace,
though, they have revealed the contours of how a peace process
might evolve. &QL;

   Millions of Americans will this week have found themselves in
the unusual position of agreeing with Fidel Castro. Both George W.
Bush and Al Gore are ``boring,'' said the Cuban leader. Sheer
hypocrisy, Bush and Gore might reply. After all, for four decades,
Castro has notoriously bored his long-suffering people with
speeches lasting hour after hour. In the view of the old guerrilla,
it has always seemed, fatigues are not just to be worn but also to
be inflicted. No longer, though: the Cuban president has at last
realized that, when it comes to words, less can be more. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Before the current stage of the presidential
campaign began, conventional wisdom (excuse the term) held that
George W. Bush's choice of running mate would define his candidacy
but the Republican shindig in Philadelphia would not. Conversely,
it was thought that Al Gore's running mate would hardly matter
(because the options were all so dismal) but his speech to the
Democratic National Convention would be decisive. So far, every
part of this wisdom has turned out to be wrong. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ ``There's a lot at stake in this election and real
differences between the two parties.'' When Joe Lieberman said that
just after Al Gore had formally picked him as the Democratic
running mate, it sounded like the sort of bland remark that
politicians perpetrate when they have nothing much to say.
Actually, it was both surprising and true. It was surprising
because for most Americans, this is one of the least gripping
elections on record. The discrepancy between what people seem to
think about this race and what is actually at stake is becoming
more striking during the current convention season _ ``the most
critical period of the campaign,'' claims Tom Mann of the Brookings
Institution. &QL;

more psychoanalysts per square mile than any other city in the
world. Good thing, too, for at the moment the national mood in
Argentina is one of deep depression, manifested in recent days by
an outpouring of anguished self-analysis over the suicide of a
well-known surgeon. And the sense of despair goes wider still: a
million or more Argentines flocked this week to the shrine of San
Cayetano, patron saint of labor, praying for his help to find work.
At least Argentina's psychoanalysts should face no problems finding

that their eyes should alight first on good old Britain:
English-speaking, Internet-hip and, since the privatizations of the

greenhouse gas emissions trading... With best regards, Bill.'' The
casual snoop might pass over this epistle as merely the
unremarkable ramblings of an academic or bureaucrat. Inspect more
closely, though, and two surprises emerge. First, this letter,
penned recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, is about an issue both take seriously: global
warming. Second, the letter reveals just how influential Eileen
Claussen, the head of the nonprofit Pew Center on Global Climate
Change, has now become. Why does Claussen _ the scourge of
global-warming skeptics _ have the ear of the world's most powerful
man? The answer is that she knows how to dance circles around the

   NEW YORK _ America is in the ninth year of its longest-ever
peacetime expansion, but somebody has forgotten to tell its
retailers. While department stores such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney
and Federated have been fighting decline for years, and the woes of
``category killers' such as Toys ``R'' Us are well-known, the
country's hugely successful specialty retailers _ such as Gap,
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Office Depot _
are only now hitting trouble. There are many reasons, but above
all, the fat years of the recent past have tempted store groups
into over-ambitious expansion plans. &QL;

   MUMBAI _ Subhash Ghai is all smiles these days _ and with good
reason. Mukta Arts, his movie production company, has just closed
the first-ever public offering of shares by a big firm from
Bollywood, the name for the Hindi movie industry located around
Mumbai (Bombay). As investors pore over the volatile cash flows of
his firm, Ghai is jazzed by the idea of building a Hollywood-style
studio that hires and trains Indian movie directors, writers and
technicians. Some optimists even see India as a low-cost producer
for the global movie industry. Film City, a newly expanded
2,000-acre complex on the outskirts of Hyderabad, offers 40 studio
floors and sophisticated post-production facilities; it has already
attracted a handful of movie-makers from Hollywood. &QL;

   With the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their convention
next week, America's voters will have before them four men bidding
to lead their country. Should they choose the pragmatic politician,
the co-chief executive of their country, who has supervised eight
years of staggering prosperity? Or what about the dreamy idealist,
the policy wonk absorbed by technology and the environment? Or
perhaps the sour, partisan reactionary _ a brutal attack dog who
specializes in ripping apart the ``risky'' dreams of others? Or
then again, there is the panicky panderer, who changes his mind
about a small Cuban boy's future just to win a few votes in Miami.
It shouldn't be too difficult, but for one thing: all four of these
men are Al Gore. &QL;

   After barely a fortnight of frail life, the peace process in
Jammu and Kashmir is officially dead. The conflict seems to be back
to the same hopeless state in which it has languished for 53 years
_ except that nowadays, on a whim of either India or Pakistan, it
could turn nuclear. Even if the past hopeful fortnight's events
turn out to be no more than a feint in the direction of peace,
though, they have revealed the contours of how a peace process
might evolve. &QL;

   Millions of Americans will this week have found themselves in
the unusual position of agreeing with Fidel Castro. Both George W.
Bush and Al Gore are ``boring,'' said the Cuban leader. Sheer
hypocrisy, Bush and Gore might reply. After all, for four decades,
Castro has notoriously bored his long-suffering people with
speeches lasting hour after hour. In the view of the old guerrilla,
it has always seemed, fatigues are not just to be worn but also to
be inflicted. No longer, though: the Cuban president has at last
realized that, when it comes to words, less can be more. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Before the current stage of the presidential
campaign began, conventional wisdom (excuse the term) held that
George W. Bush's choice of running mate would define his candidacy
but the Republican shindig in Philadelphia would not. Conversely,
it was thought that Al Gore's running mate would hardly matter
(because the options were all so dismal) but his speech to the
Democratic National Convention would be decisive. So far, every
part of this wisdom has turned out to be wrong. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ ``There's a lot at stake in this election and real
differences between the two parties.'' When Joe Lieberman said that
just after Al Gore had formally picked him as the Democratic
running mate, it sounded like the sort of bland remark that
politicians perpetrate when they have nothing much to say.
Actually, it was both surprising and true. It was surprising
because for most Americans, this is one of the least gripping
elections on record. The discrepancy between what people seem to
think about this race and what is actually at stake is becoming
more striking during the current convention season _ ``the most
critical period of the campaign,'' claims Tom Mann of the Brookings
Institution. &QL;

world. Good thing, too, for at the moment the national mood in
Argentina is one of deep depression, manifested in recent days by
an outpouring of anguished self-analysis over the suicide of a
well-known surgeon. And the sense of despair goes wider still: a
million or more Argentines flocked this week to the shrine of San
Cayetano, patron saint of labor, praying for his help to find work.
At least Argentina's psychoanalysts should face no problems finding
work in the coming months. &QL;

stockbroking in American in 1996-99, it was natural that American
online brokers would start expanding into Europe. Natural, too,
that their eyes should alight first on good old Britain:
English-speaking, Internet-hip and, since the privatizations of the
1980s, home to a broad-based ``shareholder culture.'' Yet Britain
is proving slower to embrace online investing than are continental
countries, supposedly so much more leery of the American way of

   (UNDATED) _ ``Dear Tony,'' begins the earnest memo from one
policy wonk to another. ``Knowing ouir shared interest in global
climate change, I have enclosed a report on the benefits of
greenhouse gas emissions trading... With best regards, Bill.'' The
casual snoop might pass over this epistle as merely the
unremarkable ramblings of an academic or bureaucrat. Inspect more
closely, though, and two surprises emerge. First, this letter,
penned recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, is about an issue both take seriously: global
warming. Second, the letter reveals just how influential Eileen
Claussen, the head of the nonprofit Pew Center on Global Climate
Change, has now become. Why does Claussen _ the scourge of
global-warming skeptics _ have the ear of the world's most powerful
man? The answer is that she knows how to dance circles around the

   NEW YORK _ America is in the ninth year of its longest-ever
peacetime expansion, but somebody has forgotten to tell its
retailers. While department stores such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney
and Federated have been fighting decline for years, and the woes of
``category killers' such as Toys ``R'' Us are well-known, the
country's hugely successful specialty retailers _ such as Gap,
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Office Depot _
are only now hitting trouble. There are many reasons, but above
all, the fat years of the recent past have tempted store groups
into over-ambitious expansion plans. &QL;

the first-ever public offering of shares by a big firm from
Bollywood, the name for the Hindi movie industry located around
Mumbai (Bombay). As investors pore over the volatile cash flows of
his firm, Ghai is jazzed by the idea of building a Hollywood-style
studio that hires and trains Indian movie directors, writers and
technicians. Some optimists even see India as a low-cost producer
for the global movie industry. Film City, a newly expanded
2,000-acre complex on the outskirts of Hyderabad, offers 40 studio
floors and sophisticated post-production facilities; it has already
attracted a handful of movie-makers from Hollywood. &QL;

<P>
   With the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their convention
next week, America's voters will have before them four men bidding
to lead their country. Should they choose the pragmatic politician,
the co-chief executive of their country, who has supervised eight
years of staggering prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   Or what about the dreamy idealist, the policy wonk absorbed by
technology and the environment? Or perhaps the sour, partisan
reactionary _ a brutal attack dog who specializes in ripping apart
the ``risky'' dreams of others?
</P>
<P>
   Or then again, there is the panicky panderer, who changes his
mind about a small Cuban boy's future just to win a few votes in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be too difficult, but for one thing: all four of
these men are Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, consistency is hardly the political profession's main
speciality; the vice president's Republican opponent, George W.
Bush, to name but one, has courted and dropped the religious right
at least twice during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But, given his prominence in public life, the level of doubt not
just about the vice president's basic beliefs but also his
character is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are not just four Gores to choose from. The whole
tribe could form a queue around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than providing the usual opportunity to help cull their
number, the campaign so far has merely added more Gores, some of
them (class-warrior Gore, outsider Gore) indecently farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   Even within his personal heartland _ the environment _ there is
a chasm between the eco-zealotry of his recently reissued book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' and the mild measures the vice president
says he wants to enact.
</P>
<P>
   This ambiguity, particularly the sour side of it, is one reason
why many people seem more comfortable with the easier-to-follow
Bush. Fresh from his own convention in Philadelphia, some opinion
polls have put the Texan governor as much as 17 percentage points
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can expect to get a post-convention bounce in the polls as
well, especially given his bold and tactically shrewd choice as his
running-mate of Senator Joseph Lieberman, Bill Clinton's most
prominent Democratic critic over Monica and morals.
</P>
<P>
   But will that be enough? Although Nov. 7 is still a long way
off, no candidate in recent history has rebounded to win having
been behind at the start of September.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is formidable. Yet one thing is clear: Gore should
be an impressive candidate _ and could still become one. After all,
Gore has no need to prove his competence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Republican National Convention, The Economist asked,
``Is Mr. Bush ready?'' No such doubts exist about a man who already
runs much of the White House's business.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, probably the most involved vice president in history, has
spent a lifetime preparing for the presidency. On wonkish issues
like missile defense, Gore has probably forgotten more than Bush
will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some of the main issues of the election _ medical care
and Social Security _ are ones where voters have traditionally
preferred Democrats. Gore's incremental approach may be less daring
and prove ultimately less effective than Bush's; but it may be more
in line with voters' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Gore, as the inheritor of the Clinton economy, has an
impressive record to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Republicans ask Americans to turn their backs on
the 1990s, they sound like those spoilsport Democrats did during
the Reaganite 1980s. Most Americans have never had it so good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already been snarling at Bush's ``risky'' schemes to
endanger that prosperity (not to mention all his other risky plans
for education and Social Security).
</P>
<P>
   A negative campaign can go a long way _ as Gore proved in the
primaries when he ripped apart Bill Bradley's health-care reforms,
whilst offering precious few new ideas of his own. Yet attack can
also backfire. After all, Americans currently give the credit for
their economic good fortune more to the Federal Reserve than the
White House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of Clinton fatigue: ``change, versus
more of the same,'' as the great man's own campaigners once put it.
And the more Gore snarls, the more he risks emphasizing one of his
weaknesses _ that unlike Clinton and, it seems, Bush, voters do not
find him likeable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, at the upcoming convention, Gore has to speak
convincingly about himself _ and about what he actually believes
in. One advantage of his current predicament is that he now has a
relatively blank slate on which to draw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper's hopes for what he might actually say range from
sadly unrealistic fantasies (he deserts the teachers' unions and
promises structural reform in America's schools) to unlikely hopes
(he revokes his waffle about ``fair trade''), to reasonable
expectations (he expands his measures for gun control).
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's general instincts seem creditable _ his
internationalism, for instance; others, particularly his faith in
government intervention, less so. No matter: Bush also has his
faults. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is to give more indication of what a Gore
presidency might be like. Two people might serve as role models.
The first, bizarrely, is Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, the then-vice president seemed sour and
unfocused and was also at one point 17 points behind a successful
governor, Michael Dukakis. His eventual victory owed much to a very
nasty campaign, which traduced his rival's record.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the lesson, Gore's team, partly staffed by former
Dukakis people, would have no qualms about copying.
</P>
<P>
   But, in 1988, the older Bush also offered a little more. At his
convention, the man derided as ``every woman's first husband''
emerged as an independent character _ and stepped out from
President Ronald Reagan's shadow. Gore now similarly needs to shrug
off Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The second is Lieberman. Not only does the Connecticut senator
convey a much firmer moral compass than Gore; the very act of
choosing him has already shown a bolder side to the vice president
on which he now needs to build.
</P>
<P>
   Some spinmasters argued against putting a Jew, extraordinarily
for the first time ever, on a national ticket; now nobody can
understand what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore goes on to win, Lieberman may prove to have been the
turning point. But that will surely only happen if Gore presents
the American people with a coherent account of what his presidency
would be like.
</P>
<P>
   His last chance to start doing that will come in Los Angeles
next week. &QL;

NO GLUE WILL HOLD CHAIR JOINT FOR LONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August   13, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am fixing dowel joints in a chair. Is there a better glue
than white or yellow glue to hold those legs? They are always
working loose.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE SWIFT, Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those joints will always work loose because of their design.
You could try two-part epoxy, which might keep them tight for a bit
longer. Recorsinol glue, a two-part glue but not an epoxy, will
also work better, but not much. There is just too much stress from
sitting in these chairs (and leaning back on the back legs) for
them to stay tight for long.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you add wire supports, which keep the leg assembly tight,
the joints will work loose no matter what you do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I got cedar bleed (brown stains) on my cedar siding with
Benjamin Moore's solid oil stain, it washed off OK with detergent
and water. Then when it rained it came back. How can I keep it
away?
</P>
<P>
   LEO COFFEY, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cedar bleed does come off easily enough, usually, but it will
come back, particularly when it rains. The stains are the pigment
(the tannins, really) of the cedar being leached out by water, and
deposited on the siding. As long as you have moisture, particularly
behind the shingles or siding, you will have cedar bleed.
</P>
<P>
   But you can do this: Prepare the surface by sanding and washing,
then apply an exterior primer. This will seal the cedar against
bleeding, just as shellac seals a water stain on a plaster ceiling
to keep it from bleeding through the ceiling paint. Then apply two
thin coats of the Benjamin Moore solid oil stain. The primer
defeats the purpose of the solid stain, because it can peel. It
might not, but it can. It cannot be helped, unless you install
white cedar shingles and let them weather to that Cape Cod silver.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house has gas-fired heat and gas-fired hot water. My flue
pipes keep rusting out. I was told that there are too many trees
around the house, which restrict the chimney draft, and that I
should cut a few down. Another said the moisture causing the rust
is coming through the concrete floor in the basement. I had a
makeup air pipe installed to increase the draft, and a chimney cap,
but neither did much good. An aluminum flue liner failed in one
season. Now What?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL ALBERT, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Whew! You mentioned the aluminum flue liner failing in a
season. What were the other pipes that failed? I must assume they
were galvanized steel. The problem is not a bad draft, so keep the
trees, unless some are leaning over the house. The problem is
moisture, but it is not the moisture coming from the basement
floor. The aluminum flue liner failed because it was the wrong
kind. The moisture is coming from the fuel. Burning gas creates two
cubic feet of water vapor for each cubic foot of gas burned. That's
a lot of water vapor, and it condenses as it goes up the chimney,
rusting out the flue liners.
</P>
<P>
   Install a stainless steel flue liner, or a special aluminum type
that is recommended by the gas company. In fact, either type of
liner is required when gas is burned.
</P>
<P>
   That has to work. But if it doesn't consider converting your two
heaters into power-vented ones. Power-vented heaters exhaust
low-temperature gases out a PVC pipe through the wall, eliminating
the need for a chimney.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is on a concrete slab. I would like to put down a
border of hardwood on the floor, with a rug in the middle. There
are 10-inch vinyl tiles there now, over a layer of 9-inch asphalt
tiles. Can I take off those tiles along the border and substitute a
hardwood floor as a border?
</P>
<P>
   H.K., Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can, but it's a lot of work, can involve checking
for asbestos in both types of tiles and possibly very expensive
removal, if those tiles contain asbestos. Besides, putting hardwood
on the concrete is not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not try this: Buy Pergo, the laminated plastic flooring
that looks pretty much like wood but is only about 1/4-inch thick,
and glue it down as a border. Then put the rug in the middle, over
the tiles. The rug and pad are about the same thickness as the
Pergo, so you won't trip over the border.
</P>
<P>
   This way you will avoid lots of headaches. Not only is removal
of the tiles and adhesive difficult, but both the vinyl and asphalt
tiles may contain asbestos. To determine this, you'd have to take
or send a sample of the tiles to an asbestos abatement company or
certified testing laboratory for analysis. Abatement companies are
in the Yellow Pages under Asbestos Abatement, labs under
Laboratories _ Testing.
</P>
<P>
   You can avoid all this by installing wall-to-wall indoor-outdoor
carpet. The tiles are safe as long as they are undisturbed.
</P>

RETRANSMITTING TO CORRECT GARBLED TEXT 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sun., Aug. 13.) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Running Mates'' is standard-issue Hollywood glop that reveals
virtually no insight into the world it describes, which is doubly
disappointing, as it couldn't be more timely. In an acting stretch,
celebrated conservative Tom Selleck stars as Jim Pryce, a
presidential aspirant on the eve of the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, surrounded by questions _ who will he
select as his running mate? _ and a bevy of past and present
paramours. Well, he !ital!is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The sinister big-money forces (lacking only handlebar mustaches
to twiddle) will bankroll his entire campaign if Pryce selects
Texas Sen. Morris (Bruce McGill), a guy who oozes evil like a Lone
Star well oozes oil _ it's a wonder anyone ever ventured near this
guy, let alone elected him. Lauren Hartman (Laura Linney), his
loyal and whip-smart (yet not so smart that she didn't have an
affair with him) campaign manager, wants him to pick the upright
Sen. Randall (Bob Gunton, and damned if he doesn't look a little
like Joseph Lieberman), who's passionate about campaign finance
reform. A former mistress from his distant past, the boozy Meg
Gable (Faye Dunaway), wants him to go with her louse of a husband
(Robert Culp). Shawna Morgan (Teri Hatcher), a Hollywood ditz who
just happens to be another prior lover, aches to help her buddies
rub elbows with all that power, while his wife (Nancy Travis) is
vaguely resentful of the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   All this has the makings of a serviceably farcical satire,
maybe, but none of it plays as remotely credible. Campaign finance
is a crucial issue that affects whether people or corporations run
our country _ an overly simplistic statement to be sure, but it's
handled even more simplistically here. Pryce's late crisis of
confidence is a joke _ did the guy really just realize how corrupt
the system is? _ as is the moment when the women all get together
to compare notes. Backhanded political maneuvering that could
affect the outcome of the election is in the offing, so of course
they all discuss how good Pryce is/was in the sack. (Selleck
manages little chemistry with any of them.)
</P>
<P>
   The pin-headed depictions of Hollywood imbeciles come off as
particularly callow (not to mention stultifyingly unfunny), with
the portrayal of the Washington media not far behind. When one
reporter aboard Pryce's plane mentions the issues, another
reproaches him, burbling, ``A week in L.A., fat expense account _
maybe we'll get laid!'' His buddy eyes the leggy Linney and leers,
``I wouldn't mind eight years of that.'' You WILL mind two hours of
this gibberish. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
These politicians make dull bedfellows &QL; 
The show ``Running Mates.'' &QL; 
What: Dramedy about the pressures _ and women _ surrounding a
presidential candidate. &QL; 
Who: Tom Selleck, Laura Linney, Nancy Travis, Teri Hatcher, Faye
Dunaway. &QL; 
Where: TNT. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL;

   With the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their convention
next week, America's voters will have before them four men bidding
to lead their country. Should they choose the pragmatic politician,
the co-chief executive of their country, who has supervised eight
years of staggering prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   Or what about the dreamy idealist, the policy wonk absorbed by
technology and the environment? Or perhaps the sour, partisan
reactionary _ a brutal attack dog who specializes in ripping apart
the ``risky'' dreams of others?
</P>
<P>
   Or then again, there is the panicky panderer, who changes his
mind about a small Cuban boy's future just to win a few votes in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be too difficult, but for one thing: all four of
these men are Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, consistency is hardly the political profession's main
speciality; the vice president's Republican opponent, George W.
Bush, to name but one, has courted and dropped the religious right
at least twice during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But, given his prominence in public life, the level of doubt not
just about the vice president's basic beliefs but also his
character is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are not just four Gores to choose from. The whole
tribe could form a queue around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than providing the usual opportunity to help cull their
number, the campaign so far has merely added more Gores, some of
them (class-warrior Gore, outsider Gore) indecently farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   Even within his personal heartland _ the environment _ there is
a chasm between the eco-zealotry of his recently reissued book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' and the mild measures the vice president
says he wants to enact.
</P>
<P>
   This ambiguity, particularly the sour side of it, is one reason
why many people seem more comfortable with the easier-to-follow
Bush. Fresh from his own convention in Philadelphia, some opinion
polls have put the Texan governor as much as 17 percentage points
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can expect to get a post-convention bounce in the polls as
well, especially given his bold and tactically shrewd choice as his
running-mate of Senator Joseph Lieberman, Bill Clinton's most
prominent Democratic critic over Monica and morals.
</P>
<P>
   But will that be enough? Although Nov. 7 is still a long way
off, no candidate in recent history has rebounded to win having
been behind at the start of September.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is formidable. Yet one thing is clear: Gore should
be an impressive candidate _ and could still become one. After all,
Gore has no need to prove his competence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Republican National Convention, The Economist asked,
``Is Mr. Bush ready?'' No such doubts exist about a man who already
runs much of the White House's business.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, probably the most involved vice president in history, has
spent a lifetime preparing for the presidency. On wonkish issues
like missile defense, Gore has probably forgotten more than Bush
will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some of the main issues of the election _ medical care
and Social Security _ are ones where voters have traditionally
preferred Democrats. Gore's incremental approach may be less daring
and prove ultimately less effective than Bush's; but it may be more
in line with voters' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Gore, as the inheritor of the Clinton economy, has an
impressive record to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Republicans ask Americans to turn their backs on
the 1990s, they sound like those spoilsport Democrats did during
the Reaganite 1980s. Most Americans have never had it so good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already been snarling at Bush's ``risky'' schemes to
endanger that prosperity (not to mention all his other risky plans
for education and Social Security).
</P>
<P>
   A negative campaign can go a long way _ as Gore proved in the
primaries when he ripped apart Bill Bradley's health-care reforms,
whilst offering precious few new ideas of his own. Yet attack can
also backfire. After all, Americans currently give the credit for
their economic good fortune more to the Federal Reserve than the
White House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of Clinton fatigue: ``change, versus
more of the same,'' as the great man's own campaigners once put it.
And the more Gore snarls, the more he risks emphasizing one of his
weaknesses _ that unlike Clinton and, it seems, Bush, voters do not
find him likeable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, at the upcoming convention, Gore has to speak
convincingly about himself _ and about what he actually believes
in. One advantage of his current predicament is that he now has a
relatively blank slate on which to draw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper's hopes for what he might actually say range from
sadly unrealistic fantasies (he deserts the teachers' unions and
promises structural reform in America's schools) to unlikely hopes
(he revokes his waffle about ``fair trade''), to reasonable
expectations (he expands his measures for gun control).
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's general instincts seem creditable _ his
internationalism, for instance; others, particularly his faith in
government intervention, less so. No matter: Bush also has his
faults. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is to give more indication of what a Gore
presidency might be like. Two people might serve as role models.
The first, bizarrely, is Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, the then-vice president seemed sour and
unfocused and was also at one point 17 points behind a successful
governor, Michael Dukakis. His eventual victory owed much to a very
nasty campaign, which traduced his rival's record.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the lesson, Gore's team, partly staffed by former
Dukakis people, would have no qualms about copying.
</P>
<P>
   But, in 1988, the older Bush also offered a little more. At his
convention, the man derided as ``every woman's first husband''
emerged as an independent character _ and stepped out from
President Ronald Reagan's shadow. Gore now similarly needs to shrug
off Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The second is Lieberman. Not only does the Connecticut senator
convey a much firmer moral compass than Gore; the very act of
choosing him has already shown a bolder side to the vice president
on which he now needs to build.
</P>
<P>
   Some spinmasters argued against putting a Jew, extraordinarily
for the first time ever, on a national ticket; now nobody can
understand what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore goes on to win, Lieberman may prove to have been the
turning point. But that will surely only happen if Gore presents
the American people with a coherent account of what his presidency
would be like.
</P>
<P>
   His last chance to start doing that will come in Los Angeles
next week. &QL;

&HT;     PRIVACY GROUPS SAY CELL PHONE RULE GIVES POLICE UNTOLD POWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what privacy rights advocates say is a
significant threat to civil liberties in the digital age, law
enforcement agencies may soon be able to turn the cellular phone
into a ready-made tool for nosing around in private lives.
</P>
<P>
   If a federal rule stands up to a court challenge here, the FBI
and local police will be allowed to track a cell phone user's
location while monitoring bank and data transactions made with the
device _ all without the need for a court-ordered wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious breach of privacy,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in New York. It's the equivalent of ``putting a peep hole in
a every new home through which law enforcement can look.'' He said
the rule ``means that cell phones become location-tracking devices,
which can be used to monitor our movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 million Americans use cell phones. In an era when an
ever-increasing amount of communications and commerce _ including
Internet activity _ is conducted over cellular phones, the rule
could disrupt a fragile balance between the privacy needs of
individuals and the investigation needs of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a watchdog group, said the potential government
powers ``raise significant privacy issues.'' The government is
``seeking surveillance capabilities that far exceed the powers law
enforcement has had in the past and is entitled to under the law,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Steele, executive director of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a privacy oversight group based in San Francisco, said
that the proposed rule is ``a really, really big grab'' to expand
government's investigative powers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, under current federal rules, if investigators want
to tap a phone, either a cell phone or a regular one, they must get
permission from a judge. As part of the petition for a wiretap
warrant, the agency must provide the court with evidence of
probable cause that the suspect whose phone is to be tapped is
engaging in criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new rule, law enforcement would gain the
additional power to track the approximate location of a cell phone
user without having to ask a judge. ``That gives them a tremendous
amount of power they didn't have before,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology exists to allow investigators to determine the
general location of a cell phone user. The country is divided into
``cells'' several miles wide that provide service for cell phone
users. By knowing in what cell a call begins and ends,
investigators glean a fairly good understanding of a user's
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The government disagrees with the privacy critics, asserting
that law enforcement agencies need to be able to monitor cell
phones in order to keep pace with criminals, who are increasingly
turning to the devices and to the Internet to conduct illicit
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said in a court filing in Washington that
privacy interests ``are adequately protected'' under the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the use of wiretaps is surging. In 1999, the number
of wiretaps ordered by federal and local authorities on pagers,
cell phones, e-mail and faxes increase about 20 percent over the
previous year, pushing the total number of government wiretaps to a
record 1,350, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts. The Justice Department accounted for 601 of the
court-approved wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the wiretaps were used in drug
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In one high-profile case last year, federal agents arrested 98
people in a drug-smuggling ring stretching from El Paso to the
Northeast. The arrests in part were facilitated by the use of a
`roving wiretap'' to track the use of several cell phones used in
drug transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI recently ran headlong into a major controversy over
another digital-age eavesdropping capability known as Carnivore.
Carnivore scans the Internet and captures ``packets,'' the standard
unit of digital communication that the FBI also is seeking in the
cell phone rule.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore, which would be installed at Internet service
providers like America Online, scours the on-line activities of a
suspect. Members of Congress and privacy groups, outraged that the
device gives the FBI access to the entirety of the Internet
provider's electronic traffic, assert that the system is rife for
potential abuse.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the cell phone case is a proposed Federal
Communications Commission regulation issued at the behest of the
Justice Department nearly one year ago. It directed that by Sept.
30, 2001, cellular phone companies must be able to provide
authorities with the general location of cellular phone users.
Under the order, the police may obtain location information based
where a call originated and ended.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the rule directs that cell phone companies create
eavesdropping-friendly networks for investigators. Without the need
for a wiretap warrant, the government wants:
</P>
<P>
   _ To be able to capture in real time the digits that a cell
phone user dials after a call is connected, such as call-forwarding
telephone numbers or digits used to access credit card and bank
accounts;
</P>
<P>
   _ To be able to capture so-called ``packet-mode
communications,'' which contain the content of a telephone call or
data transmission broken down into electronic chunks.
</P>
<P>
   The actions ``will help ensure that law enforcement has the most
up-to-date technology to fight crime,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition of privacy rights organizations and cellular
industry associations, including those mentioned above, is fighting
the rule in U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A
ruling could come as soon as this month.
</P>
<P>
   The groups argue that under the proposed rule the ``packets''
containing the actual content of a call could be easily accessed by
investigators without a formal wiretap warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Olson, a lawyer who represents the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association and Center for Democracy
and Technology, said, ``Our objection is that the FCC wants the
telephone companies to provide information to law enforcement
involving content _ without a wiretap'' order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement would get a lot of content under this. They
don't get it all, but they'd get a lot,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   The government counters that the concerns of privacy groups are
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC said in written arguments filed with the court that
there should be no concern about using cell phones to obtain the
location of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information revealing the approximate location of wireless
callers ... is no different from the location information that
results from the detection of a telephone number in the landline
system,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Colgate, an assistant U.S. attorney general, added in an
interview that investigators have no intention of turning ``cell
phones into a real-time homing devices.'' To do so, he said, would
require a court-ordered wiretap, and would only be done if
absolutely necessary. He cited the example of tracking the
movements of a suspected kidnapper.

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Colgate stressed that ``packet'' surveillance would
not be used ``as a back-door way'' to get a unauthorized wiretaps,
as the privacy coalition fears. If law enforcement wants access to
the content of cell phone calls, investigators will get the proper
warrant, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate said that the privacy and industry coalition has an
unreasonable fear about ``rogue law enforcement operations'' as
epitomized during the long reign of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not willing to buy in that we're going to have the Hoover
era of the 1950s and 1960s over again,'' Colgate said.
</P>
<P>
   Such assurances do little to assuage the concerns of the ACLU's
Steinhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their arguments come down to this: `Trust us. We are going to
get access to information that we are not entitled to, but we won't
look at it,''' he said.

<P>
   After barely a fortnight of frail life, the peace process in
Jammu &AMP; Kashmir is officially dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul Mujahideen, one of the main groups fighting India's rule
in its only Muslim-majority state, had on July 24 called a
cease-fire and said it would like to talk to the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it imposed an ultimatum: the talks would have to include
Pakistan, which controls a third of Kashmir and regards India's
portion as its rightful inheritance, or the cease-fire would be
called off.
</P>
<P>
   India ignored the ultimatum, and on Aug. 8 Hizbul Mujahideen
said it would fight on.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict seems to be back to the same hopeless state in
which it has languished for 53 years _ except that nowadays, on a
whim of either India or Pakistan, it could turn nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to some rumors, Pakistan and India have, despite
appearances, already struck a secret deal on the future of Kashmir,
making the end of the truce nothing more than a tactical maneuver.
That seems unlikely, though nothing can be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the past hopeful fortnight's events turn out to be no
more than a feint in the direction of peace, though, they have
revealed the contours of how a peace process might evolve.
</P>
<P>
   First, it should be understood that the stated obstacles to
peace are not the real ones.
</P>
<P>
   India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, dispensed quickly
with the main Indian objection to talks with the rebels, who want
either independence for Kashmir or union with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Though India could not transgress its own constitution, Vajpayee
dropped his insistence that the rebels had to accept it as a
condition for talks. India should deal with them on the basis of
insaniyat (humanity), he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speed and flexibility of his response to the cease-fire gave
the rebels little excuse for backing out. Nonetheless, Hizbul
Mujahideen found one, in the form of a demand that Pakistan had to
be party to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   India rejected that for two reasons. First, it regards Pakistan
as the author of violence in Kashmir, whether it was last year's
harebrained attempt to grab territory on India's side of the line
of control or last week's horrible series of massacres in which
over 100 people died.
</P>
<P>
   More profoundly, India regards Kashmir as its territory and the
discontent of the Kashmiris as an internal matter. Even so, dual
talks could have been embarked upon, perhaps by treating them as
separate processes.
</P>
<P>
   The real hurdles to peace are, first, India's bumbling and
brutal treatment of a people who have never been certain whether
they belonged with India, Pakistan or on their own; and, second,
Pakistan's stake in their discontent.
</P>
<P>
   While it lasted, the cease-fire offered a glimpse of a way over
the first hurdle. India would have started by talking to Hizbul
Mujahideen, which, unlike most of the other militant groups, is
dominated by Kashmiris rather than outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The talks would have gradually been extended to take in other
separatist groups, including at least some of the 23 members of the
All-Party Hurriyat Conference. Eventually, they would have
encompassed all shades of opinion in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Such talks would get nowhere, however, without tangible
improvements in India's administration of Kashmir. Each stretch of
the track would add strain.
</P>
<P>
   The state's ruling party, despised by most Kashmiri Muslims, has
no wish to make way for pacified militants. Vajpayee's own party,
the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is ideologically
disinclined to make the sort of concessions that might pacify them.
Sooner or later, these issues must be faced.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre and the ultimatum suggest that Pakistan, or groups
over which Pakistan's government has some influence, can veto any
move towards peace and has strong reason to. But India has, in
essence, everything else it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Though India formally claims all of Kashmir, including the areas
now controlled by Pakistan and China, it would probably settle for
the status quo, turning the present line of control into the
international border.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan thinks, probably wrongly, that violence can force India
to grant Kashmir ``self-determination.'' Pakistan's incentive to
disrupt any truce is like that of a gunslinger in a poker game who
knows he holds low cards.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can help blunt that incentive. In March Bill Clinton,
stopping briefly in Pakistan on his way home from India, declared
that ``this era does not reward people who struggle in vain to
redraw borders with blood.''
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that behind the scenes America has been
cajoling Pakistan to restrain the militants. It had been hoping
that the country's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, was
desperate enough for economic aid to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul Mujahideen's cease-fire proposal looked like the fruit of
that pressure. Although the truce has broken down, progress need
not come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   India should continue with its peace offensive, preaching and
practicing insaniyat. That means talking to willing Kashmiris,
restoring democratic decency to the state and allowing its citizens
to be architects of their own future.
</P>
<P>
   India will not be chided for refusing tripartite talks at the
point of a gun, but it cannot forever dodge talking to Pakistan
about Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage, Vajpayee and General Musharraf will have to meet.
Pakistan and Hizbul Mujahideen will have to return to the
negotiating table, leaving their guns at the door. They may not win
back the rest of Kashmir. But a durable peace that ended the threat
of nuclear war would be quite a consolation prize. &QL;

UNLIKELY PLOT WEAKENS TNT'S CAMPAIGN FOR `RUNNING MATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beauty of a show like ``The West Wing'' is that no matter
how make-believe it is, it still seems impossibly real. The problem
with ``Running Mates,'' a politically charged movie airing on the
eve of the Democratic National Convention Sunday night, is that
it's not ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the acclaimed NBC series, which has former Oval Office
insiders on its production staff, ``Running Mates'' can boast a
political pedigree: One of its executive producers is Gerald
Rafshoon, White House communications director during the Carter
administration. But unlike ``The West Wing,'' whose scripts fairly
crackle with vitality, Sunday's TNT movie looks like someone's
untutored impression of behind-the-scenes presidential politics.
More like a botched campaign appearance, it looks staged and dated.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem: The film is described as a comedy/drama,
possibly to explain away the hysterical, though not particularly
funny, performances of Faye Dunaway and Teri Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   It's really a polemic against campaign-finance abuse, though.
Nothing wrong with that: Movies with messages are good for the
soul. But once the audience understands the ground rules, the
ending of ``Running Mates'' is about as surprising as the outcome
of modern political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Selleck (with upper lip completely naked because no one with
facial hair has been elected president since Taft) plays the main
character, Michigan Gov. James Reynolds Pryce, a liberal Democrat
with his party's presidential nomination in the bag. His big
decision now is to choose between a running mate who makes the high
rollers happy or one who's good for the country.
</P>
<P>
   The former is the obvious choice because it comes with a
guarantee of serious funding from big business. The alternative,
like raisin bran, is good for the constitution but not necessarily
a boon to one's economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name, Pryce likes to think he's not for sale, that
opportunism practiced with an eye toward the greater good is OK, or
at least convenient salve for the conscience. Pryce weighs his
options with input from four women who have made an impression in
his life, or at least in his mattress. First, but not always
foremost, is his patient wife, Jenny (Nancy Travis). More crucial
to the campaign is his loyal, driven and brilliant campaign
manager, Lauren Hartman (Laura Linney). Also in this odd bridge mix
are Meg Gable (Dunaway), the booze-fogged wife of Pryce's political
mentor, and Shawna Morgan (Hatcher), a wacko Hollywood fund-raiser
who wants to be Pryce's White House social secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Dunaway and Hatcher emoting over the top, the film
has solid performances from Selleck, Travis and the
underappreciated Linney. Bob Gunton, Bruce McGill and Rober Culp
also shine in small roles, but ``Running Mates'' ultimately lacks
the very imagination that Gov. Pryce and his campaign staff boast
will take them to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it injects stilted humor and contrived situations,
notably an implausible powder-room scene involving all four women,
in an effort to spark interest in a story that's all too familiar,
even to us political outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING MATES

<P>
   Millions of Americans will this week have found themselves in
the unusual position of agreeing with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Both George W. Bush and Al Gore are ``boring,'' said the Cuban
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer hypocrisy, Bush and Gore might reply. After all, for four
decades, Castro has notoriously bored his long-suffering people
with speeches lasting hour after hour: in the view of the old
guerrilla, it has always seemed, fatigues are not just to be worn
but also to be inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Castro was merely trying to extract advantage from a
recent and little-noticed change of heart. For Cuba's president has
at last realized that, when it comes to words, less can be more.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Castro broke the news of this revolutionary
change _ but in characteristic fashion. ``I have reached the
conclusion, a bit late perhaps, that speeches should be short,'' he
told Granma, the Cuban Communist Party daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Well, better late than never, even if this startling admission
came at the end of an interview that filled four pages of fine
print. More remarkable, however, is that Castro has been as good as
his new, short, word: none of his recent speeches has lasted longer
than 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And on July 26, a big anniversary in Cuba's revolutionary
calendar and always good for several hours of uninterrupted
oratory, the old windbag's harangue lasted less than half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Cubans will no doubt be delighted. Anyone who has stood
through a Castro speech in Cuba's tropical sun will know that even
mad dogs and Englishmen risk keeling over from heatstroke as the
latest sugar harvest is dissected in mind-numbing statistical
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden urge for brevity will doubtless also be celebrated by
the 73-year-old's enemies, but as a sign of failing vigor. They may
be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Communist government is using ``new and efficient media
methods'' to get its message across. Does this mean that Castro is
about to embrace that dreaded imperialist tool, the soundbite?
</P>
<P>
   Doubters will explain that Latins hate silence, and that
long-winded speeches are therefore intrinsic to Latin American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   In support, they may cite the example of Hugo Chavez,
Venezuela's paratrooper-turned-president, who, intoxicated by the
exuberance of his own verbosity, is doing his best to imitate the
lengthy speeches that Castro has just vowed to eschew. Last week he
entertained the press to a three-hour news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But is prolixity really Latin American? This year's Cervantes
prize, the highest literary award in the Spanish-speaking world,
went to Augusto Monterroso, a Guatemalan novelist celebrated partly
for a short story about the seemingly never-ending rule of Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party. It consisted of just one
sentence. (``When he woke up, the dinosaur was still there.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now, happily, Mexico's dinosaur is about to depart, after an
election campaign that was notable for its cacophony of soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an inevitable part of political life in Latin
America, the long-winded speech is the mark of the caudillo.
Monologue is inherently undemocratic: it demands the kind of
buttock-aching passivity to be found only among the cowed or the
deferential _ appropriate perhaps to a medieval court, but not to a
modern polity.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains now is for Castro to allow other, dissenting,
voices to fill some of the silences he proposes to leave. For
Cubans, that would be an even more welcome revolution. &QL;

TWO-GUN TEXAN NEEDS TO START USING HIS HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August   13)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I have no notion of whether Vice President Al Gore
will make missile defense a major issue when he makes his big
speech here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But he's almost a lap behind Governor George W. Bush, if you
measure laps by double-digit polling margins. And arguing that Bush
is reckless and immature by vowing to bust up the 28-year-old
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is probably not good politics.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't understand that there's really no way to
protect this country from sneak A-bomb attacks, missiles, or
otherwise. A pickup truck sneaking across from Canada, or a
sailboat coming ashore at night in the Gulf, or a freighter carting
bananas into New York Harbor can do the trick. But politicians
can't win any votes by telling you that.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor earned high marks for his big speech in
Philadelphia, mentioning ``character'' 10 times, and stressing how
red-white-and-blue he is, and sincere in helping minorities. He
tells us daily he wants us to know ``what's in my heart.'' Excuse
me: I want to know what's in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's well-delivered and well-received acceptance speech
contained just 79 words about what may be his greatest challenge as
president: ``When America uses force in the world, the cause must
be just, the goal must be clear, and the victory must be
overwhelming. I will work to reduce nuclear weapons and nuclear
tension in the world _ to turn these years of influence into
decades of peace. And, at the earliest possible date, my
administration will deploy missile defenses to guard against attack
and blackmail. Now is the time, not to defend outdated treaties,
but to defend the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   You can draw a number of inferences from this. He won't send
troops to put down riots, rebellions, or massacres in Africa or
Indonesia or the Balkans or the Middle East. Where he does send
troops, the outcome will be ``overwhelming,'' which was certainly
not the case in his father's Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the vow to deploy a new missile defense scheme ASAP is his
most breathtakingly reckless promise. It is potentially more
destabilizing than his
whoopee-I'll-give-everybody-a-great-big-fat-tax-cut promise, a
hollow bribe reprising his daddy's infamous ``read my lips _ no new
taxes!'' ploy.
</P>
<P>
   The dirty little secret of arms control is that there is no
system you can build to realistically protect American cities from
weapons of mass destruction. Any bright college sophomore can
download formulas for making atomic weapons. The Clinton
administration is weighing committing the United States to building
new radar bases in Alaska to detect missile strikes from China or
North Korea. Scientists who think the scheme cannot tell decoys
from the real thing are embroiled in bitter disputes with defense
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   I buy the technical argument that this costly system won't work.
</P>
<P>
   The same day Bush vowed to bust up the ``outdated''
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that has been the basic blueprint of
disarmament since 1972, Britain's Financial Times editorialized
that a US missile scheme in violation of the ABM treaty would be a
colossal mistake for us: ``Russia and China are both adamant in
their opposition to the US plan, which they see as a first step
toward a much more comprehensive ABM system aimed not at rogue
states but at themselves.'' All our European allies are aghast. The
Chinese, already helping North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, and Libya
with long-range missile development, are deeply suspicious of our
intent.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joe Lieberman's record of collecting defense contractor
contributions for his support of missile defense systems makes it
even less likely Gore will make a big deal of this. And
anti-Clinton blather about the Democrats' political machine selling
out America to Chinese money makes the Chinese even more wary of
Bush's saber-rattling and Gore's tiptoeing around the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Most American voters don't care what the rest of the world, the
94 percent who are not American, thinks about our fears about
hostile missiles aimed at our cities. Bush, a callow figure when it
comes to knowledge of the planet's peoples and cultures, brags of
his Midland, Texas, background and its bumptious ``The sky's the
limit!'' mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to missile defense, ``the sky's the limit!''
is a dangerous and misleading motto. The CIA just warned the White
House China will accelerate its missile-building even more if we
break the ABM Treaty. The Europeans will go ballistic, to employ a
missile term rhetorically. Against us. We are on the verge of
pitching over the precipice into another arms race. With hardly any
debate or thought.
</P>
<P>
   My hunch is that Gore will try to finesse the issue, letting
Clinton and Defense Secretary Bill Cohen decide whether to go ahead
with Alaska base preparation. If they do that, the British will
start getting sniffy about allowing us to upgrade the US radar
capability at Flyingdales in Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
   My suspicion is that the average American voter is indifferent
or even hostile to what leaders of other countries think about our
missile schemes. But our leaders have to be smarter and more wary
than our voters. That's why we call them ``leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time I hear that ``sky's the limit'' talk, I envision
missile silos yawning open, across China, Russia, the North Korean
peninsula, to Iran and Iraq and Israel, perhaps even to the Arab
oil states, and maybe the restless archipelago islands of the
Pacific. The sky is the limit, unless we grow up and recognize that
the rest of the world is not going to let us try to dominate the
planet with missile schemes that will provoke our friends as well
as our foes to build up their own weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Surely a man wise enough to be president should understand this.
Can't someone explain it to this two-gun Texan? Look, Governor:
It's like handguns in Texas; the other guy has one, you want one,
right? You must believe that, because you signed that
right-to-carry law to let Texans carry concealed handguns. So,
think of a nuclear missile like your favorite six-shooter. If
you've got one, your neighbor wants to be packing his own, right?
</P>
<P>
   Now that you've got that, go one more step: When every
so-inclined nation, right or rogue, is packing its own nukes, does
that make the neighborhood safer? Or a more dangerous place? We
need a president whose head overrules his heart. There's a lot
riding on this. Like the planet's future.

<P>
   Millions of Americans will this week have found themselves in
the unusual position of agreeing with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Both George W. Bush and Al Gore are ``boring,'' said the Cuban
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer hypocrisy, Bush and Gore might reply. After all, for four
decades, Castro has notoriously bored his long-suffering people
with speeches lasting hour after hour: in the view of the old
guerrilla, it has always seemed, fatigues are not just to be worn
but also to be inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Castro was merely trying to extract advantage from a
recent and little-noticed change of heart. For Cuba's president has
at last realized that, when it comes to words, less can be more.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Castro broke the news of this revolutionary
change _ but in characteristic fashion. ``I have reached the
conclusion, a bit late perhaps, that speeches should be short,'' he
told Granma, the Cuban Communist Party daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Well, better late than never, even if this startling admission
came at the end of an interview that filled four pages of fine
print. More remarkable, however, is that Castro has been as good as
his new, short, word: none of his recent speeches has lasted longer
than 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And on July 26, a big anniversary in Cuba's revolutionary
calendar and always good for several hours of uninterrupted
oratory, the old windbag's harangue lasted less than half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Cubans will no doubt be delighted. Anyone who has stood
through a Castro speech in Cuba's tropical sun will know that even
mad dogs and Englishmen risk keeling over from heatstroke as the
latest sugar harvest is dissected in mind-numbing statistical
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden urge for brevity will doubtless also be celebrated by
the 73-year-old's enemies, but as a sign of failing vigor. They may
be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Communist government is using ``new and efficient media
methods'' to get its message across. Does this mean that Castro is
about to embrace that dreaded imperialist tool, the soundbite?
</P>
<P>
   Doubters will explain that Latins hate silence, and that
long-winded speeches are therefore intrinsic to Latin American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   In support, they may cite the example of Hugo Chavez,
Venezuela's paratrooper-turned-president, who, intoxicated by the
exuberance of his own verbosity, is doing his best to imitate the
lengthy speeches that Castro has just vowed to eschew. Last week he
entertained the press to a three-hour news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But is prolixity really Latin American? This year's Cervantes
prize, the highest literary award in the Spanish-speaking world,
went to Augusto Monterroso, a Guatemalan novelist celebrated partly
for a short story about the seemingly never-ending rule of Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party. It consisted of just one
sentence. (``When he woke up, the dinosaur was still there.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now, happily, Mexico's dinosaur is about to depart, after an
election campaign that was notable for its cacophony of soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an inevitable part of political life in Latin
America, the long-winded speech is the mark of the caudillo.
Monologue is inherently undemocratic: it demands the kind of
buttock-aching passivity to be found only among the cowed or the
deferential _ appropriate perhaps to a medieval court, but not to a
modern polity.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains now is for Castro to allow other, dissenting,
voices to fill some of the silences he proposes to leave. For
Cubans, that would be an even more welcome revolution. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Before the current stage of the presidential
campaign began, conventional wisdom (excuse the term) held that
George W. Bush's choice of running mate would define his candidacy
but the Republican shindig would not.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, it was thought that Al Gore's running mate would
hardly matter (because the options were all so dismal) but his
speech to the Democratic National Convention would be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   So far, every part of this wisdom has turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's choice of running mate said little more than that he
likes to surround himself with well-qualified politicians with
conservative voting records.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention, on the other hand, was an eye-opener,
showing what the ``new Republican Party'' is willing to do to
attract independents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gore's choice of Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut may
go as far as any vice-presidential pick can go towards changing
perceptions about a candidate. It gives a spark of excitement to a
candidacy that has so far plodded from one unconvincing moment to
another.
</P>
<P>
   It is an axiom of American politics that a huge problem for any
incumbent vice president is to distinguish himself from the
president without repudiating the record on which he is running.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Gore's task should be easier than most. He should
be able to distance himself from the personal lapses while
endorsing the policy achievements. In practice it has been harder,
since, during the Lewinsky scandal, he felt obliged to be loyal to
his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democrat to attack Clinton during the
Lewinsky affair, saying on the Senate floor that the president's
behavior was not just inappropriate but immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking innocence by association will not help Gore overcome
``Clinton fatigue'' at a stroke. Nor will it remove the question of
presidential morality from the debate (arguably, it puts the matter
back near the top of the agenda for a while).
</P>
<P>
   But it will blunt the force of criticism because Republicans can
no longer say _ as Dick Cheney did in Philadelphia _ that ``it is
not possible to look at (Gore) without thinking about (Clinton).''
It now is.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the choice of Lieberman may encourage voters
to reassess Gore himself. This is not just because, as both men
have repeatedly said, Lieberman is the first Jew on the
presidential ticket of a big party. Rather, it is because some of
the qualities that make him unusual are shared by Gore too.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman were two of only ten Democrats in the Senate
to vote for the Gulf war. Lieberman's religious side _ he observes
Orthodox Jewish practices, and quoted the Book of Chronicles when
his nomination was announced _ chimes with Gore's less remarked
upon, but still marked, Baptist faith.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman hands out ``silver sewer'' awards to ``culturally
polluting'' movies, music or videos. One of the first people who
tried to shame the entertainment industry into restraint was Gore's
wife, Tipper, in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a small personal link. Orthodox Jews may not drive
on the Sabbath. When there was a Senate vote on that day, Lieberman
used to stay at an apartment near the Capitol owned by the Gores,
and the Shabbosgoy (the Gentile who would do other banned things
like turning on the lights) was none other than Al.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman had been merely a pillar of rectitude with no
connection with Gore, his selection would have been tokenism. As it
is, his reputation may help to improve Gore's own.
</P>
<P>
   And, as an immediate consequence, it should help him both with
socially conservative voters _ notably suburban women and
blue-collar men, among whom Gore is getting hammered _ and with the
large number of people who disapprove of Clinton personally but
like his policies.
</P>
<P>
   In picking Lieberman, Gore did something unusual: he took a
risk. He did so with Lieberman's religion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism in America is less potent than it used to be, but
it has not vanished. One Jewish candidate was defeated by a rival
who went around asking, ``How can North Carolina have a
representative in Washington who won't eat North Carolina
barbecue?'' (the state is famous for barbecued pork). That was in a
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how widespread this attitude is. But people are
more prejudiced than they are willing to tell others, and in one
recent poll 6 percent of the population still said they would not
vote for a Jewish candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is also a risk on particular issues. He has spoken
in favor of the partial privatization of Social Security _ which
Gore excoriates Bush for proposing. He has favored school vouchers
_ for which Gore excoriated Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has now backed off both ideas, and even though in
general his policies are similar to Gore's, the Democratic ticket
still looks less than united on these two controversial policies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, Lieberman is a risk to party unity. Vouchers
are anathema to the teachers' unions (a huge proportion of
delegates at next week's Democratic Convention are teachers). His
campaign against pornography is anathema to Hollywood. His support
of free trade is unpopular with unions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he offends three large Democratic interest
groups at a time when Gore has not yet nailed down the support of
the whole party.
</P>
<P>
   With Ralph Nader ready to snap up all Democrats who put ideology
above party, the risk is not trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats have lauded the nomination. But that is partly
because Lieberman has backtracked on Social Security and education,
two of the issues that endeared him to independent voters in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore took a gamble and, in bringing it off, has lessened
his reputation as a shameless panderer.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the most important decision of his campaign so far
and, on balance, it is a good one. But it is good, mainly, because
of its shock value.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will cause voters to look at Gore anew. The question
is what Gore does then. He has to appeal to the center, solidify
the base and clarify what his candidacy is about.
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task, and one that Gore must confront alone. To
that extent, the last part of the conventional wisdom _ that the
Democratic gathering next week is vital for Gore _ still seems
right. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ ``There's a lot at stake in this election and real
differences between the two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Lieberman said that at the war memorial in Nashville
just after Al Gore had formally picked him as the Democratic
running mate, it sounded like the sort of remark _ simultaneously
bland and exaggerated _ that politicians perpetrate when they have
nothing much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was both surprising and true. It was surprising
because for most Americans, and almost all foreigners, this is one
of the least gripping elections on record.
</P>
<P>
   Many still think of it as the Gush versus Bore contest _ between
two cautious scions of America's political aristocracy rushing
towards the electoral center offering undistinguished and
indistinguishable policy platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's comment is also true because for the first time in
decades almost any electoral result is conceivable, ranging from a
clean sweep of the presidency, Senate and House of Representatives
by the Republicans, to a clean sweep by the Democrats _ or any
combination in between.
</P>
<P>
   That means the winner could end up with a degree of control not
seen since the Eisenhower administration and would be able to
influence policy for years afterwards through its control of the
many appointments to the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve
Board that fall due during the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy between what people seem to think about this
election and what is actually at stake is becoming more striking
during the current convention season _ ``the most critical period
of the campaign,'' claims Tom Mann of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   There may still be few clear signs that America's apathetic
voters are aware what their decision in November could do to their
country. But something is beginning to click. The gravitas of the
candidates and the sharpness of their policy differences have both
increased over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has never been accused of lacking seriousness, but Bush has
and the display of party unity at the Republican Convention in
Philadelphia last week, in addition to his well-received final
speech, suggests that, at the least, he has become a formidable
party manager and campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   These two have now been joined by two of the more respected
politicians in the country _ Dick Cheney, the secretary of defense
during the Gulf war, and Lieberman, the nearest thing the Senate
has to a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The policy differences between the two sides have also begun to
sharpen. On Social Security (the pensions system), Bush has
proposed letting people take a share of their payroll taxes _
probably two percentage points out of the current 12.4 percent _
and invest it in personal retirement accounts. This is the
so-called ``partial privatization of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to encourage private saving for retirement. But
he does so by proposing a federal savings subsidy, directed at
poorer savers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Bush would change the structure of the system
up front, while Gore would erode people's dependence on Social
Security by encouraging additional savings and, possibly, make
structural changes later.
</P>
<P>
   There is a comparable difference in education and health care.
Gore wants to increase spending on public education by up to four
times as much as Bush does. But Bush would try to transform the
system itself by allowing some parents to divert the money that now
goes into their children's public education towards private
schools, providing a measure of competition.
</P>
<P>
   On health, Gore wants to expand Medicaid (the system for poor
Americans) to some who do not now get it, and expand Medicare (for
the elderly) to cover the cost of more prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to reform Medicare by allowing people to buy
different levels of health care, and would provide the prescription
drug benefit through private insurers, not the government.
</P>
<P>
   None of this compares with the sort of ideological choice that
Ronald Reagan presented to Americans in 1980. But the differences
are sharp enough, and if you add in the tax cuts the two are
proposing ($1.3 trillion over ten years for Bush, $500 billion for
Gore, including the savings subsidy), it is hard to argue that it
would make little difference whom the voters decide to pick.
</P>
<P>
   Despite which, the attitudes of those voters have not changed
much. Influenced partly by satisfaction with the economy and partly
by a sense that politicians have had little to do with their
prosperity, voters remain unmoved by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hours of television watched and broadcast for the
Republican Convention was the lowest since TV became a mass medium.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of voters who say they are not following the
campaign continues to rise (44 percent now compared with 37 percent
in July 1996). Still, the twists and turns of the election do seem
to be having an impact on those who are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead in the polls leapt after last week's Republican
Convention in Philadelphia by an average of six points to around
14. That lead immediately shrank to within the margin of error in
one poll taken the day Gore chose his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The moral may be not that voters are entirely indifferent, but
that their involvement is mild and changeable. This in turn is
determining campaign strategy. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900, OR CONTINUE TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No one could fairly accuse the Republicans of offering a vacuous
set of policies. But politically, the main impact of their
proposals has not been to focus voters' attention on the issues but
rather to minimize the perception (which still exists) that Bush is
a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican interest lies in keeping attention away from
policy matters and on to the contrast of personality, where Bush
outscores Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, of course, have the opposite interest. And that
is where the election now stands _ with voters roughly evenly
divided between an unfocused satisfaction which probably favors
Bush and a fitful interest in the issues which Democrats believe
favors Gore.

<P>
   It is a start. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ ``There's a lot at stake in this election and real
differences between the two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Lieberman said that at the war memorial in Nashville
just after Al Gore had formally picked him as the Democratic
running mate, it sounded like the sort of remark _ simultaneously
bland and exaggerated _ that politicians perpetrate when they have
nothing much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was both surprising and true. It was surprising
because for most Americans, and almost all foreigners, this is one
of the least gripping elections on record.
</P>
<P>
   Many still think of it as the Gush versus Bore contest _ between
two cautious scions of America's political aristocracy rushing
towards the electoral center offering undistinguished and
indistinguishable policy platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's comment is also true because for the first time in
decades almost any electoral result is conceivable, ranging from a
clean sweep of the presidency, Senate and House of Representatives
by the Republicans, to a clean sweep by the Democrats _ or any
combination in between.
</P>
<P>
   That means the winner could end up with a degree of control not
seen since the Eisenhower administration and would be able to
influence policy for years afterwards through its control of the
many appointments to the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve
Board that fall due during the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy between what people seem to think about this
election and what is actually at stake is becoming more striking

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Watkins Park, with its meandering stream and its
thicket of greenery, is as bucolic as downtown Indianapolis gets.
But look a little more closely _ or inhale a little more deeply _
and reality intrudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, look at that crap!'' shouts Tom Neltner. As an
activist environmentalist, he knows whereof he speaks, and there it
is: raw sewage, as well as condoms, clearly visible in the stream.
``Floatables'' is the official euphemism for them. ``Sinkables''?
Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   The mess is not just unsightly; unwary trespassers can pick up
E. Coli, or contract shigellosis and hepatitis, by dabbling in the
babbling brook. But warning signs have clearly been ignored.
Hanging from a nearby tree is a bobber connected to a fishing line.
</P>
<P>
   This rustic scene comes courtesy of Indianapolis's ``combined
sewer overflow'' (or CSO) system, which was designed nearly a
century ago to carry both sewage and storm water through one set of
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis's pipes have now become so overfilled and
undermended that they regularly carry sewage where it is not
supposed to go _ to Watkins Park or, worse, into people's
basements.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis is not the only city grappling with CSO problems.
In the 1970s and 1980s, some places used federal grants to convert
their old systems, but about 1,000 American cities, predominantly
in the Midwest and the Northwest, still have them.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, where environmental law-enforcement is often on the lax
side, accounts for about 10 percent of the communities that still
use CSOs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea did not lack logic, in the beginning. The men who built
them designed CSOs to fail once or twice a year, during unusually
big storms _ an acceptable risk, they decided, when compared with
the substantial added cost of building separate flow systems.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, some districts of Indianapolis get 85 overflows
annually, or 1.8 million gallons of diluted crud a year. Sometimes,
rainstorms that dump a mere fraction of an inch set off an
overflow.
</P>
<P>
   CSOs serve about 10 percent of the 400-square-mile city of
Indianapolis, predominantly the downtown area and some older
districts. Wherever they exist, housing values go down, no matter
how quaint the architecture or convenient the location.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Truedell-Bell, a community leader in the Mapleton-Fall
Creek district, blames the local incidence of childhood asthma on
sulphur from backed-up sewage.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the problem is easy to explain. Rapid population
growth and heavy property development during the 20th century meant
that more and more homes were hooked up to the CSO system, pushing
pipes far past their original capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors contributed, including the (pretty universal)
preference for low taxes over big investment in things you can't
see, such as sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Could another factor _ racism _ have been involved? Critics
charge that the Republicans who generally control Unigov, the
region's unusual government combing city and county, have been more
sympathetic to affluent suburbanites than to inner-city blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Neltner's pressure group _ Improving Kids' Environment, or IKE _
filed a complaint last October with the federal Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
</P>
<P>
   IKE contends that CSO neighborhoods with large numbers of blacks
get more serious overflows than CSO districts that are mostly
white. This, IKE contends, is because, Indianapolis officials have
tried to patch up the system in the white areas first, even though
the problems were less severe.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is still looking at the issue; if it agrees with IKE,
the agency may require the city to fix the problem properly.
</P>
<P>
   Neltner, for his part, would like to see an end to new suburban
connections to the old sewer system and a program that notifies
residents when overflows are happening (in case they are not yet
aware that sewage is streaming down the street).
</P>
<P>
   He also wants a long-term plan to fix the system. The obvious
way to do so would be to separate Indianapolis's storm pipes from
its sewers. Most experts say that the cost and the physical
disruption would make this impracticable.
</P>
<P>
   But even less-costly remedies _ such as building new storage
facilities and control mechanisms that would work together to make
peak flows more manageable _ would still be pricey, though exactly
how much is the theme of spirited arguments between Republicans and
the Democratic mayor (the first Democrat to hold that post in a
generation).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that CSO improvements would cost families $150
more in sewer charges every month. Although that seems a clear
exaggeration, the new mayor's director of public works admits they
would be ``very expensive to implement.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if you are planning to visit Indianapolis this
autumn, pack your galoshes. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ America is in the ninth year of its longest-ever
peacetime expansion, but somebody has forgotten to tell its
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   While department stores such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney and
Federated have been fighting decline for years, and the woes of
``category killers'' such as Toys ``R'' Us are well-known, the
country's hugely successful specialty retailers are only now
hitting trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been two profit warnings from Gap, a
clothing retailer, and warnings or falling sales numbers from,
among others, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters,
Pacific Sunwear and Office Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers' average ``same-store'' sales growth _ for units open
a year or more _ has been falling since late last year; according
to Buckingham Research Group, growth at the end of July averaged
3.6 percent, little more than half the level in December.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers blame a variety of things, from the weather to a
slowing economy. A relatively rainy summer may, admittedly, be
holding back clothing sales. And consumer spending appears to have
dropped off from the exceptional levels of the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But June's retail sales figures, which showed a healthy
annualized increase of 8.7 percent, suggest that American shoppers
are still hitting the malls in force.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, in truth, is not demand but supply. The fat
years of the recent past have tempted store groups into
over-ambitious expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Julian of Credit Suisse First Boston points out that
America now has ten times more square footage of retail space per
head than does Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are ``ignoring any notion of overcapacity,'' he says.
Clothing chains such as Gap are particularly guilty, because their
small stores are quick to build and tempt with the fattest returns.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Slater of Lazard Freres thinks that the supply of specialty
clothing space is already outstripping consumer demand, and that
the gap will grow. He calculates that growth in square footage at
American clothing chains will accelerate to 9-10 percent for this
year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Gap and American Eagle all plan to increase
floor space by two to three times that rate this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, many of these expansion plans might seem sensible
_ after all, even the seemingly omnipresent Gap has just 6 percent
of the country's clothing market. Combined, however, they are
threatening to saturate Main Street. And, as Slater points out, too
much supply will force discounting to clear excess stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a business such as retailing, with high fixed costs,
discounting spells death for profit margins. In addition, the
retailers face increasing competition, both foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   While Gap has for years successfully expanded abroad, foreign
chains such as Sweden's Hennes &AMP; Mauritz and Spain's Zara have now
established a foothold in New York and plan a nationwide expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, domestic discounters, such as Costco, Kmart and above
all Wal-Mart, are continuing to take market share. Their same-store
sales growth has remained stable at around 6 percent in the past
six months, while growth at specialty clothes stores fell to just
over 1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the industry ramped up capacity too quickly, in
the early 1990s, the result was a wave of bankruptcies that led to
a decline in overall store space in 1995 and 1996, before growth
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution, therefore, would seem to be for the
companies to rein in their expansion plans before they get into a
similar mess. But it may take longer to remove supply from the
market this time: most of the current growth is being driven by big
branded retailers, armed with balance sheets that are stronger
today than they were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will any company want to be the first to blink. Tellingly,
Gap remains committed to its growth plans despite a sharp drop in
its share price since its latest warning.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, retailers are hoping that consumers will shop them
out of trouble. And once again, they are likely to be
disappointed. &QL;

   But June's retail sales figures, which showed a healthy
annualized increase of 8.7 percent, suggest that American shoppers
are still hitting the malls in force.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, in truth, is not demand but supply. The fat
years of the recent past have tempted store groups into
over-ambitious expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Julian of Credit Suisse First Boston points out that
America now has ten times more square footage of retail space per
head than does Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are ``ignoring any notion of overcapacity,'' he says.
Clothing chains such as Gap are particularly guilty, because their
small stores are quick to build and tempt with the fattest returns.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Slater of Lazard Freres thinks that the supply of specialty
clothing space is already outstripping consumer demand, and that
the gap will grow. He calculates that growth in square footage at
American clothing chains will accelerate to 9-10 percent for this
year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Gap and American Eagle all plan to increase
floor space by two to three times that rate this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, many of these expansion plans might seem sensible
_ after all, even the seemingly omnipresent Gap has just 6 percent
of the country's clothing market. Combined, however, they are
threatening to saturate Main Street. And, as Slater points out, too
much supply will force discounting to clear excess stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a business such as retailing, with high fixed costs,
discounting spells death for profit margins. In addition, the
retailers face increasing competition, both foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   While Gap has for years successfully expanded abroad, foreign
chains such as Sweden's Hennes &AMP; Mauritz and Spain's Zara have now
established a foothold in New York and plan a nationwide expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, domestic discounters, such as Costco, Kmart and above
all Wal-Mart, are continuing to take market share. Their same-store
sales growth has remained stable at around 6 percent in the past
six months, while growth at specialty clothes stores fell to just
over 1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the industry ramped up capacity too quickly, in
the early 1990s, the result was a wave of bankruptcies that led to
a decline in overall store space in 1995 and 1996, before growth
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution, therefore, would seem to be for the
companies to rein in their expansion plans before they get into a
similar mess. But it may take longer to remove supply from the
market this time: most of the current growth is being driven by big
branded retailers, armed with balance sheets that are stronger
today than they were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will any company want to be the first to blink. Tellingly,
Gap remains committed to its growth plans despite a sharp drop in
its share price since its latest warning.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, retailers are hoping that consumers will shop them
out of trouble. And once again, they are likely to be
disappointed. &QL;

   BUENOS AIRES _ Not for nothing does Buenos Aires claim to have
more psychoanalysts per square kilometer than any other city in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   For Argentines are a mercurial people: notoriously immodest
about their country's virtues, they can as easily switch to
exaggerated excoriation of its faults.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the national mood is one of deep depression,
manifested in recent days in an outpouring of anguished
self-analysis over the suicide of a well-known surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Favaloro pioneered heart-bypass surgery when working in the
United States in the 1960s. Back in Buenos Aires, he set up a
medical research center and became one of Argentina's most
respected public figures.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29th, Dr. Favaloro shot himself, seemingly because of
his medical institute's financial problems. That struck a
particular chord with Argentina's middle classes, who seem to see
in the doctor's suicide an echo of their own frustration over the
country's depressed economy.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of despair goes wider: a million or more flocked this
week to the shrine of San Cayetano, patron saint of labor, praying
for his help to find work.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is suffering some of the textbook symptoms of
deflation. The economy went into recession almost two years ago,
battered by emerging-market blues and the problems of Brazil, its
main trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Brazil, whose economy is now growing strongly again,
Argentina cannot shake off recession by devaluing its currency: its
peso is fixed by law at parity with the dollar under its rigid
currency-board scheme.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando de la Rua's government has instead tried to
woo the financial markets by trimming the fiscal deficit it
inherited when taking office in December, through tax rises and
spending cuts, including a cut in civil servants' wages.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery has been sluggish. Growth is confined to
exports; consumer spending continues to fall, in part because of
the tax rises and wage cuts for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Though lower than its peak in the last recession in 1995,
unemployment is still rising. It stood at 15.4 percent in May, up
from 13.8 percent last October. Officials still claim doggedly that
the economy will grow by 3 percent this year, but most
private-sector economists think 1-2 percent more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revenues in July were disappointing, after the previous
month's bumper take had temporarily improved confidence. Investors
have started to worry that the government may not manage to meet
the fiscal targets for the rest of the year that it has negotiated
with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an economic team that makes such a big deal out of country
risk and investors' expectations, that would be a tremendous
setback,'' says Pedro Lacoste of Alfa, an economic think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of several economists who argue that de la Rua's team
should have taken even tougher action when it came to office in
December, cutting instead of raising taxes and forcing privatized
utility operators to slash their tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the public-sector wage cuts, that would have added
up to ``a once-off deflationary shock,'' of equivalent effect to a
devaluation, says Lacoste.
</P>
<P>
   Officials counter that the worst is over, and that patience will
be rewarded. Few Argentines are prepared to contemplate abandoning
their currency board: many retain traumatic memories of the
hyperinflation that preceded it. But deflation carries
psychological scars too.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Argentina's psychoanalysts should face no problems
finding work in the coming months. &QL;

REVISED ITINERARY TO REVERSE A STOCK SKID, TRAVELOCITY RE-MAPS ITS
PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ANDREA AHLES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Travelocity.com joined the tech stock market
craze a little too late.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fort Worth online travel site became publicly traded
March 8, it opened at $47 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of skyrocketing and creating multimillionaires,
Travelocity shares have dropped steadily in the past six months to
$12, even though the company added new features and launched a
travel site for America Online users.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity, one of the largest e-commerce sites on the Web
behind Amazon.com and eBay, outperformed analysts' expectations for
its first and second quarters. But the stock has remained depressed
along with the shares of other online retail sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their weak stock performance is more indicative of a sector
that has been under pressure for quite a while than anything
happening with the company,'' said Steve Weinstein, vice president
at the Pacific Crest Securities investment firm in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity continues to increase revenues and attract new
customers, compared with other online travel sites like
Expedia.com, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   And in an attempt to generate more interest in its stock by
institutional investors, Travelocity will convert 33 million shares
of preferred stock held by its parent company, Sabre, into Class A
common stock, chief executive Terry Jones said last week. That move
will triple the company's market capitalization to $780 million,
making it more attractive to banks, insurers and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had high hopes for Travelocity's market debut when it
announced in October that it would merge with publicly traded
Preview Travel. Shares of Preview Travel rose 160 percent from
about $17 a share in October to $47 a share in March when the
merger was completed.
</P>
<P>
   But when the public shares of Preview Travel converted to the
Travelocity ticker symbol on March 8, the stock began to skid.
</P>
<P>
   The deal created a travel Web site with 21 million customers and
more vacation and cruise packages than the old Travelocity site.
Sabre continues to own a 70 percent stake in Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity says it took some of the best features from the
Preview Travel site, such as all-inclusive vacation packages, and
added them to its site. The site added a ``ski map'' for those
looking for ski trips and a ``dream map'' showing customers various
destinations available for a specific dollar price.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the company launches a magazine offering travel tips
and features about exotic locales. The bimonthly magazine will
initially be sent to 250,000 Travelocity members and will be
available on newsstands for $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Preview Travel deal, Travelocity became a partner
with America Online, providing the online community with a travel
site. The AOL site was launched in April.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other portal deals that Travelocity has with Yahoo,
Lycos and Excite, the AOL partnership gives Travelocity up to $200
million over the next five years and a share of the advertising
revenue generated on the site, Jones said. AOL also gets a portion
of the earnings from each sale on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked hard on our brand, our customer service and new
features to get customers to use our site,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity has grown to almost 1,000 employees and is moving
from its headquarters at 4200 Buckingham Blvd. in the Centreport
development to a building nearby on 15100 Trinity Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently reported a second-quarter net loss of $13.5
million, compared with a net loss of $12.78 million in the same
quarter last year. Revenues rose to $46.79 million from $19.2
million. Wall Street had expected the company to lose 34 cents per
share, before one-time items; it lost 26 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Travelocity has built itself to be the premium
leisure travelers' site in the growing online travel market, and
they expect the company to become profitable in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of Travelocity is you can book a round-trip
ticket and the hotel and rental car in under 10 minutes,'' said
Henry Harteveldt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester predicts that the online travel market will grow to
$29 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Travelocity is facing more Internet
competition as two new entrants get ready to launch this fall.
Orbitz and Hotwire, both backed by airlines, are hoping to capture
a portion of the online market with cheaper airfares and search
functions that are intended to be easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   The online travel market is crowded with sites like Expedia.com,
backed by Microsoft, and the name-your-own-price Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity needs to expand its presence, particularly in the
business travel market, said Joshua Friedman, a senior research
analyst at IDC Corp. Only 30 percent of Travelocity's customers are
business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is definitely not in standard published air, car
and hotel fares, and Expedia has understood that better than
Travelocity,'' Friedman said, pointing to Expedia's recent purchase
of Travelscape, a wholesale travel site.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Travelocity will continue to add new features and
work toward profitability, with the hope that the stock price will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity stock ``is a long-term play,'' Jones said. ``Over
the long term, we believe the market will reward us.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Following the explosive growth of Internet
stockbroking in America in 1996-99, it was natural that American
online brokers would start expanding into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Natural, too, that their eyes should alight first on good old
Britain: English-speaking, Internet-hip and, since the
privatizations of the 1980s, home to a broad-based ``shareholder
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Britain is proving slower to embrace online investing than
are continental countries, supposedly so much more leery of the
American way of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is now behind a number of places _ notably Germany _ in
the number of online share-dealing accounts. Some of the American
brokers who plumped for Britain as their stepping-stone to Europe
must be wondering if they made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report by J.P. Morgan, an investment bank,
Britain has one-third of Europe's shareholders but only 7 percent
of the continent's online-broking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It cites a number of reasons for this, including the low savings
rate in Britain (4 percent of disposable income as opposed to 12-13
percent in most of Europe). And young Britons, who might be
expected to use the Internet if they started investing in shares,
tend to invest so much money in their homes that they have little
left for the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, by contrast, equity investment is taking off at the
same time as the Internet. Online broking has been further boosted
by the splurge of companies listing on Frankfurt's
technology-dominated Neuer Markt.
</P>
<P>
   But Huw van Steenis, the report's author, thinks the most
important reason for Britain's relatively slow switch to online
investing is ``the arcane and expensive clearing and settlement
system.'' The costs include the government's ``stamp duty'' tax of
0.5 percent levied on all share purchases.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the reliance on bits of paper. Some
three-quarters or more of all retail share-deals in Britain are
settled by the transfer of physical share-certificates rather than
electronically, through nominee accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certificated'' trading is a cumbersome, expensive service that
few online brokers offer. Many investors became accustomed and
attached to certificated trading during the privatization boom of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Blanket advertising campaigns urged the masses to ``tell Sid''
to buy shares in state-owned utilities. Sid ended up with a lot of
paper, and more when a number of building societies (thrifts)
shifted from mutual to shareholder ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the stock exchange has switched to
``dematerialized,'' book-entry share-ownership, which new buyers of
shares accept but Sid dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   The transition will take time. Too bad for Britain's online
brokers. Three of the top five are American: TD Waterhouse, DLJ
and, biggest of all, Charles Schwab, which now claims more than
half of British online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Did they make a mistake in locating their European bases in
Britain? Of course, none will admit as much. Indeed, they point out
that, having doubled in six months, the British market for online
transactions is expanding at a phenomenal rate.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Duste, chief executive of Charles Schwab Europe, does
concede that, with hindsight, his firm might have concentrated
harder on other markets in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He is also disappointed that it is proving harder than expected
to develop cross-border business within the European Union, despite
the EU's attempts to create a pan-European market in the securities
business.
</P>
<P>
   No American firm has a big share of any continental European
market. Nor, with the partial exceptions of ConSors, of Germany,
and Bipop, from Italy, have European brokers had much success
outside their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, outside Britain, it is striking how much local firms
dominate their national markets. So for Americans, in one respect
at least, it is still good old Britain. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Following the explosive growth of Internet
stockbroking in America in 1996-99, it was natural that American
online brokers would start expanding into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Natural, too, that their eyes should alight first on good old
Britain: English-speaking, Internet-hip and, since the
privatizations of the 1980s, home to a broad-based ``shareholder
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Britain is proving slower to embrace online investing than
are continental countries, supposedly so much more leery of the
American way of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is now behind a number of places _ notably Germany _ in
the number of online share-dealing accounts. Some of the American
brokers who plumped for Britain as their stepping-stone to Europe
must be wondering if they made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report by J.P. Morgan, an investment bank,
Britain has one-third of Europe's shareholders but only 7 percent
of the continent's online-broking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It cites a number of reasons for this, including the low savings
rate in Britain (4 percent of disposable income as opposed to 12-13
percent in most of Europe). And young Britons, who might be
expected to use the Internet if they started investing in shares,
tend to invest so much money in their homes that they have little
left for the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, by contrast, equity investment is taking off at the
same time as the Internet. Online broking has been further boosted
by the splurge of companies listing on Frankfurt's
technology-dominated Neuer Markt.
</P>
<P>
   But Huw van Steenis, the report's author, thinks the most
important reason for Britain's relatively slow switch to online

</P>
<P>
   More significant is the reliance on bits of paper. Some
three-quarters or more of all retail share-deals in Britain are
settled by the transfer of physical share-certificates rather than

<P>
   ``Certificated'' trading is a cumbersome, expensive service that

</P>
<P>

   (UNDATED) _ ``Dear Tony,'' begins the earnest memo from one
policy wonk to another. ``Knowing our shared interest in global
climate change, I have enclosed a report on the benefits of
greenhouse gas emissions trading...
</P>
<P>
   ``This new report by the nonprofit Pew Center on Global Climate
Change supports the view that a flexible, well-designed trading
system will significantly reduce the costs of climate change
mitigation...With best regards, Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The casual snoop might pass over this epistle as merely the
unremarkable ramblings of an academic or bureaucrat. Inspect more
closely, though, and two surprises emerge.
</P>
<P>
   First, this letter, penned recently by one Bill Clinton to one
Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, is about an issue both take
seriously: global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the letter reveals just how influential Eileen Claussen,
the head of the Pew Center, has now become. Why does she have the
ear of the world's most powerful man? The answer is that she knows
how to dance circles around the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three years ago, in the run-up to the signing of
the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the debate in America
on climate change was dominated by skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto pact was seen in many countries as a courageous if
imperfect attempt to come to grips with an impossibly complex and
uncertain threat. In the United States, however, it was regarded
with scorn by those who sought to portray it as the handiwork of
wild-eyed greens such as the vice president, Al Gore, who had
helped to broker the Kyoto deal.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the opposition was the Global Climate Coalition (GCC),
an umbrella group representing heavy industry. Through television
campaigns and intense lobbying, company executives sought not
merely to sink the Kyoto treaty, but to trash the very notion of
climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Such hostility was a sharp contrast with the more open attitudes
of big business in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Even when faced with new scientific evidence of the human role
in climate change, the GCC remained combative.
</P>
<P>
   The picture has changed dramatically in the past two years.
Giant firms such as United Technologies, Intel, American Electric
Power (AEP), DuPont and BP now openly accept that the evidence for
climate change is sufficient to take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, as a new report issued last week by the Pew Center
points out, are conducting audits of the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted by their plants and are taking on voluntary targets for
emissions cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms even think reducing emissions could be profitable.
Frank Loy, America's top negotiator on climate change, says that
big firms have ``shifted from being climate skeptics to climate
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives much of the credit for this volte face to Claussen.
Until the Pew Center began to challenge its line roughly two years
ago, the GCC had a virtual monopoly as the public face of corporate
America in the climate debate.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, a longtime bureaucrat who had often dealt with
corporations during international environmental talks, suspected
that attitudes in big business were not quite so uniform.
</P>
<P>
   After she resigned from government in mid-1997, she crafted a
set of principles that reflected a more progressive approach to
climate change, but which ``danced a fine line on Kyoto,'' as one
person on the receiving end of her pitch describes it.
</P>
<P>
   With some trepidation, she approached a handful of leading
American industrial firms that she thought might be open-minded.
She was right. A number of companies agreed to band together under
the Pew Center's umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy for the early joiners: some, such as AEP, a big
coal-fired utility, and BP, a giant oil firm, were berated by their
peers for breaking ranks. However, the Pew's media skills meant
that they soon found strength in numbers and a powerful voice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the GCC is a spent force, while the Pew's blue-chip
member companies have annual sales of more than $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is no suprise, then, that Claussen has detractors. One charge
is that the Pew Center is a front for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen insists this is nonsense. She points out that she has
been highly critical of the administration, both for its lack of
domestic action and for its ``dangerous'' efforts overseas to
dilute the Kyoto pact.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she notes, she served under Presidents George Bush and
Ronald Reagan with distinction, and counts leading Republicans as
fans. She even chides Gore for ``lacking courage'' to push ahead
with the issue of which he was an early champion.
</P>
<P>
   Another, more substantive, grouse is that Claussen is a
shameless publicity hound. The boss of a respected think-tank
points to the huge sums that the Pew Center spends on full-color
advertisements and glossy brochures, and mutters that he could have
used that money for serious research projects.
</P>
<P>
   On this count, Claussen is probably guilty as charged. But do
not expect any remorse, as her use of the media has been by far her
most powerful weapon.
</P>
<P>
   By spending pots of money on ads, brochures, independent reports
and high-profile conferences, the Pew Center has managed to earn
credibility as an honest broker. Where moderate firms once kept
silent, they now have a forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, only the bad guys were out there in the media,''
says Claussen. ``We raised the ante by being so public.'' That is
the sort of spin of which both Tony and Bill would surely be
proud. &QL;

fans. She even chides Gore for ``lacking courage'' to push ahead
with the issue of which he was an early champion.
</P>
<P>
   Another, more substantive, grouse is that Claussen is a
shameless publicity hound. The boss of a respected think-tank
points to the huge sums that the Pew Center spends on full-color
advertisements and glossy brochures, and mutters that he could have
used that money for serious research projects.
</P>
<P>
   On this count, Claussen is probably guilty as charged. But do
not expect any remorse, as her use of the media has been by far her
most powerful weapon.
</P>
<P>
   By spending pots of money on ads, brochures, independent reports
and high-profile conferences, the Pew Center has managed to earn
credibility as an honest broker. Where moderate firms once kept
silent, they now have a forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, only the bad guys were out there in the media,''
says Claussen. ``We raised the ante by being so public.'' That is
the sort of spin of which both Tony and Bill would surely be
proud. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The search for the next Microsoft is an
understandable obsession. But although this week's $6.4-billion
merger between two of Silicon Valley's highest-flying software
communications firms, Phone.com and Software.com, inevitably
prompted such talk, the reality is that Phone.com already looks
rather more like the next Netscape _ Microsoft's erstwhile victim.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal was predictably described by the participants
as the creation of a new ``global powerhouse,'' the combined annual
revenues of the two companies are only around $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   And though Software.com is a solid business, and is even making
a small profit, Phone.com has faced a sufficiently uncertain future
to be regarded by most analysts as a takeover candidate. It must
hope that throwing in its lot with a firm of similar size will
change that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news for shareholders was that the merging
firms have lured a top manager from the mighty Cisco Systems, Don
Listwin, to run the business.
</P>
<P>
   To walk away from the possibility of succeeding John Chambers,
Cisco's boss, in five years' time, not to mention a bundle of Cisco
options, is quite a declaration of faith.
</P>
<P>
   As a linchpin of the mobile Internet, Phone.com was one of the
past year's hottest stocks, rising by 1,200 percent from its IPO in
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree that the mobile phone will quickly
overtake the personal computer as the means by which most people
gain access to online services. And as the pioneer of much of the
software infrastructure that is making all this happen, Phone.com
seemed to be sitting pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's founder, Alain Rossmann, a veteran of Apple, had been
determined not to repeat the mistakes made by his former company.
</P>
<P>
   When Phone.com (then called Unwired Planet) came up with the
technology for a mobile browser, Rossmann, rather than go it alone,
approached the mobile-phone-making giants _ Nokia, Ericsson and
Motorola _ in 1997 to persuade them that it should become the
standard for wireless Internet communication.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, and the technology became known as WAP (wireless
application protocol). It was the breakthrough that Rossmann's
fledgling company needed, but it came at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Although Unwired Planet had a technological lead over
mobile-phone firms and software rivals, WAP was to be an open
standard rather than a proprietary one (like Microsoft's Windows).
</P>
<P>
   Today, around 80 percent of all WAP telephones have Phone.com
browsers, but Nokia is already using a version of its own and
Ericsson plans to offer a mobile edition of Microsoft's Internet
Explorer next year.
</P>
<P>
   Phone.com is probably resigned to seeing its share of the WAP
browser market decline. But, as it more or less gives its browsers
away, it could live with that as long as there is strong demand
from big telecoms firms for its server software for the mobile
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft, Oracle and others are greedily contemplating
that market. Phone.com will need to take full advantage of its
superior focus and nimbleness if it is to stay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Software.com is less glamorous than Phone.com, but has been just
as much a leader in its field.
</P>
<P>
   By selling Internet messaging infrastructure to telephone
companies and Internet service providers, it has quickly built up a
base of around 120 million users. Its software brings together
e-mail, voice mail, messaging and even video into one unified
Web-based service.
</P>
<P>
   Software.com faces stiff competition too, but has looked less
vulnerable than its new partner.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Internet mailbox companies offer similar products
aimed at consumers and small businesses, while Microsoft will
defend its dominant Exchange program from insurgents by
incorporating it into its .NET web-services strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Software.com's range of products can expand and
still remain competitive, the big communications companies it
serves are unlikely to desert it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the merger will create a ``powerhouse'' is debatable,
but it should bring some benefits. It will stop both firms from
competing expensively against one another, as they did within a few
weeks of each other earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Phone.com paid $850 million for a unified messaging start-up
called Onebox.com and Software.com bought (at) &LR; mobile.com, a
wireless-application service provider, for over $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   With customers and product lines that are complementary, there
should also be plenty of scope for cross-selling. And, by creating
a single platform across both the fixed-line and wireless Internet,
the new entity should be better placed to fend off rivals that have
only one part of the jigsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Much, though, will depend on Listwin. He will bring with him
from Cisco both a high level of credibility with large telephone
companies and an unrelenting focus on customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   If he can also pull together two talented but very different
developer teams, he may succeed in forging a company that is at
least capable of competing with Microsoft, if not rivalling it. &QL;

RETRANSMITTING TO CORRECT GARBLED TEXT 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sun., Aug. 13.) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Running Mates'' is standard-issue Hollywood glop that reveals
virtually no insight into the world it describes, which is doubly
disappointing, as it couldn't be more timely. In an acting stretch,
celebrated conservative Tom Selleck stars as Jim Pryce, a
presidential aspirant on the eve of the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, surrounded by questions _ who will he
select as his running mate? _ and a bevy of past and present
paramours. Well, he !ital!is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The sinister big-money forces (lacking only handlebar mustaches
to twiddle) will bankroll his entire campaign if Pryce selects
Texas Sen. Morris (Bruce McGill), a guy who oozes evil like a Lone
Star well oozes oil _ it's a wonder anyone ever ventured near this
guy, let alone elected him. Lauren Hartman (Laura Linney), his
loyal and whip-smart (yet not so smart that she didn't have an
affair with him) campaign manager, wants him to pick the upright
Sen. Randall (Bob Gunton, and damned if he doesn't look a little
like Joseph Lieberman), who's passionate about campaign finance
reform. A former mistress from his distant past, the boozy Meg
Gable (Faye Dunaway), wants him to go with her louse of a husband
(Robert Culp). Shawna Morgan (Teri Hatcher), a Hollywood ditz who
just happens to be another prior lover, aches to help her buddies
rub elbows with all that power, while his wife (Nancy Travis) is
vaguely resentful of the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   All this has the makings of a serviceably farcical satire,
maybe, but none of it plays as remotely credible. Campaign finance
is a crucial issue that affects whether people or corporations run
our country _ an overly simplistic statement to be sure, but it's
handled even more simplistically here. Pryce's late crisis of
confidence is a joke _ did the guy really just realize how corrupt
the system is? _ as is the moment when the women all get together
to compare notes. Backhanded political maneuvering that could
affect the outcome of the election is in the offing, so of course
they all discuss how good Pryce is/was in the sack. (Selleck
manages little chemistry with any of them.)
</P>
<P>
   The pin-headed depictions of Hollywood imbeciles come off as
particularly callow (not to mention stultifyingly unfunny), with
the portrayal of the Washington media not far behind. When one
reporter aboard Pryce's plane mentions the issues, another
reproaches him, burbling, ``A week in L.A., fat expense account _
maybe we'll get laid!'' His buddy eyes the leggy Linney and leers,
``I wouldn't mind eight years of that.'' You WILL mind two hours of
this gibberish. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
These politicians make dull bedfellows &QL; 
The show ``Running Mates.'' &QL; 
What: Dramedy about the pressures _ and women _ surrounding a
presidential candidate. &QL; 
Who: Tom Selleck, Laura Linney, Nancy Travis, Teri Hatcher, Faye
Dunaway. &QL; 
Where: TNT. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL;

<P>
   MUMBAI _ Subhash Ghai is all smiles these days _ and with good
reason. Mukta Arts, his movie production company, has just closed
the first-ever public offering of shares by a big firm from
Bollywood, the name for the Hindi movie industry located around
Mumbai (Bombay).
</P>
<P>
   As investors pore over the volatile cash flows of his firm, Ghai
is fired by the idea of building a Hollywood-style studio that
hires and trains Indian movie directors, writers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bollywood, he says, must get corporate. Producers such as Ghai
sense a big opportunity in India's movie industry, which currently
turns over a modest 60 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) a year _ if
only it can mend its unruly ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 films are made in India each year, more than in any
other country. Bollywood contributes roughly a quarter of that
number. The rest comes from a thriving but dispersed regional movie
industry, mostly in the south, in languages such as Tamil and
Telugu.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled by a few powerful movie producers _ often tycoons or
former actors _ the industry is largely self-financed, but at a
high cost. Private finance, some of it from underworld sources, is
secured at usurious rates of between 24 percent and 36 percent.
Small wonder that only a fifth of all movies make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The money-making opportunities are increasing, however, with the
boom in satellite television in India and the global market for
Indian movies. More than 60 satellite-television channels in India
have enlarged the appetite for local films and film music.
</P>
<P>
   Television production houses, such as Sony Entertainment and

   MUMBAI _ Subhash Ghai is all smiles these days _ and with good
reason. Mukta Arts, his movie production company, has just closed
the first-ever public offering of shares by a big firm from
Bollywood, the name for the Hindi movie industry located around
Mumbai (Bombay).
</P>
<P>
   As investors pore over the volatile cash flows of his firm, Ghai
is fired by the idea of building a Hollywood-style studio that
hires and trains Indian movie directors, writers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bollywood, he says, must get corporate. Producers such as Ghai
sense a big opportunity in India's movie industry, which currently
turns over a modest 60 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) a year _ if
only it can mend its unruly ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 films are made in India each year, more than in any
other country. Bollywood contributes roughly a quarter of that
number. The rest comes from a thriving but dispersed regional movie
industry, mostly in the south, in languages such as Tamil and
Telugu.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled by a few powerful movie producers _ often tycoons or
former actors _ the industry is largely self-financed, but at a
high cost. Private finance, some of it from underworld sources, is
secured at usurious rates of between 24 percent and 36 percent.
Small wonder that only a fifth of all movies make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The money-making opportunities are increasing, however, with the
boom in satellite television in India and the global market for
Indian movies. More than 60 satellite-television channels in India
have enlarged the appetite for local films and film music.
</P>
<P>

Star TV, pay huge sums to buy the rights of Bollywood favorites.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Grapevines, being clones (they are propagated as
cuttings), are extremely susceptible to disease. Once a bacterium
has worked out how to get past a clone's defenses, it can run riot.
</P>
<P>
   The subtle differences of response to infection that are found
in genetically diverse host organisms, and which serve to slow
pathogens down, are absent in cloned crops.
</P>
<P>
   That is why California's viticulturists are so worried about
Pierce's disease. It has ravaged the state's vineyards twice in the
past _ once in the 1880s, and once in the 1930s and 1940s. Now, to
the horror of wine lovers everywhere, it is threatening to do so
again.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's disease is caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium
that infects the tissue which carries water from a plant's roots to
its leaves, and whose genome was unravelled by researchers in
Brazil earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the insect mainly responsible for spreading
Xylella in California was a leafhopper called the blue-green
sharpshooter. This bug usually feeds at the edges of vineyards, and
then only on tender new shoots. That makes it easy for farmers to
prune away the infected portions of a vine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, however, a new Xylella vector _ the glassy-winged
sharpshooter _ appeared in California. This bug confines itself
neither to the edges of vineyards, nor to the tenderest shoots. It
will feed, vinewise, on anything, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It thus spreads Xylella very fast. And it has already been
recorded in 11 of California's grape-growing counties. The state's
officials are understandably paranoid about this.
</P>
<P>
   So, like the lady who swallowed a spider to catch the fly, they
have been casting around for something that likes to eat
glassy-winged sharpshooters, preferably in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   They have come up with a small Mexican wasp called Gonatocerus
triguttatus. The females of this wasp hunt out sharpshooter egg
masses and lay their own eggs there. When the wasp larvae hatch,
they eat the sharpshooter's eggs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Larry Bezark, the entomologist at California's
Department of Food and Agriculture who is in charge of the program,
experimental releases of Gonatocerus will begin this month. If all
goes well, a mass release of the critters will take place next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those who enjoy a glass of chardonnay, merlot or cabernet
sauvignon should keep their fingers crossed. &QL;

   With the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their convention
next week, America's voters will have before them four men bidding
to lead their country. Should they choose the pragmatic politician,
the co-chief executive of their country, who has supervised eight
years of staggering prosperity? Or what about the dreamy idealist,
the policy wonk absorbed by technology and the environment? Or
perhaps the sour, partisan reactionary _ a brutal attack dog who
specializes in ripping apart the ``risky'' dreams of others? Or
then again, there is the panicky panderer, who changes his mind
about a small Cuban boy's future just to win a few votes in Miami.
It shouldn't be too difficult, but for one thing: all four of these
men are Al Gore. &QL;

   After barely a fortnight of frail life, the peace process in
Jammu and Kashmir is officially dead. The conflict seems to be back
to the same hopeless state in which it has languished for 53 years
_ except that nowadays, on a whim of either India or Pakistan, it
could turn nuclear. Even if the past hopeful fortnight's events
turn out to be no more than a feint in the direction of peace,
though, they have revealed the contours of how a peace process
might evolve. &QL;

   Millions of Americans will this week have found themselves in
the unusual position of agreeing with Fidel Castro. Both George W.
Bush and Al Gore are ``boring,'' said the Cuban leader. Sheer
hypocrisy, Bush and Gore might reply. After all, for four decades,
Castro has notoriously bored his long-suffering people with
speeches lasting hour after hour. In the view of the old guerrilla,
it has always seemed, fatigues are not just to be worn but also to
be inflicted. No longer, though: the Cuban president has at last
realized that, when it comes to words, less can be more. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Before the current stage of the presidential
campaign began, conventional wisdom (excuse the term) held that
George W. Bush's choice of running mate would define his candidacy
but the Republican shindig in Philadelphia would not. Conversely,
it was thought that Al Gore's running mate would hardly matter
(because the options were all so dismal) but his speech to the
Democratic National Convention would be decisive. So far, every
part of this wisdom has turned out to be wrong. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ ``There's a lot at stake in this election and real
differences between the two parties.'' When Joe Lieberman said that
just after Al Gore had formally picked him as the Democratic
running mate, it sounded like the sort of bland remark that
politicians perpetrate when they have nothing much to say.
Actually, it was both surprising and true. It was surprising
because for most Americans, this is one of the least gripping
elections on record. The discrepancy between what people seem to
think about this race and what is actually at stake is becoming
more striking during the current convention season _ ``the most
critical period of the campaign,'' claims Tom Mann of the Brookings
Institution. &QL;

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Watkins Park, with its meandering stream and its
thicket of greenery, is as bucolic as downtown Indianapolis gets.
But look a wee bit more closely _ or inhale a wee bit more deeply _
and reality intrudes. ``My God, look at that crap!'' shouts Tom
Neltner. As as activist environmentalist, he knows whereof he
speaks, and there it is: raw sewage, as well as condoms, clearly
visible in the stream. This rustic scene comes courtesy of
Indianapolis's ``combined sewer overflow'' (CSO) system, which was
designed nearly a century ago to carry both sewage and storm water
through one set of pipes. &LR;  &QL;

   BUENOS AIRES _ Not for nothing does Buenos Aires claim to have
more psychoanalysts per square mile than any other city in the
world. Good thing, too, for at the moment the national mood in
Argentina is one of deep depression, manifested in recent days by
an outpouring of anguished self-analysis over the suicide of a
well-known surgeon. And the sense of despair goes wider still: a
million or more Argentines flocked this week to the shrine of San
Cayetano, patron saint of labor, praying for his help to find work.
At least Argentina's psychoanalysts should face no problems finding
work in the coming months. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Following the explosive growth of Internet
stockbroking in American in 1996-99, it was natural that American
online brokers would start expanding into Europe. Natural, too,
that their eyes should alight first on good old Britain:
English-speaking, Internet-hip and, since the privatizations of the
1980s, home to a broad-based ``shareholder culture.'' Yet Britain
is proving slower to embrace online investing than are continental
countries, supposedly so much more leery of the American way of
capitalism. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ ``Dear Tony,'' begins the earnest memo from one
policy wonk to another. ``Knowing ouir shared interest in global
climate change, I have enclosed a report on the benefits of
greenhouse gas emissions trading... With best regards, Bill.'' The
casual snoop might pass over this epistle as merely the
unremarkable ramblings of an academic or bureaucrat. Inspect more
closely, though, and two surprises emerge. First, this letter,
penned recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, is about an issue both take seriously: global
warming. Second, the letter reveals just how influential Eileen
Claussen, the head of the nonprofit Pew Center on Global Climate
Change, has now become. Why does Claussen _ the scourge of
global-warming skeptics _ have the ear of the world's most powerful
man? The answer is that she knows how to dance circles around the

   NEW YORK _ America is in the ninth year of its longest-ever
peacetime expansion, but somebody has forgotten to tell its
retailers. While department stores such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney
and Federated have been fighting decline for years, and the woes of
``category killers' such as Toys ``R'' Us are well-known, the
country's hugely successful specialty retailers _ such as Gap,
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Office Depot _
are only now hitting trouble. There are many reasons, but above
all, the fat years of the recent past have tempted store groups
into over-ambitious expansion plans. &QL;

reason. Mukta Arts, his movie production company, has just closed
the first-ever public offering of shares by a big firm from
Bollywood, the name for the Hindi movie industry located around
Mumbai (Bombay). As investors pore over the volatile cash flows of
his firm, Ghai is jazzed by the idea of building a Hollywood-style
studio that hires and trains Indian movie directors, writers and
technicians. Some optimists even see India as a low-cost producer
for the global movie industry. Film City, a newly expanded
2,000-acre complex on the outskirts of Hyderabad, offers 40 studio
floors and sophisticated post-production facilities; it has already
attracted a handful of movie-makers from Hollywood. &QL;

  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients on or after Aug. 13,

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a television camera zoomed in for a close-up, Jazmn Guy and
Lisa Tucker, the two adorable little girls sharing the role of the
young lioness Nala in the upcoming L.A. production of ``Walt
Disney's The Lion King,'' belted out a pitch-perfect few bars of
``I Just Can't Wait to be King.'' The rehearsal hall at the El
Capitan Entertainment Centre in Hollywood fell largely silent and
producer Thomas Schumacher, his hands on the shoulders of director
Julie Taymor, gave a little squeeze of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Free advertising _ the kind this mega-musical probably doesn't
need. With apologies to Elton John, anyone care to join me in a
chorus of ``Can you Feel the Product Being Teased''?
</P>
<P>
   On the same day a block of 50,000 new tickets (top price $127
for a VIP package) went on sale for the 8-month run at the Pantages
Theatre, the media had a seat at day one of ``The Lion King''
rehearsals. Print reporters and TV cameras alike got a peek at
Taymor and Michael Curry's puppets, costumes designs and masks and
met the newly announced L.A. cast. Music director Colin Welford led
Fuschia Walker and the ensemble in a rendition of the show's
opening number, ``Circle of Life.'' And choreographer Garth Fagan
explained how wonderful it was to have Disney money to spend on
exotic dance effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this is to generate even more excitement,'' Taymor,
the production's Tony winning director/costume designer, said of
the rehearsal sneak peak. ``It's a whole new cast and it's exciting
to say we're live people doing our live work now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added John Vickery, who returns to play the villainous Scar, a
role he created in the original Broadway production: ``I don't
remember (the cast preview event) being quite that big. They tell
me L.A. is chomping at the bit. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Chomping at the bit? Yathink?
</P>
<P>
   Carrying the kind of critical and word-of-mouth buzz that even
Michael Eisner couldn't buy, ``The Lion King'' figures to be the
must-see theatrical event of fall season. In addition to being in
its third sold-out year at Broadway's New Amsterdam Theatre, this
kingpin of Disney's theatrical division is also playing in Osaka,
Tokyo, London and Toronto. The Pantages engagement, which starts
previews Sept. 29, will be the first American production after New
York.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, said Schumacher, it's finally happening in
L.A., the spot where the animated Disney movie of the same name was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, being an L.A. native and having my whole career here,
bringing the show back is really sort of a homecoming for me,''
said Schumacher, the president of Disney's feature animation
division and the co-chair of the Buena Vista Theatrical Group.
``Even Hollywood Boulevard. I sold ladies shoes down the street,
and right outside the window, I could see the Pantages Theatre.
Today we get to do a show there.''
</P>
<P>
   And quite a show it promises to be. In bringing to the stage the
tale of Simba the lion cub who would be king, Taymor had to figure
out a way to bring the entire animal kingdom (no human characters,
remember) to life without the use of ``puffy animal suits.'' Her
solution was a blend of costumes and puppetry that left visible the
human being pulling the strings or wearing the mask. By now, you've
seen the pictures. Some actors are operating puppets or machinery.
Others use mechanized masks.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Taymor said, the illusion is left to the
audience's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics are the art, and they are enjoyable to our
audiences,'' said Taymor after an actor demonstrated the flight of
three gazelles. ``You don't need to patronize our audience. They'll
use their imagination. They know (these) aren't real gazelles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the actors who are in `The Lion King' have never held
a puppet before,'' she added. ``So what we've done is cast
tremendous actors with the right attitudes, actors who are into
learning this technique.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Vickery three years ago, when he joined the cast of the
first production of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had worked with a mask before, but it had been years, and
certainly not an electronic one,'' he said. ``So everything was
sort of magic, and when you got in the middle of it, couldn't
really see the forest for the trees. I was just trying to get from
stage right to stage left without being killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Rufus Bonds (playing Mufasa), Fuschia Walker
(Rafiki), Clifton Oliver (adult Simba), Moe Daniels (adult Nala),
William Akey (Zazu), Bob Bouchard (Pumbaa) and Danny Rutigliano
(Timon).

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Martha ``Marty'' Steffens and Robert McCray have
been named the editor and general manager of the San Francisco
Examiner under its new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives, whose appointments were announced Thursday,
will be key leaders in the remaking of the Examiner under Ted Fang,
the publisher of a three-times-a-week newspaper in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp., which recently bought the San Francisco
Chronicle for $660 million, is transferring the Examiner to Fang
and his family _ along with a $66 million subsidy for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle and Examiner have operated under a joint operating
agreement since 1965, combining business operations and splitting
profits while maintaining separate editorial staffs. The agreement
was to run through 2005 but was terminated by the sale, which
formally occurred last month after a bitter court fight over
whether the deal violated anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens and McCray hint at ambitious plans for reshaping the
newspaper in a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at places like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles,
these are major metropolitan cities that support multiple daily
newspapers,'' said McCray, 42, who will take over the Examiner's
business operations in November. ``I think San Francisco is the
kind of city that can support more than one newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   McCray is currently general manager of the Blade in Toledo,
Ohio. He has also worked at the Los Angeles Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens, 47, the former editor of the Binghamton (N.Y.) Press &AMP;
Sun-Bulletin, will take charge of the Examiner's editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   Both acknowledge they face a huge challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very, very busy,'' Steffens said.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner was acquired by Fang and his politically prominent
family as part of Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. To avoid
anti-trust problems with the U.S. Justice Department, Hearst
transferred the smaller Examiner to the Fangs. Hearst is running
the newspaper during a four-month transition period.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs have said they intend to convert the Examiner from an
afternoon newspaper to morning publication focusing on San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the newspaper will start its new life with a big
influx of cash from its former owner, journalism experts say it has
some major hurdles to overcome to survive in the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a very tough road ahead of it,'' said Ben Bagdikian,
former dean of the journalism school at the University of
California at Berkeley and the author of ``Media Monopoly.'' ``It's
going to be up against a very big newspaper, owned by a very rich
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bagdikian said it is encouraging to see the Fangs hiring
people who are nationally established in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are serious about putting out a paper, this is the
first step,'' he said. ``You bring in a general manager who has
some experience and an editor who has some experience, and you
begin remaking the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Both managers said they would conduct national searches to build
a quality staff.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Examiner employees can join the
Chronicle, which has the same union contract _ an opportunity most
are expected to take. The Fang family, which currently runs the
free community paper, the Independent, is not expected to have a
unionized staff.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless Steffens invited current Examiner staff members to
apply for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think money will be a problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While she would not be specific for ``proprietary reasons,''
Steffens said her goal will be to find ways for the newspaper to
reach new audiences in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens, who has worked at the Orange County Register and the
Los Angeles Times, has long been a supporter of civic journalism,
which advocates that newspapers work to improve the cities they
serve.
</P>
<P>
   At the Binghamton paper, Steffens created a local forum and
related newspaper series focusing on what could be done to prevent
the community from being hurt by economic downsizing, said Jan
Schaffer, executive director of the Pew Center for Civic
Journalism. Steffens serves on the center's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is doing journalism that is being used for text books,''
Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   McCray became general manager of the Toledo Blade just eight
months ago, after working at its sister paper, the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. McCray was praised by those who had worked with him
in the past, as being one of the rarest types of business managers:
one who understands newspapering.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Leader, a current Los Angeles Times editor and former
Examiner staffer, praised McCray's work at the Blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed that he very much recognized the importance of
journalism,'' Leader said. ``This is a high-energy guy.''

 &HT;    Lone clone doesn't mind leaving life to Chance
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SWISS ALP, Texas _ Ralph Fisher's house comes with a deja view.
</P>
<P>
   Peek out the calico kitchen curtains and you'll see a baby
Brahman bull napping on the front lawn under a hackberry tree.
Nothing odd about that, unless you know that this bull wallowed out
that sweet spot in another lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   So when Fisher looks out the farmhouse window, he sees not only
the reality of the new bull calf but also a remembered landscape
with his favorite bull (now dead) dozing in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   The young bull is a clone of the old bull, a TV and movie star
named Chance who lived to be 22.
</P>
<P>
   And today it's time to sing ``Happy Birthday'' to Second Chance,
who is either 1 year old or 23 years old, depending on whether you
think clones are new animals or the same old familiars rewrapped in
fresh hide.
</P>
<P>
   A clone needs a clown to throw a party, so that's exactly what
will happen tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, a sometimes rodeo clown, invited 300 guests to his
52-acre ranch in Swiss Alp, a hamlet between La Grange and
Schulenburg about 65 miles southeast of Austin. Fisher invited so
many people because he wanted to include ``everyone who knew him in
his former life.'' And, the Texas A&AMP;M scientists who cloned Second
Chance are scheduled to come and announce new findings about the
bull's longevity and health.
</P>
<P>
   It will be good news, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most press since they shut down the Chicken
Ranch,'' said Fisher, referring to the legendary La Grange
whorehouse that inspired a Broadway musical. ``I invited the
governor. I doubt he's going to show, but we might get a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's private party includes armadillo races, hayrides,
horseshoes, pony rides and free photos with Second Chance, whom
Fisher is grooming to join his herd of Longhorns and other animals
that attend parties and conventions for photo opportunities.
(Fisher is the man who brings his Longhorns to the corner of
highways 620 and 2222 near Lake Travis on weekends for tourist
photos.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves recognition,'' he said. ``Most people don't even
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Chance is believed to be the lone clone living with
private owners. He was created by Texas A&AMP;M University experts who
scraped skin cells from Chance before he died in 1998. Second
Chance was born Aug. 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher asked A&AMP;M scientists to clone Chance because he had been
the beloved family pet for 17 years, and he thought Chance could
help further genetic research. The university paid for the cloning
with a research donation, and Fisher got to take Second Chance home
after he was weaned from his surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day Second Chance really spooked Fisher and his
wife, Sandra Reddell.
</P>
<P>
   With 52 acres of farmland beckoning in all directions, Second
Chance did exactly what Chance used to do. He walked over to a
special spot in Fisher's front yard, just 15 feet from the kitchen
window, and laid down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, uh-oh.'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wondered if it was all accidental or coincidental,''
he said. ``In my heart, (I think) if his physical appearance
regenerates material, why can't his memory functions be the same or
develop into the same?''
</P>
<P>
   Second Chance also likes to be scratched in the same spots as
Chance and has the same peculiar eating manners of Chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes the same things he liked the first time,'' Fisher
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the other farm animals put their mouths in the feed buckets
and don't come up for air until the food's gone. But Second Chance
eats with bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts his head down and fills his mouth up like a child with
no manners and lifts his head and just chews and chews,'' Fisher
said. ``I've raised at least 20-30 Longhorns and Brahmans and I've
never seen another one eat like that,'' except for Chance.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is ecstatic to have his favorite animal back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank God he gave him back to us,'' said Fisher, who
doesn't support the cloning of humans. ``We're Christians, and we
stand proud of the fact that technology is such that we can get him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've stopped telling Aggie jokes,'' said Fisher, who holds two
degrees from Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas,
including a master's in special education. ``If I had another life
myself, I'd be a doggone Aggie.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Fisher's friends wants Second Chance to attend the Texas
delegation's presidential ball in Washington D.C. in 2001_ whether
George W. wins or not.
</P>
<P>
   Since this presidential race is giving the Bush family a second
chance at the White House, Fisher figures Second Chance would be
the perfect party animal.

ATTACK OF THE NAUGHTY WEB SITES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When I type in the first letter of a Web
address, another address appears below the address line. It has the
same beginning letter and is an objectionable site. How can I rid
my computer of the site?
</P>
<P>
   _ Embarrassed
</P>
<P>
   DEAR EMBARRASSED: Someone's been very naughty behind your back,
because I know with utmost certainty that none of my readers would
EVER think about going to smut sites. Or at least getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   You are a victim of Internet Explorer's AutoComplete, a dubious
``enhancement'' that attempts to guess what you're typing. It's
handy for filling in Web-based forms, but pretty annoying when it
starts guessing ``www.yasminebleethnude.com'' when you're trying to
get to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Go to Internet Options in the Tools menu, then pick the Content
tab and look for the AutoComplete button. You'll be able to turn
AutoComplete off and dump what it's got stored.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot easier if you go to www.swanksoft.com and download
HistoryKill 2000. It can clean out just about anything that
Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator stash.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How can I change a Word art extension from .Doc
to .Jpg or .Bmp? I can move the file into my photo program, but I
can't edit it because it still has the .Doc extension.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wassssssuuuupppp Doc
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DOC: Just changing the file extension isn't going to turn
the file into a graphic. Here's what I do every month when I get
the latest Yasmine Bleeth Newsletter, which arrives as a Word
document.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of my wife _ well, she's not really my wife yet _
are components of the document that can be separated. I generally
right-click on the picture, then select Copy from the pop-up menu.
Then I paste the picture into Paint Shop Pro. I can either save it
in just about any format or print it out.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How do I download the OPL3-SAx driver to fix my
laptop?
</P>
<P>
   _ Asleep at the Wheel
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ASLEEP: You, ummmm, download it. You'll probably find it on
the laptop manufacturer's Web site, along with installation
instructions. In general, click on the download link and save it to
a folder on your computer where you can find it later. Then read
the instructions. Even Yasmine knows enough to do that.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: About your recent column covering blank boxes
on the task bar. Well, a little dose of RegClean (download from the
Microsoft site) can handle that. Boxes are left over from very low
resources. I hope you don't get paid to do this column.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Answer Man
</P>
<P>
   DEAR THE: Actually, I get paid to KEEP doing it after reading
letters from all the pinheads out there who think they know it all.
Listen, Sparky, we already know the problem is caused by low
resources. We want to know what's draining the resources, and why
it seems to happen after doing a Windows update. RegClean is a good
tool for examining the Registry, but it only fixes known problems.
I run it every week, and I still have the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, didn't mean to get that worked up. I need to review my
collection of Yasmine photos and relax.
</P>
<P>
   (Anybody with the real answer or Yasmine Bleeth's home number
can write Dr. Emilio Bombay at drbombay(at)star-telegram.com
(snail-mail: Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX
76101). Fax: (817) 390-7257. In real life, Dr. Bombay is Michael
Gerst, editorial systems manager for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

   Forget about the Republicans and their Philadelphia love-in.
Never mind the Democrats and their upcoming Al &AMP; Joe Show in Los

</P>
<P>
   Who woulda figured?
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot founded the Reform Party in 1995 solely for the
purpose of rubber-stamping his run for president in 1996. When some
would-be usurper misread Perot's intentions and decided to campaign
for the party's '96 presidential nomination, Perot squashed him
like a bug.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, a far more determined and resourceful
interloper set his sights not merely on grabbing the Reform Party
nomination but on seizing control of the party _ lock, stock and
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that ex-Republican Pat Buchanan has achieved more
or less what he set out to achieve by snatching the Reform Party
right out from under the devoted Perotistas who thought they
controlled it.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``more or less'' because it's not entirely clear whether
Buchanan intended to irreparably alienate the many Perot
aficionados who saw _ still see _ themselves as the lifeblood of
the party. Maybe Buchanan truly believed that the Perotistas would
readily see the wisdom of handing him the keys to the Reform
machinery _ or maybe he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, it doesn't much matter. Buchanan seems rather
pleased to be the focal point of so much anger and resentment; he
seems energized by the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   It figures. Buchanan is a former newspaper columnist and TV
commentator, which means that he has spent much of his adult life
fending off the indignation of those who have no use for anything
he says or does.
</P>
<P>
   After years of co-hosting ``Crossfire,'' the shout-and-snarl
discussion program on CNN, Buchanan could hardly be expected to
come unglued over the sniping of a mild-mannered Reform Party
mainstay such as Russ Verney.
</P>
<P>
   Verney, in fact, couldn't even get under the skin of Pat's
sister as the two discussed their differences in several joint TV
appearances. Bay Buchanan, who serves as her brother's campaign
manager and chief spokesperson, laughed her way through a
``Crossfire'' confrontation with Verney even as the Verney and
Buchanan forces faced off like rival gangs gearing up for a
ferocious battle over some disputed piece of turf.
</P>
<P>
   There is much more at stake, of course, than just the top spot
on the Reform Party ticket _ which by itself would appear to be
worth considerably less than Ralph Nader's Green Party nomination,
at least as far as the presidential preference polls are concerned.
The prize that really has the Buchanan brigades and the Perotistas
clawing at one another's throats is the $12.6 million in federal
campaign cash awaiting the survivor of the Reform Party blood feud.
</P>
<P>
   Verney says that Buchanan is not entitled to the money because
he stuffed the ballot box in the party's mail-in primary election.
Bay Buchanan says her brother locked up the nomination fair and
square _ and she seems confident that the money will be safely
delivered into Buchanan campaign coffers faster than you can say,
``Ross who?''
</P>
<P>
   At last report, the Perotistas had abandoned the
Buchanan-sanctioned convention site and set up their own convention
for the purpose of nominating a nuclear physicist named John
Hagelin, who is also the nominee of some outfit called the Natural
Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   Could this deal get any weirder? Surely not, but at least it's
interesting, which is more than we say for some of the major
parties' recent conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. It could get weirder. Isn't there still a chance that the
Great One, Ross Perot _ aka the Scheming Weasel _ could come
swooping into Long Beach at the last possible moment and demand the
Reform Party nomination for himself?
</P>
<P>
   It's far-fetched, I know. But then, just about everything Perot
does is far-fetched.

 &HT;    Volkswagen's 2000 Jetta GLS 1.8T has plenty of va-voom
 &HT;    By Pete Szilagyi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - These are horsepower-crazy times. My family
drives a perfectly stock minivan with nearly the power of some '60s
muscle cars, and any contemporary luxury sedan needs at least 225
horsepower to even be considered by shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's M5, a sedan comfortable enough to take grandparents to
Sunday brunch, has nearly enough power to launch the space shuttle.
Even your neighbor's new pickup, which may never do a lick of work,
probably generates close to 300 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer a modest, four-cylinder, 1.8-liter engine available in
several Volkswagen and Audi models. It's tiny but as thrilling as
many of the huge engines. The VW-Audi 1.8T _ the 3T2 is for
turbocharged _ transforms the New Beetle, Jetta and Golf into
absolute delights, with a rush of acceleration that no competitor
less than $20,000 can match.
</P>
<P>
   It's an efficient, durable and punchy engine, developed for a
European market snobby about performance and driving aesthetics. VW
models have other excellent four- and six-cylinder engine options,
including a lively turbo-diesel, but the 150-horsepower 1.8 turbo
provides the most performance for the price.
</P>
<P>
   This week's test model, a firehouse-red 2000 Jetta GLS 1.8T,
costs $21,500, which could have been pared to a more reasonable
$19,500 with the elimination of the optional Monsoon sound system
and leather seats. The base Jetta, the 115-horse GL, is $17,000 to
$19,000. Top market GLX, with the 174-horsepower VR6 V-6, can reach
to the mid-$20,000s.
</P>
<P>
   Most disappointing is the Jetta's cramped rear seat and higher
prices than same-size competitors, although all Jettas include as
standard 15-inch wheels, height-adjustable front seats, anti-lock
brakes, floor mats, air conditioning, upgraded audio and side
airbags.
</P>
<P>
   VW's Golf, also the recipient of the 1.8T for 2000, is
essentially a hatchback Jetta but sportier looking and more useful
for hauling large objects. Golf models are about $1,300 less than
comparable Jettas.
</P>
<P>
   The first impression you'll have of the Jetta (and Golf) is of
sophistication and quality for the price range. The interior, quiet
and tasteful, is finished in attractive materials and patterns,
with a border of chrome here and there. Exterior panels are
assembled carefully to close tolerances, and the paint is deep and
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Ample space is provided for front-seat occupants, unless they
are more than 6 feet tall, but rear legroom and headroom are
lacking. At 6-foot-2, I couldn't sit in the rear without banging my
head on the headliner. My knees were in my face. The trunk is
roomier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Instrumentation is minimalist, functional and generally easy to
use, although symbols on the climate-control system are tiny and
inscrutable. The cruise-control switch is awkwardly located atop
the turn-signal stalk. Sufficient interior storage space for maps,
sunglasses and the like is provided.
</P>
<P>
   Under way, the Jetta's chassis dynamics and harmony between the
steering, suspension and brakes are impressive. Although not as
stiffly suspended as a sports sedan, the Jetta can be driven
adventurously without undue tire screeching and body swaying.
Steering is precise for a vehicle the Jetta's price, and the car
stops quickly. The body is rigid and solid, rattle- and
squeak-free.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic transmission, an $875 option in the
1.8T, takes the edge off the turbo's whoosh slightly but makes the
Jetta easier to drive. Unlike some Swedish turbos, VW's 1.8T still
has some turbo lag and hesitation at lower engine speeds. With the
manual five-speed transmission, the driver can get caught in a gear
too high, then have to quickly downshift to regain steam.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic is more intuitive about maintaining proper engine
speed than a daydreaming driver with a five-speed. Of course,
driving enthusiasts will buy nothing but the five-speed, and I'm
with them.

 &HT;    Leaner, meaner flagship sedan can run with best
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General Motors may be axing its performance-oriented
Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird in the next couple of years,
but that doesn't mean there's nothing left to offer buyers looking
for something with power. Just check out the second-generation
Oldsmobile Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   For 2001, the Aurora is leaner and meaner, with a 250-horsepower
V-8 out in front of the creature comforts expected in an Olds. GM
calls the Aurora an ``entry-level luxury'' sedan, but it could just
as easily be a ``sports sedan.'' It doesn't take long behind the
wheel to realize the Aurora is a car that can go.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 Auroras have been sold since the model debuted
in 1995; other numbers that really please Olds division execs are
from the racetrack. The Aurora V-8 has won four straight
Indianapolis 500 races, with nine of this year's top 10 finishers,
including winner Juan Montoya, using racing versions of the motor.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what consumers really make of this, but the
win-on-Sunday, sell-on-Monday dictum so often heard in years past
in Southern stock-car racing circles clearly resonates today in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than power to the Aurora. Opt for the 215-hp
V-6 version and, for a base price of $30,000, a generous helping of
amenities. Move up to the $34,305 Aurora with the V-8, and the
standard fittings will include power leather seats, real wood trim,
power equipment and safety features that include front and side air
bags, traction control and anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Give the design/engineering people some credit for legible
instrumentation and controls where you want them. This year's
Aurora is 6 inches shorter (overall length is about 200 inches)
than last year's model and a couple hundred pounds lighter (3,800
pounds). That's enough heft to give it a stable feel even without
the Aurora's self-leveling independent suspension and traction
control.
</P>
<P>
   Five adults can ride in the Aurora with adequate head and leg
room _ this is a car 56.7 inches tall with almost 38 inches of rear
headroom _ and they'll find little reason to carp. The driver
benefits from stereo/AC controls on the steering wheel, which is a
responsive 2.6 turns lock-to-lock, and the Aurora has enough drink
holders and storage spaces to prevent nitpicking in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   It does have some body lean, and the Aurora cabin isn't as
hushed at speed as some of its competitors, which include the
5-Series BMWs, Lincoln LS, Lexus ES300 and comparably priced
Acuras. But the fact that Olds has a sedan that can be seriously
measured against the German and Japanese cars says a lot for
Oldsmobile and what has been done with its flagship sedan.

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Just after being confirmed as President
Clinton's new Commerce secretary, Norman Mineta called the chief
executive of a major Silicon Valley technology company and
introduced himself as ``Secretary Mineta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're secretary to whom?'' a somewhat bewildered assistant to
the executive asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, technically, I'm secretary to President Clinton,''
Mineta replied.
</P>
<P>
   The former San Jose mayor and longtime U.S. representative is
still getting used to the title _ and his new place in history as
the first Asian-American appointed to the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta returned Thursday to San Jose, where he grew up, in his
first official trip to the region since he was named June 26 to
replace William M. Daley, who resigned to become chairman of Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign. The Senate confirmed
Mineta on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has only six months until a new president is in
office, Mineta expects to play a key role in helping the Clinton
White House win Senate approval of normalized trade relations with
China. He also plans to be an advocate for the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, a delegate at next week's Democratic National
Convention, was skeptical of efforts at the Republican convention
last week to present itself as the party of diversity. But he
conceded the furor over the 1996 fund-raising scandals, including
Vice President Al Gore's appearance at a Buddhist Temple, hurt
Democrats among Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, who is of Japanese descent, insists it is his resume,
not his ethnic background, that got him the job as head of the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think it was because of my qualifications,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His resume includes: Army intelligence officer in Korea, San
Jose city councilman and mayor, member of Congress for 21 years
and, since 1995, a senior vice president at Lockheed Martin.
Clinton was interested in tapping him as secretary of
Transportation in 1992, but Mineta chose to stay in Congress and
become chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he spent three years with his family in a World War II
internment camp in Wyoming. He later fought successfully in
Congress to get reparations for the tens of thousands of
Japanese-Americans forced into the camps out of suspicion that they
would spy for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta hints that if Gore is elected in November, he may stay in
a Cabinet post, most likely at Commerce or the Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said he has a clear focus for the next six months:
keeping the economic boom going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very fortunate person,'' he said. ``I'm coming into this
job as secretary of Commerce at a time when the economy is booming.
. . . To me, the important thing that I have to do is make sure
this expanding economy continues to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the outlook for the economy remains sunny. The
Commerce Department reported July 28 the gross domestic product
grew at 5 percent last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of his agenda is securing China's entry into the
World Trade Organization. The House voted in May to approve
permanent normal trade relations with China and the country's entry
into the WTO. The Senate is expected to approve the measure this
fall, but it must clear stiff opposition from, among others, Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say normalizing trade relations undermines Congress'
ability to pressure China to improve its human rights record. For
years, Congress has had to vote annually to extend trade relations
with China while the bill before the Senate would make the ties
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta disagrees with the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's human rights or trade violations or anything
else, it seems to me you're better off having them at the table,
rather than be outside the tent,'' he said. ``If you're at the
table and inside the tent, at least you're able to talk about and
negotiate these items with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said spurring the growth of electronic commerce is
another major priority. He believes the Commerce Department should
help set privacy rules to protect Internet users, and uniform
standards to make sure different technologies are easy to use for
consumers. Generally, the government should have a ``minimalist
role'' in regulating trade over the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., praised Mineta for his focus on
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm represented the epicenter of the area that created the
new economy,'' Eshoo said, referring to California's Silicon
Valley. ``He understands how to use the extraordinary powers of his
office to do great things.''

&HT;     RICH AURILIA LONGS FOR THE BIG APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN SHEA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rich Aurilia doesn't hide the fact he'd welcome
playing in New York one day. It was his childhood dream to be a
Met, to play baseball at Shea Stadium, to catch a subway to work,
to play before friends and family and all the crazies in Gotham.
</P>
<P>
   He still thinks about doing that. Just not yet. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to play in New York, but maybe some time down the
road,`` Aurilia said. ``I'm happy in San Francisco. I love the
team, the stadium and my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia was born and raised in Brooklyn, where his father (also
Rich) followed the Brooklyn Dodgers and watched his kid develop
into an All-Big East shortstop at St. John's University and
eventually hook on with Brooklyn's old enemy, the dreaded Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of playing in New York surfaced in June, when
the Mets called the Giants' front office to inquire about Aurilia's
availability.
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia was targeted as a possible replacement for injured Rey
Ordoez, even though Aurilia struggled in the first half with his
glove and bat.
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia also heard that Boston had made inquiries. But if
manager Dusty Baker was going to stick with Aurilia, so would the
front office. Aurilia stayed, and a funny thing happened on the way
to a mediocre season. Just as the trade report surfaced, Aurilia's
game took off.
</P>
<P>
   He regained his batting stroke and fielding prowess, and the
numbers tell it all - he's batting .359 since July 1 while playing
errorless ball in 43 of his last 44 games, including the last 25 in
a row. He also tops National League shortstops with 12 homers and
51 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   And now he is returning to New York, albeit as a Giant, for an
important weekend series and possible playoff preview. The first of
four games is Friday night, and Aurilia expects his parents making
the drive from their new home in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with my game now,'' Aurilia said. ``I finally feel
I'm playing to my capabilities. It's a satisfying feeling after my
rough start.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wild-card standings, the Giants are 11/2 games behind the
Mets. In the first meeting between the teams, the Giants pulled off
a four-game sweep at Pac Bell Park in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Aurilia, and instead of Barry Larkin, who vetoed a
trade to New York, the Mets acquired shortstop Mike Bordick from
Baltimore and now think they've got enough to win the wild card, if
not overtake Atlanta in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips said he sees ``good balance.
No
</P>
<P>
   gaping holes or weaknesses anywhere. We're not perfect, but
we're pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially the pitching staff, which offers a 1-2 punch of Mike
Hampton (11-7, 3.59 ERA) and Al Leiter (12-5, 3.28), who'll pitch
Saturday and Sunday, respectively, against the Giants' top starters
- Shawn Estes (11-3, 3.81) and Livan Hernandez (11-8, 4.00).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really big series, especially because we didn't play
the Mets real well last year,`` said Aurilia, recalling that the
Giants lost seven of nine in the 1999 season series. ``We've got to
beat those teams to get to the playoffs, and they know they've got
to beat us. It'll be an intense series.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not Ebbets Field or the Polo Grounds, but it's the next
best thing for Aurilia, who caught the Giants a few times at Shea
as a kid. He remembers Jack Clark getting beaned and Terry
Mulholland tossing his glove to first base when a comebacker got
stuck in his web.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorites to this day is Mookie Wilson. I loved
watching Mookie run the bases,'' Aurilia said. ``I liked Hubie
Brooks and later Keith Hernandez and Wally Backman.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a great place for baseball, but I guess it's
nothing like it was. Growing up in Brooklyn, I felt the sentiment a
lot of people still had for the Dodgers. My dad would tell me about
going to Ebbets Field and all the kids trying to sneak in.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Giants, Dodgers and Yankees all playing within 45
minutes of
</P>
<P>
   each other, that was the golden age.''

&HT;     JENNY THOMPSON: A SWIMMER TO WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Jenny Thompson has marbled arms, a back of steel
and, judging by a new photo in Sports Illustrated, abs made of hard
metal, too.
</P>
<P>
   This is a strong woman. She's headed for medical school at
Columbia University in another year, and headed to Sydney for her
third Olympic Games next month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow, she has become a sympathetic figure, the poor kid
</P>
<P>
   from New Hampshire whose father bailed out when she was a
toddler and whose spectacular swimming career has been foiled at
the most critical moments.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday should have put an end to all of that. Two snapshots of
Thompson emerged. In one, she was winning the 100-meter butterfly
at the U.S. Olympic Swimming trials, then pumping her fist to the
cheering crowd as she marched off the deck. In the other, she was
wearing skimpy shorts, boots and nothing else. She posed like a
pinup for Sports Illustrated, placing her hands strategically
across her chest to keep things provocative rather than
pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   But even the story accompanying the brash display of flesh
portrays Thompson as thwarted, shortchanged. Only one thing will
</P>
<P>
   stop the pity party that the media insist on throwing in her
honor: a gold medal in an individual Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has five golds now, all in relays. She also has a
silver,
</P>
<P>
   from the 100-meter freestyle in Barcelona. That medal is the
most
</P>
<P>
   controversial, and the most misrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson dived into the pool as the world record-holder in the
100
</P>
<P>
   free. A Chinese woman, Yong Zhuang, won the 1992 gold, beating
Thompson by two-tenths of a second. Zhuang, through a bizarre set
of regulations since abandoned, was not tested for drugs after the
race.
</P>
<P>
   But when dozens of Chinese swimmers started testing positive for
steroids a few years years later, the conventional wisdom said that
Thompson had been cheated out of her rightful place in swimming
history.
</P>
<P>
   There's a problem with that theory. Zhuang did not break
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's world record. She won the Olympic final in 54.64
seconds _ 0.18 of a second slower than Thompson had swum at the
U.S. trials five months earlier. If Zhuang was doping, she still
wasn't unbeatable. Thompson had already proved that she could go
faster than the new champion. She just didn't do it on the day they
were handing out Olympic gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has always had superior times and lamentable timing.
She
</P>
<P>
   was America's premier swimmer in 1996, but she faltered badly at
the Olympic trials. She became an emotional mess before the meet,
unable to sleep, focus or relax. She didn't have the swagger of a
great champion.
</P>
<P>
   She qualified for the U.S. team only on the relays. She was
becoming Dan Jansen Lite, one of those athletes who dominates
events for three years and then shrinks in the Olympic spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been unfathomable, except that Thompson
</P>
<P>
   does not act like a dominant athlete. She swims like one, but in
every other arena, her vulnerability shows.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, she punctuates almost every sentence with a
nervous
</P>
<P>
   laugh. She seems uncomfortable in front of a microphone, almost
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, she has learned how to be a public figure, to say the
right things with poise and a smile. ``I can't tell you how
thrilled I am - and how relieved,'' she said Thursday night, after
her butterfly win. ``I think a lot of people think of it as a
cakewalk, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   She admitted to anxiety, to letting her emotions cramp her
</P>
<P>
   style in the last 25 meters of the race. She won in 57.78,
slower than in the semifinals the night before. At the end, she
visibly tightened up, as did runner-up Dara Torres, in the lane
next to her.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them were watching each other, looking side to side
</P>
<P>
   rather than at the finish. Their coach, Richard Quick of
Stanford, scolded them for losing their concentration, their
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   At her age, in her position, Thompson should know better. But if
</P>
<P>
   She gets a little insecure, it's understandable. Whenever she
thinks she's out in front, all alone, somebody always catches up.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, everything had locked back into place
for
</P>
<P>
   Thompson. She broke Mary T. Meagher's world record in the 100
butterfly, making herself the undisputed favorite for Sydney. That
record had stood for 18 years, and among active swimmers, only
Thompson had ever seriously challenged it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Thompson's record is gone, shattered twice by Inge
</P>
<P>
   de Bruijn of Holland. She doesn't even have the American record
anymore. Torres took that on Wednesday in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Torres came back to swimming last summer, after a seven-year
</P>
<P>
   layoff. She joined Thompson's team, swam Thompson's events,
commanded attention from Thompson's coach. Pretty soon, the two had
to be separated, Thompson in one workout session, Torres in
another.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been only human for Thompson to resent Torres.
</P>
<P>
   The interloper is not just a threat in the pool. She is a former
model, a beautiful, gregarious extrovert whom the media would
adore.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, these things shouldn't matter. But for female
athletes, as Anna Kournikova's disproportionate fame demonstrates,
they matter far too much.
</P>
<P>
   The picture in SI shows that Thompson, too, can play ball
</P>
<P>
   in the pulchritude league. But most of all, she can swim.
</P>
<P>
   Torres was gaining on her all the way down the stretch, but
</P>
<P>
   Thompson never yielded. At the finish, the two embraced in a
full bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, it was totally fake,'' Torres deadpanned at her news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   She was a total ham. She showed up in the press room while
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was still talking and plopped down amid reporters, a
conspicuous presence in the audience, with a red, white and blue
bandanna wrapped around her head.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is a natural scene-stealer. But Thompson has owned this
</P>
<P>
   stage for a long time, too long to step aside now.

AS THE LEAF TURNS: A LITTLE LEGWORK PUTS YOU ON THE TRAIL OF FALL
FOLIAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanied by FOLIAGE-IF YOU GO)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scotty Johnston has been leading fall foliage tours for more
than 40 years, becoming so conversant with the whys and wherefores
of turning leaves that he has been dubbed the nation's only
``foliologist.'' But his prediction of a beautiful and colorful
fall foliage season is based only partly on science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident for one reason _ we've never had a bad one,''
says Johnston, who works for Tauck World Discovery, a tour company
with a full slate of foliage tours. ``Even what is an average year
for us who live (in New England) is eye-boggling, especially to the
visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   And though it's still full-bore summer for those of us in Texas,
the leaf-peeping season is just a few weeks away from beginning in
Canada and parts of the Northern United States, where trees start
turning rich autumn colors as early as the beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
   (Texas' peak season usually begins in the latter part of October
in the northern part of the state and lasts through late November
in the southern portions, says veteran foliage-watcher Howard
Rosser of the East Texas Tourism Association.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnston does bring some science to bear on his annual color
predictions, which he publicizes in a toll-free hot line suggesting
hot spots for foliage tourists. But he says the factors that
combine for the best color _ adequate springtime rain, cool, sunny
fall days, low wind _ don't make much of a difference from year to
year to affect the experience of the average tourist. More
important is knowing when and where to go, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the optimum week or two can be a bit of a gamble _ just
slightly easier than trying to hit Washington, D.C., at the right
time for the cherry blossoms. Most important to keep in mind is
that both latitude and altitude play a role. The northernmost areas
with the highest elevations turn first, with the color changes
moving southward at the rate of roughly 25 miles per day, he says.
Inland areas, with chillier temperatures than those on the coast,
also turn earlier.
</P>
<P>
   According to this timetable, the first areas to enjoy fall
colors are the Canadian and Colorado Rockies, which begin the North
American foliage season as early as the first weeks of September,
Johnston says.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes eastern Canada, such as Montreal and Quebec, in
mid-September. By late September, look to the highest and farthest
north portions of New England, in spots such as Vermont, New
Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A week or two later, in early October, the prime spots have
moved south to the lower portions of those states and neighbors in
Massachusetts and Connecticut. The New England season is pretty
much finished by the third week of October _ about the time for
peak color in such states as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, West
Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Johnston considers the
last good color to appear in Missouri's Ozark Mountains and
Arkansas' Ouachitas in late October and early November.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course. Nova Scotia, for instance,
enjoys its peak color in mid-October _ it turns later than its
fellow Canadian sites because no part of the land mass is more than
35 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, which provides a moderating
influence on both temperature and color.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas, of course, is on its own timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rosser suggests that Texans keep their eyes on southern
Arkansas and Oklahoma; Texas leaves traditionally start turning a
week or so after those areas, usually by late October. The season
extends into late November in the southernmost regions.
</P>
<P>
   Rosser says good spring rains and a summer that hasn't been as
severe as usual should produce a good fall season. Traditional
highlights are Daingerfield State Park, Big Thicket and Lake o' the
Pines. Rosser's association can suggest a number of scenic drives,
with natural stopping points in such towns as Pittsburg, Sulphur
Springs and Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Other Texas spots to watch:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lost Maples State Natural Area, in the western part of the
Texas Hill Country near Bandera, is perhaps the best-known (and
most-visited) Texas site for foliage. Leaf-lovers congregate in
this area, usually beginning in late October, for hiking as well as
driving tours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canadian, up in the Panhandle, is usually the first area in
Texas to turn. in early to mid-October; hot spots include the
natural area at Lake Marvin, part of the Black Kettle National
Grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Caprock Canyon State Park, the lesser-known neighbor of Palo
Duro Canyon in western Texas, puts on a good natural show, usually
beginning in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guadalupe Mountains National Park, way out in far West Texas,
about 100 miles east of El Paso, offers foliage in a spectacular if
remote setting; the star of the show is McKittrick Canyon, where
the most vivid colors are present from roughly mid-October to
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   _ But whether you're headed to New England or East Texas,
Johnston offers good advice for would-be scenery spotters: Use good
maps. Plan a route judiciously, not trying to cover too much ground
in one day. Allow plenty of time, perhaps twice as much as you
think you'll need; the best views are often along narrow, two-lane
roads likely to be crowded with other tourists.

   EGYPTAIR-CRASH (Washington) _ The National Transportation Safety
Board Friday strongly indicated that Egyptair 990 crashed last Oct.
31 because of a deliberate act by the relief co-pilot, releasing
nearly 1,700 pages of documents, as the chairman of the board
declared that there were ``no unresolved safety issues'' that would
require a hearing. But American experts representing Egyptair,
including a former chairman of the Safety Board, said that the
documents contained extensive evidence that argued against the
crash as being a deliberate act. The plane went down about 60 miles

   JAPAN-RATES (Tokyo) _ Reflecting its belief that the world's
second largest economy is firmly on the road to recovery, Japan's
central bank raised key interest rates Friday for the first time in
a decade, despite strong pressure from government officials to keep
borrowing costs close to zero as an economic stimulus. The central
bank said it would steer the overnight call rate _ the interest
rate that private banks charge one another _ to 0.25 percent from
virtually zero. The official discount rate, the rate on loans to
private banks, was left unchanged at 0.5 percent, a record low. But
the central bank's decision drew sharp criticism from government
officials, political leaders, and many economists who have argued
that Japan's economy is still too delicate to sustain an increase
in interest rates, no matter how small. Many critics of the rate
hike view it more as an statement of independence on the part of
the central bank than sound economic policy. By Calvin Sims.

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The last preliminary event of what is expected to
be one of the closest presidential races in recent history will
begin Monday when Democrats gather in Los Angeles to nominate Vice
President Al Gore and rally the faithful for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's challenge will be to articulate his vision for the
future, highlight his party's differences with Republican nominee
George W. Bush and tout the administration's record over the past
eight years while stepping out of the political and personal shadow
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the GOP did two weeks ago, Democrats also hope to mount
a four-day, tightly scripted, televised lovefest without
controversy, conflict or crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But some pre-convention skirmishes may hamper the Democrats'
effort to display that kind of unity and provide some news for the
15,000 journalists expected to be on hand for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have already arrived in Los Angeles, with a full
schedule of fund-raising activities that has some Gore supporters
angry they will siphon money away from the presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And the Gore folks continue to press Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
D-Calif., a general co-chairwoman of the Democratic National
Convention, to cancel a scheduled fund-raiser at the Los Angeles
Playboy mansion, an icon of Hugh Hefner's adult entertainment
company. It's a potential embarrassment for the party and Gore's
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who has taken
high-profile stands against the sexual and violent content of
entertainment produced in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides predict these conflicts will be resolved by the time
the convention opens, and the White House predicts that any
animosity toward the Clintons will ease after the president's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will begin the process of passing the torch with his
speech to the convention Monday, a night that will also feature New
York Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. Tuesday will feature
former candidate Bill Bradley, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers said President Clinton will offer not only
a recitation of the Clinton-Gore accomplishments, but also a
rousing endorsement of Gore as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will accept the party's nomination for vice president
Wednesday night, sharing the stage with Gore's daughter Karenna
Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Before he steps onto the 5-foot-high, 3,700-square-foot stage at
Los Angeles' Staples Center to accept the nomination Thursday
night, Gore will see his life presented in what aides describe as a
``warm and fuzzy'' biographical video. It will chronicle his tour
in Vietnam, his ``scoops'' as a reporter in Nashville, Tenn., and
his long love affair with his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to soften aggressive images on the campaign trail, Gore
promised last week that ``I will not say a single unkind word about
Gov. Bush or Dick Cheney,'' but Democratic supporters still expect
him to methodically go down the list of issues that separate the
two presidential campaigns -- from Social Security to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will hammer on the differences between the two
major party candidates on a variety of issues important to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big differences in economic policy, in crime policy,
in health care policy, in education policy, environmental policy,
right down the line,'' Clinton told a gathering of Democratic
faithful last week. ``And in our policy on building one America,
whether we should have a minimum wage, hate crimes legislation,
employment nondiscrimination legislation, whether we should
preserve or get rid of a woman's right to choose -- all these
things are at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The president and other speakers are likely to mention House
Republicans more often than speakers at the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., said that ``voters need to know
that with Bush you get the whole package, including the
right-wing-dominated House GOP leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson repeated the Gore campaign's description of the GOP
convention as a masquerade ball, with party leaders keeping top
House GOP leaders mostly out of sight from prime-time TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they won't be quiet during the convention,
promising, as Democrats did at the Republican convention, to
provide a daily ``truth quotient'' that won't end until well after
the traditional balloon drop at the convention's close to Tina
Turner's ``Simply the Best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has already provided its pre-convention spin,
predicting that Gore will get a convention bounce and narrow the
gap with Bush, but that he will ultimately fail even with a lot of
production help from Hollywood friends to convince voters he's
capable of working constructively with both Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>

   ``Now does anyone think, after the kind of `risky scheme'
language and `masquerade ball' and `whose planet are they on' type
rhetoric, that Al Gore would truly be able to change the tone in

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The last preliminary event of what is expected to
be one of the closest presidential races in recent history will
begin Monday when Democrats gather in Los Angeles to nominate Vice
President Al Gore and rally the faithful for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's challenge will be to articulate his vision for the
future, highlight his party's differences with Republican nominee
George W. Bush and tout the administration's record over the past
eight years while stepping out of the political and personal shadow
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the GOP did two weeks ago, Democrats also hope to mount
a four-day, tightly scripted, televised lovefest without
controversy, conflict or crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But some pre-convention skirmishes may hamper the Democrats'
effort to display that kind of unity and provide some news for the
15,000 journalists expected to be on hand for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have already arrived in Los Angeles, with a full
schedule of fund-raising activities that has some Gore supporters
angry they will siphon money away from the presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And the Gore folks continue to press Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
D-Calif., a general co-chairwoman of the Democratic National
Convention, to cancel a scheduled fund-raiser at the Los Angeles
Playboy mansion, an icon of Hugh Hefner's adult entertainment
company. It's a potential embarrassment for the party and Gore's
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who has taken
high-profile stands against the sexual and violent content of
entertainment produced in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides predict these conflicts will be resolved by the time
the convention opens, and the White House predicts that any
animosity toward the Clintons will ease after the president's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will begin the process of passing the torch with his
speech to the convention Monday, a night that will also feature New
York Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. Tuesday will feature
former candidate Bill Bradley, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers said President Clinton will offer not only
a recitation of the Clinton-Gore accomplishments, but also a
rousing endorsement of Gore as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will accept the party's nomination for vice president
Wednesday night, sharing the stage with Gore's daughter Karenna
Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Before he steps onto the 5-foot-high, 3,700-square-foot stage at
Los Angeles' Staples Center to accept the nomination Thursday
night, Gore will see his life presented in what aides describe as a
``warm and fuzzy'' biographical video. It will chronicle his tour
in Vietnam, his ``scoops'' as a reporter in Nashville, Tenn., and
his long love affair with his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to soften aggressive images on the campaign trail, Gore
promised last week that ``I will not say a single unkind word about
Gov. Bush or Dick Cheney,'' but Democratic supporters still expect
him to methodically go down the list of issues that separate the
two presidential campaigns -- from Social Security to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will hammer on the differences between the two
major party candidates on a variety of issues important to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big differences in economic policy, in crime policy,
in health care policy, in education policy, environmental policy,
right down the line,'' Clinton told a gathering of Democratic
faithful last week. ``And in our policy on building one America,
whether we should have a minimum wage, hate crimes legislation,
employment nondiscrimination legislation, whether we should
preserve or get rid of a woman's right to choose -- all these
things are at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The president and other speakers are likely to mention House
Republicans more often than speakers at the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., said that ``voters need to know
that with Bush you get the whole package, including the
right-wing-dominated House GOP leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson repeated the Gore campaign's description of the GOP
convention as a masquerade ball, with party leaders keeping top
House GOP leaders mostly out of sight from prime-time TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they won't be quiet during the convention,
promising, as Democrats did at the Republican convention, to
provide a daily ``truth quotient'' that won't end until well after
the traditional balloon drop at the convention's close to Tina
Turner's ``Simply the Best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has already provided its pre-convention spin,
predicting that Gore will get a convention bounce and narrow the
gap with Bush, but that he will ultimately fail even with a lot of
production help from Hollywood friends to convince voters he's
capable of working constructively with both Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now does anyone think, after the kind of `risky scheme'
language and `masquerade ball' and `whose planet are they on' type
rhetoric, that Al Gore would truly be able to change the tone in
Washington?'' Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes asked.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CARROLLTON, Ohio _ The crowd was awed as 7-year-old Travis
Dwire proudly displayed the carp on the fishing line.
</P>
<P>
   After gently returning the carp to the water, Travis flashed a
smile and remembered the biggest fish he ever caught. ``It was a
really heavy 16-inch bass and I reeled it in all by myself!''
</P>
<P>
   Travis and his sisters Casey and Lindsay were among 175 children
and parents who were kept occupied with earthworms, rods and
bobbers at Hooked on Fishing, Not Drugs 2000. For the second
summer, the Ohio Division of Wildlife and Five Rivers MetroParks
teamed up to offer a free nine-week program that educates
youngsters about the dangers of drugs while they are kept busy
enjoying nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to teach the children to respect each other and to
respect wildlife,'' said Tina Weaver, a MetroParks wildlife
officer. ``Every week we collect litter around the area.''
</P>
<P>
   During every Wednesday morning session, Tina Weaver and her
husband Trent, who also is a wildlife officer, kick off the day
with an hour of safety tips about biking, hiking, fishing and the
dangers of alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, we encourage the parents and guardians to
come with their children so they can appreciate outdoor activities
together,'' Tina Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked on Fishing participants ranged from 5 to 18 years old and
those younger than 15 are required to attend in the presence of a
parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The Weavers introduce a new fishing topic each week. The lessons
began with introductory information on casting. Children were then
put to the test as they aimed to place their casts inside a hula
hoop floating in Possum Creek Pond. The next step dealt with
baiting the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them it's better and less expensive to use live bait
like night crawlers and crawdads,'' the wildlife officer explained.
</P>
<P>
   For backup bait, the group made dough ball baits of bran flakes,
dried corn, vanilla and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish and carp just love them,'' Tina Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   After learning to properly tie knots to attach to the hooks, the
children were instructed to be aware of the habitat before
attempting to fish. While a pond's water is still and easier to
fish in, the river's current may cause more difficulty because the
bait is likely to get snagged in the greenery.
</P>
<P>
   Week four took on a creative spin and each child had the
opportunity to draw a picture of a freshwater aquatic animal.
Winning artists were supplied with reels and rods. It doesn't stop
there, the children have many chances of acquiring their own
equipment. ``If the kids are on time they win a T-shirt and if they
attend at least six sessions of the nine-week program they get
their own rod and reel along with hooks and bait,'' Tina Weaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers and fishing experts like 73-year-old Ermon Brown take
part in the workshop by offering guidance and helpful fishing tips.
``The important this is camaraderie,'' he said. ``I'm just an old
guy that loves kids _ they're exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowded under a shelter during a thunderstorm last week, the
children gathered for the final session: learning to fillet their
catch. Each session began with a pledge to resist using harmful
substances followed by a series of safety questions. The children
eagerly raised their hands to answer in exchange for informational
cards about several types of fish.
</P>
<P>
   The storm cleared as the youngsters gathered to watch Brown's
fillet demonstration. Before piercing the catfish, the volunteer
informed everyone that the fillet blade is much sharper than any
household knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to hold his sharp spines down and start cutting the
tough skin behind the whiskers,'' he said as the youngest
participants ones shrieked with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bibby, an intern at the Division of Wildlife and a Wright
State University student, offered tips on examining the fish before
cooking it. ``The gills have to be red and make sure that the
fish's eyes are clear, or else the fish is not safe to eat,'' she
warned.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing program concluded with an hour of fishing followed
by a fish fry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a lot of fun for these kids and for me, too,''
Tina Weaver said.

WHEN BAD WEATHER IS GOOD BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Ravi Nathan, the weather is not kindling for small talk.
Sunshine does not necessarily lift his spirits, nor does rain
always sour his mood.
</P>
<P>
   As the portfolio manager of weather derivatives at Aquila
Energy, Nathan is more concerned about how heat waves lingering
over California, hurricanes gathering in the Gulf of Mexico and
cold fronts drifting into the Northeast will affect his clients,
companies whose businesses are vulnerable to the vicissitudes of
the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has been especially unruly, with droughts and high
heat in parts of the South and West, but rain and relatively cool
weather (so far) in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot day in Kansas City, Mo., where Aquila _ a unit of
Utilicorp United, an energy company and utility _ is based, Nathan
talked of his complicated relationship with the shifting skies.
Following are excerpts from the conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ NEELA BANERJEE
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does it mean to hedge against the weather?
</P>
<P>
   A. We use various weather measures, such as temperature and
precipitation, to come up with various averages for a city, a
region. And we can create an index from those averages that we base
our contracts on.
</P>
<P>
   So for example, if you see from the index that there will be
several days over 100 degrees in New York this summer, then you
enter into a contract that says, for every degree over 100, you get
$10,000. But for that protection, you pay a premium ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who are most of your clients?
</P>
<P>
   A. Technically, any business impacted by the weather is a
candidate. But mainly it's energy companies, utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But we also get soft-drink companies, too. Beverage companies
hedge by setting up contracts in case there aren't enough hot days.
If the temperature gets above 90, people drink more soda. The
contract will be set up, say you have 50 days in the summer under
90 degrees, and for each day you get paid depending on how much in
prospective sales you lose.
</P>
<P>
   The average risk exposure on the contracts is about $2 million.
But the biggest single contract I've had is $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So how are your clients faring? Did they guess right about
the weather this summer?
</P>
<P>
   A. The weather market in California originally thought summer
would be cool there, because the last three summers have been cool
and power prices didn't do much, and they expected it to be the
same. But weather being weather, it will surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know the meteorological pattern that's caused it, but
a ridge of heat has stayed over the whole West for most of July,
which is strange because weather usually moves around and lets a
region cool off.
</P>
<P>
   But utilities also hedge against cool summers, against people
not turning on their air-conditioners, if you want to put it
simply.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has the summer's unexpected weather _ the lasting heat and
droughts in the West, the cool, rainy weather in the Northeast _
been good or bad for business? And do you react to the weather
differently from other people?
</P>
<P>
   A. What's good for business is when risks go up. When there's so
much volatility, the prospects for making money are good. At the
same time, it is so important for me to balance my exposure out _
all over the country, all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   This summer in America has been absolutely good for business.
We're doing quite well.
</P>
<P>
   But it's bad being a weather trader, because I just can't enjoy
the weather. You walk out of the house and you think the weather
will be a kiss on the cheek, but it ends up being a punch in the
nose. I'll go to New York, say, and I may have a contract there,
and if the weather isn't going the way we planned, I think, ``Oh,
God, I'm losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can individuals use weather derivatives, to, say, hedge their
barbecues?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're prevented by our regulators from dealing with mom and
pop. If people want to bet on the weather, maybe they should try
Vegas.

KPMG CONSULTING ARM LOOKS READY TO FLY SOLO

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the busy market for initial public offerings _ especially for
volatile Internet-related companies _ analysts tend to be wary,
which makes their enthusiasm for a planned $2.83 billion stock sale
announced last week by KPMG Consulting Inc. all the more
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Through an alliance with Cisco Systems, which invested $1
billion in KPMG Consulting a year ago, the consulting group has
specialized in what it calls ``e-business services'' to a client
list that includes blue-chip companies, the Pentagon, the State
Department and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the largest technology services IPO in history,''
said Karl Keirstead, vice president for equity research at Lehman
Brothers. ``I think Wall Street will find it quite attractive,'' he
added, in comparison with its competition. Two other big
information-technology services companies, Electronic Data Services
and Computer Science Corp., ``have been going through tough
transitions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think KPMG will be the first of the Big Five accounting
firms'' to sell part of its consulting business to the public, said
Moshe Katri, managing director at SG Cowen Securities, who follows
Sapient Corp., a KPMG competitor. ``We expect the others to
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, federal regulators are hammering out tough new limits on
accounting firms' ability to perform lucrative consulting work for
their audit clients. Last Monday, an arbitrator separated Andersen
Consulting from Arthur Andersen, the tax and auditing firm. Earlier
this year, Ernst &AMP; Young sold its consulting unit to Cap Gemini for
roughly $11 billion, and PricewaterhouseCoopers is considering
divesting itself of its consulting unit by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   In January, KPMG LLP incorporated its consulting unit as a
separate entity, 80.1 percent owned by KPMG and its partners and
19.9 percent by Cisco. KPMG Consulting announced plans in May for a
$1 billion initial public offering, but in an amended prospectus
filed last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it
raised the offering to 324.2 million shares to be priced at $6.75
to $8.75 each. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is to be the underwriter.
After the sale, the public would own 55 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, the accounting firm KPMG LLP and its partners
are to divest themselves of any common shares in the consulting
company, which has applied to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol
KCIN.
</P>
<P>
   Katri is positive about the new offering. ``In general, spending
on information technology services is growing about 14 percent a
year,'' he said. ``The biggest attraction of computer services is
that investors don't bet on the technology itself, which may not
work out. You're betting on consultants that use the best-of-breed
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   KPMG is particularly well positioned, Keirstead added. ``All the
Big Five firms are struggling to transition their business models
and employee skill sets to capitalize on the demand for Internet
consulting services,'' he said. ``In my view, KPMG has done the
best job of making the transition, given that half of its revenues
derive from Web consulting projects. That's what Wall Street wants
to own today.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew T. Burns, senior vice president at PaineWebber in San
Francisco, said: ``It's a reasonable valuation. It's a discount to
pure Internet professional services companies and a slight premium
over the mainstay outsourcing companies like Electronic Data
Services.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stock seems to be priced unusually low, compared with
similar, $20-a-share offerings at the beginning of the year, said
Gail Bronson, a consultant in Palo Alto, Calif., who also provides
market commentary for IPO Monitor, a news and data Web site. ``What
does that say,'' she asked, ``about the overall enthusiasm of the
investment houses'' to which they made advance presentations?
</P>
<P>
   Even investors who are bullish on KPMG Consulting long term
should steer clear of the initial offering, Bronson advised. ``No
one should buy an IPO in the first day that it trades, or even the
first couple of weeks, until you see where the price settles out
to,'' she said. ``Invariably, if it's a popular offering,'' she
added, ``it will shoot up'' at first.

LIEBERMAN'S CANDIDACY WILL TELL MUCH ABOUT AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Thank you. God bless you. God bless America,'' Sen. Joseph
Lieberman said this week in Nashville after the history-making
announcement that he would be the first Jewish-American
vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It was an apt beginning for the ``moral crusade'' Lieberman will
carry out in the months ahead as running mate of Democratic
presidential hopeful Al Gore, a Southern Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is a devout Orthodox Jew who prays three times a day
and walks to Sabbath services because of his religion's
prohibitions against driving or working on the Sabbath. He doesn't
even turn on lights or punch elevator buttons on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't attend the political convention nominating him as
senator in Connecticut because it fell on Saturday. However,
Lieberman said his religion allows some public service work on the
Sabbath, such as crucial votes in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book, ``In Praise of Public Life,'' co-authored
with Michael D'Orso (Simon and Schuster. $21), Lieberman says
America is tired of its moral backsliding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clear signs of a beginning of a new American
\Rspiritual\S awakening around our country today,'' he writes.
``Today's awakening is appropriately multidenominational and
broadly spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are alarmed by what they see as ``a crumbling moral
framework,'' reflected by rising divorce rates and such recent
history as the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the high school shootings
at Littleton, Colo., and similar disastrous events.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman tells about his own divorce 16 years ago, calling it
one of his most painful decisions. Today, he is happily remarried
to Haddasah Freilich Lieberman, whose parents were Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked with prominent Christians, such as former
Education Secretary William Bennett, in denouncing what he calls
violent and immoral programming in movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   This presidential campaign will be a time of testing for
America. Will citizens in a predominantly Christian nation show
respect for the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate? Or will
some revert to name-calling and bigotry?
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup Poll indicates a large majority of Americans
would not reject a presidential candidate simply because he is
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rev. Welton Gaddy, director of the Interfaith
Alliance, a multidenominational organization that counters
political efforts by religious conservatives, said pockets of
prejudice linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is some people will continue to apply a religious
litmus test to candidates, and that's sad,'' Gaddy said.
</P>
<P>
   While admiring Lieberman's moral stands, Gaddy said the
vice-presidential nominee and all other candidates should be judged
on their political merits, not their faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not electing holy man of the year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Land, president of the conservative Southern Baptist
Religious Ethics &AMP; Religious Liberty Commission in Nashville,
Tenn., said most Baptists won't reject Lieberman simply because he
is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Land said controversial campaigns by Baptists aimed at
conversion of Jews to Christianity were misinterpreted and were
examples of a biblical command to evangelize all people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Baptist voters respect Senator Lieberman's faith and
commitment; they see it as a positive, not a negative,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Land said, many Baptists will be turned off by
Lieberman's pro-choice stand on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Lieberman praises America's strides in showing
tolerance to minority races and religions. But he said a skewed
view of tolerance has caused an erosion of moral values in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We confused tolerance and respect for all people with
tolerance and respect for all behavior,'' he writes. ``This moral
timidity in the name of tolerance deprived us of the common
vocabulary of values and the shared moral assumptions that
traditionally have been at the heart of the American experience
...''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's faith commitment again accentuates the major role
religion is playing in this year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush, a United
Methodist, has called Jesus of Nazareth his philosophical hero. He
candidly speaks about his own spiritual rebirth, influenced by
private conversations with Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a moderate Southern Baptist, has said that part of his
decision-making is based on asking the question, ``What would Jesus
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a political decision on the part of Gore to name
a Jewish running mate, it was a stunning reaffirmation of America's
unique brand of religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In Lieberman's own words, ``Miracles do happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The true miracle could blossom in the months ahead as Americans
set aside age-old bigotries and choose a candidate on his morality,
integrity and governing skills, not his religion.

SOFT AND CUTE, ALPACAS TURN HEADS, AND PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.Y. _ Screech. Slam. Ooh. Ahh.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Boyd and his family scarcely notice the noise anymore.
They know the routine so well. First, there is the sudden glow of
the brake lights on the vehicles heading past their 120-acre farm
on a normally quiet back road in rural Sullivan County. Then comes
the whine of the brakes and the thump of car doors slamming.
Inevitably, a knot of curious visitors gathers at the pasture fence
near the 200-year-old house.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them take out cameras,'' said Boyd, ``because they've
never seen an alpaca before.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the 80 quizzical, friendly looking, big-eyed
creatures eyeing him meditatively on a recent afternoon, all of
them sporting improbably long eyelashes and goofy topknots. Each
resembled nothing so much as a teddy-bear-ish Bambi as drawn by Dr.
Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently the alpaca was an exotic sight at county
fairs and petting zoos in the metropolitan region. And the animals
were profoundly unknown way out there in rustic crevices like
Boyd's 120-acre former dairy spread, half a mile from what was once
the site of the original Woodstock festival.
</P>
<P>
   For a tiny but growing number of upstate farmers and
entrepreneurs, however, these gentle, adaptable creatures are
becoming not just a curiosity but a way of life: an avocation, a
passionate cause and, more importantly, a profit center.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Sullivan County and the region see the alpaca farm,
should their numbers grow, not only as a support to the local
economy, but as an alternative to the exurban encroachment that is
implacably transforming picturesque dairy farms into split-level
tracts. ``Alpacas are well suited to the land here,'' said Allan C.
Scott, supervisor of the town of Bethel, the largest in the county.
``It's already a good thing for our economy, and I'm sure that
raising alpacas could be an economic option for others in Sullivan
County.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those others is Maria Herlinda Bravo, an entrepreneur who
has established a herd of 340 alpacas on a 48-acre farm in
Callicoon, N.Y., six miles northwest of Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alpacas thrive in the warm days and cool nights here,'' said
Bravo, a former grocery-chain vice president, who in 1999 made her
farm the headquarters of a vertically integrated international
alpaca operation. She breeds the animals and shears the luxurious
fleece for her fashion business, selling expensive scarves,
sweaters, blankets and blouses through a catalog and on the
Internet, under the name of Quintessence and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Other alpaca herds have recently been established in Catskill,
New Kingston and Walton. There are New York herds in Hancock and
Rome, and alpacas are being raised on Long Island and in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's son Brandon is president of the Mid-Atlantic Alpaca
Association, which counts as its members 100 of the 140 alpaca
owners in seven mid-Atlantic states (they are given to flaunting
vehicle bumper stickers proclaiming ``ALPACAS _ HAVE YOU HERD?'').
</P>
<P>
   But still: alpacas?
</P>
<P>
   While some raise the animals as pets, the real draw is the
silky, durable, water-resistant and highly insulative alpaca
fleece, which has long been prized as the raw material for
luxurious fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders say that depending on the color and the quality, fleece
sells for $2 to $8 per ounce in the United States, primarily to
weavers and knitters. Each animal produces 5 to 8 pounds of fleece
per year, enough for several sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   While it can be lucrative to sell, alpaca can be even more
lucrative to weave: a man's sweater can be made out of 1 pound of
yarn worth about $40; it costs $100 in labor to weave, and it can
be sold for $400.
</P>
<P>
   But Boyd and other herd owners breed alpacas for more than
fleece: females sell for $12,500 to $40,000, and herd sires have
fetched as much as $165,000. Owners command stud fees of $2,000 to
$5,000 for their prize bulls.
</P>
<P>
   These days 99 percent of the world's 3 million alpacas graze in
the mountains of Bolivia, Chile and Peru. But in recent years,
herds have been established in Canada, Australia, Japan, Britain,
Israel, Italy and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, alpacas are being raised in every state,
and the nation's alpaca herd is growing by about 22 percent a year,
according to the Alpaca Registry in Kalispell, Mont. By July 31,
there were 29,856 registered alpacas, up 2,145 percent over 1990,
when there were 1,330. The number of owners has grown from 146, in
1991, to 2,919.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the number to double in another five years,'' said
Ken Hobert, business manager of the Alpaca Owners and Breeders
Association in Estes Park, Colo., which has 1,950 members. ``We get
1,000 inquiries a month from people who want to know more about
owning alpacas,'' he said of the registry's Web site,
www.alpacainfo.com.
</P>
<P>
   He said the scarcity of alpacas is based on their slow rate of
reproduction, since females usually deliver one baby, called a
cria, per year. Importing alpacas from South America is difficult
and expensive, given quarantine restrictions, and the Alpaca
Registry has been closed to newly imported alpacas since Dec. 31,
1998. Unregistered alpacas ``have minimal breeding value and are
difficult to sell,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show off the superiority of their fleece, alpaca
worshipers proffer research showing that alpaca fibers are
stronger, lighter, warmer and softer than sheep's wool. Studies
show that the semi-hollow alpaca fibers are finer than Angora
rabbit fleece, mohair (from Angora goats) and cashmere goat fleece.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike merino (sheep's wool), alpaca fleece is lanolin-free,
and sold, therefore, to those who are allergic to wool.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, breeders say alpacas are, in livestock patois, easy
keepers, requiring minimal food, water, care and shelter, thanks to
the extremes of heat and cold their ancestors endured in the Andes.
They live 15 to 25 years and can weigh 150 to 175 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   They are placid, have no incisors, horns, hooves or claws, and
``they don't bite and they rarely kick, and when they do, they
don't hurt each other _ because they have soft pads on their
feet,'' said Boyd's farm manager, Jair Trujillo. ``They don't cut
up the pasture, either.''
</P>
<P>
   For these and other reasons, alpaca owners reject comparisons
with the ostrich-farm scramble of the 1980s, when speculators
expected windfall profits from the supposedly exploding ostrich
market only to find that it was more of a novelty boomlet.
``Ostriches are mean, dangerous and dirty,'' contended Boyd, ``and
they are nowhere as easy to handle as alpacas.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bravo estimates that, given the slow alpaca reproductive rate,
``it will take a long time to drive the price of breeding stock
down.''
</P>
<P>
   She has placed a big bet on Sullivan County by putting in new
buildings and paddocks to house her high-tech computer-monitored
alpaca business, which employs six full-time workers, and features
a two-story barn-cum-office-cum-laboratory equipped with ultrasound
devices to monitor gestating alpaca females.
</P>
<P>
   The hope for stability in alpaca prices is an important
consideration in Sullivan County, where, because of low milk
prices, more farms ``are being lost every year,'' said Scott, a
director of the Sullivan County Partnership, a consortium of
organizations working to develop the county's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, an alpaca proselytizer, said he welcomed competition.
``There is plenty of room for more,'' said Boyd, a retired
marketing manager for the Pepsi-Cola Co. and American Home Products
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, 86, bought the farm in 1966, a decade after it last
supported dairy cows, ``but I always wanted to use the property
productively,'' he said. He finally got his wish in 1994 after
seeing a televised report about an alpaca herd in Santa Fe, N.M.
``I knew how to spell alpaca but didn't know any more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, laughing, ``Some people thought I had a soft cranium,
but I saw the potential from the start.'' He suggested the alpaca
avocation to his wife and four grown children. ``After Dad
suggested we buy them, we just looked at each other,'' recalled his
44-year-old son, Brandon, an entertainment lawyer in New York City.
``Then we said: `What is this? Can you eat them? Do they pull a
plow?' Finally we thought, `Maybe it will help to keep Dad busy.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the senior Boyd bought his first three animals for
$55,500. Soon he bought seven more, and found himself the
proprietor of the Double E Alpaca Farm (the E's represent Ed Boyd
and his wife, Edith).
</P>
<P>
   As his herd increased, he began selling fleece to local
spinners, and soon he was selling animals and obtaining stud fees.
``I started with a five-year plan, to make money, and we made it,''
said Boyd, adding that his alpacas were profitable for the first
time in 1999, earning $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Brandon Boyd said that he was converted. ``There
was just something about them that drew me in,'' he said. As he
spoke, he stood near his father in the venerable dairy barn, where
a throng of alpacas made the sound called ``humming'': a soothing
ululation that sounds something like a happy kazoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are such gentle animals,'' Brandon said. ``All I can say
is that I've really become very gung-ho about alpacas.''

HARRY POTTER MEETS THE CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first readings are over, the tired eyes glazed, the mammoth
tomes laid aside. Blessedly, Phase 1 of this year's Harry Potter
frenzy has concluded. But hold on. Relief may be premature. For
now, it seems, it is time to settle in for Phase 2: Potter
deconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Just one month after the publication of ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth in J.K. Rowling's projected seven-book
series, battle lines are already forming in the debate over the
literary merit of the Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply: Is Harry Potter literature or not? And by extension,
what benchmarks are appropriate in making a judgment: C.S. Lewis or
Billy Bunter, J.R.R. Tolkien or Enid Blyton?
</P>
<P>
   By and large the initial reception has been overwhelmingly
favorable. ``The dissenting voices are very rare,'' said Robert
Potts, an editor of The Times Literary Supplement in London.
``Harry Potter works very well in the existing tradition of English
children's literature. It takes an extremely curmudgeonly attitude
to despise these books.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the remarks of scores of reviewers and commentators on both
sides of the Atlantic _ indeed, as far afield as The Straits Times
of Singapore _ make it clear that proponents of a minority
countervision are prepared to take up the cudgels against the
prevailing view of the Potter saga, even to brave the accusation
that nothing breeds resentment quite like success.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most immediate issue is the character of the books'
protagonist _ Harry Potter, schoolboy wizard. He may entrance
readers by the millions but that _ in the counterview _ may simply
be because he provides the simplest of pegs on which dreams may be
hung. ``He is not a boy of depth or subtlety,'' said Robert McCrum,
the literary editor of The Observer of London, in a review that
generally praised Rowling's abilities as a storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   McCrum's criticism echoed the conclusions of this year's judges
for Britain's Carnegie Medal, Britain's most prestigious award for
children's books. Annie Everall, the head of the 12-member judging
panel, which announced its conclusions just before ``Goblet of
Fire'' was published, said that there had been a consensus on the
panel that Harry was ``more one-dimensional'' than rivals for the
prize, which went to Aidan Chambers' ``Postcards From No Man's
Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics go further, arguing that Harry has become no more
than part of a stale formula wearing thin after four books. ``J.K.
Rowling hit upon a winning formula at the beginning of the series,
and she has hardly changed it'' in ``Goblet of Fire,'' a review in
The Daily Telegraph in London said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of language, where the gulf seems to
lie primarily between highbrow and not-so-highbrow perceptions of
the books, although in what some Potter enthusiasts may take as a
backhanded compliment, Colin Cheong said in The Straits Times,
``Just because some adults happen to enjoy the Potter books does
not mean the books should be judged against an adult's `literary'
yardstick.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a much-debated critique of Rowling in The
Wall Street Journal by Harold Bloom, Sterling Professor of
Humanities at Yale University, provided possibly the most
heavyweight intellectual imprimatur to the dissent. ``Her prose
style, heavy on cliches, makes no demands upon her readers,'' Bloom
wrote last month, even as he vouchsafed the hope that ``my
discontent is not merely a highbrow snobbery, or a nostalgia for a
more literate fantasy to beguile (shall we say) intelligent
children of all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrum, in The Observer, was just as blunt. ``Her work teems
with exotic personnel and it has the reader by the throat from page
to page, but her prose is as flat (and as English) as old beer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the same could be said for many, if not most, authors
of the blockbuster best sellers that cram airport bookstores. But
in the Eng. Lit. 101 debate around Rowling, the question leads
straight into the issue of where Harry Potter fits in the canon of
children's literature _ or at least of children's literature with a
sufficiently large adult audience to stir a largely adult debate.
</P>
<P>
   This, oddly enough, is an area where the lines blur. Some voices
are utterly dismissive. Even before ``Goblet of Fire'' was
published, Anthony Holden, a judge for Britain's highly regarded
Whitbread Award, went public with his reasons for opposing the
nomination of the third Harry Potter book, ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban,'' for the prize. Referring to what he saw as
its direct antecedent in the literature of British boarding-school
life, he called the Potter books ``a tedious, clunkily written
version of Billy Bunter on broomsticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics, like Jeff Baker, a book critic for The Portland
Oregonian, are prepared to concede that the books are ``well
written and extremely imaginative'' but echo the view that Harry
Potter is not yet assured of a place in the annals of great
children's literature. ``J.K. Rowling is a fine stylist and a
clever fantasist,'' he wrote, ``but she is no J.R.R. Tolkien. `The
Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings' are more exciting and, frankly,
more beautiful than the Potter series, and C.S. Lewis' amazing `The
Chronicles of Narnia' series, which Rowling often cites as an
influence, is more poetic and fully formed.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does all this leave Rowling? What do the critics see as
her place in the history of English literature?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the idea of an author producing work by installments, a
technique that drives the annual frenzy of choreographed
anticipation at the heart of the Potter marketing strategy, is not
new: Charles Dickens did the same in the 19th century with such
effect, Baker says, that 6,000 New Yorkers lined the docks in 1841
to await the final installment of ``The Old Curiosity Shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rowling is very much a phenomenon of this century, and in
the counterview her work is in the same league as the other
fleeting shadows of an insubstantial, market- and
celebrity-oriented era. ``Potter is one with the weekend
megamovies, pop stars, sitcoms and reality TV,'' said Rex Murphy in
The Globe and Mail of Canada, ``and belongs to the same machine
that feeds their crass, short, forgettable lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rowling's vaunted triumph in bringing children back to the
printed word has not escaped criticism, with the naysayers arguing
that her success is driving out other novelists. In The Times of
London, Marina Warner, who has written frequently about fairy
tales, evoked a string of other writers who have also
``re-enchanted the landscape.'' And Tom Kemp, musing in The Daily
Telegraph on the all-absorbing fascination Rowling has for so many
children, said it ``would be nice if she left them time to read
other authors as well.''

GOOD REASONS NOT TO FORWARD THAT HEART-WRENCHING E-MAIL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By J.R. LABBE 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humans are the most gullible creatures on the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking your dog kind of gullible _ you know, you
pretend to throw the ball and then hide it behind your back while
Rambo searches the backyard for something that isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm talking the ``I believe everything I see in print''
gullible that prompts otherwise intelligent people to believe some
of the garbage that gets circulated on the Internet as truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since I first wrote about the Postal Service e-mail
tax and the ``Janet Reno thinks Christians are cultists'' Net
hoaxes, people who profess to be die-hard daily readers of the
paper continue to forward both e-mails to me, with attached
messages that express their outrage at the disdain that the federal
government shows for the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   But there have also been the readers who provided solid reasons
why it is a terrible idea to pass along any of the e-chain types of
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mazy of Florida, a veteran who served with the 2nd Battalion
4th Marines, suggests that Net hoaxes and dozens of other ``please
forward to as many people as you can'' e-mails start as a scam by
people who collect active e-mail addresses so ``they can compile
page after countless page of addresses to sell to the mailing list
companies so that they in turn can flood your mailbox with all of
their unwanted mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you respond to a `Remove' from an e-mail, all you're
doing is assuring the fact that you will be receiving even more
junk mail. The sender will stop sending you his'' _ er, remember,
Jim's a Marine, so I must judiciously edit the adjective inserted
here _ ``mail, but he also takes the address (the one you just
proved to him is current) and sells it to other junk e-mailers. The
cycle continues over and over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Tow from Richland, Wash., cautions about the sob stories
that call for folks to forward chain letters to countless friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most ask only that the recipient forward them to `all your
friends' or `at least ten friends.' They seem to circulate forever,
even though most of these heart-rending stories are not true. The
one about the little girl in the wheelchair, alone in the park,
with the sad look on her face, is full of logical flaws, but used
to cycle through my inbox every other month.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the harm in this, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage they do is to fill the e-mail servers and inboxes
with e-junk and, because most people use `Forward,' they create
huge lists of valid e-mail addresses that can be misused by the
unscrupulous,'' Tow wrote. ``I believe chain letters are money in
the pockets of those who gather and sell lists of valid e-mail
addresses to spammers and others who send unsolicited commercial
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Unsel, a local buddy of mine, suggested that folks should
add the ``Urban Legend Combat Kit'' Web site to their handy list of
electronic bookmarks if they have any doubts about the validity of
an e-mail claim.
</P>
<P>
   The site is terrific fun. It breaks down the hoaxes by category:
new legends (Are people putting HIV-infected needles in gas pump
handles?); old urban legends and myths (our old Postal Service
friend Bill 602P is here, along with Madalyn Murray O'Hair trying
to ban religious programming on TV and the lapse of
African-American voting rights in 2007); and a ``Forward an Email
to All of Your Friends and Something Great Will Happen'' list.
</P>
<P>
   You can find 'em all at www.netsquirrel.com/combatkit _ the
promises of free beer, candy, computers, cars, CDs, soda and gift
certificates, all for the click of that Forward button.
</P>
<P>
   Tow advises that the best way to stop spam is to just erase it
as it comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person doesn't respond within two or three e-mails, the
spammer usually removes your address for you. He figures he's just
wasting his time e-mailing you and moves on to an even fresher set
of addresses that he just purchased from the guy that everyone
responded to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullible has its dark side, Mazy cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are too ready to fill out every line of every form they
receive on the Internet, giving out valuable private information as
to who they are and their lifestyle; then they sit back and
complain about the spam they are deluged with daily.''
</P>
<P>
   You may be signing away something that's worth a lot more than a
free case of M&AMP;M candy.

&HT;     REEVES SAVES HIS TALENT FOR THE NEXT `MATRIX' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fear of being tagged stupid has gone to Keanu Reeves' head.
``The Replacements'' has him playing the smartest guy in the locker
room _ and the distinction is the only nuance in the film.
</P>
<P>
   The way-mellow one has surrounded himself with the dumbest
people ever assembled for a sports movie. Reeves plays quarterback
to the police-lineup of stereotypes and grotesques who've been
hired to play football in the midst of a midseason players'
walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he's saddled with little to say, so that when he does
dare speak, his words pass for Zen nuggets. Though the script fails
to come up with anything for Reeves to say as brilliant as
``Ex-cellent!'' or ``Whoooa. . .,'' his curt QB wisdom is like
frat-house haiku. Here's one from the huddle during the big game:
``Pain heals. Chicks dig scars. Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   What drove a post-``Matrix'' Reeves into the arms of ``The
Replacements'' is none of our business. But judging from the way
that baseball cap is pulled down over his face during the jailhouse
electric-slide sequence, suggesting a dance double, he can't be
happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   His every pout is a plea with us for commiseration. Even the
busty, wholesome cheerleader (Brooke Langton), who's been put on
love-interest duty, is zipless. Bully for the writhing strippers
who've been recruited as scabs for the striking cheerleaders; it's
the only move that gets busted properly during the entire affair.
Is this the satire the film's been after? It should have tried
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Vince McKewin's muse seems to have been other bad sports
films and his favorite beer ads. There are no signs of having lived
or loved or even scored a satisfying victory at tiddlywinks, let
alone tackle football. An angle on the tragi-comedy that is the NFL
surfaces only as an endurance contest: How many times you can
listen to ``Taking Care of Business'' or Gary Glitter's ``Rock and
Roll Part 2'' without climbing the walls? How do you respect a film
whose idea of Jock Jam is ``I Will Survive''? The film should
simply be thrown to ``Sports Center'' anchor Stuart Scott and Rich
Eisen and left for the carcass it is.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, scads of familiar faces milk their greatest hit for a
canned laugh: Orlando Jones (the ``7-Up Yours'' pitchman), rabid
Jon Favreau (doing his most devastating Jeremy Piven) and Rhys
Ifans (the grimy, gangly pig of ``Notting Hill''). There's also a
deaf fellow, a born-again Christian, a sumo-size Japanese guy and
some gangsters tossed in for desperate measure. And as long as
director Howard Deutch indulges them, the film is like two hours of
outtakes in search of a studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has no idea what to look at, and the editing is
supremely patchy. In the way of wisdom, the film has Gene Hackman
as the scab-team's coach _ although he's here sandwiched between
Reeves and crusty team owner Jack Warden: how wise could he be? Not
even the big QB-cheerleader love-touchdown makes an impact. While
Reeves and Langton look deep through each other, Deutch makes The
Police's ``Every Breath You Take'' do all the heavy-lifting,
cross-cutting a kiss with game footage of John Madden and Pat
Summerall going nuts about Reeves taking the ball into the end
zone. You want to take the whole thing out to the parking lot and
shoot it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' is vaguely based on the '87 players' strike
but is being touted as a football tribute to the underdog baseball
comedy ``Major League,'' which, as role models go, is highly
suspect. But even in its extreme dimness, that film glimpsed a
pro-sport satire. ``The Replacements'' thinks comedy and
liquidating racial tension is achieved by line-dancing to ``I Will
Survive,'' a song performed only in movies standing in the welfare
lines. Keanu seems to have left the dancing and the running and the
throwing and the acting to his stunt man, getting top dollar for
mercifully minimal output, conserving himself for ``The Matrix''
sequels. OK, maybe he is the smartest guy in the locker room.

<P>
   If you live in the Northeast or Upper Midwest, you may be
shopping for an ark. Who can think of convertibles when gray skies
seem to bring showers almost daily?
</P>
<P>
   But the long-range forecast calls for sunshine _ someday _ and
when it comes, a drop-top car will seem all the sweeter. And when
it comes to convertibles, the choices have rarely been better, with
several new cars out now. Here are models from major manufacturers
priced at $150,000 or less:
</P>
<P>
   ASTON MARTIN DB7 VANTAGE VOLANTE
</P>
<P>
   $150,000; 420-horsepower V-12; rear drive; 4 seats; power top;
glass rear window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The styling is beautiful and the V-12 power is impressive, but
the DB7's real draw is the Aston Martin nameplate, which guarantees
exclusivity almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ACURA NSX-T
</P>
<P>
   $88,745; V-6 (252 or 290 h.p.) rear drive; 2 seats; removable
roof panels.
</P>
<P>
   An exotic, distinctively styled supercar with Honda quality and
durability, this midengine, race-inspired rocket is unlikely to
leave you stranded.
</P>
<P>
   AUDI TT ROADSTER
</P>
<P>
   $33,750, 180-h.p. 4, front drive and manual top; $39,450,
225-h.p. turbo 4, all-wheel drive, power top, glass window. Four
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is there a cooler-looking car on the road than the TT coupe?
Well, there's the 2001 TT roadster. Truly an all-season car, it is
the only medium-priced convertible available with all-wheel drive
for winter snows.
</P>
<P>
   BMW 323Ci
</P>
<P>
   $35,560; 170-h.p. 6; rear drive; 4 seats; manual top; plastic
window; power top optional. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, the 3-Series sedans were remade, then the coupes. This
year, the convertible got a new platform, but it kept its great
road manners. Other engines are coming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW Z3
</P>
<P>
   $31,870 with 170 h.p. 6; $37,470 with 193-h.p. 6; rear drive; 2
seats; manual top; plastic window (power top optional).
</P>
<P>
   BMW M ROADSTER
</P>
<P>
   $43,270; 240-h.p. 6; rear drive; 2 seats; power top; plastic
window.
</P>
<P>
   A high-performance version of the sporty Z3, this pocket rocket
can be highly entertaining in the hands of a skilled driver.
</P>
<P>
   BMW Z8
</P>
<P>
   $128,700 with 94-h.p. V-8; rear drive; 2 seats; power top; glass
window.
</P>
<P>
   James Bond already had a turn at the wheel of this
limited-production roadster with 50's overtones, but it will be an
unattainable dream for most people.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET CAMARO
</P>
<P>
   $24,915, 200-h.p. V-6; $29,290, 305-h.p. V-8; rear drive; 4
seats; power top; rear glass.
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC FIREBIRD
</P>
<P>
   $25,785, 200-h.p. V-6; $31,525, 305-h.p. V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Camaro and Firebird fans should get 'em while they can. After 33
years in GM's lineup, they are likely to disappear, in their
current form, in 2002. They're still relative bargains, though
insurance can be costly.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET CAVALIER Z24
</P>
<P>
   $20,350; 150-h.p. 4; front drive; 4 seats; power top; glass
window.
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC SUNFIRE GT
</P>
<P>
   $22,265; 150-h.p. 4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most affordable softtops around, the Cavalier and
Sunfire come with a long list of standard equipment, including
antilock brakes and traction control.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET CORVETTE
</P>
<P>
   $46,350; 345-h.p. V-8; rear drive; 2 seats; power top; glass
window.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of the Corvette, an American icon since 1953,
keeps the character of past classics but improves on their
weaknesses. It is now easy to climb in and out, and the trunk can
carry two sets of golf clubs. For 2001, horsepower rises to 350.
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER SEBRING
</P>
<P>
   2000 model: $25,070; 168-h.p. V-6; front drive; 4 seats; power
top; glass window.
</P>
<P>
   Practical and relatively affordable, with a back seat that
adults can actually use, the Sebring has been the nation's
best-selling convertible for good reason. For 2001, an all-new
Sebring comes with a 200-horse V-6.
</P>
<P>
   DODGE VIPER R/T10 ROADSTER  &QL; 
$67,950; 450-h.p. V-10; rear drive; 2 seats; manual top. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Viper as a raucous street-legal race car. A new
sport package for weekend warriors trades amenities and weight for
10 more horsepower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORD MUSTANG
</P>
<P>
   $22,135 (190-h.p. V-6); GT $26,035 (260-h.p. V-8); Cobra $32,370
(385-h.p. V-8); rear drive; 4 seats; power top; glass window.
</P>
<P>
   Ford celebrated the Mustang's 35th anniversary in 1999 with a
redesign that gave the pony car sharper lines and some retro
styling touches. A total remake is due in 2002, with a shift to the
Lincoln LS platform.
</P>
<P>
   HONDA S2000
</P>
<P>
   $32,440; 240-h.p. 4; rear drive; 2 seats; power top; plastic
window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel like Mario Andretti as you goose the high-revving
engine and quickly run through the short throws of the six-speed
manual transmission. But the purity of the racecar design also
results in a stiff ride, lots of noise and few amenities.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUAR XK SERIES
</P>
<P>
   $71,795 (XK8, 290-h.p. V8); $82,395 (XKR, 370-h.p. supercharged
V-8); rear drive; 4 seats; power top; glass window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Already a raving beauty with sumptuous accommodations and
powerful engines, a Silverstone edition due later this year will
give the XK even more power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAZDA MIATA
</P>
<P>
   $20,995; 140-h.p. 4; rear drive; 2 seats; manual top; glass
window.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda started the roadster revival a decade ago with this car.
Despite an onslaught of new rivals, the perky Miata still delivers
the most smiles for the money.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ CLK-CLASS
</P>
<P>
   $48,745, 215-h.p. V-6; $56,245, 275-h.p. V-8; rear drive; 4
seats; power top; rear glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the trunk space is skimpy for a car of this size, the CLK
offers solid, classy, luxurious open-air motoring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ SL-CLASS  &QL; 
$83,245, 302-h.p. V-8; $129,595, 389-h.p. V-12; rear drive; 2
seats; power top; plastic window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The SL, competing in the stratosphere of luxury roadsters, has
worn the same basic body since 1990. A new one is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE SPYDER  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   $23,842, 154-h.p. 4; $25,732, 205-h.p. V-6; front drive; 4
seats; power top; plastic window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``geo-mechanical'' styling of the Spyder, introduced as an
'01 model last spring, has arcing lines, hard edges and ribbed
panels. There is no longer an all-wheel-drive option. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH PROWLER
</P>
<P>
   $43,725; 253-h.p. V-6; rear drive; 2 seats; manual top; glass
window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the Plymouth brand doomed, this caricature of a 1950's hot
rod will become the Chrysler Prowler in a couple of years. The
car's cartoonish appearance is a lot more fun than its
performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE BOXSTER
</P>
<P>
   $42,195, 217-h.p. 6 6; $50,695, 250-h.p. 6 rear drive; 2 seats;
power top; plastic window.
</P>
<P>
   New this year, an S model adds a more powerful engine to the
many charms of this midengine sports car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE 911 CARRERA  &QL; 
$75,735; $81,165 with all-wheel drive; 300-h.p. 6; 4 seats: power
top; plastic window.
</P>
<P>
   Many enthusiasts consider the 911 the epitome of sports cars.
The classic look remains even afte a total redesign.
</P>
<P>
   SAAB 9-3  &QL; 
$40,300, 185-h.p. turbo 4; $43,825 SE, 205-h.p. turbo 4; $45,570
Viggen, 230-h.p. turbo 4; 4 seats; power top; glass window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The name has changed from the 900 to the 9-3 in recent years,
and engines were updated. Yet the basic structure is the same, and
it feels dated.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA CAMRY SOLARA  &QL; 
$25,523; 135-h.p. 4; front drive; 4 seats; power top; glass window.
</P>
<P>
   Based on America's best-selling sedan, the Solara convertible is
quiet, smooth and nicely finished, but don't expect sports car
handling on curvy roads.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA MR2 SPYDER
</P>
<P>
   $23,553; 138-h.p. 4; rear drive; 2 seats; manual top; glass
window.
</P>
<P>
   A midengine design makes the new MR2 a great-handling roadster,
but results in a near-total lack of storage. Unless you travel
solo, the Miata is more practical.
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN CABRIO  &QL; 
$20,515 (GL, manual top), $23,825 (GLS, power top with glass
window); 115-h.p. 4; front drive; 4 seats.
</P>
<P>
   If you want an affordable convertible with European handling,
this is your only choice.
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO C70
</P>
<P>
   $44,075, 190-h.p. 5; $46,075, 236-h.p. 5; front drive; 4 seats;
power top; glass window.
</P>
<P>
   The first Volvo to break out of the company's styling box, the
C70 looks more impressive than it drives. Compared with rock-solid
convertibles from some European manufacturers, the C70's structure
can be shaky and its drivetrain feels coarse. &QL;

THE HONORS LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 13, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know it is August when the lead story in the news _ not the
business page but the morning radio news _ is a tire recall.
</P>
<P>
   Granted that Ford and Firestone should have known there was a
problem with sport utility vehicle tires that sometimes
disintegrated at highway speeds. Some 46 deaths may have resulted
in the 10 years since the Ford Explorer was introduced. The anatomy
of industrial error is always interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the second-biggest tire recall in history (at 6.5 million
tires, it is fewer than half the 14.5 Firestone radials replaced in
1978) is the kind of story that usually dominates the headlines in
August, along with ``Eli Lilly Suffers Prozac Blow,'' not to
mention ``War in Chad, Not Many Killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, political and technological tides run deep even in
the still of summer. Their effects were to be glimpsed momentarily
last week when the Clinton administration called John Kenneth
Galbraith to Washington to receive the Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, 91, was the oldest of the 15 people honored Wednesday
at the White House for their ``devotion to freedom and its
expansion.'' The presidential medal dates from the administration
of John F. Kennedy. It is the nation's highest civilian award.
</P>
<P>
   The composition was about what you would expect in Bill
Clinton's last honors list _ a wholehearted salute to the social
activist movement in which the president grew up. Included were
George McGovern (Food for Peace), Jesse Jackson (Project Share),
and Marian Wright Edelman (Children's Defense Fund).
</P>
<P>
   Also honored were women's labor activist Mildred McWilliams
Jeffrey, worker advocate Monsignor George G. Higgins of Washington,
immigrant rights advocate Cruz Reynoso of California, and the Rev.
Gardner Calvin Taylor of New York. Others were retired General
Wesley K. Clark, retired Admiral William Crowe, retired Johnson &AMP;
Johnson chief executive and antidrug activist Jim Burke, and AIDS
researcher and educator Mathilde Krim.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the list were Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of
New York, the late Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island (whose widow
accepted the award) and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal (who did not
attend). None of them can ordinarily expect to be celebrated in the
business pages. Yet all of them are properly understood as being
entrepreneurs, and all have contributed directly to economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith was the only one of the 15 of whom it can be said
confidently that his influence will continue long into the 21st
century. The reasons are simple. He is a writer and he has filled
an important gap. He has been the chief critic of the dominant
tendencies of modern economics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 62 years since his first book _ ``Modern Competition and
Business Policy,'' with H. S. Dennison _ a steady flow of essays,
novels, histories, criticism, journals, tracts, letters, and
autobiographical writings have issued from his writing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In steadiness of output he resembles one of his heroes, the
novelist Anthony Trollope, of whom it was said that, if he
completed a book during a morning writing session, he would place a
blank sheet of paper before him on the writing desk and begin the
next novel, continuing to write until the allotted time was up.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes speaking for a variety of other economists who for one
reason or another could no longer speak for themselves, other times
speaking for those who had no voice, the world's poor, Galbraith
wove a coherent and complete vision of the great evolving apparatus
of global production and consumption. Often his account was quite
at odds with the version being taught in the principles of
economics course across the way at Harvard, where he was professor
for 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   John Maynard Keynes, Joseph Schumpeter, and Allyn Young had
died. Edward Chamberlin and Joan Robinson were caught up in a vain
attempt to persuade other economists of the significance of
imperfect competition. Thorstein Veblen was all but forgotten. It
was Galbraith who, in books like the ``The Great Crash'' and ``The
New Industrial State,'' depicted an economic order in which
powerful forces contended for dominance and ``consumer
sovereignty'' was more a metaphor than a fact.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one book more than any other for which
Galbraith will be remembered. ``The Affluent Society'' was
published first in 1958, and received new editions in 1969, 1976,
1984, and 1998. ``To furnish a barren room is one thing,'' it
concludes. ``To continue to crowd in furniture until the foundation
buckles is quite another.'' The book is an eloquent brief for more
public investment: in education, the amelioration of poverty and
inequality, environmental quality, preservation, and other
significant human capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to mock the wrong predictions _ although
generalizations that may have seemed wrong in one decade have a
mysterious way of seeming right again the next. In general,
Galbraith greatly underestimated the scope and scale and durability
of the market revival. He overestimated the capacity of a
bureaucratic elite to smoothly administer economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is impossible to mistake his deep insight into the
militarily-driven, technologically-hyperactive economy that has
emerged in the years since World War II. Businessmen always were
among his fans. If he couldn't keep up with all the willy-nilly
changes of the '80s and '90s, he nevertheless provided a durable
map of where to look to find the really important stories of the
day: the burgeoning consumerism, the increasing inequalities among
the labor force, and even the patent disputes and the tire recalls
that are the stuff of news in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many economists have enlisted in an effort to
``get Galbraith right'' _ or Schumpeter, or Veblen, or Chamberlin.
And, indeed, new tools are being forged all the time with which to
discuss the frictions, assymetries and inequalities which Galbraith
insisted were the essence of the process. Instead of ``The Great
Crash,'' we get behavioral finance. More power to the scientists in
their quest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is worth remembering that Galbraith all along has been
not a scientist but a humanist. He is committed as few others to
seeing things whole.

<P>
   It's the next-to-the last week of the most popular TV show of
the millennium so far. ``Survivor,'' airing at 8 on CBS, has blown
ABC's ``Millionaire'' out of the top spot in the ratings and become
a true phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Only five castaways are left on the island as tonight's
installment begins: Sean, Kelly, Rudy, Richard and Susan. Since the
last four have voted as a bloc almost straight through, you might
expect Sean to be the next to go. But Kelly's loyalty to the
alliance has come under doubt, so she may be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   And if the million-dollar pot of gold at the end of this twisted
rainbow isn't enough, the prize in tonight's reward challenge is
some cold beer, which sounds pretty enticing after 30-odd days on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is followed at 9 on CBS by the execrable ``Big
Brother.'' Unless you're really a connoisseur of awful television,
you might want to skip that and switch to Fox for ``American
High,'' which is a cinema verite documentary set in a suburban
Chicago high school. Real kids, real problems, and some compelling
video _ this may be Fox's way of jumping on the reality-TV
bandwagon, but it's an honorable effort, which is more than we can
say for the appalling ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democratic convention: Vice presidential nominee designate
Joseph Lieberman should speak tonight. You can watch on PBS from
7:00 p.m.-closing, or on ABC, CBS or NBC from 10:00-11:00 p.m.
Cable networks CNN, C-SPAN, MSNBC and Fox News will air hours of
coverage and pundit blathering. And Comedy Central will have
``Indecision 2000'' coverage at 11 on ``The Daily Show.'' From Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill,'' Fox at 8: A father and son shooting
contest threatens to expose Hank's poor marksmanship, while Bobby
turns out to be an ace. Rerun.
</P>

 &HT;    EPA'S COMPUTERS EASY PREY TO HACKERS, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
information systems have been ``riddled with security weaknesses''
that allowed frequent intrusions by foreign and domestic computer
hackers, a government study warns.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, the bipartisan investigative
arm of Congress, reported Friday that it found more than two-dozen
instances in which the EPA's database was compromised or misused.
</P>
<P>
   In July of last year, for example, a group of hackers set up a
``chat room'' on an EPA network server to conduct on-line
conversations. In another case, the EPA failed to notice a
sophisticated penetration of three agency computers until it was
notified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At risk is the nation's chief repository of environmental
information. The EPA keeps records on health and safety assessments
and private businesses, as well as data on contracting and
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers skilled enough to bypass the security can access much of
this information through the Internet, where it is then subject to
disruption, fraud and improper disclosure, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer security risks are significant, and they are
growing,'' said the congressional investigating office, which put
the EPA on a list of 22 federal agencies which have lax database
security.
</P>
<P>
   After preliminary findings of such security lapses last
February, the EPA shut down its computer network temporarily for an
overhaul. Congressional investigators said they have not yet
assessed the modifications.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office noted that most of the serious problems
had been identified by the agency's own inspector general first in
1997 and again in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings drew a sharp critique from House Commerce
chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's ``cyber-security policy amounts to
little more than paper pushing,'' said Bliley, who had requested
the audit of EPA and is now seeking similar investigations of the
Food and Drug Administration and the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   In its response to the security audit, the EPA's deputy
administrator Margaret N. Schneider said that the agency had
accelerated plans to erect a ``firewall'' to protect sensitive data
and has begun to implement ``aggressive, corrective responses'' to
remedy the security problems.

 ON THE PATH TO CREATE A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gregory Javan Mills is talking about the collection
he has spent 20 years assembling: 5,000 films starring black actors
or made by black producers and directors. There is ``Tamango,''
with Dorothy Dandridge as a slave who has a love affair with her
master. There is ``Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads,'' an
early film by Spike Lee. There is ``Harlem Rides the Range,'' an
all-black western from the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the prized possessions in Mills' collection at the
New York State Black Film Archive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call them possessions,'' he stammers, then begs,
``You have to phrase it another way.''
</P>
<P>
   He is sitting in a film and video classroom in the Adam Clayton
Powell State Office Building on 125th Street in Harlem. A Bell &AMP;
Howell projector so old that it looks like an antique refrigerator,
with a door that flaps open if it is not latched, sits on a coffee
table. The machine was built for the military, it turns out. But it
is not his prized possession. Finally, Mills decides that his
prized possession is ``the ability to steer this organization on
the right path.''
</P>
<P>
   And there it is: Unreconstituted art-speak, or rather, arts
administrator-speak, that falls so easily from the tongues of the
type of executive director whose job includes running the projector
and making the popcorn. Mills talks as if he is writing a grant, or
perhaps has written too many: Careful, measured and heavy on what
some might call truisms. ``There's always room for improvement,''
he says after being asked if things are better for black artists
now than in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   At the Harlem Week 2000 Black Film Festival, which ends on
Sunday, Mills is showing films that have not been screened in half
a century or more. They are drawn from his archive, which he
describes as the largest collection of black films. Mills' films
are stored in the basement of the office building and in other
places, including his apartment, the studio in Harlem where he has
lived, alone, since he moved to Manhattan in the 1970s. ``I'm like
Duke Ellington: This is what I do, this is my family. Duke
Ellington said, `Music is my mistress.'''
</P>
<P>
   But collecting movies was an ordeal at first. In the early
1980s, Mills would set up a table outside the New York Public
Library, offering information about his organization. The idea was,
once people came up to the table, they would slip some change into
the donation jar. He ended up with more than money. He met film
collectors from Brooklyn, who provided the reels for the first
Black Film Festival, in 1985. The collaboration was, in Mills'
terms, ``an opportunity to bring Manhattan and Brooklyn together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the collectors did not volunteer to help him build a
collection. ``I would say, `How do you get this stuff?' They would
say, `We got the connections.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, 48, did not start off with much of an interest in film,
although as a child in Winston-Salem, N.C., he loved Bette Davis.
And he remembers overhearing his mother, a public-school dietitian,
talk about Dorothy Dandridge's death (in 1965, at 42, of an
overdose of prescription drugs). His father worked on cars. ``I
don't think I wanted to work in the cafeteria or be a mechanic,''
he says, ``so I became an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   A painter, to be specific. He spent a few years in the Air Force
(his ``Peter Max period,'' he calls it; he painted a psychedelic
mural for the noncommissioned officers' club at Ellsworth Air Force
Base in South Dakota). Then, thanks to the GI Bill, he moved to New
York and enrolled at the School of Visual Arts. He still quotes
Oscar Wilde and Jimi Hendrix like an ardent student.
</P>
<P>
   Here is something he says the professors did not teach him at
the school: In the 1970s, New York galleries would not show ``black
art,'' and that included abstract paintings by a black artist,
namely, him. Here is something they did teach him there: Artists
start schools of thought, like Bauhaus, the Ash Can School and
Dada. So, at school, he decided to start a ``school of thought for
artists of color.'' One of his first projects was to help a fellow
student whose photographs of children playing in Harlem had been
declared ``unaesthetic'' at Visual Arts. His letters of protest led
the administration to reconsider, and the student got the degree
that had been hanging in the balance. A panel discussion on race
and the arts, the first of many, followed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Mills saw a public television segment on
Oscar Micheaux, who made films in the early '20s and '30s about
black life and who was nicknamed the Midnight Rambler because he
often rented white movie theaters after midnight to show his films.
Mills knew nothing about the man.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way of things. Know nothing, start a film festival.
Fortunately, Mills and Ernest Steele, who became the archivist,
found _ without the help of the Brooklyn collectors _ the Donnell
Library Center in Midtown Manhattan, which houses the city's film
archives. They spent days researching distributors and collectors
and building a network of people who would alert them when rare
prints came on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, worried that the recession was hurting support of
the arts in Harlem, he considered quitting. ``I thought, `Let's
have an auction, sell off everything, everyone go back to their
first love.''' Then another grant came through, and changed his
mind.

 &HT;    Buying a good used PC might not be a bad idea
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I bought a used car last week. I can remember years
ago when it was routine to buy a brand new car every two or three
years. It was part of the American tradition just as much as
hand-cranked ice cream and Sunday afternoons spent on the front
porch.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a front porch anymore, most of my friends would run
in panic at the thought of cranking an ice cream freezer on a 90
degree day, and I no longer buy new cars. I'm not alone.
Reconditioned used cars are becoming more and more popular as new
car prices cross the border between foolish and insane.
</P>
<P>
   The same market shift is coming to the PC world. Buying a new
machine will no longer be the automatic first choice.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's already happening. There have been some really
important changes lately _ including a slowdown in the growth of
the new PC market.
</P>
<P>
   But, more important than that, hardware has finally outdistanced
software. In the past, you almost had to buy a new and more
powerful computer every couple of years just to run the new
software. Computer programs once grew in complexity so fast that
you needed a super PC just to run ordinary programs such as word
processors and Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, even a 350 megahertz Pentium machine can handle almost
everything (games excluded) that a home user might want to tackle.
And a 500 megahertz machine is just about right. Given that, a used
computer is a real bargain. Besides, buying a used computer makes
even more sense than buying a used car.
</P>
<P>
   With a car, there are many parts that literally wear out.
Cylinders lose compression, normal wear and tear slowly destroys
transmissions and differentials, and even the interior of a car
slowly deteriorates. But in a computer _ other than the disk
drives, power supply, cooling fan and switches _ all the parts are
solid state electronics and, with ordinary care, these parts can
and should last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   For most novices, it's probably smart to buy from one of the
retailers that specialize in used computers. That way you will get
a warranty and also the assurance that someone has looked the
machine over to make sure that it's in good working order. (If you
know a lot about computers you will feel easy negotiating with an
individual and you'll probably get a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   But my assumption is that if you know a lot about computers, you
don't need my help in picking out a used machine).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I would recommend for novices at the used computer
store.
</P>
<P>
   1. Find a place that has been in business for at least a year or
so. The marketplace _ long-term _ tends to filter out incompetents
and crooks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pay close attention to the store's return and warranty
policy. And remember that _ as a practical (not legal) matter _
that only a written return and warranty policy has any value to
you. So make sure, if you buy a machine, that you leave with a
written statement not just a spoken promise.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stick to brand-name machines when you buy used. Some
off-brands are every bit as good as the name brands. But, when
buying used, it just makes sense to get the extra security of a
brand name. Besides, if you need service or advice, you are more
likely to be able to find someone who is familar with the quirks of
a well-known brand.
</P>
<P>
   4. Before you walk into the store make sure that you know the
selling price for equivalent new machines. That's the only way that
you'll be able to judge whether the price for the used machine is
fair. If, for instance, you can only save $100 or so by buying a
used PC, you're much better off with the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   5. While you may well get excellent advice at the store, it's a
good idea to get some independent help on what type of machine you
need before going in. Otherwise, you'll be in danger from a
fast-talking salesman who may try to convince you that a
too-powerful, or not-powerful-enough machine is right for you.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, look for a good used machine with a Pentium
500 megazhertz chip or better at the used computer store at a
substantial savings over what you'd pay for a new brand-name
machine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the market for a PC, I think it'll be worth your
time to take a look at the used machines.

 &HT;    PEREIRA, Colombia _ Distinctive dark-green coffee bushes still
carpet the steep slopes around Pereira, a city of 400,000 people at
the heart of Colombia's coffee-growing district. But as Ciro Medina
drives to Finca Tasmania, his coffee farm on the edge of town, he
points to patches of grass and the occasional banana palm on the
hillsides. ``Those are all abandoned coffee farms,'' he says.
 &HT;    Such sights are increasingly common throughout the department of
Risaralda, where Pereira is the capital, as well as throughout the
neighboring departments of Caldas and Quindio. These three
provinces, known simply as the ``Zona Cafetera,'' produce more than
a quarter of the country's vital coffee crop. The abandoned fincas,
or farms, illustrate an industry ground down by depressed world
prices, rising costs, crop diseases and fierce global competition.
Even weather and natural disaster have conspired against Colombia's
growers: Last year, a powerful earthquake wrecked homes and
infrastructure.
 &HT;    Times have been correspondingly tough on Fedecafe, the national
coffee growers' federation and the most powerful player in
Colombia's coffee industry. It has been forced to sell many
businesses and turned Bancafe, one of the country's biggest banks,
over to the government after severe losses. Its ability to invest
in the industry while maintaining its system of price supports to
growers has eroded.
 &HT;    Even despite such problems, few growers were prepared for the
news that Colombia may need to import coffee soon to cover domestic
consumption _ probably in 2001. After bad weather, production this
year is expected to be the lowest on record: around 9 million
60-kilogram sacks, versus an average of 12 million to 13 million
sacks last year.
 &HT;    For a country that has been exporting coffee since 1835 and
claims to produce the finest-quality beans of any major producer,
such a state of affairs is a body blow. ``It affects our pride to
say that we are going to bring in bad coffee for us to drink,''
Medina complains. A little bit south of Pereira, on the porch of
the small cottage he built 20 years ago next to his tiny plot of
land, Octavio Bonilla talks pessimistically of the industry that
has been his life. ``Everything goes up except the coffee,'' he
complains.
 &HT;    Bonilla was born only a few yards from here 65 years ago; his
grandfather was the first to plant coffee in these parts. But now
he is fed up with his tiny yields and the rising costs of
pesticides and fertilizers. He is thinking of replacing half of his
coffee trees with cacao and bananas. ``I never thought that would
happen,'' he says. ``It seems that the coffee grower will
disappear, little by little.''
 &HT;    In hindsight, Colombia's problems began a decade ago with the
end of the global coffee quota system. In the early 1990s, Colombia
claimed nearly 22 percent of the world market. It remains the
world's second-largest producer after Brazil.
 &HT;    But while quality is good, production costs are correspondingly
high, and cheaper, more aggressive producing nations such as
Vietnam have begun to gobble market share. Without globally
organized retention schemes to hold back increasing production,
market prices have _ aside from occasional weather-induced spikes _
slumped.
 &HT;    Recent efforts to revive the quota-driven retention schemes may
buoy prices, but will do little to help prevent imports. The
problem, according to Ricardo Avellaneda, an adviser to Fedecafe,
stems from the running down of the federation's stockpiles of
cheaper, non-export quality coffee. Previously, Colombia's coffee
roasters could buy reserves of this coffee at subsidized prices.
But with these inventories likely to be exhausted soon, coffee
roasters will likely turn to cheap imports, perhaps from Ecuador,
Peru or Central America, rather than pay more for unsubsidized
Colombian coffee.
 &HT;    ``It is not that there is no coffee _ just that there is no
cheap coffee,'' Avellaneda says. ``And there is not going to be any
in the future unless the producers or the government subsidizes it
_ which they do not want to do.''
 &HT;    So far, though, producers have failed to receive or understand
that message. ``Imports are not justified,'' says Medina, who
contends that imports are for the benefit of the roasters, not the
growers.
 &HT;    However touchy the subject of imports, it is just the tip of the
iceberg as far as the growers' problems are concerned. All agree
that the biggest factor affecting the industry is the low market
price. The 30 percent to 40 percent price decline through the first
four months of the year means making a living is ever harder for
the country's 570,000 families who depend directly on the crop.
 &HT;    Medina, a civil engineer who went into coffee as a sideline 26
years ago, says his engineering work makes it possible to keep his
30-hectare finca. Life is even tougher for small growers like
Bonilla, who make up the bulk of Colombia's growers (95 percent
have fewer than 10 hectares). ``It is only profitable for the
biggest and those who use the most technology,'' Medina says. ``For
the little guys, it is impossible.''
 &HT;    Weeding small farmers. Hence Pereira's abandoned farms, a
phenomenon that is bringing more migration to urban centers and
increasing social pressures and tensions. Other growers have found
a standby in welcoming tourists to their picturesque farms.
 &HT;    Owners of small farms, like Bonilla, complain about the lack of
credit and the impenetrable bureaucracy. ``I went to the
agricultural bank, but they demand so much paperwork, I gave up
insisting,'' he says.
 &HT;    With the future not looking too bright for such small growers,
the face of the Zona Cafetera is likely to change further. At
Fedecafe, Avellaneda insists only the most efficient producers can
survive. The land under cultivation has fallen from more than 1
million hectares to around 800,000 hectares in recent years, he
says, yet Colombia has 20 percent more coffee bushes. ``If we had
the same productivity as Costa Rica, we would have 565,000
hectares,'' he says. ``This is the same evolution that is taking
place in agriculture all over the world. There used to be 6 million
farms in the U.S. Now there are 2 million.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, given Fedecafe's guiding role in the industry,
criticism of its leadership has mounted. A rival organization
called National Coffee Unity has won supporters like Bonilla and
has staged protest marches. But Medina praises Fedecafe's technical
assistance and commercial campaigns _ its Juan Valdez figure is an
advertising icon in the United States _ but says many of its
policies have taken the wrong direction. ``We need and defend the
federation,'' he says. ``But if it is going in the wrong direction,
then the course has to be corrected.''
 &HT;    Fedecafes Avellaneda insists the criticism is unfair. ``It is
normal that people blame Fedecafe. We are a scapegoat, for better
or worse,'' he says. His advice to embattled growers is simple:
``Be good managers. Be highly productive. Get educated. Do not
expect too much from your institutions _ the federation can only
defend prices so far.''

YES, THE EURO WILL REBOUND. SOMEDAY. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the euro ever rally?
</P>
<P>
   That is a fair question, given the currency's tumble this
summer. Despite predictions that it was time for a rebound in the
euro, the unified currency of 11 European nations, it is back
within striking distance of new lows, bedeviling American investors
by erasing gains that they may have made in European equities.
</P>
<P>
   After a rally of 8.5 percent from its record low of 88.95 cents
on May 4, the euro has fallen 6.4 percent from its recent peak of
96.49 cents, on June 16. It dropped below 90 cents on Wednesday and
finished the week at 90.33 cents. That is down 22.6 percent from
its debut value of $1.1667 in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing to be a currency forecaster these days,''
said Anne Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers
Harriman &AMP; Co. She is not alone. There is no easy answer to why the
euro remains so weak.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the countries behind the euro are now growing
at 3 to 4 percent a year. They are at an earlier stage in their
expansion cycle, compared with that of the United States, so they
should be able to keep perking along. Their stock markets, while
not taking off, are doing better than American equities so far this
year. And the European Central Bank has moved to support the euro
and to keep inflationary pressures in check, raising its benchmark
interest rate by 1.75 percentage points since November. Many
analysts expect that inflation and euro worries will prompt another
rate increase late this month or in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very difficult to explain the softness of the euro
from the European side,'' said Nicholas P. Sargen, global market
strategist for J.P. Morgan's private clients.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has also received help from the United States in the
last year, as the Federal Reserve has lifted its benchmark interest
rate by 1.75 points, aiming to put a brake on U.S. economic growth.
A slowing United States economy should make a rebounding Europe
more attractive, especially in a year when the U.S. stock market
indexes are in negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   But all that came of this was a six-week rally that started in
early May and got its real lift when the Fed raised its target for
the federal funds rate by half a point, to 6.50 percent, on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? While analysts are not confident of their
explanations, they put most of the blame on the strong performance
of the United States economy and investors' consequent
unwillingness to bet on Europe when America has given them so much.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worrying that the U.S. economy will slow sharply,
investors seem to be betting that the Fed can direct the economy to
a soft landing, with growth remaining relatively robust and
inflation continuing to be restrained. German jobs data, released
last week, may have also created concern; the number of unemployed
fell by 9,000 in July, but that was below the predictions of 10,000
to 25,000. The unemployment rate slipped to 9.5 percent, from 9.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has made us wrong,'' Mills of Brown Brothers Harriman
said, ``is the appetite of Europeans for direct and portfolio
investment in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase
Securities, pointed out that European companies were still behind
their United State competitors in restructuring and in productivity
gains. That, too, is probably undermining the euro, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the euro pessimists have been surprised. Parker has been
bearish on the currency since its inception. But she had predicted
that it would rally this year, in part because the Fed was pushing
interest rates higher and the American economy's rapid growth was
expected to slow. Last December, she forecast that the euro would
be at $1.10 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now she predicts that the best the euro can do is 92 cents by
year-end and 95 cents by next June. ``The most that we are counting
on is that the euro has bottomed out,'' she said. But she is not
ruling out a brief side trip to a new low.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those major moves that simply take longer to
turn around than people think,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she felt sure of one development _ although, wisely,
she declined to forecast the timing: ``Sometime in the next five
years, we will be doing the same search for reasons why the dollar
is so weak.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    PEREIRA, Colombia _ Los arbustos verde oscuro de cafeto aun
cubren las empinadas cuestas que rodean a Pereira, una ciudad de
400.000 habitantes en el corazon del distrito cafetalero de
Colombia. Pero Ciro Medina, mientras maneja hacia la finca
Tasmania, su hacienda cafetalera, senala los tramos de hierba y los
esporadicos bananos que crecen en las laderas de las colinas.
``Esas son fincas cafetaleras abandonadas,'' dice.
 &HT;    Estas tierras baldias son cada vez mas comunes en el
departamento de Risaralda, del que Pereira es la capital, asi como
en los vecinos departamentos de Caldas y Quindio. Estos tres
departamentos, la Zona Cafetera, producen mas de la cuarta parte
del grano. Las fincas abandonadas ilustran el deterioro del sector
a causa de la baja de los precios mundiales, el alza de los costos,
las plagas y una feroz competencia internacional. Hasta el clima y
los desastres naturales han conspirado contra los colombianos: el
ano pasado, un fuerte terremoto devasto casas e infraestructura.
 &HT;    Fedecafe, la federacion nacional de cafetaleros y la asociacion
mas poderosa del sector en Colombia, ha sufrido tiempos dificiles.
Fedecafe ha tenido que vender muchos negocios y se ha visto
obligada a entregar al gobierno Bancafe, uno de los mayores bancos
del pais, debido a graves perdidas. Se ha erosionado su capacidad
de invertir en el sector y a la vez de mantener su sistema de
precios subsidiados a los cultivadores.
 &HT;    A pesar de esos problemas, pocos cafetaleros esperaban la
noticia de que Colombia tal vez necesite importar cafe para cubrir
el consumo interno en el 2001. Se teme que la produccion de este
ano sea la mas baja jamas registrada: unos 9 millones de sacos de
60 kilos, en comparacion el promedio de 13 millones de sacos.
 &HT;    Para un pais que exporta cafe desde 1835 y que se ufana de
producir el grano de mejor calidad del mundo, es un golpe bajo.
``Decir que vamos a traer cafe malo para tomarlo es una afrenta a
nuestro orgullo,'' se queja Medina.
 &HT;    Al sur, cerca de Pereira, en el portal de la cabana que
construyo hace 20 anos cerca de su pequena parcela, Octavio Bonilla
habla con pesimismo de la industria que ha sido su vida. ``Todo
sube menos el cafe,'' se lamenta.
 &HT;    Bonilla nacio a pocos metros de aqui hace 65 anos. Su abuelo fue
el primero en sembrar cafe en esos parajes. Pero ahora esta harto
de la magra cosecha y del alto costo de los plaguicidas y
fertilizantes. Esta pensando sustituir la mitad de sus plantas de
cafe con cacao y bananos. ``Nunca pense que esto sucederia,''
comenta. ``Parece que el cafetalero desaparecera poco a poco.''
 &HT;    Los problemas de Colombia comenzaron hace una decada, con el fin
del sistema mundial de cuotas del cafe. A principios de los anos
1990, Colombia controlaba casi el 22 por ciento del mercado
internacional. Todavia es el segundo productor del mundo, despues
de Brasil.
 &HT;    Pero aunque la calidad es buena, los costos de produccion son
altos, y paises con una produccion impetuosa y costos menores, como
Vietnam, le arrebatan participacion. Sin un sistema mundial para
mantener la produccion bajo control, los precios han bajado,
excepto los aumentos por razones del tiempo.
 &HT;    Los recientes esfuerzos por revivir los sistemas de retencion
basados en cuotas podrian sostener los precios, pero no haran mucho
por prevenir las importaciones. El problema, segun Ricardo
Avellaneda, asesor de Fedecafe, es el agotamiento de las reservas
de cafe barato de la federacion. Anteriormente, los tostadores de
Colombia podian comprar reservas de este cafe a precios
subsidiados, pero como es posible que esos inventarios se agoten
pronto, los tostadores probablemente recurran a las importaciones
baratas, quiza de Ecuador, Peru o Centroamerica.
 &HT;    ``No es que no haya cafe, sino que no hay cafe barato,'' senala
Avellaneda. ``Y no habra en el futuro a menos que los productores o
el gobierno lo subsidien, lo que no quieren hacer.''
 &HT;    Pero los productores no han recibido o no han entendido el
mensaje. ``Las importaciones no se justifican,'' apunta Medina,
quien alega que benefician a los tostadores, no a los cultivadores.
 &HT;    El tema de las importaciones es delicado, pero es solo la punta
del iceberg. Todos coinciden en que el mayor problema es el bajo
precio del mercado. La baja de precios del 30 por ciento al 40 por
ciento en los primeros cuatro meses del ano implica que ganarse la
vida es aun mas dificil para las 570.000 familias colombianas que
dependen del cultivo.
 &HT;    Medina, un ingeniero civil que se dedico al cafe como actividad
secundaria hace 26 anos, dice que su trabajo le permite mantener su
finca de 30 hectareas. La vida es todavia mas dura para los
cultivadores pequenos como Bonilla, que componen el grueso de los
cultivadores de Colombia (el 95 por ciento tiene menos de 10
hectareas). ``Solo es rentable para los grandes y para los que usan
los adelantos tecnologicos,'' indica Medina. ``Para los pequenos,
es imposible.''
 &HT;    Asedio al pequeno agricultor. De ahi las fincas abandonadas de
Pereira, un fenomeno que aumenta la emigracion a los ciudades y las
presiones sociales. Otros cultivadores han encontrado una actividad
sustituta en las visitas de turistas a sus pintorescas fincas. Los
duenos de parcelas pequenas, como Bonilla, se quejan de la falta de
credito y de la burocracia. ``Fui al banco agricola, pero exigian
tantos papeles, que deje de insistir,'' relata.
 &HT;    Con un futuro sombrio para esos pequenos cultivadores, la
fisonomia de la Zona Cafetera probablemente cambie mas. En
Fedecafe, Avellaneda reitera que solo los productores mas
eficientes pueden sobrevivir. La tierra cultivada ha bajado de mas
de un millon de hectareas a unas 800.000 en los ultimos anos,
apunta, pero hay un 20 por ciento mas de cafetos. ``Si tuvieramos
la misma productividad que en Costa Rica, tendriamos 565.000
hectareas,'' dice. ``Es la misma evolucion en la agricultura que
tiene lugar en todo el mundo. En Estados Unidos habia 6 millones de
granjas. Hoy hay 2 millones.''
 &HT;    No es raro que, teniendo en cuenta el papel de Fedecafe como
guia del sector, las criticas contra su direccion hayan aumentado.
Una organizacion rival llamada Unidad Cafetera Nacional ha captado
a partidarios como Bonilla y ha organizado marchas de protesta.
Pero Medina elogia la ayuda tecnica de Fedecafe y las campanas
comerciales (su personaje Juan Valdes es un icono de la publicidad
en Estados Unidos) pero dice que muchas de sus estrategias han
tomado el rumbo erroneo. ``Necesitamos la federacion y la
defendemos,'' senala. ``Pero si va en el rumbo equivocado, entonces
hay que corregir el rumbo.''
 &HT;    Avellaneda afirma que las criticas son injustas. ``Es normal que
la gente culpe a Fedecafe. Para bien o para mal, somos el chivo
expiatorio,'' comenta. Su consejo a los angustiados cultivadores es
simple: ``Sean buenos administradores. Sean muy productivos.
Estudien. No esperen gran cosa de sus instituciones: hasta ahora,
la federacion solo puede defender precios.''

 &HT;    PEREIRA, Colombia _ Los arbustos verde oscuro de cafeto aun
cubren las empinadas cuestas que rodean a Pereira, una ciudad de
400.000 habitantes en el corazon del distrito cafetalero de
Colombia. Pero Ciro Medina, mientras maneja hacia la finca
Tasmania, su hacienda cafetalera, senala los tramos de hierba y los
esporadicos bananos que crecen en las laderas de las colinas.
``Esas son fincas cafetaleras abandonadas,'' dice.
 &HT;    Estas tierras baldias son cada vez mas comunes en el
departamento de Risaralda, del que Pereira es la capital, asi como
en los vecinos departamentos de Caldas y Quindio. Estos tres
departamentos, la Zona Cafetera, producen mas de la cuarta parte
del grano. Las fincas abandonadas ilustran el deterioro del sector
a causa de la baja de los precios mundiales, el alza de los costos,
las plagas y una feroz competencia internacional. Hasta el clima y
los desastres naturales han conspirado contra los colombianos: el
ano pasado, un fuerte terremoto devasto casas e infraestructura.
 &HT;    Fedecafe, la federacion nacional de cafetaleros y la asociacion
mas poderosa del sector en Colombia, ha sufrido tiempos dificiles.
Fedecafe ha tenido que vender muchos negocios y se ha visto
obligada a entregar al gobierno Bancafe, uno de los mayores bancos
del pais, debido a graves perdidas. Se ha erosionado su capacidad
de invertir en el sector y a la vez de mantener su sistema de
precios subsidiados a los cultivadores.
 &HT;    A pesar de esos problemas, pocos cafetaleros esperaban la
noticia de que Colombia tal vez necesite importar cafe para cubrir
el consumo interno en el 2001. Se teme que la produccion de este
ano sea la mas baja jamas registrada: unos 9 millones de sacos de
60 kilos, en comparacion el promedio de 13 millones de sacos.
 &HT;    Para un pais que exporta cafe desde 1835 y que se ufana de
producir el grano de mejor calidad del mundo, es un golpe bajo.
``Decir que vamos a traer cafe malo para tomarlo es una afrenta a
nuestro orgullo,'' se queja Medina.
 &HT;    Al sur, cerca de Pereira, en el portal de la cabana que
construyo hace 20 anos cerca de su pequena parcela, Octavio Bonilla
habla con pesimismo de la industria que ha sido su vida. ``Todo
sube menos el cafe,'' se lamenta.
 &HT;    Bonilla nacio a pocos metros de aqui hace 65 anos. Su abuelo fue
el primero en sembrar cafe en esos parajes. Pero ahora esta harto
de la magra cosecha y del alto costo de los plaguicidas y
fertilizantes. Esta pensando sustituir la mitad de sus plantas de
cafe con cacao y bananos. ``Nunca pense que esto sucederia,''
comenta. ``Parece que el cafetalero desaparecera poco a poco.''
 &HT;    Los problemas de Colombia comenzaron hace una decada, con el fin
del sistema mundial de cuotas del cafe. A principios de los anos
1990, Colombia controlaba casi el 22 por ciento del mercado
internacional. Todavia es el segundo productor del mundo, despues
de Brasil.
 &HT;    Pero aunque la calidad es buena, los costos de produccion son
altos, y paises con una produccion impetuosa y costos menores, como
Vietnam, le arrebatan participacion. Sin un sistema mundial para
mantener la produccion bajo control, los precios han bajado,
excepto los aumentos por razones del tiempo.
 &HT;    Los recientes esfuerzos por revivir los sistemas de retencion
basados en cuotas podrian sostener los precios, pero no haran mucho
por prevenir las importaciones. El problema, segun Ricardo
Avellaneda, asesor de Fedecafe, es el agotamiento de las reservas
de cafe barato de la federacion. Anteriormente, los tostadores de
Colombia podian comprar reservas de este cafe a precios
subsidiados, pero como es posible que esos inventarios se agoten
pronto, los tostadores probablemente recurran a las importaciones
baratas, quiza de Ecuador, Peru o Centroamerica.
 &HT;    ``No es que no haya cafe, sino que no hay cafe barato,'' senala
Avellaneda. ``Y no habra en el futuro a menos que los productores o
el gobierno lo subsidien, lo que no quieren hacer.''
 &HT;    Pero los productores no han recibido o no han entendido el
mensaje. ``Las importaciones no se justifican,'' apunta Medina,
quien alega que benefician a los tostadores, no a los cultivadores.
 &HT;    El tema de las importaciones es delicado, pero es solo la punta
del iceberg. Todos coinciden en que el mayor problema es el bajo
precio del mercado. La baja de precios del 30 por ciento al 40 por
ciento en los primeros cuatro meses del ano implica que ganarse la
vida es aun mas dificil para las 570.000 familias colombianas que
dependen del cultivo.
 &HT;    Medina, un ingeniero civil que se dedico al cafe como actividad
secundaria hace 26 anos, dice que su trabajo le permite mantener su
finca de 30 hectareas. La vida es todavia mas dura para los
cultivadores pequenos como Bonilla, que componen el grueso de los
cultivadores de Colombia (el 95 por ciento tiene menos de 10
hectareas). ``Solo es rentable para los grandes y para los que usan
los adelantos tecnologicos,'' indica Medina. ``Para los pequenos,
es imposible.''
 &HT;    Asedio al pequeno agricultor. De ahi las fincas abandonadas de
Pereira, un fenomeno que aumenta la emigracion a los ciudades y las
presiones sociales. Otros cultivadores han encontrado una actividad
sustituta en las visitas de turistas a sus pintorescas fincas. Los
duenos de parcelas pequenas, como Bonilla, se quejan de la falta de
credito y de la burocracia. ``Fui al banco agricola, pero exigian
tantos papeles, que deje de insistir,'' relata.
 &HT;    Con un futuro sombrio para esos pequenos cultivadores, la
fisonomia de la Zona Cafetera probablemente cambie mas. En
Fedecafe, Avellaneda reitera que solo los productores mas
eficientes pueden sobrevivir. La tierra cultivada ha bajado de mas
de un millon de hectareas a unas 800.000 en los ultimos anos,
apunta, pero hay un 20 por ciento mas de cafetos. ``Si tuvieramos
la misma productividad que en Costa Rica, tendriamos 565.000
hectareas,'' dice. ``Es la misma evolucion en la agricultura que
tiene lugar en todo el mundo. En Estados Unidos habia 6 millones de
granjas. Hoy hay 2 millones.''
 &HT;    No es raro que, teniendo en cuenta el papel de Fedecafe como
guia del sector, las criticas contra su direccion hayan aumentado.
Una organizacion rival llamada Unidad Cafetera Nacional ha captado
a partidarios como Bonilla y ha organizado marchas de protesta.
Pero Medina elogia la ayuda tecnica de Fedecafe y las campanas
comerciales (su personaje Juan Valdes es un icono de la publicidad
en Estados Unidos) pero dice que muchas de sus estrategias han
tomado el rumbo erroneo. ``Necesitamos la federacion y la
defendemos,'' senala. ``Pero si va en el rumbo equivocado, entonces
hay que corregir el rumbo.''
 &HT;    Avellaneda afirma que las criticas son injustas. ``Es normal que
la gente culpe a Fedecafe. Para bien o para mal, somos el chivo
expiatorio,'' comenta. Su consejo a los angustiados cultivadores es
simple: ``Sean buenos administradores. Sean muy productivos.
Estudien. No esperen gran cosa de sus instituciones: hasta ahora,
la federacion solo puede defender precios.''

MORTGAGING THE FARM FOR A MOP

   Stacey Lavender isn't a cleaning fanatic, but she plays one at
work. Lavender is the assistant buyer in charge of housewares at
Restoration Hardware, the nostalgia-driven national chain, so she
is responsible for the 38 cleaning products and tools the company
now carries, like Italian-made squeegees in two sizes, Johnson
flannel dust cloths, Seeds' Wood Dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Lavender said that the buzz in cleaning right now is microfiber
and that Restoration Hardware will be doing a microfiber ``story,''
as the store calls its displays, in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microfiber creates static electricity,'' Lavender explained,
``which means that it literally attracts dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cool. We'll have a mop, a mitt and a set of three
towels. I'm pretty excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Also coming in January: an 8-foot telescoping cleaning tool with
a flood-bulb changer, a cobweb brush and a wool duster.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration Hardware sells its cleaning products with the same
chatty fervor and folksy nostalgia it uses to sell the rest of its
wares. For example: ``When I was a kid,'' the squeegee caption on
the company's Web site begins, ``there was a guy named Pete who
yearly took down and washed our storm windows. ...'' The Pete story
won't win the Booker Prize, but you get the point, that squeegees
are iconic objects vibrating with Proustian memories, that
squeegees are something worth thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   On her Web site, Martha Stewart hawks Homekeeping Brushes,
``from a family-run business in Germany that uses only the finest
natural materials, including real goat hair, ostrich feathers and
solid woods.'' They come in odd and wonderful shapes, like enormous
surgical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma's current catalogs boast an even more impressive
and seductive array of cleaning tools, including a gleaming,
stainless-steel, hotel-quality, standing dustpan and broom for $95;
a beechwood and horsehair extendable broom set for $16 _ ``For
sheer luxury as well as utility, natural horsehair is a winner''
the caption reads _ and three Miele vacuum cleaners (the Platinum,
at $999, is the best seller).
</P>
<P>
   ``People are spending an enormous amount of money on their
homes, and they want to take care of them,'' Richard Harvey, the
vice president of merchandising for the Williams-Sonoma catalog,
said. ``What we bring to the table is a selection of the absolute
best products. A lot of what we carry you can find in restaurants
and hotels like that upright dustpan. It's $95, but it will last
forever. And you know what? It sells great. And it looks cool. You
can't underestimate how something looks. So part of what we're
doing is making housewares attractive and not so mundane.''
</P>
<P>
   Perish the thought! David Brooks, in his book, ``Bobos in
Paradise, the New Upper Class and How They Got There'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $25), writes, ``Educated elites are expected to spend
huge amounts of money on things that used to be cheap.'' So the
best Bobos, Brooks' term for a group he defines as Bohemian
bourgeois, find the best microfiber mops, Australian lamb's wool
ceiling dusters and professional vacuum cleaners to care for their
restaurant-quality kitchens, recycled teak floors and slate-slab
bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning has come out of the broom closet. A home magazine,
Dwell, makes its debut this month with a cover line that reads,
``The Most Beautiful Vacuum Cleaners on Earth.'' And aren't they
just? From the pink Hello Kitty Sanyo, $89.95, to the Filter Queen
Majestic, a ringer for the robot on ``Lost in Space,'' about
$1,800. Cleaning has gone all high-tech and looks gender-neutral.
You might call it indoor gardening.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Buchanan's choice: black woman teacher
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan today introduced Ezola
Foster, a black Los Angeles teacher and conservative political
activist, as his running mate. Foster, a teacher and administrator
for 33 years, was a supporter of California Proposition 187, which
sought to deny most forms of state aid to illegal immigrants. It
passed, but was invalidated by the courts. Buchanan made his
announcement outside the convention hall in Long Beach, Calif.,
site of an intraparty battle between Buchanan and supporters of
party founder Ross Perot, who is staying out of the fray this year.
Buchanan opponents are holding their own parallel convention
nearby, supporting nuclear physicist John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGNING BEFORE SUNDOWN
</P>
<P>
   Courting key constituencies in battleground states, Al Gore
sought today to boost support from union workers at stops in
Philadelphia and Detroit. Gore is getting the endorsement of the
United Auto Workers despite labor opposition to his views on trade
issues. Appearing with running mate Joe Lieberman at a doll factory
in Philadelphia run by women and known for hiring the disabled and
homeless, Gore also touted proposals for ``unprecedented tax cuts
for working families.'' Afterward, Lieberman was heading home to
Washington to observe the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GORE LINKAGE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said today that Al Gore needs to do more to
criticize President Clinton's misconduct in office. Bush told
reporters that Clinton had ``embarrassed the nation'' _ and that
Gore should be saying more about it. ``If Al Gore has differences
with the president, he ought to say loud and clear what they are,''
Bush said. Americans ``have felt let down'' by Clinton's behavior,
Bush said on the plane from California to Oregon as he campaigned
for a second day with his former rival, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GORE SEPARATION
</P>
<P>
   Only days before the opening of the Democratic convention,
President Clinton urged Americans to throw no political stones at
Al Gore for the Oval Office affair that Republicans have been using
to link the vice president with Clinton's behavior. ``Surely no
fair-minded person would blame him for the mistakes I've made,''
Clinton volunteered at the end of a 75-minute question-and-answer
session before an audience of 4,500 in Willow Creek Community
Church in South Barrington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   TWO-PARTY SYSTEM: SEEING DOUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, the Reform Party was founded as an alternative to
the two-party system. Now, the Reform Party is a two-party system.
This year, the party finds itself organized like Noah's Ark. There
are two of everything: two Reform Parties holding two separate
conventions led by two different party chairmen. And by Saturday,
there will be two ``official'' Reform Party presidential
candidates. It'll take the Federal Election Commission, and likely
a federal court, to decide which one is the real Reform Party _
which can be defined as the party that gets the $12.5 million in
federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES TAKING A BACK SEAT
</P>
<P>
   The six members of the Federal Election Commission, rather than
the hundreds of Reform Party delegates, will decide the outcome of
the battle between Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin for $12.5 million
in federal funds that go to the party's presidential nominee. Under
federal election law, the Reform candidate must certify that he's
on the ballot in at least 10 states and then formally ask the FEC
for the federal funds. The commission then votes whether to release
the money. Four votes are needed.
</P>
<P>
   BUT . . . THEIR MONEY IS GOOD
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Leadership Council, the tax-exempt group led by
Joe Lieberman for the last five years, has raised millions from
corporations, including some oil and tobacco companies criticized
by ticket-mate Al Gore. The DLC raised about $4 million last year,
most from companies and executives who gave anywhere from $10,000
to a half-million dollars to support the group's pro-business,
centrist agenda. The donors include communications, high-tech and
pharmaceutical giants. But it also has attracted financial support
from corporations that traditionally support the Republican Party _
like Texaco and Koch Oil and tobacco giants Philip Morris, U.S.
Tobacco and R.J. Reynolds. The DLC provided the donor list to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   BUT . . . THE PAST IS HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, Congress held televised hearings into
whether the Reagan administration improperly arranged for military
assistance to the Contra rebels battling communism in Nicaragua at
a time when U.S. aid to the rebels had been banned by Congress.
Dick Cheney, then a Wyoming congressman, helped lead the defense of
the administration and Oliver North, countering Democratic
accusations of lying and covering-up by highlighting North's
tireless efforts on behalf of the communist-fighting guerrillas.
Now, Cheney is declining to discuss that role. Said his spokesman,
Dirk Vande Beek: ``This race is about the future and . . . not on a
resolved situation from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ARMS LENGTH ON PLAYBOY . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California said today she'd be willing
to move her upcoming fund-raiser from the Playboy Mansion after
fellow Democrats blasted the planned gala and removed her as a
convention speaker. ``It's never been about the Playboy Mansion;
it's been about putting on a good event and raising money,'' she
said today. Besides dropping Sanchez from the speakers roster,
party officials plan to meet Aug. 18 to determine whether to take
any additional action against her.
</P>
<P>
   . . . BUT NOT FROM THE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said his acceptance of campaign money from Playboy
magazine executives doesn't compare to the poor symbolism of a
Democratic Party official holding a fund-raiser at the Playboy
Mansion. ``It's apples and oranges,'' Gore said today, supporting
the party's decision to separate itself from the event and from
Rep. Loretta Sanchez for her role as organizer. But Gore said he
hoped the dispute could be worked out by moving the fund-raiser to
another location.
</P>
<P>
   FRIST NEW SENATE LIAISON
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential campaign named Sen. Bill Frist of
Tennessee as its liaison with the Senate. Frist played a key role
in last week's Republican convention, delivering a health care
speech on the same night that George W. Bush accepted his
nomination as the party's presidential candidate. Frist was a
co-chairman of the committee that wrote the party platform and
played a key role in retaining Bush's education initiatives. Bush's
previous liaison was Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell, who died July 18
of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   EMERGENCY: GET HILLARY!
</P>
<P>
   A newly formed group wants to raise $9 million to boost Rick
Lazio's Senate chances with a negative advertising blitz in the
campaign's final two months, according to a fund-raising letter
being sent to many New Yorkers. The plans of the Emergency
Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton are outlined in the
letter. The Lazio campaign disavowed any connection to the group,
based in Washington. Founders of the group, according to the
letterhead, include ex-Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger, ex-Attorney
General Edwin Meese, ex-Rep. Bob Dornan of California and
unsuccessful presidential candidate Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK-CHANGE ARTIST
</P>
<P>
   Blending her unique roles as first lady and Senate candidate,
Hillary Clinton plans several high-profile appearances through the
opening stages of the Democratic convention. She'll attend glitzy
fund- raisers and receptions and then deliver a prime-time address
to the convention Monday night, just before President Clinton takes
the podium. The hoopla began for her today as she and her husband
flew to Los Angeles aboard Air Force One. She was whisked off to a
taping with Jay Leno for his late-night NBC show.
</P>
<P>
   OLD ENOUGH TO BE INDEPENDENT
</P>
<P>
   The only Kentucky Democrat in Congress, Rep. Ken Lucas, says he
won't vote for Al Gore's presidential nomination next week because
of deep differences over tobacco, abortion and gun control. ``I'm
pro-life and he's pro-choice,'' said Lucas. ``I'm for the tobacco
farmer and the tobacco industry here in Kentucky and he is not. I'm
for Second Amendment rights. So we just have some major
differences.'' Consequently, Lucas, a 66-year-old first-termer,
said he'll abstain when fellow delegates vote for Gore's nomination
at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   EVER THE SUPPORTIVE HUSBAND
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lavished praise on his wife for pursuing a
Senate seat and promised that if she's elected, doubtful New
Yorkers ``will never have another question'' about her
qualifications. At a $25,000-a-plate dinner in Manhattan's Upper
East Side that brought in $500,000 for Hillary Clinton's campaign,
the president said he regrets that they had to abandon plans to
spend his last year in office traveling together. But he doesn't
mind, he said, because his wife is pursuing her dream.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WANTS TO BE A CABINET MEMBER?
</P>
<P>
   If George W. Bush wins the presidency, it's a cinch that quite a
few of his friends, political allies and business associates will
share in the patronage. And Texas Republican _ with discretion and
humility of course _ are engaged in a parlor game, trying to guess
who'll get what. The Dallas Morning News says that so many Texans
fancy themselves in top administration jobs that, if fantasy comes
true, the state might suffer a brain drain. No problem, said Texas
GOP chief Susan Weddington: ``Republicans have so many brains, they
could send a bunch to Washington without a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   JEWISH ROOTS STRESSED
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Lieberman made her first campaign trip apart from her
husband, taking Tipper Gore to her hometown, where she underscored
her Jewish faith and the diversity of the Democratic ticket. She
saluted Gardner, Mass., where her father was a rabbi, as a place
``that respected others that were not exactly like them.'' Her late
father, Samuel Freilich, brought his family to the central
Massachusetts industrial town after the Holocuast because it had an
opening for a rabbi. Hadassah Lieberman had been born in Prague,
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AHEAD IN BATTLEGROUND BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing Al Gore in the battle to win states, and
electoral votes, was underscored this week as George W. Bush
campaigned in California. The powerhouse state, where Gore once led
comfortably, now appears competitive. And Bush is showing strength
in the polls in many other key battleground states. In 20 states
where both campaigns are focusing their energy and advertising,
Bush has a lead or an edge in more than half, including some states
Democrats should be able to count on. He was even with Gore in
seven of those states, while Gore was ahead in only two.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE USUAL TOUR BUSES DON'T GO
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioned bus stopped in front of the local landmark
in Huntington Park, and would-be convention protesters got out to
gawk and snap photos of a block-long mountain of concrete rubble.
As Southern California puts on its best face for next week's
Democratic convention, community activists showcased its seedier
side with a ``reality tour.'' The sweep through downtown and the
industrial suburbs of Los Angeles included stops at a half-built
high school sitting on a toxic site and an oil refinery that
critics fear could spread a poison cloud in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   KEEPING HIS DAY JOB
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman will still seek a third term in the Senate, even
as he pursues the vice presidency as Al Gore's running mate.
Spokesman Dan Gerstein said Thursday that Lieberman considered
dropping out, but decided it ``would cause a lot of instability and
potentially hurt the party if he took his name off the ballot.''
But Democrats worry that the decision might show a lack of faith in
Gore's prospects. Also, if Lieberman wins the vice presidency,
Connecticut's Republican governor would appoint a Republican
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   GIVE HIM A UNION CARD
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader walked the picket
line Thursday with Communication Workers of America employees
striking Verizon, the largest Baby Bell, unconcerned that the
strikers' union already has endorsed Al Gore. He said Democrats and
Republicans are both to blame for putting corporate interests above
public interest. Nader has made federal labor law and corporate
influence on public policy centerpieces of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A CLAY FAMILY TRADITION
</P>
<P>
   In a five-way race to succeed retiring Rep. William Clay
(D-Mo.), the congressman's 44-year-old son, state Sen. William Clay
Jr., won the Democratic primary this week in the 1st Congressional
District. The election had been expected to be close, but Clay won
handily, sweeping St. Louis and elsewhere running slightly ahead of
his main rival, Charlie Dooley, a member of the St. Louis County
Council.

   In her new book, ``Sex and Real Estate: Why We Love Houses''
(Pantheon, $23), Marjorie Garber proposes that many people view
houses as objects of sexual and romantic desire. ``By providing not
only love objects but love stories, love scenarios,'' writes
Garber, a Harvard University professor, who clearly delights in
cultural metaphor, ``the house and its furnishings are doing our
living for us.'' In Garber's world view, spring cleaning is a Roman

silverware drawer?'' _ Mendelson is academic, encyclopedic and
sometimes very funny, a Beeton with a Ph.D. There are now 200,000
copies of ``Home Comforts'' in print. ``It's popped on and off the
best-seller lists,'' Beth Wareham, the director of publicity at
Simon &AMP; Schuster, said. ``The response has sort of blown us away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though cleaning house represents only part of the book's
scope, ``it is always referred to as `that cleaning book,'''
Mendelson said. ``Clearly, that's the part that has touched a
nerve,'' she continued. ``I have a friend who is a psychiatrist,
and she said, `Hmm, clean and dirty, that's 2-year-old stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson, who speaks as vigorously and precisely as she writes,
continued: ``I do think the job situation has strained the
connection to the home. People are working very long hours, and
they're living as transients in their own houses. People are
literally homesick. Maybe one of the ways they respond is to go and
buy all this stuff, to feel rooted and cared for, by caring for
their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elitism, sex, homesickness _ these are big concepts to swirl
around the mop bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Margaret Horsfield, a BBC journalist who lives
in British Columbia, published a book called ``Biting the Dust: The
Joys of Housework'' (St. Martins Press). It's a discursive social
history of cleaning in this country, a tale of germ warfare and
societal pressures, strewn with weird and wonderful personal
anecdotes, of looking for Mr. Clean and never finding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing was how much ink the book got,'' Horsfield
said. ``Not many people bought it, but everyone wanted to write
about it, because, it turned out, every reviewer wanted to confess
his or her cleaning practices. There's a lot of emotion around the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, I found myself confessing to Horsfield. I told
her about how the skirting boards in my house dominate my thoughts,
and how I find myself stopping work every hour or so to run an old
T-shirt over the notched surfaces. I told her about the Miele
vacuum cleaner I bought last month, the entry-level model purchased
for $319 at the Reliance Vacuum Cleaner Co. in Middletown, R.I. It
doesn't have a telescoping wand, but it does have a swiveling head.
In any case, it is awfully pretty.
</P>
<P>
   My friend, Ramona, who washes her floors every night and likes
to call me after the deed (``It's done!'' she'll breathe into the
phone), had sent me to Reliance for Crush, the store's own citrusy
wood-floor cleaner, which trumps Murphy's. Five hundred dollars
later, I had my new Miele, the Crush, a mop ``system,'' stainless
steel polish, hospital-grade tile cleaner and three empty spray
bottles. I told Horsfield I had never been happier.

 &HT;    Admit it _ you've got to have new gear
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It would be interesting to be a billionaire for
a day, just to see how long I could shop f/w new stuff without
getting tired.
</P>
<P>
   I expect the World Bank might have to be called in to assess the
damage, though, because if there's anything better than buying new
gear for hunting season, it's buying new gear and not having to
worry about how much it costs or if there's a warehouse that can
hold it.
</P>
<P>
   And the great thing is marketers know that no hunter can resist
buying something before he heads out to hunt for the first time
each fall, especially if it represents a new twist on an old item.
After all, how many camouflage mesh tops do we really need? Several
apparently, since they now come in versions that are insect proof
and in different colors for different conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But, we have to choose, don't we? Therefore, this seemed like a
good time to review some of the new stuff on the market, as well as
look at some new versions of items you might already have. Here we
go:
</P>
<P>
   _ Chairs: A place to sit during hot, dove season afternoons is
important. You can get a director's chair that holds two people for
about $50 or you can get seats and buckets with built-in ice chests
and storage compartments for shells and other gear. This year I
bought a folding tripod stool in Mossy Oak camo for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clothes: You need a hat for dove hunting to keep the sun off
your face and maybe provide a little camouflage for the birds
coming in. Any cap will do, of course, but there are models that
have mesh crowns to allow for some cooling air to move through. You
can buy them for less than $20. Light cotton or mesh shirts in
every camo pattern on earth are available, usually for less than
$30.
</P>
<P>
   Shorts are nice if you're not hunting in really bad thorn
country. Look for camo or tan or green khakis, $15-50 depending on
brands and how fancy they are.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shells: Most sporting goods stores will offer some kind of
special on dove loads before the season opens. If you hunt much at
all, you might want to consider a case of 10 boxes. These should be
priced anywhere from $40 to $75, depending on the amount of shot
and the promotion at your store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Knives and shears: A good pair of kitchen shears is one of the
best investments you can make for dove and duck seasons. They can
cost $15 or more than $100 if you get into the surgical stainless
steel variety. Most knife manufacturers make them, though, and sell
them for not a lot of money. They do a better job of cutting
through leg and wing bones than a knife and you don't have to
sharpen them as often.
</P>
<P>
   _ Radios: There are all kinds on the market today, and they just
keep getting cheaper as electronics get better. They can be useful
around a dove field for setting hunters and letting people know who
might need shells, drinks or who has a limit and is about to vacate
a hot shooting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is the standard, and the company is selling its
Talkabout models from around $50 up to more than $200 for the most
powerful models. You can even get them in camouflage colors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hearing protection: Those of us going deaf wish we'd known
more about how to protect our ears before it was too late. But it's
never too late to start, no matter how old or young. Anything you
do now is saving hearing for later on.
</P>
<P>
   I have custom ones fitted to my ears that cost $50, and you can
get those at outdoor shows and such. Or you can buy simple ones
that cost a few dollars. There are electronic models with
directional hearing that can cost a couple of hundred and more.

GORE GETS UGLY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Aug. 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It is almost enough to make one have a kind
thought about Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the blue, Al Gore has decided to make a humiliating
example of a woman for the choice she has made of a location for a
fund-raising reception.
</P>
<P>
   This imbroglio involves, curse me for mentioning it in a family
newspaper, the Playboy Mansion. It is also supposed to involve, in
some tortured way that escapes me, sex _ a topic from which
Republicans and Democrats alike recoil with the same horror.
</P>
<P>
   And the allegedly offending person, the Hester Prynne of this
latest tale of morality politics gone nuts, is a congressman
rightly regarded in the Democratic Party as a bit of a hero simply
for the fact that four years ago she dethroned Representative Bob
Dornan of Orange County, who in addition to his other sins had
raised the politics of misogyny to an art.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore invested his time on behalf of Loretta Sanchez when she
ran for reelection against Dornan two years ago, showing up for a
fund-raiser in an apparently politically correct location as well
as two rallies in the county that has been a symbolic capital for
California conservatism but is gradually becoming a symbol of
dynamic diversity. It also turns out that Sanchez is developing
into one fine congressman, increasingly effective on national
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But now, because she had the alleged temerity to arrange a
reception for 650 of her donors at Hugh Hefner's mammary monument
(a smart marketing move and nothing more), consider what is about
to happen to her. At Gore's behest, with the guys who run the
Democratic National Committee and its congressional campaign
affiliate being the agents, she is to be dropped from her
ceremonial honor as a cochairman of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is also to be denied her few moments of face and
speaking time from the podium of this self-sanctified convention.
And now, if cooler heads do not prevail, she is being threatened
with dismissal from her other ceremonial position as a vice
chairman of the party and official disavowal of her reelection
campaign in what is still a potentially competitive district is
even on the table. These latest threats were conveyed last week
directly to Sanchez by no less than Bill Daley, the Gore campaign's
boss, who should know better, being of the Chicago Daleys, in whose
town the Hefner empire was born.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's sins consist of the choice of the mansion in stylish
Holmby Hills for an event, sold out at $5,000 a person, for the
benefit of her political action committee (Hispanic Unity USA) that
registers new Latino voters. It will be held under a tent on the
lawn, not inside the sin palace. There will be no Bunnies around,
as is typical at the many such receptions held there that have
benefited causes from cancer research to arms control. The National
Women's Political Caucus has raised money there, as the Hollywood
Women's Political Committee used to, and as Rock the Vote has on
behalf of young voters. Like, big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Gore reaction of disapproval a few weeks ago was
ridiculous enough, but the move to squish Sanchez like a bug
gathered steam last week in the wake of Gore's bold decision to
make Senator Joe Lieberman his running mate. Gore and Lieberman are
apparently set on being the Cotton and Increase Mather of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The hypocrisy quotient is gigantic. Al Gore has already
collected $1,500 for his own campaign from Hefner and daughter
Christie. Since 1992, the Democratic Party has received at least
$100,000 in Playboy money.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just on the surface. All over town this week,
Democrats are taking money in the homes of people who make dirty
movies, really dirty movies, movies and TV shows that market
violence and sex, toys that glorify gory (pardon the pun) violence,
records that celebrate hatred of women, cop-killing, and rape, not
to mention garden variety polluters, price-gougers, and gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of victim for his symbolism crusade (a slick
marketing effort that in fact destroys the very values it purports
to support) is instructive _ a two-term congressman who is female.
Does anyone think he would land like a ton of bricks on a male
congressman with real seniority?
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has been magnificent in her refusal to get drawn into
this farce. Under absurd pressure, she is willing to find a
different location if she can hold her crowd and its money, which
will go for something worthwhile. All campaigns end up asking
forbearance of their supporters during the inevitable rush to the
center, and sometimes the last straw is itself symbolic, but it is
no less real.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late for an outcry to work. But it wouldn't
surprise me if some serious and high-minded money types in the
Democratic Party started writing checks to Hispanic Unity USA and
telling the big-shot guy Democrats that the dough is coming out of
their hides.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, what Gore was up to was merely dumb. Now,
however things turn out, it's both wrong and revealing.

JUDAISM: A PRIMER (TWO TAKES)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Al Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his
Democratic vice presidential running mate puts the national
spotlight on Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   It is attention that many in the Jewish community welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more positive exposure Jews get and the more awareness the
rest of the world gets about Judaism, the better off we all are,''
said Rabbi Eve Ben-Ora, director of Jewish education for Houston's
Jewish Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   And while Rabbi Shaul Osadchey of Congregation Or Hadash says
the Connecticut senator's nomination brings some concern about
anti-Semitism emanating from misperceptions or misunderstandings of
Judaism, it also ``gives us an opportunity to educate people on
Jewish life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy learning. Modern Judaism is not a monolithic
religion but one marked by a variety of beliefs and ideas with
varying degrees of observances of rituals and traditions. But there
are some basics on which all three major American branches _
Orthodox, Conservative and Reform _ agree.
</P>
<P>
   Religious Jews worldwide believe in one God.
</P>
<P>
   The world's 14.5 million Jews, including nearly 6 million in the
United States and 3.5 million in Israel, trace their religious
history nearly 4,000 years to the Patriarch Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Judaic writers characterize God as a passionate deity
who controls and intercedes in the affairs of his creatures. It was
God who called Abraham to ``leave your country, your kindred and
your father's house for a country which I shall show you; and I
shall make you a great nation'' (Genesis 12:1-2). It is this
promise that allows religious Jews to characterize themselves as a
chosen people who have a divinely selected home: Israel.
</P>
<P>
   God again interceded when the Jewish people were in Egyptian
bondage and called Moses to lead the Jews to freedom. It was to
Moses that God entrusted the Ten Commandments in a personal
encounter on Mount Sinai. Moses is traditionally considered the
author of the Torah, which is the basis of Jewish law and the first
five books of what Christians know as the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Over several millennia, the religious observances of Jewish
people revolved around the laws, holy days such as Rosh Hashana and
Yom Kippur, and life cycle events such as weddings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, Judaism faced serious challenges as Jews
found growing acceptance in what once were hostile, discriminatory
societies. But acceptance often came at the price of abandoning
religious observances and distinctive garb. In addition, science
and rationalism of the period called into question the supernatural
and the divine.
</P>
<P>
   The responses to modernity shaped the face of modern Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ORTHODOX
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews are a minority in the United States but are
dominant in Israel, Europe and other areas, according to Rabbi
Joseph Radinsky of United Orthodox Synagogues, Houston's largest
Orthodox congregation with 500 families.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is one of about 1 million Orthodox Jews. Although the
branch is the smallest and most observant of the three, it is
gaining new adherents among younger, tradition-minded Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here in 1976, (the synagogue) was mainly old
people,'' Radinsky said. ``Now it is all young, highly educated
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews interpret the Torah and its divine revelations as
literal events. The Torah, with its traditional regulations, is
regarded as written law. But equally authoritative is Halakha, a
body of oral law, rabbinical commentaries and traditions that the
Orthodox believe are based on the divine revelations at Mount
Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews believe the Torah and its codes are eternally
binding and unchanging. For example, keeping the Sabbath (from
sunset Friday to sunset Saturday) means no work and a day set aside
to worship God. That is why Lieberman does not campaign or attend
political events on the Sabbath. He also cannot travel except by
foot, which means he walks from his home to the capitol when he
needs to cast a Senate vote on Friday nights or Saturdays. What
constitutes work on the Sabbath can bring forth often detailed
definitions from rabbis and even contradictory opinions.
</P>
<P>
   But rabbis have long held that work that saves lives _ such as
that done by physicians and firefighters _ is exempt from the law.
Lieberman's own rabbi and others have said this also applies to the
senator's work as a public servant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that _ and the rabbis have encouraged me in
this and Jewish tradition does _ when you have a responsibility to
the people that can protect or advance their well-being or their
lives, then you've got to do it (work),'' Lieberman has said.
</P>
<P>
   By observing the biblical commandments, known as mitzoh,
Orthodox Jews attain personal holiness. Among the commandments are
the dietary laws known as kosher, which, for example, bans the
eating of pork.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews maintain gender traditions such as separating men
and women in the synagogue. Orthodox women still adhere to head
coverings at worship. The Orthodox do not accept women as ordained
rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox men often wear a yarmulka (skull cap) and are required
to pray three times daily.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox also emphasize Hebrew in their services and in
learning, although sermons in the United States are in English.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox response to modernity was to keep the Torah
interpretations intact, including oral laws and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM
</P>
<P>
   Reform Jewry, while following many Jewish laws and traditions of
old, take a more progressive or liberal view of the Torah and
Halakha.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century Jewish scholars in Germany, notably Abraham
Geiger, established two basic principles that have guided Reform
Judaism. One is that Judaism is evolving and is not based on a
once-and-forever divine revelation that was likely the product of
human inspiration rather than a supernatural event. Revelation can
continue through great teachers and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The second principle is that Judaism is subject to modern
knowledge and individual critical analysis. The two principles,
coupled with desires to blend in with more open and modern
societies, led Reform leaders to reject many traditions such as
wearing yarmulkas. They modernized worship, introducing the local
language instead of Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   X X X MORE
</P>
<P>
   $$$
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest strength of Reform Judaism is that it encourages
people to make informed choices and informed decisions,'' said the
JCC's Ben-Ora. ``What that means is that people have to learn and
to know and then apply that knowledge to their lives. They have the
ability to decide what they are going to do or what they are not
going to do as a result of their leaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform Judaism took deep root in the United States through such
leaders as Isaac Mayer Wise (1819-1900). Wise established the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations, Hebrew Union College and the
Central Conference of American Rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Judaism accepts the ordination of women as rabbis and
allows men and women to sit together in the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   American Reform rabbis shocked the Orthodox in 1983 when they
voted to automatically accept as Jewish those who had Jewish
fathers and were raised exclusively Jewish. This changed the
2,000-year-old law that Jewish identity flowed through mothers to
their children.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, along with Reform's more relaxed requirements for
conversion, have created tension with Orthodox leaders, especially
those in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, American Jews have largely supported the Reform
movement. The two largest synagogues in Houston, Beth Israel and
Emanu El, are Reform. There are 1.5 million Reform Jews in 895
congregations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a movement toward more tradition and ritual in
Reform Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in its history (the Reform movement) is turning
back a lot more to traditions which at one point it rejected,''
Ben-Ora said.
</P>
<P>
   Hebrew is being reintroduced in many synagogues, and many rabbis
and laity are returning to the use of the yarmulka.
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVE
</P>
<P>
   The radical changes introduced by Reform Judaism in the 19th
century led to the development of Conservative Judaism in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding the need for modern thinking and updating, such
scholars as Solomon Schechter (1850-1915) insisted on the
observance of religious traditions and laws. Schechter was
president of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York and
organized Conservative congregations into the United Synagogue of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Judaism rejected the personal autonomy that Reform
Judaism espoused, Osadchey said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Jews, along with Reform members, do not take the
Torah revelations as literal but as the product of human
inspiration influenced by God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though (Jewish law) was created by human beings, it has a
divine element to it and (Conservative Jews) accept as a community
this law as binding upon us,'' Osadchey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual does not have the right or prerogative to
determine how, for example, they observe the Sabbath or kosher,''
Osadchey said. ``These are established by the Conservative movement
for its members.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Conservative movement accepted the ordination of
women, it rejected patrilineal descent.
</P>
<P>
   With a foot in both the Reform and the Orthodox worlds,
Conservative congregations can range from very traditional to
liberal. About 1.5 million Jews in 800 congregations are
Conservative movement members.
</P>
<P>
   Other branches
</P>
<P>
   While about 4 million Jews are members of the three major
branches, many American Jews are not affiliated with a specific
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Small numbers are associated with other groups such as
Reconstructionist Judaism, the newest movement among American
Judaism. It is a growing arm of liberal thought and observance that
focuses on social and personal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Hasidic Jews, with their distinctive wear such as black hats and
long black coats, are a minority of Orthodox Jewry. There are
numerous subdivisions among the Hasidic, who are characterized by a
positive, joyous attitude toward observance and embrace the
mystical dimensions of Judaism.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weather conditions will deteriorate along the Northeast Seaboard
Saturday as low pressure forms near the coast. As breezes begin to
blow onshore, clouds and occasional showers will develop from
southern New England to the northern Middle Atlantic states.
Isolated thunderstorms are also possible. Sunday will have similar
weather as the low stalls.
</P>
<P>
   To the west and south of the low's influence, plentiful sun will
cover the Great Lakes and interior Southeast. Thunderstorms will
surround a stationary front across the Florida Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will persist over the Plains, where abundant sun
will lift readings past 100 degrees in many places.
</P>
<P>
   The West will be mainly sunny and hot with isolated afternoon
lightning storms forming near the rugged terrain of the southern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: COOL RELATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Averaging temperatures across the region, July 2000 was the
third coolest July in the Northeast since 1895. While August has
seen a few hot days, the month so far is still averaging cooler
than normal. In some respects, the August trend is not surprising.
Using the 50 coldest Julys in New York City, statistics reveal that
half of them were followed by unusually cool Augusts. In contrast,
only 10 percent were followed by unusually warm Augusts. Low
pressure stalled near the Atlantic coast will bring cool and
showery weather to the Northeast Seaboard this weekend.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There is only one question on the mind of everyone
who has ever known John Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Can he do it?
</P>
<P>
   Can a relatively unknown heavyweight from Massachusetts find a
way to beat the greatest heavyweight of his era Saturday at the
Paris Hilton to win the World Boxing Association title? Can a guy
who was knocked out in 19 seconds six years ago by David Tua
survive the onslaughts of Evander Holyfield and conjure up some way
to defeat him?
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics, of which there are many, answer that with another
question. Can elephants fly?
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the skeptics are right because many of
those same experts said barely four years ago that matching
Holyfield against Mike Tyson was a felony. They said Holyfield's
entrance music that night should have been ``The Executioner's
Song'' because he was walking into a fistic electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven rounds later, Tyson was bloody, beaten, and half
unconscious and suddenly many of the same wiseguys were saying they
knew it all along.
</P>
<P>
   So can John Ruiz beat Evander Holyfield? Yes, he can.
</P>
<P>
   Will he? That's up to him and, to a lesser extent, Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the best Ruiz could not beat the best Holyfield _ but
that Holyfield no longer exists. He is nearly 38 years old and has
been through two hard nights with Lennox Lewis and a similarly
difficult one with Michael Moorer before he finally stopped him
nearly three years ago. That's not to mention his three wars with
Riddick Bowe, fights that changed both men for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ruiz's battle plan, which is to test Holyfield by
working at a fast pace from the outset and hitting him wherever he
can whenever he can, regardless of the location of the punches, is
a sound one. It is based on a simple question: What does Holyfield
have left?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make Holyfield fight Johnny's fight,'' said Gabe
Mari, Ruiz's trainer. ``Punch and move. Make him work more than he
wants to. Don't let him set the pace. Don't let him get
comfortable. Hopefully, Johnny'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the real question with Ruiz (36-3, 27 KOs), of course.
Will he do it? He can, but will he?
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is a skilled journeyman, what I call a professional. In
boxing, being called a professional is being spoken of with great
respect. It doesn't mean you are the most skilled fighter in
history or that you are a legend in the making. What it does mean
is you know your trade and how to ply it.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz has learned his the hard way, in small arenas for small
money until his chance finally came. But he has learned, reaching a
point several years ago that shocked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three or four fights ago I really started feeling
comfortable,'' Ruiz said. ``That's why I think this fight came at
the right time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If it did, it will be because Holyfield (36-3-1, 25 KOs) is no
longer what people think he is and Ruiz is more than they think he
is. If Ruiz is that, he can win because he comes to the ring with a
hard jab, the ability to move and box, and enough cumulative power
to wear down an opponent and take him out.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a one-punch knockout artist, but neither is Holyfield.
Both are boxers more than fighters, with Holyfield the consummate
counterpuncher, which means Ruiz must be careful when he presses
the attack not to get caught by a counter left hook as he jabs. He
must keep his right hand up to protect himself at those moments.
But that jab and the movement that is supposed to follow is what he
must use to bother Holyfield and drag him into the deep water of
the fight's late rounds, when Ruiz's youth (28) becomes a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will beat Holyfield's jab,'' Mari warned. ``Even Lewis
didn't beat him with his jab. But the difference between Johnny's
jab and Lewis's is Lewis throws pillows. There's night and day
difference between them. Johnny's jab does damage. We need to use
it and avoid fighting Holyfield's fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to walk out and knock Johnny out and go home. So we
have to start fast, too. We got youth on our side, so who benefits
if they go to war a little bit?''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis is on the words ``a little bit.'' If a brawl breaks
out early, Holyfield probably wins it. But if a fight breaks out
with punches and counterpunches and a fast pace it could take more
out of Holyfield than it does Ruiz. There are several small things
pointing to Holyfield not being as ready as he should be.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield weighed in Thursday at 221 pounds. It is the heaviest
he has ever weighed for a fight. Combined with the fact he already
had the match postponed once when he claimed a rib injury makes you
wonder how seriously he has taken the 224-pound man in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Holyfield has fought down to the level of his
opponent. He rose up in the big fights with Bowe, Tyson, and, to a
lesser extent, the Lewis rematch, but struggled against Moorer
twice, Bobby Czyz, Alex Stewart, and Vaughn Bean. If that pattern
persists Saturday, the three-time champion may find it far more
difficult to become the four-time champion than he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   That Holyfield has little respect for Ruiz was clear when he
stood up at the final press conference and said, ```I'm preparing
for a better person that I see.''
</P>
<P>
   For a longtime Holyfield watcher that meant he doesn't see much,
if he's even bothered to look. He felt the same way about Czyz and
trained three weeks for the fight. He won, but looked so bad Tyson
decided that night to fight him.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue is, who will Ruiz really have in front of him?
He will have an old champion who has not looked like himself since
the second Tyson fight (June 28, 1997). He will have an old
champion who is coming off two straight big fights with Lewis,
neither of which he did well in. He will have an old champion
asking himself to get up mentally for a guy he says doesn't look
like much as a ``person.'' He will have an old champion whose
greatest fights have always been as much mental exercises as
physical ones, nights in which his will overwhelmed bigger,
stronger, and more heavily favored opponents.
</P>
<P>
   As he has aged, Holyfield has begun to face what most athletes
do. Good as his body looks, he admits to having more bad days than
good ones. More days when his shoulder is stiff, or his legs cramp,
or his back is sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure that's happened,'' said Jim Thomas, Holyfield's advisor.
``But Evander is as well-conditioned an athlete as I've ever seen
at 37.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so but can he be in better shape than he was for the two
Lewis fights? What will he feel like when he leaves for the arena?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe like the old Evander Holyfield. Or maybe just like an old
Evander Holyfield. If the latter happens, and Ruiz remains mentally
strong and follows Mari's plan, it may become clear finally why
Ruiz is only a 4-1 underdog, not 6-1 or 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny has a shot,'' veteran fight trainer Lou Duva said last
week. ``I know this guy (Holyfield, who Duva once trained and
managed). Evander isn't Evander anymore and Johnny can fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the reticent Ruiz acknowledged this week that he is not the
only one with questions about himself when the bell tolls around 11
p.m. Holyfield does too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he comes in,'' Ruiz said. ``I'm ready for that. Making
him work hard is my main goal. From the first round I have to
fight. I'm the underdog. I got more questions to answer than he
does. I have to change people's minds from the beginning to the
end. But I want to see what he still has in the tank after a couple
of rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect Ruiz to use his jab and his right hand behind it to score
early. But also look for a lot of movement that forces Holyfield to
pursue him, using his energy to get into position to punch.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see Ruiz loading up, however. Rather he will
look to hit Holyfield anywhere, including on the arms and elbows,
as often as he can while carefully trying to avoid the counterpunch
and uppercut that have turned so many nights Holyfield's way.
</P>
<P>
   If Ruiz's plan is successful, he will make Holyfield work late
into the night, into rounds he never thought he'd be facing. What
happens if they get there will tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield is a great fighter, but he's an old fighter,'' Mari
said. ``I've watched him a lot on tape. I don't think he can see
the punches anymore. I don't think he can get out of the way of a
punch anymore. That's why Lewis hit him so often.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he does have is experience. John doesn't. You have to
rise to the occasion. He has. Now John has to. Everybody has bad
days on the job. But if you're a fighter, you can't have a bad day
on a night like this or you won't be a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   No you won't. But that applies not just to Ruiz. It also applies
to an old warrior who may not be ready for the young brave who is
waiting for him with more arrows in his quiver than Holyfield
thinks.

 UNDATED: ancestors' achievements.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, how the past should be used is at the crux of the
debate. Ian Buruma, who has written extensively about the legacies
of World War II, contends that the quest for reparations tends to
mire the petitioners in the very victimization for which they seek
payment, as well as encouraging a never-ending flood of
restitution-seekers. ``If every group that feels a historical wrong
wants compensation, how far back do you go?'' he asked in an
interview. ``It becomes problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   As ethnic groups in the United States and elsewhere have
assimilated, Buruma went on, they have tended to replace their
cultural identities with the residue of past discrimination. This
leads, in his view, to resentment, which undermines the possibility
of mutual understanding between groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of identifying as an American entitled to freedoms and
rights and all men created equal,'' he said of African-Americans
seeking reparations, ``you are born into an aggrieved group
deserving compensation. Then that's your whole identity and you can
never get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the argument against reparations is simply that any
kind of compensation would be a wholly inappropriate and inadequate
recompense, not just for slavery but also for the entire array of
racial injustices that trailed in slavery's wake.
</P>
<P>
   As the sociologist Glenn C. Loury wrote recently in The New York
Times: ``Who can say what the out-of-wedlock birth rate for blacks
would be, absent chattel slavery? How does one calculate the cost
of inner-city ghettos, of poor education, of the stigma of
perceived racial inferiority? The severity of slavery's `injury' is
far more profound than any cash transfer will be able to reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   But for proponents, the word ``reparations'' can cover a host of
interventions, from cash payments _ the current equivalent of, say,
40 acres and a mule _ to a direct, official apology from the
president. Some argue that affirmative action policies already in
place should be considered sufficient, though Barkan responds that
affirmative action aims at fixing present injustices rather than
compensating for past ones.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Ogletree, among others, have suggested that
reparations be used to finance social and economic development
programs for the benefit of all black Americans. In another
development, a lawyer named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann is compiling
evidence for lawsuits against a dozen companies that she says
demonstrably benefited from the slave trade. Among them are
Providence Bank, a precursor of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and
Aetna Insurance Co. of Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, many proponents of reparations see the issue
as a moral one that cannot be dismissed because the practicalities
seem byzantine at the moment. ``I think it's part of the social
contract of justice in America,'' Dyson said, ``that if black
people have done what they've done and have been treated the way
they've been treated, then they deserve what they deserve. And we
can argue about what that desert should look like, but it ain't
come yet.''

   GORE-IMAGE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ No matter whether you think Al
Gore should be the next president, give him this much: He has
transformed the vice presidency, the subject of generations of
ridicule and derision, into more than the butt of jokes. So it is
remarkable that Gore's political coming-out here next week has been
designed not merely as the usual four-day paean to the party's new
standard bearer but also as a production that will obscure, neglect
and even expunge his time in what he calls the ``Square Office,''
only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor to the Oval Office.

   JEWS-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ron Wyden, a Jew whose parents fled
Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic senator from Oregon, a state in
which Jews account for less than 1 percent of the population.
Oregon is also home to not a few militia members and
black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet Wyden says he has
encountered only a ``small hard core'' of anti-Semitic haters. The
tale of Wyden in Oregon bears retelling for those who reacted to
the news of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's annointing with the queasy
suspicion that this just cannot be good for the Jews. Although
bigotry thrives and shouts rather loud, Jews in this country have
never before had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews
are no longer considered ``the other'' in America. By Laurie
Goodstein. (Moving in the ``a'' category.)

   KANSAS-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Darwin is back in Kansas.
In the state school board primary this month, Kansas voters
defeated those candidates who last year supported removing any
mention of evolution from the state science curriculum. Now,
whoever wins in November is expected to restore evolution to the
curriculum and reverse a significant victory for advocates of
creationism. By Pam Belluck. (Moving in the ``a'' category.)

   AIRLINE-HASSLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Business travelers have been
grousing for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or
at all), lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes
and a tote board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Air
travel, once considered pleasant and even glamorous, is now
routinely derided as something akin to riding a Greyhound with
wings, except the bus has more comfortable seats and usually gets
there on time. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-GAP-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once it was the great taboo. Now,
most American schools and policy-makers are talking about it: the
achievement gap between black and Hispanic students on the one hand
and whites and Asians on the other, which persists even among the
ranks of the most well off and well educated. Fourteen racially
diverse suburbs in different parts of the country have joined to
share successful strategies for closing the gap. As a way of
forcing them to deal with it, states are beginning to require
school districts to break out their test score data by race. By
Kate Zernike.

<P>
   SINATRA-WWII-REVIEW (New York) _ Some in Times Square aren't
thrilled by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of
Frank Sinatra on the traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway.
Critics say the Crossroads of the World are too congested for the
bronze likeness of a singer with little connection to Broadway. The
most historically significant aspect of this proposal, however, has
been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed forces' busiest
recruiting station would honor a man who avoided the World War II
draft and spent much of his life trying to live it down. By Tom
Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-LAWS-REVIEW (Boston) _ ``We must help protect our children,
in our schools and streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our
nation's gun laws,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. In
other words, Bush was saying, we don't need more laws to do the
job. This is one side of the long-running debate on how to control
the terrible toll guns exact on the country. It is the side long
supported by the Republican leadership in Congress and the National
Rifle Association, who see new gun laws as a threat to American
freedom. But is this true? In 1998 alone, 30,708 people were killed
by guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at a
cost estimated as high as $100 billion. Are current laws adequate
to to fight this scourge? By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   THEATERS-ORNATE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Marcus Loew, who founded
Loews Theaters in the early 1900s, once said: ``We sell tickets to
theaters, not movies.'' That was certainly the case when the grand
movie palaces of the teens and twenties lit up America's big cities
and small towns. For the most part, the theaters were baroque,
showy grand dames. Some flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble
floors, and architectural ornamentation worthy of the Sun King.
Now, a new grandiosity is back, inflating cinemas into
Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as many as 30 screens. Many
theaters now compete with their film selections in terms of
theatricality. By Monte Williams.

organizations have expressed worries that that the Czech police

PINOCHET CAMPAIGNS TO AVERT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Since being stripped of his senatorial
immunity on Tuesday, Gen. Augusto Pinochet and supporters have
started a campaign to gain support to help him avert a trial on
charges of kidnapping, murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
   The approach represents a shift from what had been a quiet,
strictly legalistic defense before the Supreme Court, with lawyers
arguing that the former dictator was too frail to instruct his
lawyers adequately in a long trial.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, which appears to be orchestrated with conservative
politicians, retired military officers and executives, is an
attempt to galvanize the support of an estimated 30 percent of the
country that still considers Pinochet a hero whose coup in 1973
overthrew President Salvador Allende Gossens, a socialist, and
saved the country from Communism.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 60 politicians and other supporters gathered
around the general at his house to offer their support in an event
that was carefully choreographed for Chilean television cameras.
The general, smiling and carefully balancing himself with a cane,
spoke for 10 minutes and promised a vigorous defense of his
innocence and honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate obligation that I will assume before my
conscience and my family,'' he said. ``I don't ask for anyone to
accompany me. But those who want to help me can help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet had kept a low profile since returning here in early
March, not voting in the Senate, where he is a member for life
under a constitution written during his 17-year rule, or otherwise
involving himself overtly in politics. He has stayed home, played
with his grandchildren and consulted his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says he is preparing ``a letter to the Chilean people''
that will justify his role in history. It is bound to be a polemic
that may galvanize the right and surely outrage the left.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published this week by the Center of Studies on
Contemporary Reality, a research center, indicates that 52 percent
of Chileans support the Supreme Court decision to strip his
immunity, with 35 percent opposed and the rest giving no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean society has been deeply divided on the case since
Pinochet was arrested two years ago in London on a Spanish warrant
that sought to try him for a variety of serious criminal charges.
Demonstrations have gradually decreased in size and emotion. But
Chileans still express concerns that the case could upset the
country's stability.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's new gestures have been accompanied by a more public
role in recent days by his wife, Lucia Hiriart, the grand dame of
the Chilean right. At a public dinner on Thursday night, Pinochet's
wife criticized the judicial investigation into her husband's
involvement in human rights violations as ``entirely political,
unjust and cowardly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they judge him immediately after he left the
presidency?'' she asked. ``They waited until now when he is sick,
old and without power. Is that just?''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the new campaign, Francisco Javier Cuadra,
Pinochet's chief of staff from 1984 to 1987 and a lawyer, said:
``Until now, the defense has been strictly juridical and in the
hands of lawyers. I think from now on his defense will be more
political.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative business leaders have become more vocal on
Pinochet's behalf, suggesting that the legal proceedings are having
negative effects on investment. ``The ruling will not alter Chile's
political stability or social peace,'' said Hermann Von
Muhlenbrock, president of the Metal Industries Association. ``But
it will have an impact on future economic activities and in the
decisions of certain investment groups.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist who is moderate on economic
affairs, has tried to encourage businesses to pump up investment as
part of an effort to lift the country from a lingering recession.
He has argued that the Pinochet case should have no economic
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, the prosecuting judge in the case, is
preparing a list of questions to interrogate Pinochet. The judge is
widely expected to draw up an indictment in October and then order
a medical examination to test the general's mental state before a
possible trial can begin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their
national convention don't know yet who John Witchel is. But he and
his friends are planning to crash the Democrats' party with a
straightforward message: they want in. ``We already drive every
significant sector of the economy,'' Witchel says. ``The keys to
the kingdom are squarely in our hands. I'm here to say there's a
next generation of Internet executives, and we're ready to become
national political players.''
</P>
<P>
   John Witchel is a big, driven man, a former Stanford jock with a
booming voice. At 32, he is running his third successful company,
the San Francisco-based Red Gorilla, while serving on the boards of
seven other Internet start-ups. But Witchel's current obsession is
not business but politics - an arena he feels is ripe for the
attention of entrepre-neurs. ``Priced today,'' he says, sounding
slightly surprised by his dis-covery, ``politics is the bargain of
the century. For $10 million you could do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Witchel is interested in buying politicians. What he
wants, simply, is to be a political somebody, ``one of a small
handful of trusted people,'' as he puts it, ``who can be helpful
when needed.'' So Witchel has just helped start a new enterprise,
PAC.com, a political action committee aimed at centrist Democrats.
Along with Witchel, the main organizers include his Red Gorilla
colleague Wade Randlett, Tim Newell of E*Offering, Joe Kraus of
Excite &LR; home, Chris Larsen of E-Loan and E. David Ellington of
NetNoir. While these power brokers lack the star power of
Hollywood, they have an even more glamorous currency that they plan
to start handing out: equity.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, PAC.com's 20 members will each contribute $1,000 a
month in plain old cash to politicians who meet with them for
dinner and conversation. (This year, they're focusing on Congress,
where a small group has more ``leverage,'' and not on the
presidential race.) That's the traditional part; what's new is that
members will also give stock in their pre-I.P.O. or newly public
companies to PAC.com to put into a kitty and disburse over time.
``We can cash it out and give it to a politician,'' explains
Randlett, ``and say here's five grand. Or we can say here's $5,000
worth of shares; you hang on to it and see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of equity could have vast implications for the world
of politics. If Joe Kraus of Excite, for example, had contributed
just $1,000 worth of stock to a senator right when the company went
public in April 1996, three years later, even after some scary
losses and plunges, that senator would have had $15,992 to spend on
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty tempting proposition, though even tech-friendly
politicians express reservations. Representative Adam Smith, a
Democrat from Washington and the campaign chairman for the New
Democrat Network, which has worked hard to forge links to high
tech, believes that few candidates will be willing to play the
market with their campaign budgets. After all, the stock could just
as easily be eToys as Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Smith does believe, however, that the identification with
PAC.com and its pool of stock might ``help brand candidates a
little bit further'' by linking them to the New Economy. Senator
Patrick Leahy of Vermont doesn't accept money from PAC's himself,
but he, too, sees the appeal of the idea. ``I think it's an
intriguing way for young dot-com people to participate,'' says
Leahy, who has long championed Internet issues. ``It makes sense to
them. As far as ethics, the bottom line is, whenever you take any
donation, it's reported, it's public knowledge. Whether you take
cash from or stock in Polluters-``R''-Us.com, if you're voting
against an environmental issue, the public will know.''
</P>
<P>
   If politicians are cautious, campaign-finance reformers have
already made up their minds. ``A sweetheart deal in pre-I.P.O.
stock has a back-room stench to it, even if it's legal,'' charges
E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of the Brennan Center for Justice
at the New York University School of Law, which has been studying
campaign finance. ``If you believe contribution limits mean
anything, then making a contribution that explodes in value within
a few days is a blatant subversion of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Turovsky, a partner at Manatt, Phelps &AMP; Phillips in Los
Angeles and the election-law specialist who is advising PAC.com,
sounds unconcerned, however, and asserts that he has ``no doubt''
that it's appropriate for politicians to receive stocks. ``There's
nothing in the F.E.C. regulations or statutes that would prohibit
it,'' he says. In fact, in correspondence with PAC.com, officials
at the Federal Elections Commission affirmed the plan to give out
stock.
</P>
<P>
   While PAC.com is a small, start-up operation, it is undoubtedly
what its founders like to call, in Internet jargon, ``scalable'':
other PAC's and individuals from around the country can borrow the
idea and take it where they want to. For better or worse, the world
of campaign finance is likely to change. Like so much else in
American culture, politics will be pulled even further into the
orbit of the stock market and the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   And along with it, the influence of men like John Witchel stands
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   when microsoft first got into trouble with the justice
department, the established tech companies, who used to keep their
distance from national politics, swiftly beefed up their lobbying
operations and began playing the Washington game. PAC.com, however,
represents a different trend; its members have little patience for
doing government affairs by the book and tend to see the big
computer companies as hopelessly old-fashioned. ``The CEOs who
ruled Silicon Valley five years ago are middle-aged and
corporate,'' Witchel says disdainfully. ``Our guys are in their 20s
and 30s. They have 25 employees. They don't have lobbyists. They
don't go to Business Roundtable meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Witchel and his allies don't even look like traditional Silicon
Valley types; they're more frat boy than geek. At 40, Tim Newell
calls himself ``the old man'' of the group; a husky Vermonter, he
towers over most Internet executives like a football player among
chess-club nerds. Newell, a former White House aide turned
investment banker, runs E*Offering, which enables individuals to
invest in I.P.O.'s online. Joe Kraus, a founder of Excite, is a
goateed 29-year-old; his company, begun in a burrito shop during
his senior year at Stanford, had a market value early this month of
$5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   David Ellington, the cigar-smoking, 40-year-old CEO of NetNoir,
runs the Web's leading black-oriented site. Chris Larsen, 39, a
windsurfing enthusiast, is the founder and CEO of E-Loan, an online
lending service whose original interface he programmed himself.
Wade Randlett, 35, who favors tailor-made suits, was a Democratic
political consultant who helped found Silicon Valley's first PAC,
the Technology Network, in 1997 - ``hands-down the single person
who defined high-tech fund-raising,'' says Newell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like NASA was in the '60s,'' claims David Ellington.
``Then, everyone wanted to hang out with the astronauts. Now
everyone wants to be down with the future.''
</P>
<P>
   These self-styled ``astronauts'' are largely democrats. They
made their fortunes on Bill Clinton's watch and became natural
allies of his centrist, pro-trade, ``New Democrat'' agenda. Of
course, plenty of Internet entrepreneurs remain Republicans; George
Bush has raised millions in Silicon Valley, and Republican
congressmen like J.C. Watts of Oklahoma have made pilgrimages there
to court high-tech supporters. But Witchel and his fellow PAC.com
members share a Northern California ethos that makes them
culturally out of tune with traditional Republican values.
PAC.commers say they care about choice and the environment. They
don't want the Ten Commandments posted in schools. They love making
money and are perfectly comfortable doing it alongside homosexuals
and foreigners. What they see in Gore and the New Democrats are
politicians who will not only respect their style but who will also
make sure that their industry stays as unregulated, un-unionized
and untaxed as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Already, PAC.com has established what Randlett calls ``a
strategic co-marketing agreement'' with the New Democrat Network, a
group of pro-business Capitol Hill Democrats who borrow freely from
the metaphors and values of the New Economy in their quest to
modernize their party and wean it away from the labor unions and
old-line liberals. In just four years, billing itself as ``a
venture capital fund for the Democratic Party,'' the group has
become the largest caucus in the House, with 65 members. It now has
14 New Democrat Senators as well, and it runs its own PAC and
recruits, promotes and finances promising centrist candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rosenberg, 35, the president and founder of the New
Democrat Network, has made alliances with Silicon Valley a central
part of his political strategy from the beginning. Rosenberg
recognizes that Internet entrepreneurs need politicians, as Newell
says, in order ``to be in the conversation.'' They want access,
relationships and connections in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of issues on the table in Washington right now
- Internet taxation, privacy regulations, export controls, visas
for high-tech immigrant workers - that Witchel and his group might
want to weigh in on. But the PAC.commers insist that they're less
interested in short-term lobbying for a specific agenda than in
building networks of influence. ``Look at where the great power
bases of the world are,'' argues Witchel. ``One is in venture
capital. Another is in Washington, D.C. Just as I spend an enormous
amount of time getting to know investment bankers before I actually
need their money, I do the same with politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Witchel's approach is a firm belief that Internet
businesses are models for how all social and political institutions
can work more effectively. The young entrepreneurs of PAC.com tend
to use the buzz words of the Internet economy to describe every
facet of life. They want to ``disintermediate'' political
go-betweens and substitute their own networks for established
political machines. They want to ``identify an expanded target
market'' and then ``aggregate high-net-worth individuals'' to
change the base of support for the Democratic Party. As Newell
boasts, PAC.com's modest goal is to ``transform the business of
politics and the politics of business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Newell says, politics is the same as investment
banking: ``You have a product, you have to go out and raise
money.'' He chuckles. ``PAC.com is just old-fashioned grass-roots
politics _ grass-roots organizing of millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   PAC.com, for the moment, eschews soft-money donations _ the
uncapped gifts to political parties rather than individual
candidates _ but other high-tech figures have begun experimenting
with the system. Marc Andreessen, the 29-year-old founder of
Netscape, chairman of Loudcloud and Uber-geek, is part of PAC.com's
broader network. He has been hanging out with Vice President Al
Gore for years and recently dropped a quarter of a million dollars
on the Democratic National Committee. It is, Andreessen admits, ``a
lot'' by the standards of politics. ``But in my world,'' he adds,
``if I invested just $250,000 in a new company, they might think I
wasn't all that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the value of money in Silicon Valley and
in Washington - what Andreessen calls ``arbitrage'' - gets the
attention of young entrepreneurs.``If you think there's a lot of
money in politics now,'' Andreessen says, ``you haven't seen
anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world view of PAC.com, that's nothing to be afraid of;
politicians are merely the last ones to get dealt into the game.
After all, in the New Economy, argues Witchel, everyone from
receptionists to CEOs is getting paid in stock already. ``It's just
the way we do business,'' he declares. ``Doesn't it make sense for
everyone to participate in the same system?''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign-finance watchdogs certainly don't think so. At a time
when the market's reach into every corner of civic life seems
almost unchecked, critics ask, why make politics, too, dependent on
stock prices? ``Candidates are already treated as commodities to be
invested in; we might as well slap logos on them,'' says
Rosenkranz. ``Contributing stock is the perfect completion of the
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Witchel himself is torn. He'll exalt the power of skyrocketing
stock options one minute, then turn around and critique the culture
that has grown up around them. ``The thing about Silicon Valley
that's a problem for me,'' he says, ``is when it's just about
money. It's spiritually bankrupt. People get rich, they start to
smell like money, dress like money. It makes the whole culture ugly
and hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's what politics offers to the callow entrepreneurs
of Silicon Valley: a spiritual dimension, a meaningful,
civic-minded pursuit beyond the world of business and money. But
first they have to buy their way in.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Political junkies, chew on this demoralizing fact: Al Gore and
George W. Bush have already spent $150 million, and their campaigns
get built-in coverage from the networks, yet not only have they
failed to produce a spectacle as compelling as the World Wrestling
Federation's ``SmackDown!'' they can't even muster the ratings of
``The King of Queens'' reruns.
</P>
<P>
   The first law in the modern entertainment state is that you have
to know how to put on a really big show. We are a nation devoted to
extravaganzas. Americans voraciously watch pageants and quiz shows;
they fork over fat cash for rock concerts, Tony Robbins seminars
and ``Riverdance''; they even tune in dutifully for such admittedly
boring events as the Academy Awards. Winning a devoted audience
doesn't seem to require any special Hollywood magic either.
</P>
<P>
   Every self-respecting pro sport can put on playoffs and a
championship that mesmerizes millions of viewers. Even the military
was able to stage-manage the Persian Gulf war _ a blowout by the
first inning _ so that Americans were enthralled for more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
   But all the ``genius'' political consultants, all the hard and
soft money and all the free media still produce a presidential
campaign that goes down like cod-liver oil, featuring speeches that
no one listens to and photo ops that no one wants to see. A
population that won't miss a weekly election on ``Survivor'' can't
be bothered to notice the world's most important political contest.
</P>
<P>
   Several explanations for this dismal failure present themselves.
The snobs' conclusion: American voters are stupid. Faced with
weighty policy debates, the theory goes, the average stupefied
citizen simply crashes.
</P>
<P>
   This is nonsense, of course. Anyone who believes the campaign is
too smart for voters isn't following it. Gore and Bush spend a lot
less time discussing Medicare Part B than they do posing with
Latina grandmothers in front of American flags. The campaign isn't
too hard. It's too dull.
</P>
<P>
   Others have argued that the candidates themselves seem too
remote, their lives of power and privilege too far removed from the
everyday people whose interest they are courting. Which is just as
far off base as the snobs' argument.
</P>
<P>
   Modern politics is infested with a ridiculous, phony populism.
The candidates _ the smartest, savviest pols in the nation _ prove
their presidential fitness by wearing jeans, flipping pancakes,
reading to schoolkids and generally wallowing in their own
mundanity. Gore can't stop being dull. Bush willfully suppresses
his charisma in order to seem serious.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of aversion to stardom and celebrity isn't just
impractical; it's downright un-American. A more compelling argument
is that the campaign ignores the three fundamental requirements of
drama: conflict, uncertainty and a great story.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians like to pretend campaigns are mano-a-mano death
struggles, but in truth they are eerily devoid of direct conflict.
The guiding principle is not clash of the titans, but parallel
play. The business of flinging mud and whispering accusations is
outsourced to campaign spokespeople and, on occasion, to the
candidates' family members. But the candidates themselves don't
squabble or wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore won't meet till the debates in October, and even
those encounters will be carefully sterilized. This disengagement,
say the pundits, gives them ``stature.'' The candidates are staying
above the fray _ but as a result, there's no fray and little worth
watching. It is possible to stage a spectacle without conflict _
see ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' _ but it's hard to reject
both conflict and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Any first-time producer knows to cut away at the moment of
highest tension, to keep the audience on tenterhooks, ready to tune
in next week. But the presidential campaigns leave nothing to
guessing. Speeches are distributed in advance. Even the
vice-presidential nomination, which should be the campaign's grand
surprise, leaks out slowly and deliberately, allowing the campaign
a no-risk preview of voters' response to any possible choice.
</P>
<P>
   Conventions are scripted to the second. Dissenting voices, if
not entirely banished, are consigned to low-visibility venues like
the South Dakota delegation at a 7 a.m. prayer breakfast. It's not
a weeklong celebration of democracy. It's the North Korean
Communist Party Congress. Is it any wonder no one wants to watch?
</P>
<P>
   Without conflict and uncertainty, a shapely narrative becomes
crucial. Any tale that you care about arcs from beginning to middle
to end. But the campaign doesn't manage to tell any story at all,
and that is the fatal blow.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story: A young orphan discovers that he has magical
powers and sets off to a school for wizards. He learns that the
evil wizard who killed his parents is back, looking for a magic
stone. Through a series of tests and puzzles, the orphan vanquishes
his nemesis and is celebrated as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a story: Al Gore gives a speech in Clayton, Mo., on
children's health; Al Gore gives a speech in Niles, Ill., on health
care; Al Gore gives a speech in Bridgeville, Pa., on women's
health. Wash, rinse, repeat till November.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, there is no solution in sight, for these
relentlessly disappointing performances are governed by an iron
logic. Now that cable, satellite, VCRs, the Internet have
fragmented the American audience into 260 million pieces, national
entertainment depends on narrowcasting. But national politics
can't. Presidential candidates must appeal to a majority of all
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Insurgents and third-party candidates can afford dramatic,
erratic campaigns. They don't mind offending because they know
they're going to lose. That's why the 1992 Republican convention,
dominated by the culture warrior Pat Buchanan, was by far the most
interesting convention in decades. It delighted conservative
activists and drew good ratings _ and it was a monumental disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major parties, any variation from the script is seen
as a risk, in which the danger of alienating any voters outweighs
the possible advantage of shaking things up. For now, campaigns
remain boring because they have to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety First campaign will win Gore or Bush the election,
but at a cost. The nation lives by the agenda of sports and
entertainment. A president who can't understand that risks
irrelevance. He won't know how to speak to his constituents, and we
won't take the trouble to listen. Maybe it's time for another movie
star in the White House.

 By STEPHEN J. DUBNER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King is addicted to writing. It isn't a matter of liking
to write or even loving it. He needs it, chemically, the way years
ago he needed his cocaine and his beer, sometimes a case a day.
``Writing is just this great big conduit, this outflow pipe that
keeps the pressure nice and even,'' he says. ``It just pours all
this (expletive) out. All the insecurities come out, all the fears
_ and also, it's a great way to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been able to make a career of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd be dead. I would have drunk myself to death or drugged
myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he almost died anyway. He and his family were
staying at their lake house in western Maine. It was late afternoon
and King was finishing up his daily four-mile walk. As usual, he
was carrying a book. Although he often reads while walking _ on
dirt roads, for instance, or down Broadway while visiting New York
_ he was not reading at the moment, for this stretch took him up a
steep hill alongside a small highway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a blue Dodge minivan crested the hill and pinballed
King off its windshield. He came down in a clump. His head was
bleeding, his lap seemed to be turned sideways and he saw that a
bone in his right leg was pointing in the wrong direction, skyward,
bulging out of his jeans. A short while later, one of his lungs
collapsed. This was all happening in a blur, literally, for King's
eyeglasses were missing. They had somehow landed on the front seat
of the minivan. They would help convince Bryan Smith, the man
driving the van, that he had hit a person and not, as he first
thought, ``a small deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, after King knew he would survive but before he
knew if he would walk again, he resumed writing. His wife, Tabitha,
who is his rock and his redeemer, set him up at a makeshift desk in
the back hallway of their Victorian sprawl in Bangor. It reminded
him of the laundry room in their old trailer, where he wrote
``Carrie,'' back when he washed motel sheets for a living and she
sold Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sat in a wheelchair, propped up by foam cushions,
brimming with pain and painkillers. Besides the fractured hip,
mangled leg, collapsed lung and lacerated scalp, he had four broken
ribs and a chipped spine, and he had lost 50 pounds. He didn't feel
like working, but a voice in his head _ yes, Stephen King, like his
characters, hears voices _ told him to.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an opposite of writer's block, King has it. As a
teen-ager, he would come home from a Roger Corman movie, write a
novelization in two days, mimeograph a few dozen copies and sell
them at school for a quarter each. By the time he was a college
sophomore, he had five finished novels in a drawer. Last month, his
hyperproductivity paid off yet again. Reaching into another drawer,
he pulled out a novel called ``The Plant'' and did something with
it that made worldwide headlines: he published it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, he became the prince of e-publishing by
releasing, through Scribner, an Internet-only novella. Its success
tickled him, and made him yearn for an even closer-to-home
publishing experience. Enter ``The Plant.'' Instead of a mimeograph
machine, he used his Web site to release it; instead of a quarter a
copy, he suggested a $1 payment for the first installment, with
more to come only if 75 percent of the downloaders paid up. ``My
friends,'' he wrote on his Web site, ``we have the chance to become
Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novel's plot _ a writer sends a man-eating plant to
a publishing house that rejected his manuscript _ Big Publishing
did its best to appear unruffled. ``I don't feel particularly
threatened,'' said Susan Moldow, the publisher of Scribner, King's
offline publishing house. The literary agent Mort Janklow told a
reporter, ``That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but
it's not a way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``The Plant'' was released, King said in an e-mail
message: ``I'm satisfied with the downloads _ about 40,000 as of 4
p.m. yesterday, and we're estimating a total pay-through of maybe
88 percent. Let Mort Janklow put that in his pipe and smoke it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hubbub was the novel's provenance. King began ``The
Plant'' back in the early 1980s but shelved it because it too
closely resembled ``Little Shop of Horrors.'' It was distributed
only to the people on his Christmas-card list. ``If I gave someone
a coffee maker and they sold it at a yard sale, it wouldn't bother
me,'' he said at the time. ``If they want to sell 'The Plant,'
fine. It's theirs. They can tear out the pages and use 'em for
toilet paper, if that's what they feel like doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be what his friends mean when they call him a genius.
After all, who but the chairman of Stephen King Inc. would think to
turn 15-year-old toilet paper into an Internet rage?
</P>
<P>
   The book he finished in his wheelchair, meanwhile, ``On Writing:
A Memoir of the Craft,'' will be published in _ yawn _ early
October. With paper and cloth and glue. For King, 52, it was one of
the scariest books he has written. While a large part of it gives
point-blank advice to the aspiring author (``The adverb is not your
friend''), it also tells the true story of how writing saved
Stephen King from the sort of life _ or death _ that he has instead
had the luxury of turning into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He has two offices in Bangor: one in the house for writing, the
other in a low-slung flesh-colored building near the airport. This
is where he and two assistants manage the empire that has arisen in
the wake of more than 40 books and nearly as many films based on
the writing of Stephen King and Richard Bachman, King's
pseudonymous counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday morning, mid-June, almost a year to the date of
his accident. King uses one red metal crutch to get from his pickup
truck to the office door. He is sick of the crutch. At a recent
reading in New York, he was determined to appear without it but was
stymied by three steep flights of stairs. Once onstage, however, he
leaned the crutch against a wall and limped to the microphone. He
got a standing ovation. King, as his longtime editor puts it, ``is
the rock star of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after telling his assistants, Marsha and Julie, how nice
they look, King lowers himself into a jungle-print recliner. He
appears healthily haggard, if that's possible _ still underweight
but generally fit. He's wearing faded jeans, a blue sweatshirt and,
on his feet, soccer socks (maroon-and-white stripes) and karate
shoes (soft white leather). The combination invokes something like
a woodsman who breaks at lunch for ballet. At one point in the
conversation, he raises his right pant leg to illustrate the story
of visiting his beloved Red Sox at spring training: ``Nomar comes
over, Bret Saberhagen comes over, Tim Wakefield comes over, and Tim
goes, 'Come on, get it up, get it up!' They wanted to see the leg,
and they all knew what the injury was.''
</P>
<P>
   The major scar, running the length of the calf, is surrounded by
any number of puckers and pockmarks. The leg is not pretty (maybe
it never was), but it's there. Attached to the rest of him. ``I
tell Tabby this is the bonus round,'' he says. ``And I believe it,
man. I have a lot of pain, but there's so much that doesn't hurt,
that I'm capable of. To be able to walk around, to still be able to
make love to my wife _ because that could have gone as well, it's
just a physiological thing. I'm grateful for everything that I
have, and I try to stay as grateful as I can, because it doesn't
matter how much money you've made or how rich you are or whether
your book's on the Internet or anything else. If you snap your
spine, you're a quad, and mine was chipped in five or six places,
almost down to the bare wires in a couple of places, so I'm very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His desk is stacked with books to be autographed, the rest of
the office thick with Kingalia. It traces the arc of a long and
variegated and uniquely successful career: a ``Green Mile''
director's chair, a ``Pet Sematary'' rug, a chipper little sign
reading ``Redrum'' (if you have to ask ... ). In the bathroom,
there's a framed photo of a very large woman in a bathtub,
presumably a fan, with a thought bubble above her head: ``A Ton of
Fun?''
</P>
<P>
   King doesn't want for fans. In the summertime, tour buses idle
outside his house. On the Internet, King rumors swarm: his minivan
encounter was not an accident (false); he is suffering from
writer's block (false); someone else _ maybe his wife, also a
novelist _ actually writes some of his books.
</P>
<P>
   That rumor is also false, as far as anyone can tell. Still,
King's prolificacy borders on promiscuity. ``You almost expect when
he refers to 'the boys in the basement''' _ King's term for his
internal muses _ ``that maybe there are real people, doing at least
his typing,'' says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent who is also
King's personal editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since King went back to work, he has written the
second half of ``On Writing''; ``Riding the Bullet,'' the e-novella
whose success prompted a storm of the-future-is-here coverage; the
better part of a haunted-house screenplay for a six-hour ABC
miniseries; and a 900-page novel, ``Dreamcatcher,'' which opens
with a group of hunters coming upon a man who claims to have been
lost in the woods. (He finished another novel, ``From a Buick
Eight,'' just before his accident, but its release has been pushed
back, in part because it involves a nasty car crash.)
</P>
<P>
   As King says in ``On Writing,'' the first draft of a novel
shouldn't take more than three months. That, after all, is how it
works for him. He writes seven days a week, with the stereo turned
up loud (lots of Eminem, Kid Rock and Wilco these days), but he
often knocks off by lunchtime. Friends say that despite his ambling
disposition, King is fiendishly focused and gets more done per hour
_ whether writing or not _ than any other human they know. ``He's
curious about everything around him,'' says Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
who founded the Rock Bottom Remainders, the authors-only rock band
that includes Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry and, on
rhythm guitar, King. ``You can't mention a book he hasn't read, you
can't mention an obscure musician who he can't sing a lyric of one
of his songs.'' King's brain is known as an extraordinarily fecund
place, constantly sprouting jokes, opinions and, above all, story
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   King alone fails to marvel at his output. That would be like a
sprinter gloating over his speed. What does delight King is his
forward momentum. He is not only the richest and most famous living
author but also among the most entrepreneurial. A few years ago, he
pulled a Dickens and published ``The Green Mile'' in six serial
installments. (At one point, all six volumes sat on The Times's
best-seller list.) Earlier this year, he released a short-story
collection exclusively as an audiobook. Even his contract with
Scribner is an anomaly, sacrificing gigantic advances for a bigger
piece of the back end. (He doesn't remember the specifics, he says:
``I think the deal is a million dollars a book and split the
royalties pretty much down the middle.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now he has given e-publishing a kick-start. ``Riding the
Bullet,'' released in March, was the world's first mass e-book,
with more than 500,000 downloads. The number of actual readers was
another question because the encryption caused countless computers
to crash. Still, thanks to King, online publishing seemed a real
possibility at last. (Never mind that the Web was already swimming
with downloadable music and movies; even though plain words are far
easier to upload, it was somehow taken for granted that Big
Publishing would be the last one in.)
</P>
<P>
   King was stunned by the success of ``Riding the Bullet.'' In
Scribner's office pool, he had predicted 16,000 downloads. Now he
wanted to try again. He made up a wish list: a downloadable story
without encryption ... released in serial form ... with
honor-system payments ... published by ... ME! Thus was ``The
Plant'' brought forth from its drawer and posted on
www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The media worked hard to turn King's insurgent act into a
writers' revolution. It is probably not. Most writers, unlike King,
can't book themselves onthe ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America'' on the day of their launch. Most writers, like Carlos
Detweiller of ``The Plant,'' would make more of an impact by
sending a man-eating vine to the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   For King, though, anything is possible and, in time, probable.
``I've continued to say yes to these things rather than kind of
pulling back and saying, Well, I'm going to write a book a year,
and that's what I'm going to do,'' he says. ``I dislike writers who
behave like old cart horses, dozing their way back to the stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has written a how-to-write book laced with memoir. Some
critics, King says, ``think I can't write,'' and he knows how ``On
Writing'' will sit with them: ``Like the town whore trying to teach
women how to behave.'' He doesn't care. In the book, he even
invites his readers-writers to submit their work to him. He's
thinking about publishing the best offerings in the paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Such approachability is a major upside of King's down-to-earth
reputation. Even in his native Maine, where celebrity is considered
a sort of disease, he is extraordinarily well regarded. It doesn't
hurt that he and his wife are world-class philanthropists, but
their just-folks nature is just as deeply appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more upside to his earthiness. ``He said
to me recently,'' Verrill says, ``that one of the advantages of not
being an acclaimed literary novelist is that you get to write about
stuff like ...,'' and here Verrill names a variety of bodily
functions that are regularly featured in King's work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, King wants to write from the gut and be an
acclaimed literary novelist. His complaints are by now familiar:
the literary establishment has long misunderstood popular fiction,
and just because he sells millions of books, serious readers won't
take him seriously. King has recently made headway. His novels have
come to be reviewed more respectfully; a Hawthorne-ish short story
he wrote, ``The Man in the Black Suit,'' won a 1996 O. Henry Award.
King was happy for the award, ``but it made me feel like an
impostor too,'' he says. ``Like someone made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, King is right: serious readers generally haven't
read him. When they do, they are usually impressed. Cynthia Ozick,
for instance, had never given King much thought until they did a
reading together. ``It dawned on me as I listened to him that,
never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes _ this man
is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation,'' she
says. ``He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a
literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history.
It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not
stupid _ that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   If King wanted to find the genesis of his bad reputation, he
might try looking in Hollywood. Except for ``Carrie'' and ``The
Shining,'' most early King films _ think ``Pet Sematary'' or
``Maximum Overdrive'' or ``Children of the Corn'' _ were dopey
gorefests. As King the author became a brand name, his movies gave
serious readers everywhere reason not to read him.
</P>
<P>
   But as his writing matured, so did the films. In 1986, Castle
Rock released ``Stand by Me,'' a sharp coming-of-age film based on
a King novella. Castle Rock has since made five more King films:
``Misery,'' ``Needful Things,'' ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
``Dolores Claiborne'' and ``The Green Mile.'' Each one was a few
thousand percent better than ``Children of the Corn.'' Too bad for
King that Castle Rock wasn't around in the 1970's. On the other
hand, he often hurts his own cause. Last year, King gave himself a
party at Tavern on the Green to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the publication of ``Carrie.'' It was a fancy night, full of
literary VIPs, capped off by ... a highlight reel including the
goriest moments in King's film repertory.
</P>
<P>
   King never set out to be a horror writer and doesn't consider
himself one now. Horror, he implies, is a cheaper version of fear,
and it's the fear he's interested in: the frantic bleats in a
protagonist's mind more than the monster causing them. Two of his
recent works, ``Hearts in Atlantis'' and ``Bag of Bones,'' seemed
intent on minimizing the monstrous. They are driven by character,
not scenario, and are each rooted in sober realism. They are big,
serious-ish books; Scribner even classed up their dust jackets. But
by story's end the ghosts have arrived. A reader feels almost as if
the writer wanted to resist but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   A reader feels more of King at work than of most writers. His
narrative voice, extraordinarily controlling and full of wry
intrusions, is always right in your ear, just outside the
campfire's light. But what most makes King unique is that he fully
exploits the writer's great natural advantage: he is the one making
up the story. If there is a single trait common to most of King's
writing, it is the reader's feeling that the author is playing God.
He can and will make really bad things happen to his beloved
creations. He will then watch them confront this evil, occasionally
offering aid. Finally, after they've been scared witless and have
proved themselves worthy, they are welcomed back into His warm
embrace, humble and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a novella that King published
last year, is a good example. In it, a 9-year-old girl gets lost in
the woods and ends up praying to her hero, the Red Sox pitcher Tom
Gordon, to help save her. It is a simple, beguiling, frightful
story. It begins in innocence, passes through the valley of the
shadow of death and ends with a benevolent wink of an author's
note: ``The woods themselves are real. If you should visit them on
your vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps ... and try to stay
on the path.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he might soon retire _ ``I think that my trick bag is
pretty well empty'' _ but instantly cautions that he probably won't
be able to. Those who know him well agree. He is preternaturally
driven, they say. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, a Bangor friend and one of King's lawyers, says
that ``he's just a competitive guy who wants to be the best at what
he does.'' King has befriended John Grisham _ a few years ago, they
paid their own way to the National Book Awards, in sly protest of
being perennially unconsidered _ but he is bothered by the
inferiority of other best-selling authors. ``I never wanted to be
content with being, let's say, a Robin Cook or even a Michael
Crichton, who's a little bit better,'' he says. Of Danielle Steel
and Mary Higgins Clark, he complains, ``These people are selling
fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   If King's Internet orgy proves anything, it's that he likes
attention, a lot. What doesn't drive King is money. ``The truth is,
Stephen King is rich because he never set out to be rich,'' says
Susan Moldow of Scribner. ``If the money mattered to him, it
wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is, many times over. Responding to an e-mail query about
his finances, he wrote: ``I don't know how much I make in a good
year. Gross could be $40 million, I'd think. What finally nets out
is maybe a third.'' For the movie of ``The Green Mile'': ``I think
I got $3 million plus a piece of the back end (up to a certain
point). The movie has earned, unlike most of them, so I think I'll
see some back end. I saw some from 'Stand by Me,' too. Mostly
(people won't believe it) the movies are just sort of fun. Like
investing in some weird margin stock like United Kurmfurling or
Yermal SpringTronix. I can't break my finances down further than
that, and you are impudent to ask (I say it without rancor, but you
know it's true). The money isn't very important. The idea is to
take care of your family and have enough left over to buy books and
go to the movies once a week. As a goal in life, 'getting rich'
strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The goal is to do what God made you
for and not hurt anyone if you can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-hurting-anyone credo is important to King, and personal.
When he was 2, his father ``did a runout.'' King grew up with his
mother and older brother, on the move and poor. In ``On Writing,''
he recalls this childhood with typical candor (which can be very
moving) and typical scatalogical flair (which will probably keep
him, for now, on the wrong side of Art). His mother set high
standards, worked like a martyr, encouraged his writing; he loved
her. Shortly before his first book was published, she found out she
had uterine cancer. ``We could hear the pause after each rasping
breath she drew growing long and longer,'' he writes. ``Finally
there were no more breaths and it was all pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, King's own family is his greatest happiness. He speaks of
Tabitha with the ardor of a newlywed and the awe of a Lourdes
pilgrim. It was Tabitha who, about 15 years ago, gave him a choice:
clean up or move out. He was a mess; he says he can't really
remember writing ``Cujo'' at all. Tabitha took him before a group
of family and friends and emptied his trash can onto the rug. Out
poured, he writes, ``beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram
bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons caked with snot
and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and
NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of mouthwash.'' He bought a
little time, as addicts will do, but soon started treatment and
stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   King seems genuinely surprised that he has lived to see his
first grandchild. He and Tabitha have had an eventful marriage;
friends say it is one of the strongest they have seen. For Tabitha,
who has published seven novels, it cannot have been easy being the
No. 2 writer in this two-writer home. Worse yet, for years they
shared a publisher. Tabitha's last manuscript got caught in limbo
when Elaine Koster, Tabitha's editor and Stephen's paperback
publisher, left Penguin Putnam in 1997. Stephen wound up signing
his lucrative deal with Scribner. Tabitha's novel wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of their three children are writers, Joe near Boston
(who writes under a pseudonym) and Owen in New York (who doesn't).
``I read Joe's stuff, and I kind of relate to it because it's like
plot-driven, it's high conflict,'' King says. ``Owen is more like
this sort of _ I don't want to dis him but _ Bret Easton Ellis. I
don't know, more like flavor-of-the-month, New York
relationships.'' The Kings' daughter, Naomi, is a Universalist
minister. ``I tell her, and I think it's true, that Unitarianism is
God for people who don't believe in God, and she just laughs.''
Naomi, who once owned a restaurant in Portland, Maine, now lives in
Chicago. ``She met a woman out there, and she's going to marry this
woman or have a commitment thing or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the whole family was up at the lake, including
Joe's wife and infant son. It was the first time in six months they
had all been together. On June 19, a Saturday, Owen was returning
to New York, so his father dropped him at the airport, drove home,
took a nap, then headed out for his daily constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had just walked into his apartment when he got a phone call
from Tabitha: his father had been in an accident. He flew back.
King had been airlifted to the Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston. Tabitha, Joe and Naomi arrived, and later, Owen. ``What
they did to me there was apparently set something in my leg,'' King
recalls, ``and there's this horrible scream _ it came out to where
they were signing papers. Joe turned pale at that. The nurse gave
them a form, a do-not-resuscitate kind of thing. Tabby said Joe
realized it was serious and he just left, went out for a while. He
had his Red Sox cap. He put the cap over his face until he was in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   King, leaning forward in his recliner, takes a pause, and a
breath. ``Later, they all gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's fully choked up. He whispers, in a model of Maine
understatement, ``They're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   King's near-death, as the facts came forth, unspooled like a
scene from his novels, full as they are of automotive menace and
rural blunderings. The driver who hit him, 42-year-old Bryan Smith
of Fryeburg, is known locally as a bit of a simpleton. King recalls
a sheriff's investigator visiting him in the hospital and saying,
``That Pepsi can has more IQ than Bryan Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith hit King, his minivan was well onto the right
shoulder. He had been distracted by his Rottweiller's trying to get
into a food cooler. Smith came back and sat with King to wait for
the ambulance. A woman and three children soon joined them.
According to her, Smith apologized and told King he had never even
gotten a parking ticket before, to which King replied, ``Well, I've
never been hit by a car before.''
</P>
<P>
   The local weekly, The Bridgton News, later reported that Smith
actually had a long history of driving violations. He had been
convicted for operating under the influence, driving to endanger
and failure to stop for a police officer. Once, after running
several cars off the road, he pulled into his driveway and promptly
passed out on his lawn, in view of the police officer who had been
chasing him. In 1998, his license was suspended three times but
each time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   At it turned out, Smith has a brother, Everett, on the Fryeburg
police force. The sheriff's deputy who responded to the King
accident, Matt Baker, used to serve on the Fryeburg force with
Everett Smith. And the only eyewitness Baker took a statement from
on the scene was his own uncle, Chip Baker. ``It's not nepotism,
it's ineptness, that's what I would credit those police departments
with,'' says Lisa Williams Ackley, who covered the story for The
News.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were enraged when it was announced that only
misdemeanor charges would be pressed against Smith. The accident,
they felt, should be treated as a seriously criminal act. ``They
should have impounded the vehicle, and they should have tested him
for drugs and alcohol at the scene, and they didn't do it,'' says
Warren Silver, the Kings' lawyer in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver had gone to western Maine shortly after the accident to
investigate it and meet with Smith. He came home with an idea that
he prayed Smith hadn't had: the 1985 blue Dodge Caravan, fresh with
King's dents, might fetch a frighteningly high price on eBay. The
next day, Silver called Smith, offered him $1,500 for the van and
had it shipped back to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   King wants to use the van for a charity event: three
sledgehammer swings for $5. ``But my wife is kind of like, 'Why
don't we just get past this whole thing,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles at his own grisly perseverance. He takes off his
glasses, rubs his eyes, puts the glasses back on. They are the same
lenses he was wearing that day; only the frames had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still wearing them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I wanted to say that things that we ordinarily
would see as quite fragile aren't necessarily that fragile,'' he
says. ``It's true of the glasses, and it's true of me. I got bent,
I got busted around a lot, but I'm still here.''

ONE KIND OF BEAUTY, COOLLY MEASURING ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The red diamond is worth half a million. It's just
half a carat and looks like a piece of faceted beach glass. ``It's
minuscule,'' Catherine Deneuve says. ``I blow, and it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve is paying a call on Yves Ringler, a diamond merchant who
often sells stones to her friend Marcial Berro, the Argentine
jeweler. Ringler's firm, the Cora Diamond Corp., is well known in
the trade for dealing in colored gems of exceptional rarity and, of
course, cost.
</P>
<P>
   Gems are a subject for which Deneuve has what you might
understate as an affinity. It's an interest put to good use in
``Place Vendome,'' opening here this week. The film stars Deneuve
as the alcoholic widow of a prestigious Parisian diamond dealer
driven to suicide by debt. The plot, such as it is, revolves around
her discovery of, and attempts to unload, a cache of precious and
undoubtedly stolen diamonds. ``I like very much stones,'' the
actress says. ``I've always collected them, rocks at first and then
heart-shaped stones and then precious stones and then ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me show you something rather special,'' Ringler says.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simmering midweek afternoon, but the atmosphere in
Ringler's Midtown office is cool and hushed. The Cora Diamond Corp.
is on a street called Diamond and Jewelry Way, in a nondescript
building with an OshKosh B'Gosh store on the ground floor and the
elite Diamond Dealers Club above. It is here on 47th Street that an
extraordinary percentage of all the gem diamonds on the world
market are faceted, bought and sold; that lobby clocks are set to
times in the diamond capitals of the world (New York, London,
Antwerp); that merchants bustle around carrying million-dollar gems
in cloth wallets beneath their trousers; that security is so tight
that even Catherine Deneuve is stopped for an ID.
</P>
<P>
   Can that be? The star of ``Belle de Jour''? The favorite not
only of Bunuel but Truffaut, Aldrich, Polanski and Agnes Varda? The
onetime face of Marianne, emblem of France? It seems strange to say
so, but casually dressed in a black linen shift, an orange cashmere
cardigan, beige fishnet stockings and tiger-printed linen
sling-backs with pointy toes, Deneuve might pass along New York's
streets almost unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair is tawny. She wears sunglasses with strong prescription
lenses. Her eyes are slightly puffy, but otherwise she appears to
be a typical Parisian woman of indefinite age, the type once
referred to as BCBG (bon chic, bon genre) by the French. Some
biographies put Deneuve in her mid-50s; some say she's a decade
older. Whatever the truth, she retains the slightly frigid demeanor
that earned her the nickname ``ice queen,'' a description she used
to detest but now says she thinks is ``right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve has a brother-in-law, a niece and two nephews in the gem
trade. She is a collector of jewels. She can diagram a diamond _
table, girdle and culet _ and talk not only with expertise, but
with experience, about the great jewelers like Harry Winston,
Chaumet and JAR; about the diamond bourse in Antwerp, Belgium;
about the ancient universal method for carrying loose gems, which
is to fold them into a paper pouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to learn this folding,'' she says, for ``Place
Vendome.'' ``You couldn't fake it. And once you fold the paper,
there is no way the stone can go out of the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Ringler places a tray on the table. ``Most diamond dealers trade
in half carats,'' he remarks. ``One carat and up, it's considered
large diamonds.'' He brings out an intense blue diamond that, by
anyone's standards, is large: 22 carats. ``I like very much this
blue,'' Deneuve says. ``But really, you are going to sell that to
... who? To an Arab? And she can only go out with two bodyguards?''
</P>
<P>
   Ringler palms the stone and then replaces it with a rose one the
size of a pigeon's egg. ``Pretty,'' Deneuve says coolly. ``And how
do you call this color?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bazooka pink,'' he says. ``The rough was African and was over
30-something carats to start.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cannes last year, Deneuve explains, she wore a necklace from
Harry Winston. It had three very large diamonds and was copied from
an original belonging to Marilyn Monroe. ``But hers,'' she says,
``was fake.'' Harry Winston was famous in the trade for two things,
Ringler remarks: He never allowed his face to appear in pictures,
and he always carried a rock in his pocket. ``He liked to have the
feel of a diamond around him,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' Deneuve says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with her own gems Deneuve is casual to the point of seeming
heedless. Once, she explains, she cleaned a diamond ring in a pot
of boiling water and forgot it was on the stove. The ring was a
loss, but the gem survived. She once dropped a stone in the dirt
while gardening with her grandson. She continues: ``For me ... what
can you do? It was a little diamond. These things happen. But for
him it was wonderful, like a fairy tale, digging, looking for this
treasure in the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress lifts an enormous blue stone, and then a yellow and
then a pink, the aggregate value of the three probably $20 million
or more. She examines each as casually as though it were a lump of
sugar and then replaces it with ostentatious care.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tastes,'' she says, ``don't go to such large pieces. It's
disturbing. It's distracting.'' When a woman wears a piece of
jewelry like that, she adds, cocking her beautiful face slightly,
to calculated effect, ``you don't see the woman.'' There is a
pause. A certain kind of answer is obviously called for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another woman, perhaps,'' Ringler replies. And Catherine
Deneuve permits herself a faint smile.

MARKET WATCH: WALL ST. AND THE POLITICS OF THE STATUS QUO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miami)   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street's political views are usually summed up
with the simple logic that is a staple of junior high math. If all
wealthy people are Republicans, and all bankers and traders are
wealthy, then all bankers and traders are. ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are plenty of exceptions, most notably Robert
E. Rubin, who jumped from running Goldman Sachs to become President
Clinton's Treasury secretary and is now chairman of Citigroup's
executive committee. But for both personal reasons (cut my taxes)
and ideological ones (competition is good, except on investment
banking fees), most financial professionals prefer the Republican
mantra of smaller government programs, less regulation and, of
course, lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This year would seem to be no exception. The Republican
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is offering enough treats
to warm even Gordon Gekko's heart. Bush wants to end the estate
tax, cut income taxes and give people a chance to invest some of
their Social Security taxes in the stock market. Vice President Al
Gore, on the other side of the aisle, prefers tough environmental
regulations and adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, a
step that the drug industry opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wall Street remains strangely tepid about Bush. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   Just this: The last five years have been the best in the history
of the U.S. capital markets. Since the end of 1994, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index has more than tripled, and the value of
United States stocks has risen by more than $10 trillion, to $16
trillion. The Street may be too conservative to thank Bill Clinton
explicitly for its good fortune, but it is well aware that the
federal budget surplus has played an integral role in powering the
market higher.
</P>
<P>
   To finance deficits, the government must sell bonds to
investors, competing for capital that could otherwise be used to
invest in stocks or corporate bonds. Government borrowings raise
long-term interest rates, stifling economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, thanks to tax increases in 1990 and
1993 and relatively restrained government spending, the federal
budget has gone from deficit to surplus. As a result, long-term
interest rates have fallen from 8 percent to less than 6 percent,
after dipping as low as 5 percent in late 1998. With lower interest
rates and lots of capital available, companies of all sizes have
been able to raise the money they need to grow. In turn, strong
economic growth has stimulated consumer spending, raised tax
revenue and increased the government's surplus, making even more
capital available for private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the surplus is not the only reason that the economy has
performed so well lately. Information technology and the explosion
of the Internet have probably been even more important. But
investors are not interested in a return to deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street likes it just as it is and doesn't want to see any
big policy changes,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer
of First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But both Gore and Bush are eager to get their hands on the
surplus for new spending programs and tax cuts. Either move would
be a mistake, said Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. In fact, if the new president is able
to spend the surplus, the Federal Reserve will probably raise
short-term interest rates, Wien said. That's because the Fed is
already worried that the United States economy is growing too fast
and increasing the risk of inflation, and that deficits (or lower
surpluses) will further stimulate the economy in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want either party's program to pass,'' Wien said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agreed. While the Street has a slight preference for
Bush, it would be happiest if neither party controls both the White
House and Congress next year, he said. ``I'd like to see a
Republican president neutralized by a Democratic Congress,'' he
said. ``Give us policy gridlock.''

 &HT;    GREIG FILES: Back to school
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As the school buses rumble though Central Texas,
bevies of backpacks, reams of ruled paper and coveys of crayons
will be on board.
</P>
<P>
   Back to school means the end of campouts and lazy mornings. It
also signals the end of juvenile ennui as parents breathe a
collective sigh of relief. Goodbye, ``I am bored.'' Hello, ``Do we
have any graph paper?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Pavlov's dog, these students will salivate at the feel of
clean, crisp notebooks under their tanned palms and
chlorine-wrinkled fingers and become intoxicated by the aroma of
newly sharpened pencils.
</P>
<P>
   But back to school also signals back to routines and pressures
and late-night wails of ``Mom, I need four empty juice cans in the
morning and a diorama of the Alamo on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   On this last free, albeit frantic, Saturday, let the Greig Files
entertain and inform you. After all, this time next week students
and parents alike will be knee-deep in essays on Eastern Europe and
refrigerated science experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder what the signs of stress in school-age children
really are? Or just how that pencil came to be? Even if you do not
have a child in the impending melee, you just may learn something
for that sought-after appearance on the ``Millionaire'' show. So if
you do not know why pencils are yellow or what the original eight
colors were in the first Crayola box, read on and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a test.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IF YOU HATED YOUR JOB AND HAD TO STAY IN IT FOR 12 YEARS?
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly how some children feel about school, says Lake
Travis psychologist Melanie Horn who specializes in treating
families with school problems.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a daily work environment without much privacy, new tasks
to learn every day and
</P>
<P>
   almost daily reviews from the boss. Yikes! No wonder the school
venue breeds tension in children.
</P>
<P>
   NEED MORE SOURCES FOR STRESS AT BACK-TO-SCHOOL TIME?
</P>
<P>
   Peer pressure, academic pressure and that old bugaboo, parental
expectations, Horn says.
</P>
<P>
   Past social problems with everything from bullying to
persnickety little girls may resurrect like the ghosts of school
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Children want to be liked and accepted (who doesn't?), but
unfortunately, only a few believe that they are. Moving to a new
school (elementary to middle or middle to high) or even a new
school district may trigger homesickness for the last set of
friends and teachers. As children progress throughout the school
system, campuses grow larger; peer groups, more varied.
</P>
<P>
   Academic challenges of the past year may loom large as rumors of
increased work load and no-nonsense teachers gain credibility.
Parental expectations, including the litany of things a child needs
to do to get into a good college, add to internal pressure. Horn's
advice? Love 'em and hug 'em.
</P>
<P>
   MOM, WHY ARE FROGS BORN WITH EXTRA LIMBS?
</P>
<P>
   Stumped by your child's homework? Keep this site for yourself,
mom and dad, kids.infoplease.lycos.com, where the answer to the
frog question can be found. (Scientists believe these
disfigurements are caused by parasitic flatworms and not chemical
pollution or thinning ozone layers.)
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes odd bits to spice up that dry history
essay on the White House, such as the fact that Teddy Roosevelt's
dog, Pete, once pulled the pants off the French ambassador. (It's
always the French ambassador.)
</P>
<P>
   READY FOR SOME NUMBERS? The uproar in your family as the
children head back to school is shared by others. The National
Center for Education Statistics reports there are almost 90,000
public K-12 schools in the United States. In 1998, 46.7 million
students were enrolled in public schools (33.5 million in
pre-kindergarten through eighth grade; 13.2 million in grades 9-12;
the remainder in schools without designated grade levels). In
addition, more than 27,000 private K-12 schools dot the nation with
an enrollment of almost 6 million students.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S A FERRULE?
</P>
<P>
   The little crimped metal on the end of the pencil that holds the
eraser. Thank Philadelphian Hyman Lipman for attaching erasers to
pencils in 1858. According to the Incense Cedar Institute, erasers
were originally called rubbers since they rubbed out marks made by
a pencil. Erasers are made from vinyl or rubber and, to their
manufacturers, are known as plugs when they sit on the end of a
pencil.
</P>
<P>
   WHY ARE 95 PERCENT OF THE PENCILS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES
YELLOW?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1800s, the best graphite came from China. Since yellow is
associated in China with respect, American pencil manufacturers
decided to use yellow to let the world know its pencils were filled
with regal Chinese graphite.
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE LEAD IN THAT LEAD PENCIL?
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   It is graphite and clay. Graphite came into widespread use as a
writing tool in the 16th century. This soft yet brittle substance
was first wrapped in string to make pencils. Eventually it was
slipped into a hand-bored tube inside wooden sticks. Talk about
labor intensive!
</P>
<P>
   So how are pencils made? Wood, usually cedar, is cut into block
and then slats. The slats are stained and grooves are cut into one
surface (see illustration at right). Prepared leads (OK, they are
graphite and clay but are still called leads) are placed in the
grooves. A second slat is placed on the top and bonded with the
first. This pencil sandwich is milled and separated into individual
pencils. Finishing touches (paint, erasers, etc.) are added.

<P>
   WHENCE COMETH CRAYOLA CRAYONS?
</P>
<P>
   Cousins Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith were at the helm of
Peekskill Chemical in New York when teachers clamored for better
materials _ especially a chalk that would not crumble and create
clouds of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Having just developed a new wax crayon to mark crates and
barrels, the cousins were poised to corner the student market. In
1903, the 5-cent box of crayons (non toxic and encased in
hand-rolled labels) hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WAS ALICE THINKING?
</P>
<P>
   You mean Alice Binney, wife of a founder of Binney &AMP; Smith,
makers of the schoolroom staple?
</P>
<P>
   She combined the French word craie (chalk) with ola (oleaginous
because the crayons were made from petroleum-based paraffin) to
coin the name crayon.
</P>
<P>
   WHO THE HECK IS ELMER? Elsie (the Borden symbol) the cow's
husband and the name of glue that has graced school desks since
1947.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at that time the white glue was called Cascorez Glue
and was packaged in glass bottles with ``ice cream pop'' type
wooden sticks attached with a rubber band. It did not take long for
the makers to figure out Cascorez was not a catchy brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Elmer, spokesbull, and Elmer's Glue All.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE BOX _ CRAYOLA FACTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Crayolas are available in 120 colors, including 20 blues, 19
greens, 15 oranges and 13 purples. _ If all the Crayolas made in
one year (3 billion) were laid end to end on the equator, they
would circle the Earth six times (just before melting). _ The
average child will wear down 730 crayons by his 10th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 24-count box is the best seller, although box sizes
include 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96 and 120.
</P>
<P>
   JOT THIS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   _ One pencil can write 45,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pencil comes from the Latin ``penicillum,'' a paintbrush.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approximately 110 million gross of pencils are manufactured
every year in the world (a gross equals 144 _ math majors, start
multiplying).
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Grapes of Wrath'' author John Steinbeck used as many as 60
cedar pencils every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Edison kept a 3-inch pencil in his vest pocket to jot
down ideas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pencils made from tropical rain forest wood have a brownish
color with little red or dark brown flecks.
</P>
<P>
   _ A typical pencil can draw a line 35 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   AND DON'T EVER RUN WITH THEM . . .
</P>
<P>
   Scissors, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Scissors are a step up from cutting things with stones like
prehistoric man did. Scissors have been found in ancient Egypt and
Italy. Shepherds cut wool; craftsmen adorned them with metal
inlays. Englishman Benjamin Hustler of Sheffield produced quality
shears of steel in the 1740s. The word is derived from the Middle
English sisoures.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS OF STRESS IN CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   _ The mantra: ``I hate school. I do not want to go to school.''
_ Crying frequently before school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Physical complaints such as stomachaches and headaches. _
Irritability or snapping at people _ Loss of interest in things
that used to be fun. _ Changes in eating, sleeping and energy
level, general lethargy. _ Look of sadness or worry. _ Change in
sleeping patterns (including increased number of nightmares,
inability to sleep).
</P>
<P>
   HELPING KIDS COPE
</P>
<P>
   _ Be cognizant of a child's strengths and weaknesses. _ Listen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not downplay or dismiss the child's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not jump in immediately with a lecture. _ Listen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investigate what is going on at school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to understand the child's point of view. _ Listen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have your child evaluated for academic or physical problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acknowledge the child's progress and comment on successes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen.
</P>
<P>
   READ MY LIPS: NO NEW HOMEWORK EXCUSES
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, librarians and coaches have heard every excuse under
the sun for why books are not returned, homework is not handed in
or equipment is missing. To save students time this year, here are
a few excuses Zilker Librarian Jackie Kraal and fifth-grade teacher
Rebecca Lang have heard that have been used already.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is always the truth: ``My (your pet here) ate
it'' as well as the bizarre ``My sister could not find her same
assignment from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It's in my aunt's boyfriend's truck.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's in my aunt's boyfriend's truck, and he just sold it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The family printer did not work.
</P>
<P>
   _ My mom's computer is not compatible with my dad's computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ I pushed ``save,'' but the computer did not save it.
</P>
<P>
   _ I gave it to (person's name here) to hand in, and he did not
do it.
</P>
<P>
   _ I had it in my hand, but I left it in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ My mom is reading the book.
</P>
<P>
   _ My parents did not put it in my backpack. I switched
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ My dad tore it up because it did not look important.
</P>
<P>
   _ It fell out of my binder.
</P>
<P>
   _ I left it in the car, at home, at a friend's house, in the
other backpack, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ We had to go out to eat.
</P>
<P>
   _ I took the wrong books home.
</P>
<P>
   _ I did not have a pencil at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has been recycled.
</P>
<P>
   _ My (dad, mom) took it to work.
</P>
<P>
   _ We had to go shopping, and I got home late.
</P>
<P>
   _ It blew away.
</P>
<P>
   STICK WITH ME: ELMER'S FACTS
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 47 million elementary school students use Elmer's
Glue on a weekly basis. _ Elmer's Glue is white because of the
natural reaction of the raw materials used to make the glue. _
Elmer's Glue was used to build a pasta bridge supporting 2,350
pounds. The bridge was built by a high school student and was the
winning entry in a pasta-bridge building contest held in Rhode
Island. _ The strength of the glue bond is due to the attachment of
the polymer adhesive to the surface of the piece to be glued.

   TRAFICANT-RENO _ Ohio Congressman James Traficant has long used
his mouth as a weapon of destruction, but rarely has his vitriol
been this personal. On a Fox News national news program Wednesday
Traficant levied a variety of sordid allegations against Attorney
General Janet Reno _ from mafia-supplied call girls to substance
abuse _ claiming secret affidavits that he refused to release.
Reno, in an unusually strong reaction, said people in public office
have to endure all sorts of nasty comments, but these are some of
the most nasty, unsubstantiated comments she has ever heard.
Traficant himself has said he is about to be indicted on federal
charges, raising questions about the real reason for his public
broadside against the Justice Department. (Montgomery, Cox News

   CAMILLA-VICTIMS _ Six months after a tornado struck Camilla,

   GRAPES _ BOONVILLE, N.C. _ In the four decades he's grown
tobacco, Frank Hopson never worried about the rising and setting of
the sun. ``Tobacco's a weed,'' and will grow just about anywhere,
he always figured. But now one of a fast growing number of North
Carolina farmers growing grapes to supply area vineyards,
57-year-old Hopson has learned to pay attention to sunshine and
other considerations critical to growing sweet, firm grapes. The
payoff? A crop that agricultural experts say won't replace North
Carolina's embattled, nearly billion-dollar-a-year crop, but one
that is acre for acre as profitable as tobacco.

   SOUTHERN-TOBACCO _ LEXINGTON, Ky. _ Southern tobacco farmers are
nervous. Growers in Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee
and South Carolina farm 90 percent of the domestic crop. But a $145
billion anti-tobacco verdict in Florida has many wondering whether
this is the straw that's broken Joe Camel's back. Will they turn to
catfish farms and grape vineyards or car sales? We check and see.

   RUSSIA-PYRAMID-$ADV13 _ MOSCOW _ Looking like something straight

suddenly around a bend off

<P>
   Moscow's northbound highway. Lines outside it attest to its
reputation of a Mecca of the paranormal. According to its builder,
a new celebrity among Russian faith-healers and astrologists, the
pyramid can bring peace and harmony to the world, can prolong life
and heal disease. All you have to do, he says, is believe. And
thousands of Russians, bored or disenchanted with traditional
religions, do. (Coker, Cox News Service).

   COSTARICA-CRIME-$ADV13 _ SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ Long admired as

countries, Costa Rica has hit a

<P>
   bad patch recently with a crime wave that is threatening its
reputation and the peace of mind of its
</P>

   CHINA-DEMOCRACY-$ADV13 _ QIUBAN VILLAGE, China _ Just about
every single one of this watermelon-growing village's 444 eligible
voters turned out to cast a ballot for the village chief. They had
a choice between a mini-bus driver, a shop owner and a fellow
farmer. That the election took place in China is a sign to some -
especially those at the Carter Center, who are working with China
on standardizing village elections _ that this communist country is
on a slow but steady course towards democracy. To others, village
elections are but a cynical gambit by the central leadership to
maintain control over the massive rural
</P>

   UPS _ When UPS formed an insurance company in Bermuda in 1983 to
be owned by employees, there was no indication the participants had
any idea they had just set in motion a series of events that would
culminate 16 years later in a punishing U.S. Tax Court ruling that
found UPS had committed a ``sham transaction.'' As a result, the
company may now be forced to pay the IRS one of the largest bills
in tax history - up to $2.3 billion in back taxes, interest and
penalties. UPS has appealed the ruling and the 11th Circuit
considers it next month. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

promises. What challenges does it face today? (Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   PHONES _ ATLANTA _Local telephone service, the rather boring
plain jane element in communications compared to go-go cell phones
and red-hot long distance services, has suddenly become a new
battleground. Many players are emerging to take on BellSouth, none
more eager than the cable giant,
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne, backed by its tentative parent, AT&AMP;T. Yes, AT&AMP;T, old
Ma Bell who used to be everybody's phone company. The move by the
cable company into phones, oddly enough, is being helped along by
BellSouth, mostly in obedience to federal legislation. (Kanell,

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ Before I made that dash

drink to sip on the way home, or be 65 cents ahead tomorrow. I
decided I needed the change more than the soda. As I pulled out of

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Undermined by votes in the Knesset and betrayed
by a one-time coalition partner in filling the nation's figurehead
presidency, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been left holding an
empty political bag. The question now is whether Barak, after a
series of political defections, can cobble together a functioning

in October and makes a final decision on its preliminary vote to
call early elections. (Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVES THURSDAY.

   TRAVEL-MIDWAY _ MIDWAY ATOLL _ It hardly seems possible that the
three tiny islands that comprise this atoll, lily pads floating

Eva Rutland used a typewriter, she'd sometimes discover that it had
run out of paper. It wasn't that her concentration was so rapt _ or
that her story was so steamy. Eva Rutland is blind. She may not be
a household name like Barbara Cartland. But this 83-year-old

   INTERNET-SECURITY _ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's

   FIRE-POLICY _ Smokey Bear's done his job. Perhaps too well in
the tinder-dry West. The U.S. Forest Service mascot who cheers the
notion of preventing forest fires succeeded in instilling fear of
fire into generations of Americans. But he may also have cast a
stigma on a land management tool that maybe could have diminished
the fuels - overgrown brush and trees that have grown unchecked for
decades - that have fed this summer's burns. ``We have been in the
mode to suppress,'' said Martha Ketelle, supervisor of the White
River National Forest. ``We have seen a buildup of fuels on most
national forests as a result of the policy.'' (Grand Junction Daily

   TIREDEATHS _ WEST PALM BEACH _ Ten people were killed in tire

of the fatalities can be linked to Firestone tires, according to
the medical examiner's office. In two other accidents in which
three people were killed, the type of tire is unknown and could
have been Firestones. The number of people killed in tire blowout
crashes in the county is ``not that staggering,'' said forensics
supervisor Bill Pellan. What is unusual is that three of the 46
deaths linked to Firestone tires nationwide occurred here, he said.

know borders. As a result, medicine is one of the prime areas of
cooperation between Arabs and Jews. A Palm Beach, Fla. infectious
disease specialist Sandford Kuvin has been exploiting that fact to
try to stamp out a widespread, and often fatal, parasitic disease,
Leishmaniasis. At the Jerusalem-based Kuvin Centre for the Study of
Infectious and Tropical Diseases, several Arab students work under
Israeli professors in researching the disease throughout Israel and
the West Bank. The students are among the Palestinians first
home-grown class of doctors. The center, recognized by the United
Nations, has projects from Israel to Tunisia and has been able to
navigate around the region's politics. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ ``Unless we take action now, our
nation may confront a situation similar to the Great Depression _
and maybe even worse.'' The presidential candidate who made this
frightening prediction is lying low. His political party, however,
currently has a high profile. It is being torn apart from within.
It turns out that Ross Perot's leadership was not needed to save
America from another Great Depression. But Perot may be needed to
keep his Reform Party from crumbling to pieces. (Rowland Nethaway

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ ATLANTA _ As a born and
bred Southsider I can't help but get a chuckle out of the Great
Pink Flamingo Controversy north of here. In case you haven't been
following major news events lately, here's the story. Doug and
Ellen Henry bought a home in what I take to be a subdivision.
Hoping to spruce up their front yard, which likely had been left
bare of trees by greedy developers, they paid $15 each for a pair
of pink flamingos. They described the colorful birds as ``lawn
decoration.'' Their neighbors, certainly not Southern-born, thought
the colorful birds were tacky eyesores. (Jim Minter is a former

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Texas _ When Al Gore introduced his new
running mate Tuesday _ Joseph Lieberman, America's first Jewish

The theme of the party: ``Isn't it great that we live in America,
where such a thing can happen?'' Meanwhile, in the months and weeks
leading up to the election, as the two major parties moved
inexorably to the nomination of yet another daring combination of
Four White Guys, I've found myself asking a different question:
``This is America! Why can't we get some semblance of diversity on
the ticket?''(McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

<P>
   TXOUT-LEGGETT _ I miss bullfrogs and I wish they'd come back.
From where, I don't know. I just know they're gone and with them
one of the few nighttime activities in a country kid's life that
was both fun and legal. There was no limit. You could hunt at
night. Ammunition was free if you caught them by hand. What a
world. (Leggett, Austin American-Statesman)

</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-PUBLIC _ Texas has permits. Texas has draw hunts. And
Texas has open areas, all for public hunters who might not have
their own place leased every fall. One things the Parks and
Wildlife Commission has done in recent years is expand the public
hunting program, both through extra opportunity on state land and
through cooperative efforts with private landowners. (Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-PARKS _ Whether it's the sight of a jaguarundi at
Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park or a faint ochre shaman
drawing on a cave wall at Seminole Canyon, Texas state parks offer
unique opportunities for visitors. You can camp, hike, fish and
even hunt in Texas parks. And even though some of the best ones are
well-known throughout the state, there are others that have their
own special charm and are just waiting to be discovered by the
masses. (Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-GEAR _ It would be interesting to be a billionaire for a
day, just to see how long I could shop for new stuff without
getting tired. I expect the World Bank might have to be called in
to assess the damage, though, because there's if there's anything
better than buying new gear for hunting season, it's buying new
gear and not having to worry about how much it costs or if there's
a warehouse that can hold it. (Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-POINT _ Shorty Powers is no shrinking violet. In fact,
you'd better WANT him to have your phone number, because if he
thinks you can help him get disabled individuals outdoors, he's
going to call. And call again. The Dallas resident, himself a
paraplegic in a wheelchair, was the founder of POINT, Paraplegics
On Independent Nature Trips. Through hard work and sheer force of
will, Powers has pushed the cause to the forefront in Texas. He's
been able to involve Texas parks and Wildlife and other
organizations in offering outdoor opportunities of every kind.
(Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-LICEN _ The first license I ever bought cost a quarter and I
didn't even need it unless I was going to hunt deer. Squirrels and
birds were free and the two deer tags _ bucks only _ were just a
vanity thing, since there aren't that many in the river bottoms
where we grew up. Times have changed since then. The license costs
more, of course, even though it's still fairly cheap. On the
license now there are five deer tags, four turkey tags, a redfish
tag, your federal Harvest Information Program data and a partridge
in a pear tree. (Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-DOVES _ Our shooting ability aside, dove season is always
good in Texas. The number of birds in any given field may vary, but
hunter success does very little, according to Jay Roberson, dove
program leader for Texas Parks and Wildlife. Texas hunters numbered
about 390,000 last year and spent an average of 1.3 days each in
the field. They killed about 11 birds per person, not bad in a
sport where the national average is about one dove per every five
shells. (Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-RECIPES _ I hate to hear anyone say that wild game,
especially doves, tastes gamy and they don't like it. Dove breasts,
grilled or fried, is one of God's chosen favorites. The only thing
you have to do is cook it. (Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-MEASURES _ Successful shotgun shooting is so simple. But
if that's the case, then why don't more people do it well? Because
they make some simple mistakes. According to one successful shooter
and teacher, there are three fairly easy problems to identify, even
if it's not always easy to do away with them. ``The very first
thing, the most common thing people do is they stop the gun when
the trigger is pulled,'' said Leon Measures. The Coldspring
resident has developed a basic shooting course called ``Shoot Where
You Look.'' He uses air rifles and repetition to teach better
shooting. (Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-WOMEN _ Hunting and fishing are wonderful ways to spend
time outdoors. The biggest problem, it seems, is getting started.
People who get the chance to go when they're young, tend to stick
with it. However, it's much harder to recruit adults into the
outdoor world. The folks at Texas Parks and Wildlife learned that
long ago and besides having programs directed at youngsters the
agency has set its sights on women with a program called ``Becoming
an Outdoors Woman.'' (Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUTBIRDS _ Birding is an inexpensive, simple and exciting way
to increase your time outdoors. It can turn a park into an oasis or
mean four dull hours in a deer stand pass faster than they ever
have. There are no seasons other than the ones imposed by the birds
themselves. It works everywhere, from your backyard to wilderness
areas. And if you're a beginner, you probably are farther along
than you might think. ``When I first started, I was amazed at how
many birds I already knew,'' said John Szypula, executive director
of the Audubon Society in Austin. ``I knew blue jays and cardinals
and chickadees. And most people already know quite a bit about it.
Once they get started, their interest really perks up.'' (Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-SEASON _ Throw in feral hogs and pigeons and Texas hunting
is a year-round sport. Still, most of us tend to think of seasons s
starting with dove season in late summer and ending with turkey
season in spring. For formal hunting periods, that's a long time,
slightly more than eight months altogether. (Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-YOUTH _ Tradition is the foundation upon which hunting is
built. Hunting leases, guns and even secret places to hunt have
been passed down from one generation to the next, providing a
continuity that's rare in any other sport. But the changing face of
America _ single-parent families, urbanization, time demands from
work and other leisure activities _ have cut into the tradition of
youngsters following parents and grandparents into the field.
(Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TXOUT-WHITE-WING _ White-winged doves are not the bird of peace.
Once thought to be a bird limited by weather and constitution to
the Lower Rio Grande Valley, the whitewing has exhibited a unique
ability to find suitable living conditions almost anywhere. They
may be pushing out other species as they move, too. (Austin

   FISHING-DRUGFREE _ The crowd was awed as 7-year-old Travis Dwire

16-inch bass and I reeled it in all by myself!'' Travis and his
sisters Casey and Lindsay were among 175 children and parents who

`AUTUMN IN NEW YORK': MAY-DECEMBER ROMANCE, OR SIMPLY HOT AND
COLD? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it were 1940, ``Autumn in New York,'' a flagrantly
old-fashioned, triple-hankie tear-jerker that might have starred
Bette Davis and Cary Grant, would probably be lauded as a serious,
high-minded romance, the quintessence of ennobling adult
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But time has played nasty tricks on a genre that aims straight
for the tear ducts. Nowadays when audiences sense that a movie as
shameless as ``Autumn in New York'' intends to ennoble them with
tears and redemption, only the most die-hard sentimentalists will
fail to smell a rat.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably one reason ``Autumn in New York'' opened Friday
without advance press screenings and despite the public expression
of disappointment by its two stars, Richard Gere and Winona Ryder,
over the studio's marketing decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gere plays Will Keane, a superstar New York chef and legendary
womanizer. Ryder is Charlotte Fielding, the ailing, doe-eyed young
designer of kooky hats who reforms him. Shortly after their affair
begins, Charlotte informs Will that she is suffering from an
extremely rare and probably terminal heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about medical anomalies! In the classic triple-hankie
tradition, Charlotte is the picture of sparkling vitality and fun
until she has sudden fainting spells (always at crucial dramatic
moments and at picturesque locations like the ice rink at
Rockefeller Center).
</P>
<P>
   She also has an improbably stiff upper lip. Although there's a
small chance her life could be saved through a risky operation (she
has less than a year to live), she refuses to have it, because she
doesn't want to entertain false hope.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the fact that Will is more than twice
Charlotte's age. He's (gasp!) 48 to her 22, something that is
repeatedly pounded home by Will's bartender John (Anthony
LaPaglia). One of the movie's two official scolds, John warns Will
that if he goes on like this, he might end up, God forbid, dying in
his own arms.
</P>
<P>
   John's dire warnings are raspingly seconded by Charlotte's
crusty old grandmother and official guardian, Dolly (Elaine
Stritch). Both of Charlotte's parents died in a mysterious accident
many years earlier. Way, way back in the 1960s, we learn, Will
actually dated Charlotte's mother. But such is the movie's prim
sense of propriety that the screenplay goes out of its way to let
us know that Will never actually had sex with the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Will was supposedly a true child of the '60s whose favorite
singer was (you'll never guess!) Stephen Stills. When the name is
dropped, Charlotte draws a blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn in New York'' once and for all certifies Gere as a
romantic ``older man'' in the mode of the 1950s and '60s Cary
Grant. In fact, the two have much in common. Both exude an
unflappable suavity under which percolates a hidden, enigmatic
sexuality. But unlike Grant's typical romantic heroes, who were
vaguely upper-class and vaguely British, Gere's Will has the
slightly roguish air of the self-made newly rich man up from the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   With her high-strung energy and saucer-eyed precocity, Ryder's
Charlotte is upper-middle-class all the way. The chemistry between
these two is less than scintillating. But in their best moments
together, Gere sheds his wariness to express a sad world-weary
tenderness, while Ryder's slightly shrill, pouty bravado melts, and
her frightened doe eyes appear caught in metaphysical headlights.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie, directed by Joan Chen, exhibits a loving eye for
New York exteriors, it's undone by its own rigidly old-fashioned
conventions. Allison Burnett's screenplay does a creditable job of
filling out the characters (Charlotte's a blunt truth-teller and
Will a sneaky and evasive liar), and depicting their love affair,
which Will blithely sabotages more than once.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's tentative psychological realism clashes lethally
with its soft-focused medical vagueness and refusal to confront the
physical realities of illness. Today we know too much about the
body to accept the notion embraced by ``Autumn in New York'' that
dying makes you more beautiful by giving you a heavenly glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn in New York'' is rated PG-13 (parents strongly
cautioned). It has sexual situations.
</P>

 &HT;    Multiple factors contribute to record fire season
 &HT;    By Marija B. Vader
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIFLE, Colo. _ Smokey Bear's done his job.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps too well in the tinder-dry West.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service mascot who cheers the notion of
preventing forest fires has instilled fear of fire into generations
of Americans. But he may also have cast a stigma on a land
management tool that maybe could have diminished the fuels _
overgrown brush and trees that have grown unchecked for decades _
that have fed this summer's burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in the mode to suppress,'' said Martha Ketelle,
supervisor of the White River National Forest. ``We have seen a
buildup of fuels on most national forests as a result of the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Add drought, dry lightning and people moving to the forests, and
the result is an unprecedented fire season in the American West. So
far, more than 64,000 individual fires have torched 4.3 million
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fires have caused heartache for many Americans,
overshadowing the good fires, especially those deliberately set by
land managers, can bring to the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never our intent to suppress all fires,'' said Dan
Hormaechea, a planner with the White River National Forest. ``That
became convoluted at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer's fires have led some to question fire management
policies of federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and
Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on conditions, officials spark what they call
``prescribed burns,'' or controlled fires, to eliminate overgrowth
of trees and brush and to replenish animal habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Before a controlled burn can be set, officials have to work
through a bureaucratic maze of public hearings and environmental
studies. Once that's done, they have to wait for the perfect
conditions _ the right relative humidity, fuel moisture content and
winds _ before they can light the match.
</P>
<P>
   The process can easily become bogged down, sometimes taking
years to resolve, said Faye Christiansen of the Eastern Idaho
Interagency Fire Management Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part is, by the time you get through the environmental
assessment and the different hoops, you've got another year or two
of fuel buildup,'' said Christiansen. ``It just takes a long time
to get things processed.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of such delays can be seen in the vicinity of Vail,
where mountain pine bark beetle, mistletoe and disease have killed
thousands of trees. They are ripe for lightning-struck fires, but
environmentalists and others block their removal by opposing
logging and controlled burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people claim that's part of nature _ the cycle Mother
Nature takes,'' Hormaechea said. ``That's all well and fine, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, fuels mount.
</P>
<P>
   Cheatgrass, an insidious culprit in fast-spreading wildfires,
covers the West. Other fuels, like pinon juniper, pine and aspen
trees, continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on conditions, when wildfires move through an area,
they're likely to travel faster through tall brush and trees,
hopping from treetop to treetop with the winds.
</P>
<P>
   And the farther the fire is from the ground, the more difficult
it is to control and contain, said Robert Storch, supervisor of the
Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison national forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the tree canopy touching one another, it's easy
for the fire to run along the tops of the trees,'' Storch said. ``A
broken pattern will break the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a critical situation right now,'' he said. ``For
western Colorado, this is the worst I've seen it in nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   Controlled burns earn a bad reputation when firefighters lose
control, such as what happened in May at Los Alamos, N.M.,
Hormaechea said.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Alamos, U.S. Park Service officials at Bandelier National
Monument started a fire to clear brush, but 50-mph winds quickly
blew it out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The fire forced 25,000 people to flee, burned 47,560 acres and
left more than 200 families homeless.
</P>
<P>
   One month later, the fire was extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an event like Los Alamos, people always question
fire management,'' Hormaechea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't see the red flags, they didn't heed the
warnings,'' Hormaechea said of park service officials. ``You always
have to err on the safe side.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 2.3-million-acre White River National Forest, fire
management plans for specific areas are incorporated into the new
forest plan set to be adopted in six months, Hormaechea said.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas may include controlled burns, some do not, he added,
but protecting life and property is ``always a given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we have a prescription that says otherwise, we put them
out,'' Storch said of the GMUG forests.
</P>
<P>
   The forest service is now taking inventory of fuels and
vegetation in the GMUG. With that, the prescription rule will be
incorporated into the new GMUG forest plan now under development,
Storch said.
</P>
<P>
   Storch and his staff analyze aerial photos to determine current
vegetation compared with trees and shrubs of the late 1930s and
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding vegetation conditions have changed dramatically,
especially with our shrub types,'' Storch said. ``The canopy cover
has increased tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire suppression has become a science, Hormaechea said, far more
sophisticated than when Indians roamed the plains.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been dramatic. Between 1919 and 1929, an
average of 29 million acres burned each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the average has been 3.6 million acres per
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the longer history, fire played a much larger role than it
does now,'' Hormaechea said.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire used to do its own thing,'' she said. ``Massive forests
could burn, but there was no population there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a few thousand people, but not millions,'' Christiansen
said.
</P>
<P>
   People want to suppress fires now because the forest has become
much more populated than in the early 1900s, Christiansen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the vegetation right up close to their home so
people can't see in,'' Christiansen said. ``People want to get away
from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably partially our Smokey Bear's fault that people
have a real fear of many kinds of fire,'' Hormaechea said. ``But
that may not be legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   When done properly at the right time of year, controlled burns
are effective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A summer like this, there needs to be a fear of fire,''
Hormaechea said. ``It's so dry, whether it's human or
lightning-caused, you've got to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncontrollable,'' he said.

ALIEN SPECIES HAVE ECOSCIENTISTS IN A QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Giant American bullfrogs are marauding through the
mud ponds of British Columbia, while a scheme that critics claim
amounts to ``ethnic cleansing of fish'' may soon eradicate
countless trout from a Rocky Mountain lake that is one of Canada's
most famous landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   It's adding up to a rough summer for aquatic species in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although not directly connected, the devastation wrought by
aggressive ``alien'' bullfrogs and the controversial plan to
restore the bull-trout to its original habitats in Alberta _ after
first annihilating the ``introduced'' breeds that have taken over _
represent two sides of a dilemma that is plaguing even relatively
pristine Canada: What to do when outside species upset nature's
balance?
</P>
<P>
   For now, little is being done to combat the surge of bullfrogs
in British Columbia. But at Banff National Park in Alberta,
scientists are preparing to take an ambitious, activist approach,
seeking to turn back the ecological clock by large scale slaughter
of fish brought there by humans _ perhaps using massive
electroshocks or poison _ to allow the return of the bull-trout.
</P>
<P>
   But first the frogs.
</P>
<P>
   There are few things more Canadian than agonizing over the
prospect of being swallowed by the big neighbor to the south. But a
researcher at the University of Victoria has gathered evidence that
the threat is only too literal for indigenous Canadian frog species
inhabiting the ponds and small lakes of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   American bullfrogs, brought to the region over the years as
stock for frogleg farms or as living ornaments for garden ponds,
have lately started wreaking havoc on native species. They are
devouring smaller Canadian tree frogs and red-legged frogs at
alarming rates, says frog researcher Purnima Govindarajulu, who has
charted the invasion in a study that started in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullfrog is a handsome frog, but such a predator,''
Govindarajulu said of the bug-eyed, banjo-voiced critter that has
become amphibian enemy No. 1 on Vancouver Island. ``When their
population expands, it expands very quickly _ about five kilometers
a year in the Victoria area.''
</P>
<P>
   Local frogs, having no experience of the big bullying American,
become easy prey for the invader, which has taken over scores of
lakes and ponds in southwestern regions of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Govindarajulu said the first American bullfrogs were brought to
the region in the 1930s by aspiring frogleg farmers or pond owners
seeking an exotic addition to the cattails and lily pads. Over the
past few years, for reasons not yet understood, the newcomers have
started gorging on their fellow frogs at a rate that could wipe out
the two most common local species.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure if there's been a new introduction of
bullfrogs, or if something else changed,'' said Govindarajulu _
who, in keeping with an activist trend among some ecoscientists, is
monitoring the bullfrog populations in three of the lakes in her
six-lake study, while systematically killing off the bullfrogs in
the others to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at how effectively we can control them,''
Govindarajulu told the Canadian Press news agency. ``Or if we can
control them.''
</P>
<P>
   High in the Rocky Mountains, meanwhile, a plan to save one
species of fish by destroying others is winning praise from
environmentalists but drawing flak from anglers, animal lovers, and
taxpapyer groups.
</P>
<P>
   With its turqoise waters ringed by spectacular snowcapped peaks,
Moraine Lake in Banff National Park is one of Canada's great
natural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kind of fish living beneath that beautiful, clear
water are not representative of the original ecosystem,'' said
Charles Zinkan, director of mountain national parks for Parks
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas of how to manage national parks in both Canada and the
United States have changed drastically in recent years. Until a
decade or so ago, there was nothing unusual about Banff's practice
of stocking lakes with outside species more pleasing to anglers. As
a result, native bull-trout populations have been all but destroyed
by brook trout and rainbow-cutthroat trout hybrids. Not a single
bull-trout presently survives in Moraine Lake.
</P>
<P>
   But under a new mandate, Parks Canada is seeking to restore
Banff and other national parks to their original state as much as
possible. For Moraine Lake, that means bringing home the
bull-trout. But park officials believe the more vulnerable species
will survive only if competing trout are ``removed from the natural
equation,'' as Zinkan delicately put it.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the poisons, electrical jolts, and giant drag nets
come in. Those are some of the methods being weighed by Parks
Canada to eradicate the introduced species. But a plan to blast the
brook and rainbow trout to oblivion with dynamite was recently
withdrawn after a huge public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists applaud the concept of bringing back the
bull-trout. ``It would be nice to keep a few lakes in their natural
state for long-term reference,'' said David Schindler, a University
of Alberta ecologist and one of Canada's foremost wildlife experts.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics call the government scheme preposterous, even
cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Real Fishing magazine blasted the plan as ``trout genocide,''
animal rights groups maintain it will cause suffering for the
targeted trout, while the Canadian Taxpayers Federation called it
an appalling waste of public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tax dollars for the ethnic cleansing of fish,'' fumed
federation director Walter Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Nontheless, the eradication program may begin this fall. Once
all the other trout are killed, there will be a wait of four years
_ basically, to ensure they stay killed _ before the bull-trout are
reintroduced from the handful of mountain lakes in which they still
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are removing trout and putting in trout,'' said Craig
Ritchie, editor of Real Fishing. ``You end up with the same thing _
trout in a lake.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government believes the project serves an ecologically
noble end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to restore an indigenous population, to bring a
lake back more closely to what it was,'' Zinkan said. ``There seems
some public misunderstanding of that concept.''

AIR FRANCE CONCORDES TO REMAIN GROUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's transportation minister reiterated Friday that
Air France's five remaining Concordes would stay grounded for the
time being because of continuing uncertainty about why the
supersonic jet caught fire last month and crashed north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, issued a statement after
meeting with investigators looking into the cause of the crash and
said they had informed him that at this point in the inquiry they
believe that `'the initial cause of the accident is the destruction
of the internal forward tire of the main left wheel carriage.'' The
tire's destruction, he said, produced ``catastrophic consequences
in a very brief period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister's statement came one day after investigators from
the Bureau of Accident Investigations confirmed that a 16-inch
strip of metal found on the runway after the crash had punctured
one of the jet's tires, turning chunks of rubber into fast-flying
projectiles that caused a major fuel leak and fire to occur before
the plane even left the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the beginning, French investigators have been
working on the broad assumption that at least one tire burst,
triggering a chain of events that included damage to the plane's
structure, a fire and engine failure that led to the plane's crash
on July 25 shortly after takeoff, and the deaths of 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   But Gayssot said Friday that investigators still did not know
the sequence of those events, how they might have been connected or
how they might ultimately have caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways has continued flying its seven Concordes, and
Gayssot said he would begin talking to British aviation authorities
about joint measures to be taken in light of the investigation's
preliminary results.

DOING GRASS ONE BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13.)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you a poor fool who mows the lawn on a hill so steep you
have to pull the mower back up on a rope? And then your back goes
out and you have to be hauled off on a stretcher?
</P>
<P>
   That hill needs a ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies if you are bashing into your trees with that
mower. Stop, unless you want to kill them. Plant a ground cover
from the tree's trunk clear to its drip line. Or even farther, if
you would like a sustainable, low-maintenance landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell you a lot of horticultural heresy,'' Jim
Glover said, brandishing a pot of golden creeping Jenny (Lysimachia
nummularia Aurea), a sun lover that can form a carpet of little
round, golden leaves in areas too wet for a lawn. ``Rip up your
lawns! Forget about flowers! You can get as big a bang for your
buck with foliage _ for nine months of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   I've been happily brainwashed by Glover and his brother, Rob,
who started Glover Perennial Growers three years ago out in
Mattituck, N.Y., where you can still sniff the salt breezes over
the potato fields. Rob runs the business end of things, and Jim
heads the propagation in 32 greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-year-old wholesale business is thriving because a
plant-hungry public wants new perennials and alternatives to grass.
Not only is grass often unsuited to wet or shady areas, but it
needs to be doused with chemicals to stay lush and green, unlike
many ground covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, you had to push new stuff,'' Jim Glover said.
``Now, people say: `New? Oh, give me new!'''
</P>
<P>
   Some are new cultivars of old favorites like Ajuga, or
bugleweed, which is usually associated with spoon-shaped purplish
leaves and little blue flowers that bloom from May through June.
But now, even the classic types of Ajuga have interesting
variations: Gaiety's purple leaves are highly glossed and crinkled;
Jungle Beauty has highly textured, mahogany-purple leaves, and its
blue flowers are 10 inches tall; Chocolate Chip has cute, smaller
leaves that form a dense cover; and there's a real oddball named
Mini Crispa Red, which has crispy wrinkled bronze leaves that curl
inward to form little buns. It's not a spreader, like some Ajugas,
and rock gardeners can't get enough of this weirdo.
</P>
<P>
   Glover also grows unusual perennials like golden box-leaf
honeysuckle (Lonicera nitida Baggesen's Gold), a shrubby spreading
evergreen that grows to 3 feet, with tiny, brilliant yellow,
fern-shaped leaves. Its foliage turns red in winter, but it doesn't
like full sun, so Glover suggests using it to highlight a bed of
purple-leaf Ajuga.
</P>
<P>
   The Glovers' greenhouses look like quilts of many colors and
textures: burgundy, chartreuse, blue green, grass green, tawny and
gold; soft mats of tiny rounded leaves, leathery, crinkled ones,
billowy grasses that wave in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads me to the versatile Carex family, with roughly 2,000
species of sedge. Somewhere in that range is a plant that can
tolerate almost any condition. Ice Dance, for instance, which has
leathery 12-inch green leaves with creamy white margins, loves the
sun and forms such a dense cover you'll never see a weed. The
Beatles is a green mop top that loves wet conditions. So does
Bowles Golden, a large clump-forming sedge that grows 18 to 30
inches tall; its glowing yellow foliage lights up dark spaces, and
it's perfect for the mucky edge of a pond. Carex flacca, an
intensely blue sedge that grows 6 to 12 inches tall, tolerates salt
and drought.
</P>
<P>
   Glover also recommends an unusual Japanese forest grass
(Hakoneckloa macra Aureola) with bamboo-like weeping foliage. The
leaves are yellow with a green stripe and turn intense pink-red in
the fall, lighting up the area beneath a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Some ground covers are being rediscovered, like lily of the
valley and Kenilworth ivy (Cymbalaria muralis), a Victorian creeper
with tiny lavender viola-like flowers that loves to grow on shady
stone walls.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a sucker for creepers that grow in and around stepping
stones and in the cracks of old brick terraces, and Glover is
experimenting with a number of marginally hardy types like Cotula
squalida Platts Black, or New Zealand Brass Buttons, which has soft
deeply dissected black leaves with a touch of green. It has little
yellow buttonlike flowers in summer and tolerates light foot
traffic. If you live in Zone 7 (zero degrees) or higher, try it
among your stepping stones.
</P>
<P>
   Mazus reptans is another good one for the walkway, especially if
the soil is moist. It forms a 2-inch carpet of bright green with
little blue or white flowers, and it's tough enough to thrive under
the weight of Morgan, the Glovers' hefty Labrador, who likes to nap
on its cool cushion. Another stepping-stone cover that takes light
foot traffic is dwarf shamrock, Oxalis magellanica Nelson, which
has little white double flowers.
</P>
<P>
   West Coast strawberries are taking hold on the East Coast,
because they thrive in sandy soil and form a dense cover that
prevents erosion. The red stems are beautiful, but the berries are
kind of dry, so if you want to graze on your ground cover, grow an
old favorite like Fort Laramie, Ozark Beauty or Quinault.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an evergreen creeping raspberry called Rubus
calycinoides, with tough leaves that turn red in the fall and
winter. It bears orange raspberries, full size and sweet, in
midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Since Glover Perennials is a wholesaler, you can't drive up its
sandy lane to buy plants, but they are sold in fine garden centers
in New York and Connecticut. Many other growers are propagating
these same varieties, so ask for them at your local nursery.

RACE ON TO REPLACE U.N. REFUGEES COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The highest-ranking U.N. official responsible
for refugees plans to retire at the end of the year, and a race is
on to find a replacement within the next month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates seem willing to take on the job, even though
it is being redefined by an era of civil wars whose combatants have
often turned their guns on aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 30 million people driven from their homes and
needing help in Europe, Africa and Asia, the job of the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees has become one of the world's most
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade _ through conflicts from Bosnia to Congo to
East Timor _ the position has been held by Sadako Ogata of Japan,
who studied at Georgetown and Berkeley and was dean of foreign
studies at Sophia University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure, Ogata said in a recent interview, she has
been forced to be fund-raiser, logistics expert, security provider
and administrator of a large bureaucracy, all the while trying to
pursue and protect her primary role of refugee advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Geneva, she has perennially been on the move from
crisis to crisis. Often she has had to defend her agency against
critics who say that it moves too slowly, as in the Kosovo crisis,
or that it fails to stop combatants from supplying themselves in
refugee camps, as in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan will choose Ogata's replacement
after he consults with various governments. The General Assembly
will then consider his choice. U.N. officials and diplomats say
Annan hoped to have a candidate by early October but was still
seeking nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no formal, public list of candidates,
diplomats say that nearly half a dozen people are considered
serious contenders. American diplomats say they have not decided
which candidate to support.
</P>
<P>
   An early nominee was Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, brother of
the late King Hussein and a close informal adviser to Ogata.
</P>
<P>
   Two possible candidates from within the U.N. system are Sergio
Vieira de Mello, the organization's coordinator of humanitarian
affairs and now administrator of East Timor, and Bernard Kouchner,
the U.N. administrator of Kosovo and founder of Doctors Without
Borders.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans see Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway as a
strong nominee. In the last year, Vollebaek has played a role in
monitoring the conflict in Chechnya on behalf of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He has also tried to broker
peace talks between the government of Sri Lanka and Tamil rebels
waging war in the country's northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Axworthy, who is expected to step down soon as Canada's
foreign minister, is a possible dark-horse candidate. Axworthy has
given relief issues a high priority in Canadian foreign policy and
was very active in international campaigns to ban land mines and
establish an international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Maahti Atisaari, a former president of
Finland, was a leading contender until he withdrew from the race
early this summer. Atisaari has told officials that he prefers to
remain in Finland and serve the United Nations on shorter special
assignments from there. But some diplomats say he might be
persuaded to reconsider.

NET ACCESS RIGHT UP CONVENTION'S ALLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: This story is being transmitted to both lifestyle and
entertainment wires.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era that celebrates technology, political conventions have
proven no more immune than any other part of society in being
impacted by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's just taken a little longer for the impacts to be noticed,
because the 2000 Republican and Democratic conventions are the
first to be conducted at a time when more than half of all American
households have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Democratic convention, for instance, only drew a
handful of Web sites, most of them add-ons to established Old Media
operations such as The New York Times and ABC News, said Luis
Vizcaino, spokesman for the Democratic National Convention
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually involved one or two reporters in the back of each
room with a laptop,'' Vizcaino said.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 Democratic National Convention will be a
state-of-the-art convention suitable for the 21st century,'' said
Vizcaino. Every Democratic delegate will have his or her own Web
page, scheduling and messaging services, to keep track of events
and gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Internet sites set up shop last week in the GOP
convention's ``Internet Alley'' portion of one of four media tents
in Philadelphia. And in the Democratic Convention's Internet Alley,
about 150 organizations are expected to set up booths, Vizcaino
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-month-old Staples Center _ already something of a
technological marvel with its two TV production studios, 12,000
built-in phone lines, fiber-optics and other infrastructure _ has
been beefed up even further since Democratic Convention organizers
took over the facility June 9, said Staples Center director of
communications Michael Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more phone lines, 300 miles of TV cable, rooms for the
wireless transmission connections for roving reporters and special
air- conditioning units to cool TV equipment have all been added,
while more than 4,000 seats are being removed and more than 40
luxury skybox suites radically renovated to accommodate each
network's broadcasting needs, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest of Internet sites in Philadelphia were still
the Web operations for TV and cable operations such as MSNBC and
ABC News, even though both had significant separate areas elsewhere
in the media tents for their broadcast headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to send a message to the new guys,'' joked
Mike Cornfield, a George Washington University professor of
political management and director of the Democracy Online Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by the amount of original content on these sites,''
said Phil Agre, associate professor of information studies at the
University of California, Los Angeles, and operator of a major
politically-minded mailing list called the Red Rock Eater News
Service. ``You (usually) need an audience to (be able to afford to)
produce original content. Maybe they're not getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield gave the partnership of ABCNews.com, the Washington
Post and Congressional Quarterly high marks for their combined Net
coverage of the GOP proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they had much to cover in a GOP convention so
tightly scripted that the schedule literally put aside two minutes
for a ``spontaneous demonstration'' of crowd support.
</P>
<P>
   The news-free situation was worsened for the dot-com crowd by a
Bush campaign decision to do virtually nothing that catered to the
Internet's particular needs, Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   During the GOP convention, a number of sites tried techie tricks
and gimmicks to attract attention, such as Insight.com, which
outfitted its reporters in Borg-like fashion, with a headset that
included a tiny eyepiece to view video, video camera, a
wrist-mounted keyboard and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Bush Campaign decision not to do much with the Net
during the convention has disappointed them at the least and may
have hurt them,'' Cornfield said. ``I'm sure they're all hoping
Gore decides to be more aggressive at the Staples Center.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because big events such as the conventions are an
opportunity for a new medium to make a splash, if everyone
cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk for a candidate with online is you never know what
will happen to your message. You can't control it,'' Cornfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already under way, according to Agre, is an ``underground war of
e-mails,'' as partisans on both sides duke it out on
opposition-research sites such as www.bushcheney.net, the
Democrats' quickly launched spotlight on the voting records of the
GOP nominees, and www.goreline.come, the Republicans' equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   But where those sites make it clear who's behind them, Cornfield
said, other, more vicious, and perhaps less accurate, sites won't
be this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Just as so-called independent expenditure groups are expected to
finance a series of single-issue attack ads in various battleground
states independent of the two campaigns, so too can attack Web
sites be expected to crop up with innocuous-sounding groups paying
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this intensified underground warfare going on,'' said
Agre. ``The grassroots groups such as Free Republic (a Fresno-based
conservative site at www.freerepublic.com) have already played a
huge role in these semi-, pseudo-, quasi-scandal stories that have
been kept alive. They create a sort of echo chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is not only trailing in the polls but has long
proclaimed his efforts to help fund the Internet in its early
years, is probably more likely to go Net in a big way at his
convention and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's apparently behind, so he has to take some risks,''
Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   There will not only be an Internet Alley at the Los Angeles
convention, but a ``Democracy Row'' of booths will be set up in the
convention center's West Hall, located maybe 100 yards from the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield also credited the so-called Shadow Convention with
doing a good job using the Internet to get people involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Convention, which will start at 6 p.m. today at
Patriotic Hall several blocks south of the Staples Center, is
focused on three issues, said organizer and columnist Arianna
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty in a time of prosperity,'' the failings of the drug
war, and the corrosive effect of money on the political process,
Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential contender John McCain gave a rousing speech
at the Philadelphia convention on money in politics; Russ Feingold
of Wisconsin, will speak in the Los Angeles version, Huffington
said. Other speakers include rapper Chuck D, U.S. Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and ``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill
Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Their speeches and other work can be seen at
www.shadowconventions.com, Huffington said.

   ``I'm struck by the amount of original content on these sites,''
said Phil Agre, associate professor of information studies at the
University of California, Los Angeles, and operator of a major
politically-minded mailing list called the Red Rock Eater News
Service. ``You (usually) need an audience to (be able to afford to)
produce original content. Maybe they're not getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield gave the partnership of ABCNews.com, the Washington
Post and Congressional Quarterly high marks for their combined Net
coverage of the GOP proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they had much to cover in a GOP convention so
tightly scripted that the schedule literally put aside two minutes
for a ``spontaneous demonstration'' of crowd support.
</P>
<P>
   The news-free situation was worsened for the dot-com crowd by a
Bush campaign decision to do virtually nothing that catered to the
Internet's particular needs, Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   During the GOP convention, a number of sites tried techie tricks
and gimmicks to attract attention, such as Insight.com, which
outfitted its reporters in Borg-like fashion, with a headset that
included a tiny eyepiece to view video, video camera, a
wrist-mounted keyboard and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Bush Campaign decision not to do much with the Net
during the convention has disappointed them at the least and may
have hurt them,'' Cornfield said. ``I'm sure they're all hoping
Gore decides to be more aggressive at the Staples Center.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because big events such as the conventions are an
opportunity for a new medium to make a splash, if everyone
cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk for a candidate with online is you never know what
will happen to your message. You can't control it,'' Cornfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already under way, according to Agre, is an ``underground war of
e-mails,'' as partisans on both sides duke it out on
opposition-research sites such as www.bushcheney.net, the
Democrats' quickly launched spotlight on the voting records of the
GOP nominees, and www.goreline.come, the Republicans' equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   But where those sites make it clear who's behind them, Cornfield
said, other, more vicious, and perhaps less accurate, sites won't
be this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Just as so-called independent expenditure groups are expected to
finance a series of single-issue attack ads in various battleground
states independent of the two campaigns, so too can attack Web
sites be expected to crop up with innocuous-sounding groups paying
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this intensified underground warfare going on,'' said
Agre. ``The grassroots groups such as Free Republic (a Fresno-based
conservative site at www.freerepublic.com) have already played a
huge role in these semi-, pseudo-, quasi-scandal stories that have
been kept alive. They create a sort of echo chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is not only trailing in the polls but has long
proclaimed his efforts to help fund the Internet in its early
years, is probably more likely to go Net in a big way at his
convention and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's apparently behind, so he has to take some risks,''
Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   There will not only be an Internet Alley at the Los Angeles
convention, but a ``Democracy Row'' of booths will be set up in the
convention center's West Hall, located maybe 100 yards from the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield also credited the so-called Shadow Convention with
doing a good job using the Internet to get people involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Convention, which will start at 6 p.m. today at
Patriotic Hall several blocks south of the Staples Center, is
focused on three issues, said organizer and columnist Arianna
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty in a time of prosperity,'' the failings of the drug
war, and the corrosive effect of money on the political process,
Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential contender John McCain gave a rousing speech
at the Philadelphia convention on money in politics; Russ Feingold
of Wisconsin, will speak in the Los Angeles version, Huffington
said. Other speakers include rapper Chuck D, U.S. Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and ``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill
Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Their speeches and other work can be seen at
www.shadowconventions.com, Huffington said.

NET ACCESS RIGHT UP CONVENTION'S ALLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: This story is being transmitted to both lifestyle and
entertainment wires.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era that celebrates technology, political conventions have
proven no more immune than any other part of society in being
impacted by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's just taken a little longer for the impacts to be noticed,
because the 2000 Republican and Democratic conventions are the
first to be conducted at a time when more than half of all American
households have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Democratic convention, for instance, only drew a
handful of Web sites, most of them add-ons to established Old Media
operations such as The New York Times and ABC News, said Luis
Vizcaino, spokesman for the Democratic National Convention
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually involved one or two reporters in the back of each
room with a laptop,'' Vizcaino said.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 Democratic National Convention will be a
state-of-the-art convention suitable for the 21st century,'' said
Vizcaino. Every Democratic delegate will have his or her own Web
page, scheduling and messaging services, to keep track of events
and gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Internet sites set up shop last week in the GOP
convention's ``Internet Alley'' portion of one of four media tents
in Philadelphia. And in the Democratic Convention's Internet Alley,
about 150 organizations are expected to set up booths, Vizcaino
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-month-old Staples Center _ already something of a
technological marvel with its two TV production studios, 12,000
built-in phone lines, fiber-optics and other infrastructure _ has
been beefed up even further since Democratic Convention organizers
took over the facility June 9, said Staples Center director of
communications Michael Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more phone lines, 300 miles of TV cable, rooms for the
wireless transmission connections for roving reporters and special
air- conditioning units to cool TV equipment have all been added,
while more than 4,000 seats are being removed and more than 40
luxury skybox suites radically renovated to accommodate each
network's broadcasting needs, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest of Internet sites in Philadelphia were still
the Web operations for TV and cable operations such as MSNBC and
ABC News, even though both had significant separate areas elsewhere
in the media tents for their broadcast headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to send a message to the new guys,'' joked
Mike Cornfield, a George Washington University professor of
political management and director of the Democracy Online Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by the amount of original content on these sites,''
said Phil Agre, associate professor of information studies at the
University of California, Los Angeles, and operator of a major
politically-minded mailing list called the Red Rock Eater News
Service. ``You (usually) need an audience to (be able to afford to)

 &HT;    Park it at any of these great places
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Whether it's the sight of a jaguarundi at
Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park or a faint ochre shaman
drawing on a cave wall at Seminole Canyon, Texas state parks offer
unique opportunities for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   You can camp, hike, fish and even hunt in Texas parks. And even
though some of the best ones are well-known throughout the state,
there are others that have their own special charm and are just
waiting to be discovered by the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Personal prejudice about the best places to visit for fall park
activities is allowed, and so the American-Statesman turned to
Brent Leisure of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Public
Lands Division for his top 10 list of favorites. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Daingerfield State Park: This East Texas park has 551 acres that
feature a lake, fall colors in the oak, sweetgum and maples and the
chance to get away from it all when the weather is at its best in
Texas. Locals know it, but it's often overlooked by travelers. Call
(903) 645-2921 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Caddo Lake State Park: Located near Karnack and obviously on the
lake, this is another fall treasure. It offers huge cypress trees,
hunting and fishing and history in nearby Jefferson and Marshall.
``Both those parks have camping and cabins,'' Leisure said. ``They
don't get the attention that some others do.'' Call (903) 679-3351.
</P>
<P>
   Lost Maples State Natural Area: Vanderpool in the Hill Country.
As the name implies, this is one park that foliage freaks pay
attention to when the weather begins to cool down. Big-tooth maples
put on a show every fall, and visitors come from all over to see
them. There is camping, but it can get crowded. Fishing is
available as well as hiking through the park. Call (830) 966-3413.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Duro Canyon State Park: This gem is located near Canyon in
the Texas Panhandle and offers a close-up view of the famous
canyon. The park is composed of more than 16,000 acres and is open
for camping, hiking, bicycling and horseback riding. ``It's a very
pretty park with a lot more fall color than people realize,''
Leisure said. ``That canyon is such a neat place.'' Call (806)
488-2227.
</P>
<P>
   Bastrop State Park: This one is nearby and fall is the perfect
time to visit, Leisure said. ``The weather is great, plus you have
some fall foliage and the pines. It really has a little bit of
everything. You can camp, play golf and we've just added 1,000
acres of undeveloped land,'' he said. Fishing and hiking are
available. Call (512) 321-2101.
</P>
<P>
   Pedernales Falls State Park: ``You have to include that one,''
Leisure said. The park encompasses more than 5,000 acres and is
great for fall camping and hiking activities. Call (830) 868-7304.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Mountains State Park: ``That's always in my top five,''
Leisure said. ``You get a lot of color in the fall, plus it's a
good place to go to see lots of birds.'' You can camp or stay at
Indian Lodge, plus enjoy the history of the local area, including
Fort Davis. The McDonald observatory is nearby for nighttime
activities. Call (915) 426-3337.
</P>
<P>
   Palmetto State Park: If you drive through Luling from time to
time, you might have seen this small park on the outskirts of town.
Most people drive right on by, though, which is bad for them, but
good for a visitor looking for a hidden gem. ``That's a neat little
park that definitely has unique characteristics, ecologically and
culturally,'' Leisure said. ``And it's really underutilized.'' Call
(830) 672-3266.
</P>
<P>
   Enchanted Rock State Natural Area: Any regular park goer has
likely stopped and climbed to the top of the granite monolith from
which the park derives its name. If you haven't, then you've missed
something. ``It's great at any time of the year, but it's really
nice in the fall,'' Leisure said. ``The weather is nice, and there
is some nice color there.'' There are hiking trails around the
park, as well. The park is located between Fredericksburg and
Llano. Call (915) 247-3903.
</P>
<P>
   Cleburne State Park: Leisure thinks this is an underutilized
park, as well, despite its proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth
Metroplex. ``It's a neat park with a lot to offer,'' he said.
Fishing, hiking and bicycling are among the top attractions. Call
(817) 645-4215.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations are required for camping in state parks. Call (512)
389-8900.

PRAGUE PREPARES FOR IMF MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Tent city opening two days after conference is cq.)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut
have already ordered replacement glass. So has Tesco, a British
supermarket chain, and it is thinking of shutting down for the
duration. McDonald's talks hopefully of its local ownership and
wants to keep its outlets open.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry will have 11,000 police officers on duty,
with several thousand troops in reserve. Schools and theaters will
close. The ministry has even opened a Web site, warning young
people: ``The police will have a lot of work on their hands, so
they cannot be too tolerant of various childish pranks.'' It adds,
``Do not provoke the police.''
</P>
<P>
   It advises older people to stock up on food and medicine, and to
``relax and trust the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   One might think that these are preparations for the battle in
Central Europe that NATO practiced for with war games for so many
years. But it is only the annual autumn meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a conference that
the Czech Republic eagerly sought in 1993 as a millennial symbol of
the country's return to capitalism and the West.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day meeting, which is expected at attract up to 18,000
officials and delegates, opens on Sept. 19. The Communists' old
Palace of Culture has been renovated for the meeting at a cost of
$60 million and renamed the Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   But since Prague sought this honor, the monetary fund and the
World Bank have become targets of rage against globalization and
indifferent capitalism. The fund in particular has for some the
same negative connotations that the Federal Emergency Management
Agency has for far-right groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Already, on various Web sites critical of the fund and its
policies, like www.destroyimf.org _ ``a Web resource for all those
mobilizing to end the poverty and injustice inflicted by global
capitalism'' _ there is the cry: ``Turn Prague into Seattle!''
There, late last November, 40,000 demonstrators paralyzed the city,
damaged businesses, clashed with the police and tied up a meeting
of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers and Czech officials expect 20,000 to 50,000
protesters _ some peaceful, some not _ to come here. The protests
will certainly be the largest here since 1989, and perhaps the
largest invasion of foreigners since the Soviets dropped by with
their tanks in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   President Vaclav Havel has tried to satisfy and perhaps co-opt
some of the more well-mannered groups by offering to meet with them
at Prague Castle.
</P>
<P>
   The government has offered designated areas for protest and
arranged for a private company, FAM, to equip the old Strahov
sports stadium with tents, portable lavatories and food so the
protesters will have a relatively clean and safe place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The tent city will open on Sept. 21, and anyone may stay there
for the duration for $37, said Tomas Doubek of FAM. There will be
private security guards but no policemen, unless there is
significant trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative party of former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus
objected to the arrangements, saying they looked as if the Czechs
``are collaborating with extremists,'' Doubek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some legislators said, `Let the protesters get a doctorate in
finance, learn two foreign languages, work in a bank for a few
years, and then they will be qualified to discuss IMF issues,''' he
said. ``Surprisingly, nobody laughed at this stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Dvorska, an organizer with the Czech umbrella group
Initiative Against Economic Globalization, says she is worried
about how the Czech police, with a history of aggressive crowd
control, will behave.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, the police were taken by surprise by protests
against the automobile industry and globalization. The police beat
some protesters and some bystanders as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid of violence on the part of the police,'' Dvorska
said. ``The Interior Ministry is purposely demonizing us. If you
look at protests around the world, it is always the police who
cause most of the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Mozen is a 25-year-old American who quit a job in
Washington to help organize the initiative's program of nonviolent
demonstrations, dance and street theater intended to educate
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our main aim to shut the meeting down, although we
think the IMF and World Bank should be dissolved,'' Mozen said.
``We want a grass-roots display of our disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says the police have been monitoring the group and its
planning, including a meeting outside Prague last month. ``We're
definitely under surveillance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, the group handed out fliers and performed a bit of
street theater in Old Town Square, holding a symbolic soccer match
between multinational corporations and representatives of the
world's poor. The corporations won by bribing the referee, who
represented the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Reinhardt, a high school teacher from New York, played the
part of McDonald's during the match. ``The World Bank is not
accountable,'' he said. ``They give out loans but don't bear
responsibility for what is being done with the money, and most
people around the world get no benefits from it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragnhild Eide Skogseth, 18, a Norwegian student who portrayed
Shell Oil, said the fund and the bank ``always say they want to
help the poor, but the results are always the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Czech police have been training for the meeting and have
worked with the U.S. police and with the FBI, which has opened an
office in Prague, mostly to monitor organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI trained 24 Czech police officers in crowd control in the
United States, said an Interior Ministry spokesman, Stanislav
Gross, and the police have paid particular attention to the way the
Washington, D.C., police handled the spring meeting of the fund and
the bank in April. Hundreds of protesters were arrested there, but
there was much less violence than in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the designers of the Web site, the meeting ``will be
protected by a Czech police operation run by the FBI.'' It says,
``The challenge to the workers' movement is to shut down that
summit with the biggest international demo Europe has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem for the police is the location of the old Palace of
Culture. The main access from the city center, where most delegates
will stay, is by a bridge over a valley that could be blocked by
protest.
</P>
<P>
   The two closest hotels, the Corinthia Forum and the Panorama,
are on the right side of the bridge, but because they have Libyan
ownership, a U.S. embargo would bar Americans from staying there.
</P>
<P>
   Horst Koehler, the fund's executive director, says he has ``full
confidence'' in Prague's ability to handle the meeting. Emphasizing
a need for ``internal reform,'' he said the fund was ``open for
discussions and dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not hiding'' from the protesters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Havel emphasizes the symbolism of Prague as the host of the
post-Communist world's first annual meeting of the fund and bank.
He said he would try to have discussions with the demonstrators as
well as the bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention given to security issues ``pains me,'' he
said. ``It seems as if we are preparing for civil war. We should
take this more positively.''

 &HT;    Admit it _ you've got to have new gear
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It would be interesting to be a billionaire for
a day, just to see how long I could shop for new stuff without
getting tired.
</P>
<P>
   I expect the World Bank might have to be called in to assess the
damage, though, because if there's anything better than buying new
gear for hunting season, it's buying new gear and not having to
worry about how much it costs or if there's a warehouse that can
hold it.
</P>
<P>
   And the great thing is marketers know that no hunter can resist
buying something before he heads out to hunt for the first time
each fall, especially if it represents a new twist on an old item.
After all, how many camouflage mesh tops do we really need? Several
apparently, since they now come in versions that are insect proof
and in different colors for different conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But, we have to choose, don't we? Therefore, this seemed like a
good time to review some of the new stuff on the market, as well as
look at some new versions of items you might already have. Here we
go:
</P>
<P>
   _ Chairs: A place to sit during hot, dove season afternoons is
important. You can get a director's chair that holds two people for
about $50 or you can get seats and buckets with built-in ice chests
and storage compartments for shells and other gear. This year I
bought a folding tripod stool in Mossy Oak camo for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clothes: You need a hat for dove hunting to keep the sun off
your face and maybe provide a little camouflage for the birds
coming in. Any cap will do, of course, but there are models that
have mesh crowns to allow for some cooling air to move through. You
can buy them for less than $20. Light cotton or mesh shirts in
every camo pattern on earth are available, usually for less than
$30.
</P>
<P>
   Shorts are nice if you're not hunting in really bad thorn
country. Look for camo or tan or green khakis, $15-50 depending on
brands and how fancy they are.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shells: Most sporting goods stores will offer some kind of
special on dove loads before the season opens. If you hunt much at
all, you might want to consider a case of 10 boxes. These should be
priced anywhere from $40 to $75, depending on the amount of shot
and the promotion at your store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Knives and shears: A good pair of kitchen shears is one of the
best investments you can make for dove and duck seasons. They can
cost $15 or more than $100 if you get into the surgical stainless
steel variety. Most knife manufacturers make them, though, and sell
them for not a lot of money. They do a better job of cutting
through leg and wing bones than a knife and you don't have to
sharpen them as often.
</P>
<P>
   _ Radios: There are all kinds on the market today, and they just
keep getting cheaper as electronics get better. They can be useful
around a dove field for setting hunters and letting people know who
might need shells, drinks or who has a limit and is about to vacate
a hot shooting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is the standard, and the company is selling its
Talkabout models from around $50 up to more than $200 for the most
powerful models. You can even get them in camouflage colors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hearing protection: Those of us going deaf wish we'd known
more about how to protect our ears before it was too late. But it's
never too late to start, no matter how old or young. Anything you
do now is saving hearing for later on.
</P>
<P>
   I have custom ones fitted to my ears that cost $50, and you can
get those at outdoor shows and such. Or you can buy simple ones
that cost a few dollars. There are electronic models with
directional hearing that can cost a couple of hundred and more.

 &HT;    Park it at any of these great places
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Whether it's the sight of a jaguarundi at
Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park or a faint ochre shaman
drawing on a cave wall at Seminole Canyon, Texas state parks offer
unique opportunities for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   You can camp, hike, fish and even hunt in Texas parks. And even
though some of the best ones are well-known throughout the state,
there are others that have their own special charm and are just
waiting to be discovered by the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Personal prejudice about the best places to visit for fall park
activities is allowed, and so the American-Statesman turned to
Brent Leisure of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Public
Lands Division for his top 10 list of favorites. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Daingerfield State Park: This East Texas park has 551 acres that
feature a lake, fall colors in the oak, sweetgum and maples and the
chance to get away from it all when the weather is at its best in
Texas. Locals know it, but it's often overlooked by travelers. Call
(903) 645-2921 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Caddo Lake State Park: Located near Karnack and obviously on the
lake, this is another fall treasure. It offers huge cypress trees,
hunting and fishing and history in nearby Jefferson and Marshall.
``Both those parks have camping and cabins,'' Leisure said. ``They
don't get the attention that some others do.'' Call (903) 679-3351.
</P>
<P>
   Lost Maples State Natural Area: Vanderpool in the Hill Country.
As the name implies, this is one park that foliage freaks pay
attention to when the weather begins to cool down. Big-tooth maples
put on a show every fall, and visitors come from all over to see
them. There is camping, but it can get crowded. Fishing is
available as well as hiking through the park. Call (830) 966-3413.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Duro Canyon State Park: This gem is located near Canyon in
the Texas Panhandle and offers a close-up view of the famous
canyon. The park is composed of more than 16,000 acres and is open
for camping, hiking, bicycling and horseback riding. ``It's a very
pretty park with a lot more fall color than people realize,''
Leisure said. ``That canyon is such a neat place.'' Call (806)
488-2227.
</P>
<P>
   Bastrop State Park: This one is nearby and fall is the perfect
time to visit, Leisure said. ``The weather is great, plus you have
some fall foliage and the pines. It really has a little bit of
everything. You can camp, play golf and we've just added 1,000
acres of undeveloped land,'' he said. Fishing and hiking are
available. Call (512) 321-2101.
</P>
<P>
   Pedernales Falls State Park: ``You have to include that one,''
Leisure said. The park encompasses more than 5,000 acres and is
great for fall camping and hiking activities. Call (830) 868-7304.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Mountains State Park: ``That's always in my top five,''
Leisure said. ``You get a lot of color in the fall, plus it's a
good place to go to see lots of birds.'' You can camp or stay at
Indian Lodge, plus enjoy the history of the local area, including
Fort Davis. The McDonald observatory is nearby for nighttime
activities. Call (915) 426-3337.
</P>
<P>
   Palmetto State Park: If you drive through Luling from time to
time, you might have seen this small park on the outskirts of town.
Most people drive right on by, though, which is bad for them, but
good for a visitor looking for a hidden gem. ``That's a neat little
park that definitely has unique characteristics, ecologically and
culturally,'' Leisure said. ``And it's really underutilized.'' Call
(830) 672-3266.
</P>
<P>
   Enchanted Rock State Natural Area: Any regular park goer has
likely stopped and climbed to the top of the granite monolith from
which the park derives its name. If you haven't, then you've missed
something. ``It's great at any time of the year, but it's really
nice in the fall,'' Leisure said. ``The weather is nice, and there
is some nice color there.'' There are hiking trails around the
park, as well. The park is located between Fredericksburg and
Llano. Call (915) 247-3903.
</P>
<P>
   Cleburne State Park: Leisure thinks this is an underutilized
park, as well, despite its proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth
Metroplex. ``It's a neat park with a lot to offer,'' he said.
Fishing, hiking and bicycling are among the top attractions. Call
(817) 645-4215.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations are required for camping in state parks. Call (512)
389-8900.

   EGYPTAIR-CRASH (Washington) _ The National Transportation Safety
Board Friday strongly indicated that Egyptair 990 crashed last Oct.
31 because of a deliberate act by the relief co-pilot, releasing
nearly 1,700 pages of documents, as the chairman of the board
declared that there were ``no unresolved safety issues'' that would
require a hearing. But American experts representing Egyptair,
including a former chairman of the Safety Board, said that the
documents contained extensive evidence that argued against the
crash as being a deliberate act. The plane went down about 60 miles
from Nantucket on a flight from Kennedy airport to Cairo, killing
all 217 people aboard. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-STAMPS-STATES (Undated) _ In California, New York, and 27
other states, people applying for food stamps are asked if they own
a burial plot. Nebraska and Nevada want to know if applicants have
sold their blood, and for how much. Hawaii demands garage sale
receipts, South Dakota wants documentation of past bingo winnings,
and Minnesota, on page 20 of a 36-page eligibility application,
asks if anyone in the household gets money from a paper route. Food
stamp applications in most states have become so onerous that they
are deterring needy people from applying for the subsidies, the
most comprehensive analysis of the applications has found. Many of
the inquiries about income and assets have no connection to legal
requirements for food stamps but are either aggressive responses to
federal mandates to deter fraud or part of recent state and local
efforts to cut welfare costs by eliminating recipients. Federal
officials say that the report, sponsored by America's Second
Harvest, the nation's largest food bank network, adds to worries
that such stringency is one reason that millions of people who are
eligible for the benefits, and need them, are not getting them. By

   CANADA-DIAMONDS (Yellowknife, Northwest Territories) _ By 2005,
the Northwest Territories is expected to produce as much as 15
percent of the world's diamonds and Canada will then join the ranks
of the world's top five diamond producers. With this future on the
horizon, officials are taking the lead now to protect the future
image of diamonds by suppressing the trafficking in uncut stones
that helps to fund guerrilla armies in Sierra Leone and Angola. By

   WEST-FIRES (Undated) _ With the worst wildfires in a generation
still burning out of control across a dozen Western states, a
fierce debate, tinged with politics, is also under way over who is
to blame. Fire experts had warned for years that a buildup of
combustible material in Western forests had reached vast and
dangerous proportions. But federal agencies did not address the
problem in earnest until 1995, and even since, conservative critics
including the Republican governor of Montana said angrily Friday,
the administration did not move with appropriate dispatch. By

U.S. FIRM WINS $245-MILLION CONTRACT TO BUILD AND RUN PRISON IN
SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Wackenhut Corrections Corp., a world
leader in private prison construction and management and a frequent
target of industry critics, contracted on Friday to build and
operate a 3,024-bed maximum-security penitentiary in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The prison, expected to be ready in about 18 months, is the
first such venture in Africa for the company, which is based in
Florida and operates correctional facilities across the United
States as well as in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-contract, which is valued by the South African
government at about $245 million including the $45-million expense
of the prison construction, was signed on Friday morning during a
90-minute ceremony here in the capital. The cost of construction is
to be financed by a consortium of South African banks.
</P>
<P>
   With South Africa's jails and prisons desperately overcrowded
and the government struggling to find the money to build new ones,
Wackenhut hopes the new prison, to be located in the northern town
of Louis Trichardt, is only the beginning of a long and lucrative
relationship with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of South Africa share that hope, and for them, more
is at stake than simply the success of a single prison. Beset not
only by high crime rates, but also by other social ills that
require substantial funding and attention, the government is
grappling with how to pay for more houses, schools, hospitals and
prisons. Wackenhut, which saves governments money by running
prisons more efficiently than they can, is seen in South Africa as
a promising solution.
</P>
<P>
   So three years ago, the South African government began an
experiment in privatization, soliciting bids to build and manage
four prisons here. Wackenhut and its local partners, incorporated
as South African Custodial Services, bid for the right to build
three prisons and won contracts for two, including the planned
prison at Louis Trichardt.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Wackenhut to operate at least one of them, South
Africa is turning to a company that made itself a common name in
the private prison-industry and not always for good reason. Over
the years, and even in recent months, the company has been
criticized for how some of its facilities in the United States have
been run.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Texas reclaimed control of a Wackenhut-run prison
in Austin after a dozen former employees were indicted late last
year on charges of sexually assaulting and harassing inmates. And
earlier this year, authorities in Louisiana transferred the entire
population of a juvenile prison run by Wackenhut after federal
investigators alleged that inmates were beaten and deprived of
adequate food and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials say the safeguards they have
incorporated into the contract will ensure that the new prisons are
run properly.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's prison system is built to house about 100,000
inmates, but the network of facilities around the country presently
incarcerates more than 170,000, and escapes are common.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    WWII DESTROYER COMES HOME
 &HT;    By RICHARD STEWART 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    ORANGE, Texas _ As Don Greer stood on the pitching deck of the
<TEXT>
little fishing boat watching a Ukrainian seagoing tug pull the old,
rusting warship out of the Gulf of Mexico into the safety of the
Sabine River Waterway, the years melted away.
<P>
   He was no longer a retiree living in Florida and the ship was no
longer an over-age and obsolete Turkish destroyer. Suddenly it was
1952. He was an 18-year-old sailor and the ship was the proud USS
Orleck, the gray ghost of the Korean coast.
</P>
<P>
   He'd come 850 miles for the reunion. The ship had come 7,500
miles. They had both journeyed almost 47 years since he'd last seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth it just for this,'' Greer beamed, looking over the
vessel that had carried him through two typhoons. He recalled the
day a North Korean shell came crashing through the radar pod where
he worked, missing him by a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   He also remembered the night he watched as the ship steamed
2,000 yards offshore _ ``too close in for a destroyer, really'' _
and blasted away at a coastal railway train with its five-inch
guns. ``It must have been an ammunition train,'' he said, ``because
it sure went up in a blaze of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a huge salmon going up river to its birthplace, the Orleck
returned Friday to the waterway where it was born. But unlike a
salmon, the ship hasn't come home to die. It's come home to be born
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Orleck, the last of more than 90 destroyers built in this
southeast Texas petrochemical city during World War II, has
returned to be renovated and converted into a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
   Built at Consolidated Steel Corp.'s Orange shipyard, the
Orleck &UR;  &LR; was launched on May 12, 1945. &UR;  &LR; It is 390 feet long, 40 feet
wide and has a displacement of 2,250 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Designed as a fast, aircraft carrier escort ship, the Orleck was
meant to last just 10 or 12 years. Friday it looked almost as if it
could fight another war.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a lot of rust on her,'' Greer said. ``She needs a
bath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take her to Hong Kong to see Garbage Scow Mary,''
he chuckled. He said thatduring the Korean conflict a woman with
that name would bring crews to repaint the sides of American ships
in exchange for the ship's garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she often tilted over 35 degrees during big storms
and room was tight for her 300-man crew, the Orleck was a happy and
proud ship, Greer said. ``It was a great life for a single man,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greer didn't want to be single. He left the Navy to get
married and made a career of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ship was launched too late to see duty in World War
II, the Orleck was in service in the U.S. Navy for more than 37
years and spent 16 more years in the Turkish Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was named for Lt. Joseph Orleck, the son of Russian
immigrants and commander of the USS Nauset, who went down with his
ship in 1943 when it was hit with bombs and struck a mine during
the amphibious invasion of Salerno, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, the Orleck was known as a ``train
buster'' after twice hurling shells inland to destroy enemy supply
trains. Greer still proudly keeps a certificate he has for being
aboard when the ship blew up two such trains.
</P>
<P>
   Later the destroyer &UR;  &LR; was to make several tours off Vietnam,
earning the honor of ``top gun'' and credited with firing more
shells into Vietnam than any other American destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Orleck was transferred to the Turkish Navy,
where it was renamed the Yucetepe. Its final war patrols were made
during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Depwe, who heads up a local group raising money to restore
the old ship, said his group has long wanted to bring back one of
the warships built in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   When they heard about the Orleck last year, it was in a shipyard
in Izmir, Turkey, and was scheduled to be taken apart for scrap.
Depwe and some others made a quick trip to Turkey and met with
officials there to see if they could get the ship.
</P>
<P>
   What really did the job, he said, was giving a Turkish admiral a
badge and proclaiming him an honorary Texas Ranger. ``Just like
Walker, Texas Ranger!'' the beaming admiral said. The admiral
helped Depwe make plans to tow the ship to Orange.
</P>
<P>
   The ship will be berthed first in a downtown city park on the
Sabine River. During formal ceremonies at 5 p.m. Saturday, it will
be transferred to the restoration group.
</P>
<P>
   Greer was joined Friday by several other former Orleck crewmen
who came to see the arrival of their old ship. Former crewmen will
be allowed the visit it, but it may be several months before the
vessel is restored enough for public tours.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, after $3 million to $5 million in restoration, the
entire vessel will be open for tours, and there are plans for
battle re-enactments. A special park on the riverfront is being
created for the ship's permanent home.

 &HT;    The Sapp vs. Wade rivalry
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Warren Sapp went silent.
</P>
<P>
   Honest. Sapp was talking away, answering question after
question, talking about how he loves Miami _ ``the fans, the sun,
the women . . . greatest city in the world'' _ when a reporter
managed to plug the Hoover Dam of NFL mouths with a mere two
syllables.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Wade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next question,'' Sapp said icily.
</P>
<P>
   The next question came, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive
tackle cheerfully answered it. Well, as cheerfully as one can
expect after a 15-13 loss to the Miami Dolphins, pre-season or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep score, don't they?'' Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone asked Sapp what he thought of Wade, a Dolphins
rookie offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp stared ahead blankly, scratching his chest with his right
hand. The question was rephrased. The catatonic look continued.
Another question was asked. More scratching and staring.
</P>
<P>
   End of interview.
</P>
<P>
   Start of a rivalry?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, we've got to begin somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would happen if you managed to get Florida and
Florida State on the same field in August.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't have to be an exhibition game. Heck, it wouldn't
even have to be a game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Seminoles and Gators got together in a Publix parking lot
to stare at each other for three hours, people would show up to
watch. The fans would spend the days leading up the game debating
the relative eyelid strength of the quarterbacks. They would spend
days afterward calling talk radio shows to recount the clutch
blinks; to complain the referees and announcers clearly were alumni
of the other school and to look forward to the regular-season
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But put the Dolphins and Bucs together on an August night and
what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   Excitement. Anticipation. Fervent debate. . . . No, wait. That
was for the CBS postgame interview with Colleen, the South Florida
native booted off the ``Survivor'' island.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins and Bucs get together for an exhibition game _
and Thursday night was the 15th time it happened _ it isn't exactly
a passionate affair. Or at least it hasn't been for 20 years, since
the Dolphins temporarily canceled the exhibition meetings despite a
string of four sellouts because, as then-owner Joe Robbie said, the
Bucs were treating each game ``as if it were a Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note: This clearly violates NFL regulations which state that
both teams shall strives to make exhibition games as lifeless as
possible.)
</P>
<P>
   But, guess what, this non-rivalry may have found its version of
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, when the Dolphins and Bucs practiced
against each other in Orlando two weeks ago, Sapp turned a routine
pass-blocking drill into a chance to practice his celebration dance
steps. Wade didn't appreciate this. And he let Sapp know _
something his teammates later told him was a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   This week, fans rallied to Wade's defense, calling talk radio
shows to say they appreciated him standing up to Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   So the stage was set. Bucs kicker Martin Gramatica lined up for
the opening kickoff, stood with his arm raised . . . and heard a
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Delay of game. On an opening kickoff. Such is the story of this
non-rivalry. Full of false starts.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game started, Sapp had his moments. He tripped running
back Lamar Smith to stop one drive inside the 10. He knocked Damon
Huard to the ground. He celebrated by bobbing his head. And
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Wade also had his moments, opening a couple huge holes for Smith
to run through. Afterward, though, neither player wanted to discuss
the other.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be a rematch. These two teams will meet again
Dec. 10 at Pro Player (This Space For Sale!) Stadium. It already is
sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for both teams,'' Bucs General Manager Rich McKay
said Thursday night. ``But as long as they're not in our division,
I don't think there ever will be a true rivalry. And I don't see
that happening in realignment.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that there seemed to be a bit more of a
buzz in South Florida this week than before some of the previous
August meetings _ and that maybe that could carry into the December
_ McKay smiled slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it wasn't just because of Todd Wade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, Sapp sat in front of his locker. Silent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much, but it's a start.

VERIZON WORKERS SAY SCRIPTED CALLS CAUSE STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could have been one of those minor triumphs that make a phone
rep's day: Dawn Barbour, a customer-service agent for Verizon _
then Bell Atlantic _ had just made an angry customer stop ranting,
solved his problem and even elicited a kind word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Bell Atlantic, but you're the nicest rep I ever had,''
the caller said.
</P>
<P>
   A simple ``thank you'' seemed the right reply, but Barbour had
to follow a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I provide you with outstanding service today?'' she
inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that what I just said?'' barked the customer, steaming
right back up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a total idiot,'' said Barbour. But Verizon
requires customer-service agents to ask the ``outstanding service''
question at the end of every call, she said, and if she had dropped
it, a supervisor listening in could have deducted points from her
performance score. Low points reduce the chance of a promotion, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Work that makes people feel like idiots is hardly the stuff that
brought organized labor to the barricades in the past. The famous
labor struggles of American history call to mind collapsing
mine-shafts and machine gunners posted on factory roofs, not
mandatory telephone sign-offs recited in attractive,
air-conditioned offices.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, contract negotiations have centered on wages and
benefits, not the subtler question of whether relatively well-paid
workers can have a greater say over the nature of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Verizon's customer-service representatives say that even in
their comfortable, well-lighted call centers, stress has become a
striking point. New technology means customer calls now roll in
assembly-line style, they say. Fast business growth means frequent
mandatory overtime, disrupting family schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Today's heightened focus on earnings growth requires
customer-service representatives to pitch products to all callers,
even those who do not want to buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   Customers sometimes become angry and abusive, but the reps
cannot slam down the phone, hide in the bathroom or do much else
except follow the script, since their supervisors may be listening
and rating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the pressure of always being nice,'' said Linda
Kramer, a customer-service representative in Crandon, N.J., and
president of the local arm of the Communications Workers of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Novel though it is for stress to be an issue in a strike, some
observers think the Verizon workers may be making the complaint at
a time of heightened public receptivity. Many Americans can
understand complaints about work spilling over into family time.
And recent studies suggest that ``emotional labor'' _ acting
friendly when you're seething inside _ can actually weaken one's
immunity and overload the cardiovascular and nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that nearly half of all
recorded occupational-stress cases occur among ``technical, sales
and administrative support'' workers, the category that includes
customer-service reps. And the median length of absence for
occupational stress is more than four times as long as for other
workplace injuries and illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important issue, and it will be a growing issue,''
said Paul Osterman, a professor of human resources and management
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said the number of
people doing customer-service tasks is growing and that complaints
about the nature of the work are rising.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 3.3 million customer-service representatives in
the United States, only about 7 percent of whom have union
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon executives, while agreeing that customer service is a
demanding job, say the stress that the strikers describe is really
a function of today's fast-paced and highly competitive business
environment, not the result of bad management.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon monitors its customer-service representatives and
emphasizes sales ``because I want to be sure they provide a high
quality of service,'' said Bruce Gordon, president of Verizon's
Retail Markets Group. ``That's called quality assurance, and every
industry does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Verizon's customer-service representatives are told
before they are hired that they will be working mandatory overtime
and selling products. He added that Verizon's personnel policies
are on par with, and in some cases better than, all prevailing
industry norms. Verizon says its customer-service representatives
earn from $35,000 to $45,000 on average for a job that does not
require a college degree, and get free health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Verizon workers generally work four hours in the morning and
four in the afternoon, with an hour off for lunch and two 15-minute
breaks. They sit spaced well apart in ergonomically designed
cubicles, typing orders into computers and speaking into
noise-filtering headsets. The employees brighten their workplaces
with family photos, Beanie Babies, union posters and the many
certificates and awards they get for good sales and service.
</P>
<P>
   All around the calling centers stand easels showing the prizes
they can win for big sales, ranging from humble pizzas and candy
bars to trips to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   What causes the stress? Nearby is the supervisor's station,
where a computer screen shows every workstation on a color-coded
grid.
</P>
<P>
   The squares change color depending on whether the employees are
signed on, signed off, keeping a customer on hold for less than two
minutes, keeping someone on hold for more than two minutes, and so
on. A supervisor can see at a glance if a representative is taking
too long, and investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Egan, a customer-service representative for Verizon and a
business agent for the Communications Workers of America, in New
York, said the stress became much worse after Verizon installed a
system that automatically routes a call to a representative just
two seconds after his or her previous call disconnects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no down time,'' Egan said. ``The customer disconnects
and the next call's right there. Try living like that, taking calls
every two seconds.'' The result, she said, is that representatives
must often begin dealing with a new caller while still typing the
order of the last caller. Sometimes, she adds, workers set
unfinished orders aside and never find the time to return to them.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the pressure, say the strikers, is the need to try
to sell to virtually every caller. Representatives are trained to
shift the conversation from, say, a billing inquiry to a sales
pitch _ a practice that Verizon calls bridging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if you're calling in because you're getting harassing
calls and you want a new phone number,'' Kramer said. ``The service
rep is required to look at your account and see what features you
have, and then try to sell you something. And not just one item,
that's not good enough. I'm required to offer you voice mail if you
don't have it, three-way calling if you don't have it. I'm required
to do my best and sparkle and shine, and put you at ease so you
say, `Oh, all right, I'll take it for a month, just because you
sound so nice.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Citing the ongoing negotiations, Gordon of Verizon declined to
discuss the specific complaints of the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers say it is not selling that causes stress, but having to
do it according to standard scripts and procedures when common
sense tells them not to. Many complain of having to dangle deluxe
products before people who do not need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fights with the inner part of the rep,'' Egan said. ``She's
thinking: `Look at this poor 80-year-old woman, what does she need
three-way calling for?' I'm offering her gadgets and she can't even
see the push-buttons on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the workers do not make the offers, a listening
supervisor may note the failure. And at least once a month, the
supervisors meet with each worker for a feedback session, reviewing
monitored calls and discussing how to do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had situations where I sold caller ID, but because I
didn't start with the biggest package, the feedback was `You should
have bridged to Sound Deal Plus,''' said Barbour, naming Verizon's
biggest residential package. Reps in her center are supposed to
sell about $60,000 worth of products a month if they want to move
out of the customer-service jobs and into jobs with no sales
duties, she said _ a goal she says she can meet.
</P>
<P>
   But those who cannot meet the goal do poorly on their annual
reviews, Kramer said. ``Let's face it, we're not all car
salesmen,'' she said.

 &HT;    Ears everywhere miss the sound of a bullfrog opera
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I miss bullfrogs and I wish they'd come back.
</P>
<P>
   From where, I don't exactly know. I just know they're not as
plentiful and with them went one of the few nighttime activities in
a country kid's life that was both fun and legal.
</P>
<P>
   There was no limit. You could hunt at night. Ammunition was free
if you caught them by hand. What a world.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's drought that has killed off many of the frogs.
Others blame ozone depletion, highway paving, global warming or
pesticides. Their absence signals an impending ecological disaster,
they say. Whatever killed off the frogs or displaced them did a
pretty effective job in some parts of the country, taking with it
one of the world's great ``I am here'' vocal declarations.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have I lain under a blanket on the ground,
worried that a water moccasin would crawl in there with me, and
quaked at the mixed men's chorus of big bullfrogs and territorial
alligators? These were not some pretend frogs in a beer commercial,
but the real thing, basso profundo and proud of it. It sent shivers
up my spine even on a hot summer night.
</P>
<P>
   I've had the quiet pleasure on trips with my dad of gigging them
by the light of a two-cell flashlight. We would have the sweet,
succulent legs for breakfast the next morning. I was always
fascinated with the fact that they jumped around in the pan when
you cooked them.
</P>
<P>
   And I've known the terror of riding a customized, frog-fishing
johnboat to the bottom of the Sabine River on an ill-fated Explorer
Scout float trip. Two guys snuck some whiskey onto the trip and a
friend, whose dad owned the boat and was hosting the trip, got
drunk and sank the boat with me and his younger brother in the
front end.
</P>
<P>
   We drifted apart after that, and he died in a car wreck. My last
memory of him is his staggering into the light of the campfire,
wet, letting the alcohol dare him to talk tough to his father, who
chastised him for endangering other people and promptly knocked him
cold in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   The one frog we caught that night got away later when somebody
opened the storage compartment under the front seat where live
frogs were kept until time to clean them. No frog legs for
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Now most frog legs we eat come from somewhere else, like
Indonesia, where they are farmed for food. Domestic frogs are just
too hard or too expensive to mess with.
</P>
<P>
   Houses in East Texas always had a fishing pole tree, a China
berry or willow maybe, against which all the cane poles would be
stacked. You could go there and pick one out before you went to
fish for bream or catfish. Lots of them had frog gigs there, too.
They were sold in most hardware stories, but if you had one on your
scavenger hunt list today you'd be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need frog gigs if you don't have frogs. But where did
they go?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have that question all the time,'' said John Herron, who
heads the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's Wildlife Diversity
program. ``There's not question they are not as common as they once
were. We know they go through cycles, but we don't know why. We
can't say if it's a long-term decline or what the cause might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans have several species of frogs from which to choose when
they can find them, Herron said, all of them in the genus Rana.
``The bullfrog is mainly an animal of the eastern United States,
west to the Rocky Mountains,'' he said. ``We also have the leopard
frog, the bronze frog and the pig frog, as well as the Rio Grande
leopard frog in southern Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to catching and eating, though, they all are
lumped together as bullfrogs. That's not quite fair to the real
dudes. ``There's no doubt that the bullfrog is at the top of the
frog food chain,'' Herron said. ``They'll eat anything they can get
in their mouths, including other frogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The first one I ever caught, with my dad standing at my shoulder
and telling me what to do, was a big bullfrog that hit a Heddon
Crippled Minnow topwater plug. He put up a pretty good fight, too,
before we put him on the chain stringer and scheduled him for
supper. I've caught them by hand and shot them with .22s in South
Texas hunting lease tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But now they're gone for the most part. You still see one here
and there and sometimes, on nice summer nights, I'll hear one or
two big dudes crank up and announce their presence to the world.
I've never had a place to take my kids frog gigging and actually
find any, which is a shame.
</P>
<P>
   They've never gotten to see spider eyes shining on the bank or a
small alligator sink beneath the moss or fight off a water snake
that was trying to climb into the boat. The frogs were the catalyst
for all those experiences, the foundation of an adult life of
hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   A lot's missing without them.

BELIEFS: JEWISH VIEWS ON CHURCH AND STATE ARE COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While many American Jews waxed enthusiastic about the vice
presidential candidacy of Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman, more
than a few have also raised eyebrows at his very public expressions
of religious faith and his advocacy of a closer partnership between
government and religion.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews have long been among the strongest supporters of
strict separation of church and state. That has not changed, a new
study indicates, despite talk of growing Jewish disenchantment with
liberalism and growing popularity of Jewish religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also shows the complexity of Jewish views,
including large gaps between the Jewish public and Jewish
leadership, and indicates that Jewish leaders appear simultaneously
to insist on strict separation of church and state and to defend
the involvement of organized religion in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish strict separationism dates only from the 20th century.
Before that, Jews were generally willing to work within the
prevailing assumption that government should be supportive of
religion rather than neutral toward it. Jews simply demanded that
Judaism receive the same benevolence and privileges as
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish attitudes changed, according to Jonathan Sarna, professor
of American Jewish history at Harvard, when prominent Christian
churchmen (perhaps feeling their world imperiled by mass
immigration, industrialization and urbanization) began campaigning
to have the United States explicitly declared a Christian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jews reacted by allying themselves with nonreligious secularists
in a struggle to make public schools and other government
undertakings religiously neutral.
</P>
<P>
   This background is mentioned in a new survey conducted for the
Center for Jewish Community Studies in Philadelphia. It is part of
a larger research project on ``Jews and the American Public
Square,'' which in turn is part of a cluster of studies financed by
the Pew Charitable Trusts of major religious groups and American
civic life.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to detect any recent changes in Jewish views on church
and state, the survey compared three groups: a representative
sample of American Jews, a representative sample of non-Jewish
Americans that mirrored the Jewish sample in educational level and
geographic distribution, and a sample of Jewish leaders taken from
participants in the annual conference of the Jewish Council for
Public Affairs, a prominent Jewish communal defense agency.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding issues like religion in public schools, government aid
or vouchers for religious schools, and the display of Christmas
mangers or Hanukkah candles on government property, the study found
that American Jews remain firmly separationist. And their leaders
are even more so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 59 percent of the non-Jewish Americans in the study
favored allowing nondenominational prayers to be read in public
school classrooms. By contrast, only 20 percent of the Jewish
public favored allowing such prayers, and for Jewish leaders the
figure was 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish leaders' even stricter separationism cannot be
attributed to secularity. On virtually every measure of religiosity
or involvement in organized Jewish life, the leaders outscored the
general Jewish public. They light Sabbath candles, fast on Yom
Kippur, attend synagogues, visit Israel, pursue Jewish education,
and attest to the importance of Judaism in their lives at
significantly higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   At one fascinating point in the survey, this pattern suddenly
shifts into reverse. Asked whether ``belonging to a church or
synagogue makes one a more aware and engaged citizen,'' the Jewish
leaders are more apt to say yes than the Jewish public, and
virtually as likely as the parallel sample of non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the clergy can discuss political candidates or
issues from the pulpit, twice as many Jewish leaders as members of
the Jewish public say yes (73 percent to 35 percent), and more Jews
say yes than do their non-Jewish counterparts (35 percent to 30
percent). Half of the Jewish leaders defended the anti-abortion
movement's right to use religion in making its case, whereas 42
percent of the non-Jewish counterparts did and 15 percent of the
Jewish public.
</P>
<P>
   On the statement ``Churches and synagogues should keep out of
political matters,'' 44 percent of the Jewish public agreed, as did
36 percent of the non-Jewish counterparts _ but only 14 percent of
the Jewish leaders did.
</P>
<P>
   The survey presents an overall ``index of support for church
involvement in politics,'' giving the non-Jewish counterparts a
ranking of 49 percent, the Jewish public 46 percent, and the Jewish
leaders 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for this combination of strict separationism with a
defense of religious involvement in politics are not hard to come
by. Jewish leaders' commitment to freedom of speech or religion
would suffice, and then there is plain self-interest. To some
extent, they are simply defending their own role in public policy
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey reveals some curious anomalies. Fewer than one
of every five Jewish leaders agree that ``Democracy in the U.S.
works better if Americans are religious,'' and scarcely more than
one of 10 rank-and-file Jews agree Only 20 percent of the leaders
agree that ``The influence of religion in American life should
increase,'' and only 30 percent of the Jewish public hold this
view.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Cohen of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, who
designed and oversaw the survey, offers this interpretation. Jewish
leaders ``are, indeed, more committed than the Jewish public to the
right of religious institutions and leaders to engage in public
life and discourse,'' but like the Jewish public, the ``leaders are
unhappy with the actual exercise of that right.''
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that the explanation is not so logical, that
in-depth interviews would show different phrases conjuring up
different images in the minds of the survey's respondents. When
asked whether they are ``pleased when political leaders publicly
affirm their belief in God,'' Jews are far more likely to think of
a Christian political leader than, say, Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder only 22 percent of the Jewish leaders and 30 percent
of the Jewish public said yes, compared with 70 percent of the
non-Jewish counterparts.

 (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 Alecia Swasy, assistant managing editor for business at The St.
Petersburg Times, is the author of ``Soap Opera: The Inside Story
of Procter &AMP; Gamble.''  
 By ALECIA SWASY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inside our newsroom in St. Petersburg, Fla., is a filing-cabinet
drawer emblazoned with a yellow smiley face. We call it the Happy
Drawer _ home to the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not where we keep the Belvedere vodka. We're talking
chocolate. Hershey's Kisses, Snickers bars and Reese's peanut
butter cups.
</P>
<P>
   When the chocolate stash runs low, people get cranky. No small
problem, considering that there is a correlation between chocolate
served and articles produced. The average 1,000-word article might
require a handful of Kisses, while a 300-page nonfiction book might
mean 27{ pounds of peanut M &AMP; M's.
</P>
<P>
   So what a treat to come across the management tricks of fellow
chocolate aficionado Ellen Gordon, the chief executive of Tootsie
Roll Industries. At 68, Gordon presides over production of 49.5
million Tootsie Rolls and 16 million lollipops a day, generating a
net profit margin of 17 percent, far ahead of her competitors at
Hershey. She merits a place among the profiles of ``Why the Best
Man for the Job Is a Woman'' (Harper Business, $24), by Esther
Wachs Book, a former reporter at Forbes magazine who knows how to
put a human face on a business story.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes tend to cross at most management texts, but this one is
different. It's not a generalized, predictable tome on how and why
women should become leaders. Book's book is like a series of comfy
chats inside a corporate suite. We hear the voices of the women who
have broken into the boys' club.
</P>
<P>
   It's lonely there, and the statistics are truly pathetic. In
1999, women held just 12 percent of the senior posts in Fortune 500
companies. And women chief executives are as scarce as pandas. But
in broader terms, women still represent power and money _ they
control 85 percent of all personal and household spending.
</P>
<P>
   The profiles offer plenty of lessons. For starters, these women
never forget their roots.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Carsey, who developed ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Roseanne,''
then pitched them to the networks, is the daughter of a shipyard
worker and a homemaker from Quincy, Mass. A self-described nerd,
Carsey endured the gray, slushy winters by watching television.
Clearly, she understands the untapped market of female viewers.
``Roseanne,'' for instance, portrayed the absurdity of everyday
life for working moms.
</P>
<P>
   Carsey's shows became huge hits: her production company is worth
an estimated $1.2 billion and she is now a partner with Oprah
Winfrey in Oxygen Media, whose chief executive is Geraldine
Laybourne, a former chairwoman of the Nickelodeon cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these successful women knew hard and dirty work in
their childhood. Rebecca Mark slopped hogs in Missouri; she is now
chief executive of Azurix, a global water supplier started by
Enron. Her Escada blazer and Ebel watch belie her modest farm
roots, but the work ethic has remained. After her hotel was bombed
during a visit to Bombay, she worked by candlelight to develop a
new power plant for the city of Dabhoi. But that probably wasn't as
tough as raising her twins while earning her Harvard M.B.A. with
distinction. Just reading about her workweek made me want to take a
nap.
</P>
<P>
   All of these women also demonstrate the importance of
establishing confidence at an early age. Researchers have found
that self-esteem for many girls plummets at about the age of 13.
One survey cited in the book found that 60 percent of girls are
happy in elementary school, but that drops to 29 percent in high
school. Boys maintained a higher level of self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Sports were important confidence-builders for many of the women,
including Meg Whitman, chief executive of eBay, who was a swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Along with self-confidence, of course, comes the courage to take
chances. Carsey, for instance, quit a comfortable job at the
networks, took out a second mortgage and started her company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women lead by example and know how to balance work
and family. They go to school plays and don't miss birthday
parties. That sends a clear message to their colleagues: ``I trust
you to get the work done. You don't have to account for every
minute of your time.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has a couple of flaws. First, the editors could have
shown us some mercy by deleting every other use of the word
``paradigm.'' A far greater problem is the excessive fawning over
unsympathetic characters like Darla D. Moore. The book chronicles
Moore's time at Chemical Bank, where the bankruptcy and
reorganization unit she ran earned millions a year before she
joined her husband, Richard E. Rainwater, the billionaire investor,
as president of his investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   In her Upper East Side Manhattan condo, the book says, she
displays a floor-to-ceiling oil painting of herself, decked in
burgundy taffeta. And the book acknowledges her reputation as a
manager who motivates by fear. One of her mantras to employees:
``So, what are you wasting your time on today?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for my money, the single fat paragraph given to Moore's and
Rainwater's woes in the Columbia/HCA Healthcare scandal falls
short. The two were slow to catch on to Richard L. Scott's
management problems at the chain, which Rainwater founded with
Scott. Eventually, Moore pushed for Scott's ouster, but it took a
federal investigation into allegations of Medicare fraud to get her
attention. Columbia paid hefty penalties in settling the case, and
shareholders saw their investment dwindle. But, hey, Moore wants to
be a role model for young M.B.A.'s attending the Darla Moore School
of Business, a result of her $25 million contribution to the
University of South Carolina. This might not be someone I want my
nieces to admire.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the good stuff _ chocolate. Gordon's family has
controlled Tootsie Roll for 65-plus years. Her grandfather had sold
paper to the company and noticed that management was late in paying
its bills. Enter Grandma, who saved a bit of her teacher's pay to
buy up Tootsie Roll stock. Other relatives did likewise, and the
family bought a controlling interest after the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Her father took young Ellen along with him to work, and she
wrote a high school essay on how she wanted to become a
businesswoman, a laughable notion in that era.
</P>
<P>
   After college, she and her husband took over the company. She
watched General Motors and other American manufacturers lag behind
foreign competitors because they failed to invest in new
technology. So she invested in high-speed machines and listened to
employee feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a manager, you really don't know all the answers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At meetings, many people may drop by to offer their points of
view. ``That's why my chairs have wheels on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company doesn't even track turnover; most employees have
been there for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing 70, Gordon still gets calls from headhunters with job
offers; she rebuffs them. She has no plans to retire but hopes to
pass on the Tootsie Roll business someday to one of her daughters
or a top manager. ``I love the game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Must be all that chocolate.

AMBASSADOR SAYS DAUGHTER DIDN'T USE OFFENDING PHRASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYDE, England _ In the dog days of August, what media types here
call the silly season, it is manna from heaven, an
honest-to-goodness diplomatic scandal, a cultural war pitting a
trash-talking American teenager against all that is good about
British chivalry.
</P>
<P>
   In a first-person account on the perils of dating in London,
Mary-Catherine Lader, the 15-year-old daughter of the US ambassador
to Britain, wrote in the society magazine Tatler:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the English countryside, the Scottish Highlands, the
sheep in Wales, and above all else, living in London. But when I
started going out here, I found that British boys really suck.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to laud the social skills and looks of American boys
while disparaging English boys as scrawny, pale, and awkward, and
it immediately became front-page news. Virtually every newspaper,
radio, and TV station in Britain, including the staid BBC, picked
up the story.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the tabloids denounced the ambassador's daughter as
a spoiled, whiny American princess who couldn't get a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Burrows, a columnist for the Mirror, suggested that Lader
should ``pack up her Prada bag, go back to the land of Jerry
Springer, and get it on with all the obese cretins and racist
red-necks.''
</P>
<P>
   The story was picked up and ran all around the world, but few
journalists bothered to call the US embassy, and none waited until
the Laders, who are out of the country on vacation, could be
reached. Had they, they would have learned that US Ambassador
Philip Lader is considering suing Tatler magazine because he and
his daughter claim the magazine made up the most controversial line
in the piece, in which she allegedly wrote that ``British boys
really suck.''
</P>
<P>
   The line appeared in headlines throughout Britain, and was
seized upon by most commentators as evidence that Miss Lader was
too ignorant and immature to get an English boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   While there was probably enough criticism of English boys in the
article to trigger some stories, it was that incendiary line that
has captured the imagination, and indignation, of many.
</P>
<P>
   Lader and his family were still out of the country Friday, but
Lader released a letter in which he said it was an editor at Tatler
who first suggested the offending line. Lader said his daughter
refused, but the editor unilaterally inserted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the article appeared, not only was that phrase included,
but it was highlighted in large, red typeface,'' Lader wrote to
Tatler editor Geordie Greig. Lader said the editors ``promised to
send her the final edit of her article before publication. This was
never received, and she never signed any release.''
</P>
<P>
   The line, he concluded, ``was not in her submitted draft and
actually was suggested by an adult editor. This has caused
considerable embarrassment to my daughter and our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatler fired back Friday, as Greig insisted Miss Lader
authorized the wording and signed off on the final draft.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever's telling the truth, what began as a story about an
undiplomatic diplomat's daughter was evolving into an indictment of
the British press, often criticized for printing rumors, unverified
information and, if Lader's allegations are true, fabrications.
</P>
<P>
   At the US embassy, embassy spokeswoman Carol Lynn MacCurdy said
The Globe, Newsweek, ABC News, and NBC News, and the Reuters wire
service were the only media organizations that waited for the
Laders' response before going with the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, at least no one in the British press, bothered to call
and get our side. They just ran with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph devoted more than half a page to the affair,
running three stories, plus an editorial pondering whether the
15-year-old's verbal attack had affected the ``special
relationship'' between Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Telegraph stories, the reporter sought comments
from English teenagers who, with nothing to back their assertions,
suggested that Lader's broadside was the result of her having just
been dumped by an English boy.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Miss Lader of embracing stereotypes of English men as
tongue-tied fops, many hurled stereotypes back at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``As she is an ambassador for American girls, I would like to
say that they are all presumptuous, offensive and very
irritating,'' teenager George Kemp wrote in the Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   MacCurdy said some American newspapers did no better than their
British counterparts. She said the Washington Post, the
Philadelphia Enquirer, and the Houston Chronicle ran items about
the Tatler piece without calling the embassy for comment.
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Lader returns to the prestigious St. Paul's school
next month, she will no doubt be asked to explain lines such as,
``I'm not sure it's actually possible to become friends with a
British teenage guy. His idea is to to ask two questions. . .and
then feel entitled to stick his tongue down your throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how many of those lines may have been embellished by
Tatler's editors remained unclear. MacCurdy said when the Laders
return, they will go over the article ``line by line.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Isle of Wight Friday, young English people were mostly
amused by the scandal. Naomi Mead, 16, said some of Lader's
criticisms of English boys are valid, but ``you can't generalize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say all English boys are like that, nor should you
say all American boys are one way or the other,'' said Mead,
displaying a sense of fairness that was hard to find in the British
media.

GORE ACCEPTS BACKING OF UAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Pa. _ Al Gore's labor pains abated somewhat Friday,
as an effusively thankful vice president accepted the long-awaited
endorsement of a powerful union, the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful to you more than I can say in words,'' Gore told
a crowd of boisterous UAW members at a rally at Willow Run airport
near Detroit, where a red carpet had been rolled out to greet the
Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the world to me. I respect you, I appreciate what
you have done, and I thank you for your help.''
</P>
<P>
   UAW President Stephen Yokich _ who once accused Gore of
``holding hands with the profiteers of the world'' for backing a
free trade agreement with China _ offered his full support for the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be our candidate,'' Yokich told the vice
president, who pumped his fists exuberantly in the air as Yokich
reported the unanimous UAW board vote to endorse Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a clear choice. I don't think Bush, Juniorhad a
chance,'' Yokich said. ``You name it, he's against what we believe
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he and his running-mate, Connecticut Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman, would not only ``defend the right to organize, we're
going to strengthen it.'' Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew who does not
work from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, skipped the labor
event so he could be back in Washington to observe the Jewish
sabbath with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president acknowledged his support of free-trade
agreements _ pacts organized labor has opposed _ but said ``we have
to use trade to lift up labor and environmental standards around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign staff were obviously relieved to get the
endorsement, especially before the Democratic National Convention
begins in Los Angeles on Monday. Membership in the 700,000-strong
union is big in Illinois, Ohio and Michigan, a senior Gore campaign
advisor noted, giving Gore a needed boost in those delegate-rich
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a long process, they made their decision, and I beleive
it was the right one,'' said Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile.
``This campaign has the support of working families,'' she said,
echoing the campaign's pre-convention theme.
</P>
<P>
   For an incumbent vice president and Democratic party nominee,
Gore has had a comparatively tough time nailing down support from
from some sectors of organized labor. While the Democratic nominee
last October won the backing of the AFL-CIO, he only this week got
the endorsement of the UAW after persistent lobbying by the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some UAW members said they were still annoyed with Gore for his
support for international trade agreements the workers said could
cost American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It was best that the union held back its support as long as it
did, said member Dan Shepherd, 52. ``If you get into a commitment
too early, then you run the risk of giving the union a black eye if
the guy turns out wrong,'' Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW had flirted with the idea of backing consumer advocate
Ralph Nader for president. Nader has been winning about four to
five percent of voter support in opinion polls _ limited support
but perhaps enough to tip the balance from Gore to Bush in some key
states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staff met with UAW members at the union leadership's
request, the Gore senior aide said, and garnered the endorsement by
winning over the rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president still hasn't gotten the official approval of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, whose president, James
Hoffa Jr., was honored at a reception at the Republican National
Convention earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa is, a delegate-at-large at the Democratic convention next
week, but the union is still not likely to issue an endorsement _
if they even decide to endorse at all _ until after Labor Day, said
Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoffa's always been a Democrat, but he's an uncommitted
delegate,'' Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The union is conducting a ``scientific poll'' of its members
this month, and will take its cue from the results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Hoffa have not met personally since late April,
Caldwell said. But Gore and Teamsters staff have been in contact at
least once a week, he and Gore aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor has been miffed at Gore for his ardent support
for free-trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade
Agreement and the China trade agreement. Union leaders argue that
expanding free trade will undermine American workers and benefit
operations in foreign nations were wages are low and environmental
standards are lax.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have also backed the trade bills, and Democrats
hope that union leaders will ultimately realize they are better
off, overall, with Gore than with his opponent, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed what everyone else has noticed, which is this
playful repartee between unions and Nader,'' said Representative
Jose Serrano, Democrat of New York, who is a longtime labor
advocate. ``I can't see how they could go anywhere else'' but to
the Democrats, who have been ``nice to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at this point, labor doesn't realize that the Democrats are
their friends, then the problem is bigger than this election,''
Serrano said.

   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ The most dangerous place in Europe today
is Montenegro, the small republic tied to Serbia in the Yugoslav
Federation. Slobodan Milosevic could intervene there at any time,
overthrowing the freedom-minded Montenegrin government and once
again challenging the West.
</P>
<P>
   What can and should the United States and its allies do now to
prevent a Milosevic demarche on Montenegro? I put the question to
President Milan Kucan of Slovenia, the most successful of the
former Yugoslav republics. Kucan has known Milosevic for 40 years,
and he has offered wise advice to the West since Milosevic set out
a dozen years ago on his course of demagogy and bloodshed _ advice
that was too often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a greater presence of the Sixth Fleet in the Adriatic,''
Kucan replied. ``Be willing to provide military instructors if
((Milo)) Djukanovic ((the Montenegrin president)) asks for them.
Support Djukanovic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army has at least 10,000 men in Montenegro, and
Milosevic could use them in a coup. There is a Montenegrin police
force of about 15,000, but it is ill trained for warfare. Some
believe it could be effective if NATO grounded the Yugoslav air
force by imposing a no-flight zone on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Kucan said the U.S. and its allies should stop urging Djukanovic
not to boycott the Yugoslav presidential election that Milosevic
has called for Sept. 24, amending the constitution so he can run
again. The world has the ``illusion'' that Montenegro can combine
with Serbian opposition parties and defeat Milosevic, he said. But
those parties are weak and divided, and Montenegro cannot remake
Serbian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic has moved gingerly toward declaring Montenegro
independent, but not taken a decisive step. Kucan said Montenegro
``must not remain a hostage in Yugoslavia. It has the right to live
democratically and become a European state.'' Djukanovic ``cannot
legitimize Milosevic's election _ he'd be compromising himself in
front of his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Milosevic move on Montenegro, if it comes, could be intensely
troublesome for President Clinton _ and Vice President Al Gore. It
would be difficult to find a legal basis for military intervention,
given the fact that Montenegro is still formally a part of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kucan said Milosevic was ``looking for an excuse to intervene.''
He said there was a fundamental element that had to be understood:
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic  &UR; has &LR;  to be re-elected president of Yugoslavia. It
guarantees not just his political but his physical existence. He's
knows very well what happened to ((Nicolae)) Ceausescu'' _ the
Romanian Communist dictator who was killed by his people when they
revolted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could be ``a very important factor in his existence,''
Kucan said. He suggested that Vladimir Putin, the Russian
president, could ``guarantee Milosevic refuge, in Russia or
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a pragmatist,'' Kucan said. ``To raise Russian
standards of living he needs the help of the West. He knows that,
and he knows help has a price. He cannot pay the price if it's
Chechnya, but he can if it's Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucan spent years in Belgrade in the old Yugoslavia. When he
became leader of the Slovene Communist Party in 1986, he moved the
republic toward democracy. He was elected president of independent
Slovenia in 1992 and overwhelmingly re-elected in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Kucan approach has made Slovenia, a country the size of
Israel to the east of Venice, a model of post-Communist democracy
and respect for civil liberties. It is prosperous and exceptionally
uncorrupt. The finance minister said its 2 million people were
``compulsive taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Kucan urged the American secretary of state, James
Baker, to help the Yugoslav republics become independent
peacefully. But President Bush wanted to discourage the breakup of
the Soviet Union, so Baker told Milosevic that we favored
preserving Yugoslavia. Milosevic took that as a green light for his
savage assaults on Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning of the Yugoslav crisis in 1988,''
Kucan said, ``the West has always acted five minutes after
midnight. Now it's time to act five minutes before midnight.''

 _ SFCHRON  
AS THEY STRUGGLE TO SPEAK HIS NAME &HT;    BY JOHN DIAZ

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES _Which is most perilous to a politician: to embrace
President Clinton too enthusiastically or to attack him too
harshly?
<P>
   To judge from Campaign 2000, either option is, to borrow a
phrase, an unduly risky scheme.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the almost painstaking avoidance of the
words ``Bill Clinton'' by both Republicans and Democrats in the
spotlight these days.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, Republicans on the podium in Philadelphia made plenty
of references to the need for ``character'' and ``dignity'' in the
White House. The Democrats gathering at Staples Center this week
will not let Americans forget that the ``policies of the last eight
years'' have produced peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, George W. Bush delivered an hourlong acceptance speech
without
once mentioning the president by name. Al Gore and his Democratic
running mate Joseph Lieberman spoke for a combined 50 minutes at
their Nashville, Tenn., announcement event last Tuesday. Their
C-word count: Zero.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost surreal, considering the passions generated during
the impeachment process just a year and a half ago. No one seems to
want to really run with or against the legacy of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, Clinton himself. Clinton can always be
counted on to do what is best for Clinton. Compromise, apologize,
triangulate, lie under oath, retreat, apologize even harder _
whatever it takes. Follow him or try to block him at your peril.
Who is more frustrated today: Mike McCurry,
George Stephanopoulos, Gore and all the other Clinton insiders who
put their reputations and careers on the line to defend him? Or
Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingston, Tom DeLay, Henry Hyde and all the
Republicans who thought for sure they were about to finish him off
politically?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder both sides are keeping their distance.
</P>
<P>
   This week's convention is a perfect example of Clinton's self
absorption. One would think he might feel the pain of Gore and all
those Democratic members of Congress who trouped out to the White
House lawn on that dark December day to stand behind him after he
was impeached. The Democrats are now in serious danger of losing
control of the White House and both houses of Congress for the
first time since 1952. So what is the biggest fund-raising event of
all in Los Angeles, the one with the big
stars and big money?
</P>
<P>
   Why, it's a brunch at Barbara Streisand's Malibu compound to
raise $10 million for the Clinton Library, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Clinton will interpret history
in that Little Rock library. Will there be a replica of the Lincoln
Bedroom, with a kiosk explaining how the Clinton presidency
perfected the art of the soft-money deal? Will visitors in headsets
hear tapes of his evasive depositions as they view models of the
Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of positives to highlight in that library,
as Clinton himself surely will remind us in his prime-time speech
tonight. His timing was perfect, his instincts impressive, in
myriad ways. He came into office as the end of the Cold War
lightened the demand on defense spending, and created the climate
for a commitment to balanced budgets. He broke from party orthodoxy
to agree to welfare reform just as the economy was booming enough
to cushion its effects. He had a knack for knowing when to turn on
his interpersonal skills, and when to use the bully pulpit to
summon the pressure of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to dominate the political scene, even when his name
is not spoken. Yet there is remarkably little afterglow for
Democrats, no percentage in hatred for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like it, don't plan a vacation in Little Rock,
where the library will someday soon be the No. 1 destination. He
will be unrepentant and unindicted, but oddly unrevered, despite
his shopping list of accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a
generation,'' Bush said in his Philadelphia acceptance speech. ``So
many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But, in the end, to
what end?
</P>
<P>
   ``So much promise, to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is right about a president he cannot bring himself to
criticize without adding a concession of admiration.
</P>
<P>
   And many Democrats here must agree with those words _ albeit for
very different reasons _ about a president they cannot bring
themselves to praise without an obligatory expression of
condemnation about his personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they will not admit to their uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   As they struggle to speak his name.

SMART MONEY'S ON TNT'S NEW WALL STREET DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newest theory in TV programming is that, if America can
embrace innumerable ensemble dramas about doctors, lawyers and
cops, it can handle an ensemble drama about investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   We may not know an IPO from a hole in our pocket, but producer
Michael Chernuchin believes we still can care about well-dressed,
well-educated, well-heeled plutocrats whose sole purpose is to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   No patching leaky aortas here. No defending the common man. It's
survival of the fattest cat, and if someone happens to have a
conscience, well, even Wall Street has to pay lip service to
equal-opportunity strictures.
</P>
<P>
   Chernuchin's ``Bull,'' premiering Tuesday night on TNT, does
likewise, with a Caucasian cast punctuated by one person of color.
Maybe that's just art imitating life. As one stiff-collared
boardroom bully says in the premiere episode, there is a glass
ceiling for minorities on Wall Street, because rich white people
spending billions in the rarefied air of high finance might not
want to be sitting across the table from, ahem, persons not like
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bold assertion that could be uttered about many other
industries, TV included. In any event, it leaves Malik Yoba (``New
York Undercover'') the sole minority member of an impressive cast.
And even his character, Harvard-educated Corey Granville, doesn't
seem to realize he's an outsider. The son of academicians,
Granville is a member of the black elite, unaccustomed to bigotry
and racially motivated limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he recognizes and accepts it, all will be well,''
says Robert ``The Kaiser'' Roberts, head of the investment banking
firm where Granville has sold $10 million worth of Brazilian bonds
the firm has been trying to unload for six months.
</P>
<P>
   What Roberts doesn't know is that Granville is part of a
renegade group planning to bolt the firm and open their own shop.
And the leader of the pack is Roberts' own grandson Robert III,
better known as Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   This is the premise of ``Bull'': young people on Wall Street
getting rich, doing it their way, maybe even thumbing their noses
at the old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Chernuchin, executive producer of ``Law &AMP; Order'' for more than
half of its 10 seasons, says he got the idea for ``Bull'' when he
was working as a lawyer in New York City. He was sitting with three
friends, all of them investment bankers, all of them about 25 years
old, and they invited him to join them at Pebble Beach. They had
leased a private plane and were flying across the country for a
round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Chernuchin's idea didn't fly for about 10 years. But now, with
the majority of Americans owning shares in publicly held companies,
the concept is hotter than Microsoft stock used to be. Besides
``Bull,'' the prime-time pipeline this fall includes Darren Star's
``The $treet,'' airing on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an opening 10 minutes of Wall Street jargon that will
confuse anyone who wasn't born with a silver certificate in his
mouth, this ``Bull'' is worth riding. With the remarkable Stanley
Tucci appearing as a recurring slimeball, and Donald Moffat as the
Kaiser, ``Bull'' shapes up as the smartest thing TNT has done in a
while.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel calls the show its first original series,
which isn't exactly true. It aired ``Crusade,'' the sequel to
``Babylon 5.'' But who's counting? ``Bull'' has an interesting
look, not unlike ``The West Wing,'' and an attractive cast, led by
George Newbern as the eccentric Ditto and Christopher Wiehl as the
fresh-faced underdog, Carson Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Chernuchin's first script, while a little heavy on insider
patois, is reminiscent of ``L.A. Law'' in its heyday. Each
character gets good lines, not just setups for the marquee players
to hit out of the park. It's the mark of a good ensemble show, and
in a new season that's looking meager for the commercial networks,
Chernuchin and TNT may have hit the bullseye.
</P>
<P>
   BULL
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: One-hour drama series about a breakaway Wall Street
investment-banking firm
</P>
<P>
   CAST: George Newbern, Malik Yoba, Donald Moffat, Elisabeth Rohm,
Ian Kahn, Alicia Coppola and Christopher Wiehl
</P>
<P>
   WHEN: Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: TNT cable
</P>

COMPANY BRINGING WIRELESS DATA TO TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: eXitSource is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even ennui, it now seems, moves at Internet speed.
</P>
<P>
   Take the wireless Net, for example. In the barely eight months
since cellphones connected to the Internet hit the mass market, the
general sentiment has rapidly gone from ``Isn't that amazing?'' to
``What a stupid user interface!''
</P>
<P>
   The promise of using your cellphone to surf the Web has crashed
into the reality of tiny screens and the hassle of using a
telephone keypad. That has quickly led cellphone companies and
wireless content providers to conclude that what people want from
their phone is not the whole Net but specific information tailored
for quick access and manageable display.
</P>
<P>
   A good example of the trend is a newly launched service from an
Atlanta-area company called eXitSource that provides information
about restaurants, lodging and hospitals at 20,000 US Interstate
highway exits.
</P>
<P>
   While the information could theoretically be obtained from a Web
site such as MapQuest over the phone, eXitSource has worked over
its database to make data available with as few as four keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   By entering a state and choosing from a list of Interstates,
wireless users can get a list of restaurants, gas stations, motels
and hospitals arranged by exit, and find out what is available at
each exit for the next 25 or 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the service has become available in the last two weeks
as a featured link on Net phones from Verizon Wireless and Nextel,
and another national carrier is expected to sign on for the service
as soon as next week, Peterson said. It can also be reached from
any wireless Net phone by someone willing to enter the Internet
address of 216.205.12.122.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the application that fuels the market for
wireless Net phones,'' said eXitSource president Ron Peterson.
``This is what takes you from `nice to have' to `need to have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Market research firm DataQuest has estimated that the US will
have 12.6 million wireless data users by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   However, many industry officials and analysts contend it is
still not clear whether current wireless Net offerings and promised
enhancements are compelling enough to achieve some of the rosier
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, wireless Net access could turn out to be something
millions of Americans do sign up for _ but actually use only a few
times a week or month, which would limit both how much they would
be willing to pay for it and how much wireless content providers
can reasonably hope to make from the services.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lowenstein, a senior wireless analyst with The Yankee Group
in Boston, said, ``There's really nothing that has hit big in the
US. I think we are still in a great experimentation phase. Nobody
really knows exactly what content people want to get access to, so
right now we are in a big market-test phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some wireless officials acknowledge that what entices
people to pay an extra $10 or $15 a month to get Net access from
their phone is not what they expected last year when services were
first launched allowing people to get news headlines, weather
forecasts and stock quotes from their cellphone screen.
</P>
<P>
   While ``mobile financial services'' such as obtaining stock
quotes or even trading stocks with a phone are by many accounts the
most popular of the services offered, Lowenstein said most studies
find no more than one in four wireless Net subscribers use them
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Maggio, president of NetMorf, a Boston company that
tailors Internet content for display over a phone, said, ``The
mobile consumer is vastly different from Web users.
</P>
<P>
   ``While typical online Web users require lots of rich content,
mobile users need precisely the right information delivered at a
time when every minute counts,'' Maggio said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, what eXitSource can offer over a wireless phone is
pretty thin, and not much more informative than the simple signs
you would see right before the off-ramp.
</P>
<P>
   It can tell you there is a hospital near a given exit off the
interstate, for example, but it does not give the name of the
hospital, how far away it is or any directions. ``We wanted to come
out quickly with a 1.0 version,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein said eXitSource is on the right track by offering
information that requires ``as little data entry as possible to
get.'' But he said, ``You still have to enter a lot of information.
That's OK if you're a passenger, but if you're a solo driver it
brings up some (safety) concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Peterson said, eXitSource hopes to make money by
charging food or hotel chains to include better information, such
as directions and whether a given McDonald's or Burger King has a
playground or a gas station has a car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Cellphone owners using eXitSource to get information might be
able to learn the names of four restaurants or three gas stations
near an exit, but would only get complete directions and richer
information about those whose owners had paid eXitSource to have
the extra data listed.
</P>
<P>
   Already the service includes a link to many hotel and motel
listings allowing people, once they have located lodgings near an
exit, to make a voice call instantly to the reservation desk.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also working with California-based speech
technology giant Nuance to develop a system with which people could
use their voice instead of pressing keys on the phone to request
information about services at each exit.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old eXitSource, formerly known as Interstate America,
sends a crew of 40 people out to continually survey every exit on
the 45,000-mile Interstate system. Its financial backers include
Zenrin, a leading Japanese developer of geographical information,
and buyers of its data include Rand McNally and General Motors'
Onstar in-vehicle data service.
</P>
<P>
   Well before launching the wireless service, eXitSource has been
making money developing specialized directories for trucking
companies, tour-bus operators and recreational vehicle owner
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Based on measurements of parking lot sizes made by satellite
positioning devices, these directories include listings of
restaurants with lots big enough to park a truck or camper, as well
as sites that have facilities at which to empty an RV toilet.
</P>
<P>
   eXitSource researchers visit every business or service within a
half-mile of each exit and re-survey sites at least annually to
keep up with changes, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   New cellular systems are being developed that can determine
where a cellphone user is, either by triangulating their distance
from cellphone towers or using the Pentagon's satellite positioning
system.
</P>
<P>
   With such a system, eXitSource could effectively ``push''
information to subscribers about services available at the next 10
exits in the direction in which they are travelling. But Peterson
said he thinks it could be 18 months before such location systems
are functional.
</P>
<P>
   While Peterson is confident that traveling consumers will find
eXitSource's database helpful, he acknowledged: ``We have to figure
out how to make money at this.''

 &HT;    Women reeling in the outdoors life
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hunting and fishing are wonderful ways to spend
time outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, it seems, is getting started. People who
get the chance to go when they're young tend to stick with it.
However, it's much harder to recruit adults into the outdoors
world.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department learned
that long ago. Besides having programs directed at youngsters, the
agency has set its sights on women with a program called ``Becoming
an Outdoor Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1993, more than 4,000 women have come
through its seminar program, many of whom have gone on to join
other organizations and try advanced skills activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ideal model that creates a system to keep them moving
through the various programs, one-day seminars, weekend events and
local events that are more advanced,'' said Steve Hall, education
coordinator for Texas Parks and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The women who have come to the program, which was pioneered in
Wisconsin but has grown intensely in Texas, are looking to learn
traditional skills, too. ``Shotgun shooting and fly-fishing are the
two most popular events among all the seminars,'' Hall said.
Canoeing is another popular activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the five weekend events held each year, there are various
education modules from which to choose for each afternoon and
morning session. The basic classes have been the best, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advertising workshops that are fairly broad, but they
are about one-third shooting, one-third fishing and one-third other
activities,'' Hall said. Some women come back to subsequent weekend
events to study other courses, as well as enjoy the campfire
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   TPWD has expanded the outdoor women's program. There are now 12
chapters around the state, including Austin, through which women
can take part in outdoors field activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's neat is that we can get a one-day introduction to many
of the teaching modules,'' Hall said. ``We can go around and
present these programs, and that recruits them to the weekend
seminars or the TOWN (Texas Outdoor Women's Network) chapters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall admits that just offering some seminars for women won't
bridge the gap that's created when those individuals haven't been
exposed to the outdoors as children. As a result, Parks and
Wildlife is looking at methods for expanding women's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two ways of doing that, starting with a program called
`Wonders of the Outdoor World' or `WOW.' That will be family events
in a camplike setting,'' Hallo said. Getting families involved will
help women be involved, as well as expose youngsters to the
outdoors at an age when the lessons can stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing we're looking at is CEO,'' Hall said. That
stands for `Corporate Executives in the Outdoors,' a program that
will allow companies to deal with leisure activities and stress
management through outdoor programs.''

 &HT;    Women reeling in the outdoors life
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hunting and fishing are wonderful ways to spend
time outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, it seems, is getting started. People who
get the chance to go when they're young tend to stick with it.
However, it's much harder to recruit adults into the outdoors
world.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department learned
that long ago. Besides having programs directed at youngsters, the
agency has set its sights on women with a program called ``Becoming
an Outdoor Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1993, more than 4,000 women have come
through its seminar program, many of whom have gone on to join
other organizations and try advanced skills activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ideal model that creates a system to keep them moving
through the various programs, one-day seminars, weekend events and
local events that are more advanced,'' said Steve Hall, education
coordinator for Texas Parks and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The women who have come to the program, which was pioneered in
Wisconsin but has grown intensely in Texas, are looking to learn
traditional skills, too. ``Shotgun shooting and fly-fishing are the
two most popular events among all the seminars,'' Hall said.
Canoeing is another popular activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the five weekend events held each year, there are various
education modules from which to choose for each afternoon and
morning session. The basic classes have been the best, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advertising workshops that are fairly broad, but they
are about one-third shooting, one-third fishing and one-third other
activities,'' Hall said. Some women come back to subsequent weekend
events to study other courses, as well as enjoy the campfire
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   TPWD has expanded the outdoor women's program. There are now 12
chapters around the state, including Austin, through which women
can take part in outdoors field activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's neat is that we can get a one-day introduction to many
of the teaching modules,'' Hall said. ``We can go around and
present these programs, and that recruits them to the weekend
seminars or the TOWN (Texas Outdoor Women's Network) chapters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall admits that just offering some seminars for women won't
bridge the gap that's created when those individuals haven't been
exposed to the outdoors as children. As a result, Parks and
Wildlife is looking at methods for expanding women's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two ways of doing that, starting with a program called
`Wonders of the Outdoor World' or `WOW.' That will be family events
in a camplike setting,'' Hallo said. Getting families involved will
help women be involved, as well as expose youngsters to the
outdoors at an age when the lessons can stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing we're looking at is CEO,'' Hall said. That
stands for `Corporate Executives in the Outdoors,' a program that
will allow companies to deal with leisure activities and stress
management through outdoor programs.''

LOOKING FOR THE METHOD BEHIND SCOOTER MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By JOHN LELAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The maitre d' at Coup, a swanky New American
restaurant in the East Village, smiled as he fingered the coat
check ticket. Coup is a place of daring high-modern style, and one
can only imagine what finery has passed through its coat room. Yet
even so, this article cut a figure: sleek of line, cutting-edge in
design, of the moment and yet blue-collar practical. ``I'm so glad
you had this ticket,'' the maitre d' smiled, ``to distinguish it
from all the others back there.'' He handed over my scooter, and I
rode off into the night.
</P>
<P>
   For one week, the idea was to travel everywhere on these two
resin wheels, testing whether these fashionable new scooters were a
viable alternative to cabs and hoofing. Since arriving from Hong
Kong at Christmas, the chrome Razor scooters, which go for about
$100 a pop, have been selling out at both Toys ``R'' Us and the
Sharper Image, appealing equally to superannuated kids and to the
regular kind. With a handful of other manufacturers and
distributors jumping on the Razor wagon, the devices have become a
new form of transit for New York's urban masses.
</P>
<P>
   But on to the road test. As a mode of transportation, sadly, the
scooter proved the stiletto heel of the two-wheeled set: great to
look at, lousy for carrying laundry to the dry cleaner. Scootering
is work, especially at rush hour. The small wheels bog down on the
city's rough surfaces, and the base rides so low that any size bump
becomes a potential obstacle. By the time I reached the office my
first morning, after a 40-block ride, I was drenched in
perspiration, my knee was bruised from a near tumble, and my hands
ached as if I'd been working a jackhammer.
</P>
<P>
   These things I learned: cracks and seams in the sidewalk are not
the scooterist's friend; a polite ``excuse me'' cuts you only so
much slack; and the scooterist's code is a subtle one. One
afternoon, as I passed a fellow rider somewhat my junior _ say, by
about 30 years _ I threw him a fraternal salute. The boy stared
back blankly and whizzed by. This, I figured, is the code of the
road, at least when some crazy adult lets go of his handgrip,
posing a threat to self and all around.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as I glided around town, weaving perilously among the
scaffolds, I felt part of a new urban tribe, joined by our
insouciant disregard for the slow pace of pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pavement-bound, they mostly didn't get it.
Construction guys asked for a lift; others shot dirty looks,
rightly fearing for their ankles. When I did impress a couple of
gym bunnies on Eighth Avenue with my lapidary roll, they simply
parked themselves in my path, astounded that they had just read ``a
whole article'' about these gizmos in a men's fashion magazine.
Fine. Now get out of my way.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned that, contrary to what you might think, it is
actually the stationary leg, not the pushing one, that gets the
more rigorous workout: or rather, the gluteal muscles attached to
that leg. If you aren't careful to switch legs from time to time,
you might find that your seated position begins to lean to the left
or right, poor form in most any occupation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, once you get the hang of it, there is real
fetishistic satisfaction in unfolding the finely machined frame _
every bar and bolt sliding silently into place _ and of breaking it
down again before entering the Met or your local noodle house. For
those of us who have never had call to assemble a high-powered
weapon in a James Bond movie, this seems the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, steady rains and the scooter-related return of an
old repetitive strain injury cut my experiment short. It was a
relief to rejoin the slow-moving ranks of the asphalt-bound.
</P>
<P>
   As a trend, scootermania properly belongs in the category of
irrational mob behavior, like soccer rioting or capri pants: one
person starts shouting something, an alpha male does this or that,
and before you know it, everybody is on scooters. I was ready to
get off the razor's edge.

LOOKER HOPES HE'LL CATCH ON WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM KALEC  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The dream started with a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired wide receiver Dane Looker practiced with the
Patriots for the first time Tuesday, approximately three years
removed from a conversation that forever changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ater completing his second season at Division 2 Western
Washington University _ not as football player but as a shooting
guard averaging 14 points per game _ a former high school teammate
asked Looker a simple question.
</P>
<P>
   The answer has led him to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My buddy Brock Huard, who is a quarterback with the Seahawks
right now, he (said), `Why not try and play football at the
University of Washington?' I played high school ball with Brock and
junior high school ball with Brock so it was kind of an ongoing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   One that Looker felt had reached its completion when he accepted
Huard's challenge and walked on. He made the Huskies team, but
Looker never expected to make a real impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal when I got to Washington was to make it on the
field once during my career,'' Looker said. ``I didn't have any
intentions of starting, so it was my dream to start. The coach
didn't give me any assurance about anything there.''
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Patriots gave up a 2002 sixth-round draft choice
for Looker, he is joining a deep and somewhat established corps of
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn isn't going anywhere. Veterans Vincent Brisby, Troy
Brown, and Tony Simmons are virtual locks to make the final cut.
Plus, Looker is battling Matt Bumgardner, Shockmain Davis, Tony
Gaiter, and Sean Morey for a spot on the 53-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Looker caught 72 Huard passes for more than 700 yards
and five touchdowns. As a senior, his numbers dropped considerably
because Huard's replacement, Marques Tuiasosopo, was primarily a
running quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   So after an established two-year collegiate career, Looker
received his degree and was ready to move on to a life without
football. But his agent got on the phone and called all 31 NFL
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after I caught the 72 balls I never thought that I had a
shot at the NFL,'' Looker said. ``I thought you had to have a
four-year career for the NFL to look at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have very much interest from any teams, to be honest
with you. My agent called around and St. Louis was the only one to
take the bait.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' free agent catch of the day hauled in three receptions
in his first professional appearance to lead all receivers. For his
efforts, Looker was given his first taste of what life can be like
in the NFL _ he was traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know they traded free agents,'' Looker said with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Looker has relished the opportunity to work with some of the
game's best. So far, Looker has run plays with Super Bowl MVP Kurt
Warner and Drew Bledsoe, and in practice, he's being chased by one
of the league's top safeties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyer (Milloy) is a legend where I grew up (near Tacoma),''
Looker said. ``I went to high school about five minutes from where
he lived. I remember growing up hearing about Lawyer Milloy and, of
course, I watched him at the University of Washington. He is a
great athlete and a legend in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional star-gazing, Looker is aware there is
still business to take care of and he's committed to giving it his
best shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I have an opportunity,'' Looker said. ``Nothing is
guaranteed, we have some great receivers here, but I have the
opportunity to make the roster.''

 (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has been living through
extraordinary economic times for so long now that fresh milestones
sometimes pass with a yawn. With growth rates over 5 percent,
subdued inflation, low unemployment, high productivity and strong
corporate profits _ all with the expansion already a decade old _
it is hard to surprise people with good news.
</P>
<P>
   But here is another sweet nugget to chew on: The unusually large
gap between the performance of the U.S. economy of those of its
main peers, Europe and Japan, is proving more sustainable than many
economists expected. And the strong dollar that helped make it all
possible continues to defy gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Months after the sharp correction in the Nasdaq began last
April, the dollar has not only failed to plunge against the yen and
the euro as was once widely expected, but it has actually retouched
its record highs against the euro and held steady against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, stock market nervousness aside, foreigners have arguably
never had as much faith in the future of the U.S. economy as they
do today. The dollar's value is determined, in the simplest sense,
by the confidence that the world has in the United States. And
nothing that is happening here has persuaded foreigners that they
would do better to put their money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The old economic laws suggest that this cannot go on
indefinitely. In a sense, the United States has been living on
borrowed money, running the largest trade and current account
deficits in its history. That makes it more vulnerable to the whims
of foreign trading partners. Fortunately, they seem to be as
smitten by America's technology revolution as Americans are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not flinching,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist
at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ``In terms of the new
economy, Europe is still somewhat behind and Japan is seriously
behind, and they cannot afford not to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most popular script for a so-called hard landing of
the U.S. economy begins with a stock market correction, followed by
a plunge in the supercharged dollar, reflecting the world's lowered
hopes for growth and profits here.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States' major trading peers _ Europe, Japan,
Canada and Mexico _ stopped recycling the dollars they earn by
selling goods here into productive investments here, the dollar
would quickly lose its strength. That would make imports more
expensive, contribute to inflation, cause the Fed to raise interest
rates and further undermine the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has been sufficiently
concerned about such an outcome for the past year that he traveled
the globe urging the country's economic peers to prod their
economies to grow faster so that the world could ``balance up,''
not ``balance down.'' Europe has been growing only half as fast as
the United States, and Japan's economy is flat, worsening the
already severe U.S. trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Hard landing could still happen if the stock market takes
another dive. But the 30 percent correction in the Nasdaq was no
minor blip, and it only slightly unnerved dollar investors, who
have since sent the U.S. currency higher.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why is speculative. But the consensus is that foreign
investors view America's technology prowess as far more resilient
than a stock market bubble. And they are willing to keep investing
in what is essentially a seller's market _ the high dollar making
assets here very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   One way that shows up is through mergers and acquisitions of
American companies by foreigners, which have quickened this year
from the already extraordinary rate of 1998 and 1999. Through early
August, foreign companies had announced 1,202 deals to buy U.S.
companies, with the purchases valued at $266 billion. For all of
1999, there were 1,701 deals valued at $305 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If that enthusiasm continues, it is not inconceivable that the
record current account deficit could continue to expand without
jeopardizing the dollar and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rudi Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, says the United States, with its younger
population, has long had lower savings rates and higher investment
rates than Europe and Japan. That was true even when Japan seemed
to be years ahead in manufacturing efficiency. But it is still true
today, when both Japan and Europe lag far behind in technological
innovation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were worried about our deficit were wrong because
they underestimated the appeal of our new economy,'' Dornbusch
said. ``It's as though there's both an oil and a gold rush, and
it's all happening here.''

CORPORATE FUNDS FUEL REVELRY SURROUNDING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Delegates heading to the Democratic National
Convention may want to pack a set of bunny ears along with their
donkey ties, JFK pins, and Gore-Lieberman bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Loretta Sanchez of California, as is no secret,
has invited a select group to the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles
for a party Tuesday on behalf of a Hispanic political action
committee. Outrage at her choice of venue prompted Democratic
officials to cancel her speech at the convention, but Sanchez, who
says she is willing to relocate her party if she can, vows to
continue with an event that is just one example of the glut of
corporate-sponsored partying that is cranking into high gear well
before the four-day convention opens Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, the men's magazine, is paying part of the freight of
the Sanchez event, along with the brewer Anheuser-Busch and Latina
magazine. As many as 600 people are expected under a tent set up on
the 5-acre grounds, where Hugh Hefner reigns, pink flamingos roam,
and the pool is used _ on other occasions _ for R-rated frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a sold-out event and it's going to be a
success,'' said Sanchez spokeswoman Sarah Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Republicans last week in Philadelphia, the Democrats
are taking advantage of federal campaign laws to use corporate
donations not only for their party gathering at the downtown
Staples Center, but also the parties and galas from Long Beach to
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders will have an array of opportunities, with the
Massachusetts delegates, for example, enjoying breakfast Thursday
at the Beverly Hilton courtesy of US Representative Edward J.
Markey of Massachusetts _ and Qwest Communications, according to a
schedule provided by the state party. Qwest is a major
telecommunications provider; Markey is the top Democrat on the
House telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   VIPs from all states will be shuttled across Tinseltown in one
of 400 automobiles provided by General Motors, a donation of
services valued at $1 million. Republicans enjoyed the same free
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Top donors to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will
be treated to dinner at Spago, Wolfgang Puck's famed Beverly Hills
eatery. AT&AMP;T is picking up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   And the LA Host Committee 2000 will keep everything running
smoothly with the aid of $750,000 worth of computer software
donated by Microsoft Corp., which is currently fighting an
antitrust case against the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Microsoft giving because maybe they didn't give enough
early on, or GM trying to fight tougher fuel economy standards for
their SUVs?'' said Ellen Miller, head of Public Campaign, an
advocate of campaign finance overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Miller argues that the donations, made at both conventions, are
aimed at currying favor with influential lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of think of the convention fund-raising this year as
the kid's birthday party that gets more elaborate each year,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts, a campaign
finance overhaul advocate, was similarly dismayed. Meehan will
speak at the ``shadow'' convention, organized by opponents of this
year's major party affairs, about the influence of special interest
money on politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``National conventions used to be high-drama, high-stakes
affairs that determined presidential nominees and decided serious
public policy questions. They're now mainly opportunities for those
with issues pending before Congress to spend limitless sums of
money for access and influence,'' said Meehan, a delegate to the
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations and event organizers tread a fine line as they
explain the affairs. They say they are trying to balance high
costs, willing donors and a competitive business environment where
contributions by one interest group must be matched by another.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM is the largest company in the world and, frankly, we're
involved in almost every environmental and energy and safety issue
you can think of,'' said General Motors spokesman William Noack.
``We have relationships in both parties, and that's why we're
completely bipartisan. But we have to represent our interests, and
this gives us an opportunity for relationship building.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Miller, a Microsoft spokesman, said his company's giving
predated the antitrust case. He also noted that the case now rests
in the courts, not with the members of Congress attending the
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy event irked party officials not for its funding, but
because the venue clashed with their attempt to address morality
concerns in the general election campaign following President
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Wednesday, Sanchez defended the
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We selected a high-profile venue to highlight the important
work of Hispanic Unity USA,'' she said, reading from a statement
and refusing to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   She expressed willingness to relocate the party in an appearance
on the ``Today'' show Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, her spokeswoman, said Hispanic Unity USA is an
organization primarily interested in registering voters. ``In Los
Angeles, there are a lot of events held at the Playboy Mansion,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore voiced support for the party's effort to
dissociate itself from the Sanchez event and rejected the
comparison between using the Playboy mansion for a fund-raiser and
his own acceptance of campaign money from Playboy magazine
executives, including Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apples and oranges,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the giving are two factors: the increased cost of
conventions and a change in federal law that allows unlimited _ and
tax deductible _ corporate support.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention, like its Republican counterpart, is
expected to cost up to $50 million. The federal government provides
each party $13.5 million to stage its convention, and in
Philadelphia, the city and the state of Pennsylvania chipped in
another $7 million apiece. They also provided untold millions in
services, as are Los Angeles and the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   The arithmetic leaves a deficit, one that corporations have
stepped in to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, corporations were banned from giving to the
parties after discovery of a memo suggesting that ITT Corp. had
donated $400,000 to the 1972 Republican National Convention in hope
the Nixon administration would settle an antitrust case between the
company and the government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, however, federal regulators loosened the purse strings
by agreeing to let corporations make unlimited donations to
convention host committees. They are the bipartisan structures
convention cities establish to seek and then run the party
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   The government also agreed the donations can be tax deductible,
since they are a marketing expense. The gifts must be reported, but
not until 60 days after a convention concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, money flows not only from corporations to host
committees, but also to candidates, to each political party and
numerous causes and political action committees. In addition,
conventions are a way to thank past donors by providing them prime
accommodations and tickets to the best events.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has established a
caste system for his organization aimed at fielding support to
Democratic House candidates.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in The Washington Post, $5,000 donors are
members of the ``Chairman's Council,'' which entitles them to a
room at the Le Merigot Santa Monica Beach Hotel. Donors of $50,000
have membership in the ``Majority Council,'' giving them access to
two rooms at the Loews hotel in Santa Monica. Those who donated
$100,000 gain entry into ``Team 2000,'' as well as three rooms at
Loews and a dinner party with Kennedy and Representative Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventions have become one huge marketplace, and what's
being marketed is the access to people who write legislation,''
said Miller, the head of Public Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even Meehan, the congressman who has joined with Senator John S.
McCain of Arizona to fight for campaign finance overhaul,
acknowledged it would be hard to remain pure over the coming days.

GORE SHOULD `SPEAK OUT' ON LEWINSKY SCANDAL, BUSH SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Confronting an issue he rarely speaks to
directly, George W. Bush challenged his Democratic rival Friday to
condemn President Clinton for his past behavior, saying Vice
President Al Gore ``ought to speak out'' on the impeachment scandal
if he is truly bothered by it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has long pledged not to make personal attacks but
makes veiled references to Clinton in every speech, said Gore could
yet restore the moral dignity of the White House. But he called on
the Vice President to distance himself from Clinton, and in doing
so revealed eagerness to bind Gore to the personal behavior of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're part of the administration, or you're not part
of the administration,'' Bush said. ``If he's got a problem with
what went on in the past, he ought to explain what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has shown his dismay and disgust at the Monica S. Lewinsky
scandal to some extent, both by distancing himself from the
president and in selecting as his running mate the first Democratic
senator to condemn Clinton in public. At the same time, Bush
generally declines to discuss the scandal explicitly, preferring
instead to describe his own moral values.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks Friday came in response to a long mea culpa Clinton
delivered the day before, in which he described his spiritual state
to a church audience in Illinois and urged voters not to hold his
moral failings against Gore. Bush, in his reaction, underscored a
dilemma for his campaign: How to link Gore to the scandal, and yet
to appear above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling back on his campaign plane as it idled on a runway in
Sacramento, Bush was immediately peppered with questions from
reporters about Clinton's remarks. By his side was Senator John S.
McCain, the Arizona Republican and former campaign foe, who was
traveling with the candidate for a second day. In a 10-minute
conversation before the plane took off for Portland, the two men
admitted they had not seen Clinton's remarks, but offered their
views anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Bush addressed more than 1,000 supporters in a
partially-filled gymnasium at the University of Portland, a
Catholic school in a heavily Democratic area. The appearance in
this relatively liberal state _ which has rejected the Republican
presidential candidate in every election since 1984 _ was part of a
three-day tour through Democrat-leaning states, an effort which
Bush hopes will demonstrate his commitment to reclaiming moderate
sections of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each (state visited) has a Republican senator, and we feel
those are states Governor Bush has an opportunity to carry,'' Bush
communications director Karen Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, after attending his sole public event of the day,
Bush was scheduled to attend his second fund-raiser in two days,
raising approximately $300,000 in regulated, so-called ``hard
money'' for the Washington State Republican Party. Bush said a day
earlier he would not expect McCain to attend unregulated
``soft-money'' fundraisers, given the Arizona senator's commitment
to overhauling the way campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Bush is planning to visit McCain's Arizona ranch, part
of an ongoing reconciliation that has at times seemed more symbolic
than genuine. Aides to both men have said there was far less
palpable tension than there had been three months earlier, when
McCain first agreed to endorse his former rival and campaign
alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   And as the two men stood together Friday, they seemed somewhat
more at ease. Although Bush dominated the discussion, McCain was
clearly eager to back the Texas governor up whenever he could.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his use of the Lewinsky scandal as an issue in the
campaign, Bush said he would speak to it only in response to
comments from disillusioned voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I do is make a pledge,'' Bush said. ``I don't think
President Clinton is an issue as we go forward. I'm just going to
remind people of what they expect from their leaders...And I'm
going to keep saying it.'' At the end of every stump speech, Bush
delivers the same vow, saying that when he takes his oath of office
he will promise to ``uphold the dignity and honor of the office to
which I have been elected, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bush has said the vow is not intended as a reference
to Clinton. But Friday, he conceded it was part of a strategy to
draw a contrast between himself and the president. He also insisted
it was not a cornerstone of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing I say in a litany of things I'm going to do,''
Bush said. ``I repeat to you what happens a lot: People show me a
picture and they say, `Don't let me down.' They are saying that for
a reason. They have felt let down.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also sought to put the remarks in the context of Bush's
overall platform, saying the campaign is largely about issues.
``The other stuff is of secondary importance,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning separately in Michigan, Bush's running mate, Dick
Cheney, did not issue the same mandate to Gore. ``Responsible for
Clinton's personal mistakes? No, I don't think so,'' Cheney said in
an interview with the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore limited his remarks to gratitude for Clinton's support.
``I appreciate what the president said. He's said it before,'' the
vice president said on Fox News. ``I think that he also went on to
say that this election, as all elections, is about the future and
not the past and I very much agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is planning to lie low for most of next week as attention
focuses on the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. Friday, he
said he will get some ``good rest'' at his ranch in Crawford, Texas
_ blissfully ignoring his opponent's formal nomination. ``I don't
have cable. I'm sorry,'' he said, laughing. ``I'm a fiscal
conservative.''

 &HT;    Opportunities abound for all Texas hunters
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas has permits. Texas has draw hunts. And
Texas has open areas, all for public hunters who might not have
their own place leased every fall.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Commission has
done in recent years is expand the public hunting program, through
extra opportunity on state land and through cooperative efforts
with private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for the successes on private land was in the
public dove hunting program. The department provided the initial
seed money to lease land near urban areas for hunting, and since
that time hunters have paid the way through purchases of the annual
$40 public hunting permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 130 units in 48,000 acres this year, and 23 units will
offer species other than doves, such as squirrel, rabbits,
pheasants and quail,'' said Herb Kothmann, public hunting
coordinator for Texas Parks and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The department also has released its 2000-2001 Public Hunting
Lands booklet, which includes applications for drawings on state
parks and wildlife management areas. In addition, hunters can pick
up information about the special drawings that include the Texas
Grand Slam and the Texas Whitetail Bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Special permit hunts cover everything from alligators to
white-tailed deer. The annual booklet explains how to apply, who
may apply and also gives dates and times for the various hunts. The
number of entrants and successful hunters from the previous year
are included so that hunters can assess their chances for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applications are already coming in,'' Kothmann said.
``Unfortunately, we continue to have people who apply for more than
one hunt in their draw category. They disqualify themselves and
everybody on their cards when they do that. They need to read the
instructions carefully on how to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be more than 6,000 openings on state parks and
wildlife management areas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the department has had tremendous success with the Big
Time Texas Hunts. That program started with the Texas Grand Slam,
all expenses-paid trophy hunting trips for whitetail and mule deer,
proghorn and desert bighorn sheep. There will be one winner this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The department then added the Texas Exotic Safari, which is
based on the department's Mason Mountain Wildlife Management Area.
That hunt is for two exotics from among waterbuck, gemsbok, oryx,
kudu, able and impala. Taxidermy, food and lodging and guides are
included. Two winners will be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Other hunts added last year featured the Texas Whitetail
Bonanza, trophy deer hunts of three to five days on some of Texas'
top hunting ranches. Twenty hunters will be selected from among the
entrants for the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Waterfowl Adventure will allow a winner and three
guests to travel around the state for a series of hunts for geese
and ducks, including mallards in East Texas and geese in the
Panhandle. Each trip includes guides, food and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the Texas Big Time Bird hunt. One winner gets
four hunts for quail, pheasant, doves and spring turkeys. Three
guests will be included on the two-day quail hunt, pheasant hunt
and two afternoons of dove hunting. One guest is allowed on the
two-day turkey hunt. Food, lodging and guides are included.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals may buy $10 entries for a chance to win any of the
Big Time Texas Hunts. You can enter all or just one and buy as many
tickets as you wish.
</P>
<P>

or (512) 389-4505 for information or to request an application
booklet.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Dickens did not have Detroit in mind when he wrote, ``It
was the best of times, it was the worst of times.'' But it sums up
the situation for the nation's auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. economy strong and unemployment at near-record
lows, automakers are selling all manner of four-wheeled vehicles at
a record pace. Profits are good. The companies are flush with cash.
Labor disputes look remote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wall Street has looked at these fundamentals and effectively
scoffed, ``Big deal.'' Auto stocks, which peaked during the spring,
are down, in some cases substantially. The stock market, analysts
say, is expecting a slide in demand _ though it may be many months
away and may not come at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that sales have never been better,'' said
Stephen Girsky, an auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``The bad news is that with slowing employment, rising
interest rates and rising gasoline prices, sales are going to fall.
And the pricing environment is just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of around 17 million
vehicles, sales remain at record levels. But they were higher six
months ago, and inventories are rising. All these factors have
combined to send the stocks skidding.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which was trading in the low $90's in May,
closed on Friday at $63.25. DaimlerChrysler, which peaked at just
over $68 in early April, is now at $56.375. Ford Motor, which most
analysts see as the best stock of the lot, has taken only a modest
hit. Its shares, which peaked at just over $31 in mid-April, are
now at $29.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rising interest rate environment and a moderating vehicle
sales environment, these stocks tend to perform poorly,'' said
Nicholas Lobaccaro, who follows auto companies for Lehman Brothers.
``And you are looking at much heavier supply of the most profitable
vehicles and major inroads by foreign manufacturers in trucks and
sport utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the long-term worry is that worldwide supply of vehicles
is far outstripping demand. That is great news for consumers,
because it suggests that prices will probably remain under
pressure. But it is not positive for corporate profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate there are 40 excess assembly plants around the
world, which probably means the industry has 100,000 extra
employees,'' said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   And more supply is coming. Japanese manufacturers, seeking
bigger market share, are committed to bolstering production of
light trucks and SUVs in the North American market, Casesa said.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in light-truck capacity, which some analysts
estimated at 15 percent, would almost certainly threaten profits in
the product line that has been Detroit's biggest money-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, say the worst may be past for the
stocks. They contend that that interest rates may have peaked, that
the economy is slowing but is not likely to stall, and that
gasoline prices are off their highs. And auto stocks are trading
much lower than they were three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   David Bradley, an auto industry analyst at J.P. Morgan
Securities, turned negative on the stocks in mid-May, when the
economy was growing rapidly and the Federal Reserve seemed intent
on raising interest rates for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   He has not changed his view entirely since then, but he says he
is feeling a bit better. ``I have gone from being quite bearish to
a slightly more positive posture,'' he said. ``We are advocating
putting a toe in the water where we see opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the economic outlook still muddled, few analysts are
sanguine about what will happen on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stocks will be choppy for the rest of the year,
but I think they are undervalued,'' said Wendy Beale Needham of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. She is recommending Ford and G.M. for
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most analysts say Ford seems the best investment. ``We
have been very cautious on DaimlerChrysler and General Motors, but
think Ford can create shareholder value, mainly because of their
product pipeline,'' said Lobaccaro at Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also likes Ford, but as a short-term play. This month,
Ford shareholders approved a proposal to distribute a special $10
billion dividend. Ford, which has already distributed $5.7 billion
to investors, could pay for the balance by buying back its stock,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the stock has popped in the last week or so, Ford
clearly has short-term potential,'' he said. ``I think the buyback
is worth another 5 percent on the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said investors with longer time horizons might consider
GM _ not because of its prospects in the motor vehicles sector, but
because it still owns 30 percent of Hughes Electronics. Chances are
that the company will spin out that remaining portion or split it
off in the second half of 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another spin of Hughes could be worth $20 a share on General
Motors stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, analysts are less than positive about
DaimlerChrysler, which they say has yet to realize the potential of
its megamerger nearly two years ago. ``Clearly, the merger hasn't
gone as well as Daimler would like,'' Girsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Lobaccaro added: ``If you look at the current earnings growth
rate of DaimlerChrysler, it is hard to reconcile how low it is, if
all the synergies they claimed would be realized were actually
hitting the bottom line. From a near-term and medium-term
perspective, the merger has been a disappointment.''

WELCOME TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
  It's not `Survivor' island,  
but it still takes some skill 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles is a vast metropolis whose many sights and wonders
simply cannot be seen in a mere five summer days without the
benefit of a little planning and a good respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in the media saturation and the vast number of parties,
protests and speeches going on during the Democratic National
Convention and delegates will be hard-pressed to come away from
their stay feeling like they really experienced L.A.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we'd like to offer our Ultimate Delegates Guide To
Los Angeles, an ``ideal'' scenario on how to enjoy your stay in the
nation's smoggiest _ check that _ make that second smoggiest city.
See, everything looks brighter already.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to imitate this itinerary, although, as our lawyers
urged us to point out, we're not responsible for anyone who
actually runs into O.J. Simpson in their travels.
</P>
<P>
   TODAY
</P>
<P>
   _3 p.m. Check into Westin Bonaventure. As you ride the glass
elevator with four reporters, be prepared to answer the same three
questions:
</P>
<P>
   1) Can Gore win?
</P>
<P>
   2) Any idea where the really good strip clubs are?
</P>
<P>
   3) Who will be the last castaway remaining on ``Surivivor''?
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to work up you're best ``no comment'' or
launch into an answer so longwinded the reporters will go pester
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   _3:45 p.m. As you emerge from hotel lobby onto downtown streets
be ready to dodge protesters rallying against the Gap and Banana
Republic and their alleged sweatshop practices. Make sure to untuck
your charcoal pique polo shirt so as to cover the Banana Republic
label on your Smithfield chinos.
</P>
<P>
   _5:30 p.m. Go to Shutters for wine tasting held by Napa County
congressman Mike Thompson. A little advice: Immediately hit the bar
in order to beat Ted Kennedy to the punch (so to speak).
</P>
<P>
   _ 8 p.m. Head to the People For the American Way dinner at
Beverly Hilton to chow down, but be prepared to duck if a fight
breaks out between Vice presidential pick and self-proclaimed
``culture warrior'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman and liberal producer and
free-speech advocate Norman Lear after Lieberman keeps harping on
how terrible ``Maude'' was. Luckily, Carol O'Connor will be there
to tell both of them to ``stifle it.''
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY
</P>
<P>
   _ 9 a.m. While breakfasting in the hotel restaurant beware of
reporters and Internet geeks who attempt to extrapolate your
preference for decaffeinated coffee into a treatise about how the
Democratic party is not as energetic and fun-loving as it once was.
With any luck Carol O'Connor will be there to tell the pests to
``stifle it.''
</P>
<P>
   _Noon: Go to California Gov. Gray Davis's luncheon at Union
Station but don't get on any trains or subways. You could end up at
Universal's CityWalk or even Santa Clarita for the rest of the day
_ or even the rest of your stay in town. _6 p.m. Ignore the boring
convention speeches by going to a reception hosted by Recording
Industry Association of America honoring Maryland congressman
Stenny Hoyer and his efforts to shut down Napster and keep music
``outrageously overpriced.''
</P>
<P>
   _10 p.m. _ At the ``Soul Train'' party at Paramount Studios be
prepared to call it a night after Sen. Barbara Boxer makes like
``Seinfeld's'' Elaine when ``Love Rollercoaster'' comes on.
</P>
<P>
   _11 p.m. _ As you return to hotel to watch a taped broadcast of
Clintons speaking on ``prosperity and progress'' be sure to gaze
out window at National Homeless Convention at Dome Village.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   _10 a.m. to 2 p.m. _ It's time to enjoy something of the city's
diverse culture. For a mere $500, take an organized bus trip to the
Hsi Lai Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights. Be content in your
newfound faith and knowing _ as an accompanying brochure notes _
that ``this is NOT a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   _5 p.m _. Enjoy yourself at happy hour with Irish delegates at
Jonathan Club. Carrol O'Connor is the designated driver.
</P>
<P>
   _8 p.m. _ Next up is Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez's planned
party for the Hispanic Coalition at the Playboy Mansion. But
beaware that the event, which has already run into image problems,
could run into more. There are rumors that George !ita!P. _ Bush
(the ``Ricky Martin of the GOP'' and nephew to George !ital!W _ and
grandson of George !ital!H. _) might crash the soiree and start
monopolizing the babes.
</P>
<P>
   _9:30 p.m. _ Then it's time to skip over to the Universal
Amphitheatre for the Hispanic Talent Showcase at Universal
Amphitheatre. This is as good as time as any to find yourself stuck
behind a slow-speed police chase on the Hollywood Freeway. Just sit
back an marvel at how all those TV copters manage not to smash into
each other. By the time you arrive, though, the concert's over so
you decide to return to Hef's and the event that's being delicately
described as the ``Gorgy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Midnight: _ About this time the president and Senator Kennedy
show up (even if the party gets canceled, they'll show up), and you
decide that maybe a good night sleep would be better than getting
caught up in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Than again maybe
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   _9 a.m. _ Begin your day at the House of Blues where United Auto
Workers host party honoring Michigan congressman John Dingell.
Anyone driving an American-made car to the event gets a dollar off
the valet parking!
</P>
<P>
   _11 a.m. _ Then pop down to Disneyland and get lost in
Fantasyland, which, afterall, isn't much different than a political
convention.
</P>
<P>
   _6 p.m. _ As Karenna Gore Schiff and Joe ``Let's Put `Friends'
In Movie Theaters'' Lieberman make nominating speeches for Gore,
duck out early to watch ``Survivor'' in your hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   _8 a.m. _ Waking up hung over and still bitter that right-winger
Rudy remains alive on ``Survivor,'' take your frustrations out by
heckling protesters on the street.
</P>
<P>
   _10 a.m. _ With Clinton, Kennedy, Hef and George P. Bush on the
loose, you realize you haven't found a date to Barbra Streisand's
concert tonight. Left with the unhappy prospect of actually having
to, gulp, actually go to the convention for the afternoon, you opt
instead to go back to your room and take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   _5 p.m. _ Refreshed, you give it one last try at Young
Democrats' happy hour at McCormick &AMP; Schmick's and get lucky. Now
you hope all those contributions (we mean donations, we mean ...
oh, whatever) _ and newfound Buddhist faith _ will put you on the
guest list for Babs' post-convention show at the Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   _6:30 p.m. _ As the vice president rambles on about ``Al Gore's
Vision For the Future,'' point out the pretty balloons overhead to
your date and remind her that Barbra will be on soon.
</P>
<P>
   _8 p.m. _ As you arrive at the Shrine you may think it's a a bit
gauche for the doorman to be holding out a bag asking for your
jewelry, but remember, you can always buy another Rolex and won't
be able to hear Streisand again until her !ital!next _ farewell
tour.
</P>
<P>
   _10 p.m. _ Babs caps the evening with ``Happy Days Are Here
Again.'' (You wonder if ``Send in the Clowns'' wouldn't have been
better?) Walking out, you wipe away a tear as your five day stay in
L.A. comes to an end. Then, of course, you can't get a cab. So you
walk back to your hotel. As L.A.'s finest round up the last
protesters, you find yourself humming ``The Way You Were.'' The
convention has already become misty, water-colored memories for
you.

VERIZON'S MANAGERS SLOG THROUGH 12-HOUR DAYS _ AND WIRES _ TO COPE
WITH STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leslie Macpherson fumbled with her tool belt as she
walked into the room crammed with wires. She had never seen so many
in her life. Blue ones, white ones. Wires as thin as toothpicks,
wires as thick as thumbs. Thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   In her management job with Verizon Communications, the country's
largest local telephone company, Macpherson kept track of utilities
regulations imposed by state agencies. She wore a suit and sat at a
desk. She met with government officials. She wrote reports. She did
not carry around pliers or orange telephone handsets.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Verizon's unionized employees began their
strike on Sunday. Macpherson is now temporarily a technician, and a
technician must know her wires. In this Verizon office in midtown
Manhattan, the wires are housed in metal frames the size of small
sailboats. After several days on the job, Macpherson now knows how
to lay a wire to help set up a dial tone for a new customer. A dial
tone. The fundamental product created and sold by Verizon and its
260,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's fed from the switch,'' she said, waving toward
a bundle of wires. ``I think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are cables,'' she said, pointing to a thick gray sheath.
``They go underground to the cosmic frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmic frame?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me about the cosmic frame,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Macpherson is one of about 30,000 managers who have been filling
in for more than 86,000 unionized workers at Verizon offices from
Maine to Virginia, pinch-hitting on union jobs that range from
answering 411 calls to fixing aerial cables.
</P>
<P>
   And after several days of the work, many of them said that while
they were not siding with the unions, they had a new appreciation
for the work of its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of respect for the people who do it,
having done it myself,'' said Diana Barnes, who was transferred
from the department that places advertising for Verizon to work as
a directory assistance operator. ``So some good comes out of bad,
if management appreciates the workers more.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Macpherson and Barnes were sent from Verizon's New York
headquarters to work at the company's largest directory assistance
center in the city, on 38th Street between Second and Third Avenues
in Manhattan. An informal, school's-out atmosphere had descended on
the place. Offices usually bustling with a dozen people were
staffed by one or two managers. Fill-in workers sauntered in
wearing jeans and sneakers. Supervisors who usually sat at desks
ran around the hallways with tools, doing double duty as bosses and
the bossed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, union workers, represented by the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, have been less than thrilled with managers filling their
jobs. The police have received reports of egg throwing and
vandalism. On a recent afternoon, several people in a picket line
outside the 38th Street building yelled at a woman walking in
through the front doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, don't go in there,'' shouted Arthur Treisman, a telephone
operator waving a union placard. ``Don't go in there! Scab!''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Garrido, a technician picketing along side Treisman, said
he felt insulted that managers were working union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think none of them are qualified to do what we do,'' Garrido
said. ``Most of them were educated in college, but they're not
technically inclined.''
</P>
<P>
   While union shifts are usually eight hours, most managers have
been working 12-hour days to compensate for being short staffed.
After 13 days, if the strike lasts that long, they are to get a
one-day break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, the work out of this office is tremendous, and
we do the best we can with what we have,'' said Deborah Torruellas,
who supervised Macpherson and other frame technicians. ``Over the
long term, one would see a negative change, because the people here
are working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and it just won't
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Torruellas has been with the company for 22 years, working her
way up through half a dozen departments to become a manager. When
her department's 38 frame technicians went on strike, she was
forced to train eight managers from other parts of the company to
do the jobs of the striking frame technicians. The recruits had to
learn in hours what it sometimes took months to master, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has also meant that Torruellas had to strap on a tool
belt and work on the frames herself, something she had not done
regularly for a decade. ``At least I'm off my desk and on the
floor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the jobs that needed filling were operator positions.
Three floors above Torruellas, about 30 people sat in gray cubicles
wearing headsets. The calls for directory assistance came in one
after another, an endless stream of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro was trying to type the word Coronet into his
computer. A caller wanted the number of the movie theater by that
name. Shapiro tapped out the letters slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spell it for me,'' he told his caller. ``I'm a manager here. I
don't have typing skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro usually manages computer programmers in the White
Plains, N.Y., office who are developing Verizon's e-commerce
systems. In his operator's cubicle he sat for 12 hours with only
three breaks _ 30 minutes for lunch and two 15-minute periods. He
had taken his shoes off. On his desk sat an apple, a cookie and a
bottle of water.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who also worked as an operator during the last strike,
which lasted for two days in August 1998, has been averaging 900
calls per 12-hour shift. (A trained directory assistance operator
takes more than 1,000 calls in an eight-hour shift.) During a
recent five-minute period, callers asked Shapiro for the numbers of
a pizzeria, a doughnut shop, a pharmacy, United Pacel Service and a
jeweler in Manhattan named Gumuchjian Fils.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really gives you an appreciation of the work that the union
folks do,''he said. ``It's invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   Three floors below, Macpherson pulled out her pliers and stared
at the wires snaking over the metal girders. So many wires. During
the last strike, at least, she had been able to hit the road for
two days as a delivery driver. But it could be worse, she said,
shaking her head as she thought about the managers who had to work
as operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK with this,'' she said. ``I'm not complaining.''

PUTING BLASTS GENERALS OVER NUCLEAR ARSENAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir V. Putin Friday sharply criticized
Russia's military brass, whose top generals are locked in a public
feud over whether to cut the country's nuclear arsenal to beef up
its deteriorating conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   In comments at the beginning of a Kremlin meeting with security
advisers, called to discuss warnings that Moscow's once-formidable
military machine is rusting away, Putin avoided taking sides in the
disagreement over nuclear and conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   But he said bluntly that the military was not working
efficiently, and was badly in need of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are our armed forces, our whole military component, effective?
Unfortunately, they are not,'' he said. ``The well-being of our
citizens as well as the state's security depends on the right
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current structure of the armed forces is hardly optimal.
How can it be considered optimal if training is not conducted in
many units, pilots rarely fly and sailors rarely go to sea?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Ivanov, secretary of Putin's advisory Security Council,
said decisions were made during the meeting to increase military
spending and improve combat readiness. He didn't elaborate. But
analysts said the conferees glossed over a much deeper problem for
Russia's armed forces: Moscow is trying to maintain a military that
it simply can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last decade the Russian military has been trying to
keep parity with the United States. This is mission impossible,''
said Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the numbers explains why. The Russian defense budget
for this year is $4.5 billion. By way of comparison, President
Clinton on Wednesday signed a $287.5 billion defense spending bill
for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, some $30 billion bigger than
Russia's entire gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 1.2 million-member armed forces are broke and low on
modern equipment and morale.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month Russia's top two defense officials, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Anatoly
Kvashnin, have been feuding over whether the country's scarce funds
should be spent on nuclear weapons or conventional arms.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin wants to cut nuclear weapons and develop conventional
arms. According to defense experts, about 70 percent of Russia's
weapons procurement funds go to its nuclear arsenal. He also seeks
to downgrade Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces _ a separate branch
of the military that controls the country's land-based nuclear
weapons _ and place it under the control of the air force.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev, a veteran of the Strategic Rocket Forces, said such a
move would constitute ``a crime against Russia and simple
madness.''
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the armed forces appeared to remain intact
after the four-hour meeting, despite speculation that the session
might result in major reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Pikayev, a military analyst at the Carnegie Center for
International Peace in Moscow said Friday's meeting was the start
of a ``long, controversial process'' in which Putin will need to
decide whether Russia will remain a major nuclear power.''

IN NEW BOOK, SOROS TAKES BACK HIS GRAVE FORECASTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   George Soros, one of the world's most successful speculators and
richest men, has come as close as anyone to personifying the spread
of global capitalism and the power of international financial
markets. So, in 1998, when he wrote a book predicting the imminent
``disintegration of the global capitalist system,'' his views
caused quite a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the global economy is still kicking, and, in a
new book, Soros, who turns 70 years old Saturday, is taking back
his grave forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I got carried away in thinking that the system
might actually collapse,'' he said, in an interview. ``I goofed.''
</P>
<P>
   His reversal is a highly unusual public about-face. Most
incorrect prognosticators simply let their mistakes drift quietly
through remainder piles and into the dustbin of history. But his
turnabout is also a barometer of how fast the world has changed. In
an unlikely coda to his career, Soros was one of the few prominent
voices since the Cold War to question the longevity of global
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The shift by Soros also reflects the dangerously fickle nature
of contemporary international financial markets, one of his
favorite themes. In the fall of 1998, he was far from alone in
worrying that the global economy might plunge into a depression.
But just a few months after his book went to press that possibility
already seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Open Society: From Global Capitalism to
Global Democracy'' (PublicAffairs Press), Soros explains that he
was wrong to worry that international capitalism might soon destroy
itself. But he stands by his admonition that unchecked capitalism
threatens freedom and democracy around the world. And he is
sticking with the delicate philosophical distinction that enables
him in good conscience to continue exploiting the same financial
markets he vilifies.
</P>
<P>
   Soros intended his previous book as the summation of his
lifetime of experience as a World War II refugee, global investor
and philanthropist. But in August 1998, his work on the book was
interrupted by a looming financial crisis in Russia, where he was
active as both an investor and a philanthropist. After Russia
defaulted on its debts, sending convulsions through financial
markets from London to Sao Paulo, Brazil, the growing crisis
convinced Soros that his conclusions were too timely to hold back.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to rush the book to press. His intended publisher,
Random House, declined to accelerate the timetable, so he decamped
to PublicAffairs Press, whose founder Peter Osnos was happy to
oblige. Entitled ``The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society
Endangered,'' the book was published in November, just weeks after
the manuscript was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Soros might have saved himself some embarrassment if he had
waited for Random House, giving the markets time to recover. ``I
have some egg on my face,'' Soros admits in a preface to his new
book. He decided to write another volume after he set out this year
to revise the first for a paperback and realized his thinking had
changed drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Soros writes that his dire predictions rested on two errors.
First, he underestimated the ability of key officials in New York
and Washington to intervene at the last second when trouble in
far-off markets threatened prosperity and stability at home. When
investors' skittishness threatened a global credit crisis, the U.S.
financial regulators quickly lowered interest rates and
orchestrated a pivotal bailout of the mammoth Long-Term Capital
Management fund in time to head off a panic. ``We almost had a
collapse,'' Soros said, ``but life is lived on the edge of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros writes that his second error was underestimating the
impact of new technology. ``There was an Internet boom concurrent
to the bust in emerging markets,'' Soros writes in his new preface.
``How could I ignore that?'' The advent of new technologies
bolstered productivity growth in the United States, helping to
withstand a slowdown abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Soros fund management company stumbled in technology, too.
Soros Fund Management first bet against the boom in high-tech
stocks and then was surprised again by their collapse this spring.
The funds suffered losses of about 20 percent. Soros announced that
he was shifting his funds' focus toward safer, less lucrative
investments to support his philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Soros stepped away from day-to-day management of his fund
company in 1989 to focus on his philanthropy. ``What has happened
there has happened to someone else and not to me,'' he said. ``The
fact that I had a bearish bias in 1998 maybe prevented us from
participating in the upside, but, really, it is unrelated.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros notes that his funds still delivered investors a return of
more than 30 percent a year since 1969, including the recent
losses. ``I make mistakes, but when you add it all up, I come out
ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soros said that an enthusiasm for exposing errors in his own
thinking had been the key to his success as a financier, as he
explains in both books. It is not as easy to recant in public, he
acknowledged, but he sees the new book as ``my life's work, in a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros said his motivation was similar to that of any author: He
wanted to leave his mind's mark on posterity. This book, he said,
``means more to me than the billions that I have made.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of both books is the idea of an open society, a term
popularized by the philosopher Karl Popper, who was the
undergraduate tutor of Soros &UR; ' &LR; . He has been refining his ideas
about it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Soros argues for shunning absolute truths, including what he
calls ``market fundamentalism'' _ an absolute belief in the values
of the free marketplace. He recommends strong multilateral
regulation of international finance to protect other social values,
like equality and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The public criticism of his work has been trying at times, he
said, especially the skeptical reception of the distinction he
draws between ``making the rules'' and ``playing by the rules.'' He
argues in both books that policy makers should worry about morality
and the social good, but not fund managers, because markets are
inherently amoral. ``That is why you can't leave everything to
markets,'' he said. It is also why his fund management company
continues trying to seize opportunities to profit off other market
participants whenever it can _ after all, somebody else would.
</P>
<P>
   His distinction between making the rules and playing by them
``is not flying,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who regard markets as immoral, who say, `He
made a fortune in the stock market, he has a bad conscience, so he
is trying to excuse himself.' But if we could get that idea across,
it would actually make a better world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Along the way, the tour guide
pointed out some of the more benign landmarks in this city of Old
World charm and fairly recent terror. To the right was the ancient
Crown Liquor Saloon; farther on, the gargantuan City Hall. And
there, listing a bit, the Albert Clocktower.
</P>
<P>
   Then Norman Reilly aimed his puttering black taxi west toward
the central destinations of his unusual tour: The Shankill Road and
Falls Road neighborhoods that were the center of the sectarian
violence that held this city hostage for the last 30 years. The
bloodshed has largely subsided, but a whiff of ``the troubles''
remains _ and tourists excitedly breathe it in. Especially the
murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them options, and most times they want to see the
murals,'' said Reilly, a driver for a popular tourism operation
called Black Taxi Tours.
</P>
<P>
   As peace becomes something more than a breath-holding pause
here, the demand for city tours is surging, thanks in part to an
explosion of provocative murals in the Protestant neighborhood
called Shankill Estate and, to a lesser extent, in the Catholic
community along the Falls Road.
</P>
<P>
   A muse for some of this artistic revival is Johnny Adair, a
Protestant guerrilla also known as ``Mad Dog,'' who was among the
dozens of former paramilitaries released from jail in recent months
under the terms of the 1998 peace agreement and who now presents
himself as the guardian of Shankill spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might even see Johnny,'' Reilly said as the buildings of
Belfast blurred past his window.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland is gradually adjusting to a peace agreement
that struggled to establish a new government and has helped to
perpetuate cease-fires declared by gunmen on both sides of the
province's divide: The mostly Catholic Republicans, who want Ulster
united with the rest of Ireland, and the mostly Protestant
loyalists, who want it to remain part of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the story of the peace effort is unfolding on the walls
of Belfast. The sides of the city's buildings have long served as
canvases for those wanting to honor the dead or threaten the
living. And for several years, tour guides have been carrying
visitors to see the curbs and street lamps painted in the colors of
division: The Union Jack colors of red, white and blue for the
Protestant neighborhoods, the Irish colors of green, white and gold
for the Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But now the artwork seems particularly intended to draw the
gapes of tourists as much as to stir the emotions of residents.
``They're painted on the walls now for others to see as well,''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the number of visitors to the city gradually increasing
to 1.6 million last year, the demand for tours has gone up, said
Michael Johnston, 27, who started Black Taxi Tours five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of years it was on and off because of the
troubles and the bomb attacks,'' he said. ``At the time, I was the
only one. But because there's a cease-fire on both sides, there's a
bunch of black taxi crews jumping on the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest makes sense, said Orla Farren, a spokeswoman for
the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. ``The political graffiti is a
very symbolic reminder of what's been going on in recent history.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reilly turned his taxi into Shankill Estate, its curbstones and
street lamps freshly painted, the light blue flags of the Ulster
Freedom Fighters _ the outlawed loyalist group for which Adair once
served as a commando _ fluttering from every pole and post.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a terrorist group, a paramilitary group,'' Reilly said
matter-of-factly. ``It's a way of letting people know it's a UFF
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more eye-catching were the new murals. One glorified the
Ulster Freedom Fighters by depicting three masked gunmen. Another
honored Billy Wright, a loyalist commando killed by the Irish
Republican Army in prison in 1997. A third showed a gun-toting Grim
Reaper, standing over the marked graves of three IRA members still
living.
</P>
<P>
   One bore the name of Sean Kelly, another guerrilla recently
released from prison, who bombed a fish shop on the Shankill Road
in 1993 with the intention of killing Adair and other loyalist
leaders. It killed nine civilians instead, including a friend of
Reilly's.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, 29, is a Protestant from Shankill. Like many who grew up
in the strongest Protestant or Catholic areas of Ulster's cities,
he can remember hearing the cry ``Riot!'' ring through the Shankill
streets, and sprinting to watch the brawls between Protestants and
Catholics. But he said he never did anything more than a bit of
rock-throwing, avoiding the paramilitary groups whose ranks swelled
with his peers.
</P>
<P>
   After years of doing ``this and that,'' Reilly said, he became a
taxi driver who found that his close-up experiences had a value in
the marketplace. He eventually joined Black Taxi Tours, whose
owner, Johnston, said he has purposely employed five Protestant and
five Catholic drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get along together,'' he said. ``And none of us have a
political criminal record.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Reilly pointed to a short man with biceps the size of
ham hocks and a shaved head that glistened in the late-afternoon
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   Adair, 36, was most recently in the public eye when he, his dog,
Rebel, and dozens of associates all showed up in Ulster Freedom
Fighters T-shirts last month in Portadown, the town 30 miles from
Belfast that has become the site of an annual showdown over the
government's refusal to allow Protestants to hold their traditional
march through a Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The government is now investigating whether Adair provoked any
of this year's mayhem, which lasted several days.
</P>
<P>
   Adair rattled some keys and said he had no time to chat, then
chatted anyway, explaining that several groups, including the
Ulster Freedom Fighters, were working to brighten up the
working-class neighborhood in a way that would ``identify our
Britishness and identify who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen murals are planned for a formal unveiling on Aug. 19,
he said. The festivities will include a huge bonfire, which
explained why there were stacks of wood on the estate's grassy
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a fun day for kids,'' he said. ``And there's a beer
tent.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the Grim Reaper mural conveyed a threat _ ``It
says it all; comin' to get you'' _ but added that he had just
supported the removal of another, more offensive mural along the
Shankill Road. He also pointed out that there was graffiti in
Catholic neighborhoods that threatened his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words will never
harm me,'' he said. ``It's the bullets I'm worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   He has survived several assassination attempts and is always on
guard _ not just against his traditional enemies in the IRA, but
fellow Protestant paramilitaries, too. Adair displayed a bullet
scar on his back and one on his skull, the latter inflicted by a
bullet fired at him in a Belfast park last year, shortly after his
release from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just there,'' he said, rubbing the area with his finger.
``Point-blank range.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who said he takes tourists along this route about four
times a day, drove out of the Shankill Estate and into the
working-class Catholic neighborhood called Falls Road. One mural
depicted a British soldier under the Gaelic phrase for ``Safe
Home''; another showed a dove carrying a British soldier away,
along with the caption, ``Time for Peace, Time to Go.''
</P>
<P>
   As he drove up the Falls Road, Reilly pointed out the black
flags hanging from lampposts to honor Bobby Sands, an IRA bomber
who died in 1981 after holding a hunger strike in the Maze prison.
He then pulled into Milltown Cemetery, where, in 1988, a Protestant
guerrilla named Michael Stone attacked an IRA funeral, killing
three mourners. Stone was freed last month as part of the
prisoner-release program, but his attack _ filmed by television
cameras _ remains a singular moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that people cannot forget on both sides,''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther on, he pointed out a fresh mural commemorating
17 people killed by plastic bullets used by British forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Catholics on it, no Protestants,'' Reilly said.
``It's just them getting at the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tour had ended; it was time for Reilly to go home, where
the only murals on display are the tattoos that festoon his arms _
including one of a little red devil that bears the name of his
young son. And when the bonfire roars later this month in the
Shankill Estate, Reilly said, he and his family will be on
vacation, out of the country.

 &HT;    Feast for the eyes

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Birding is an inexpensive, simple and exciting
way to increase your time outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   It can turn a park into an oasis or make four dull hours in a
deer stand pass faster than they ever have.
</P>
<P>
   There are no seasons other than the ones imposed by the birds
themselves. Bird-watching works everywhere, from your back yard to
wilderness areas. And if you're a beginner, you probably are
further along than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, I was amazed at how many birds I already
knew,'' said John Szypula, executive director of the Audubon
Society in Austin. ``I knew blue jays and cardinals and chickadees.
And most people already know quite a bit about it. Once they get
started, their interest really perks up.''
</P>
<P>
   Audubon is the big bird of resource and bird conservation
organizations, with established chapters in Travis County, Bastrop,
Bexar County and Waco. Those local chapters provide the perfect
setting for new birders who want to get started or serious folks
who want to interact with other longtime bird watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of just taking that first step,'' Szypula said.
``Once you get started, you can find a place to go and people who
are willing to help.'' Audubon maintains a Web site with space
dedicated to Texas birds. It gives birders a place to ask for help
or just find out which birds are being seen where in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texbirds is a good place for serious birders and you can get
information on trends, sightings and it's a good place to go
because there are people there who can help you,'' Szypula said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is the place for birding, boasting more species (more than
600) than any other state. ``It's the birdiest state and the best
place to get started,'' Szypula said. ``Right now is a great time,
too, because you've got fall migrations starting. The sheer numbers
and diversity of bird life in Texas is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Szypula offered these tips for getting started in birding in
Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a good field guide, especially one that's more local than
not. It will help you find birds that you're more likely to see in
your area,'' he said. Audubon publishes field guides, as does the
American Bird Conservancy. There also are Texas bird guides that
can be purchased in local book stores.
</P>
<P>
   A mentor can help with getting into the sport and with learning
how to identify birds, or even setting up feeding stations around
your house. Joining a local chapter is a good way to find mentoring
help.
</P>
<P>
   Binoculars help. They don't have to be super expensive, since
you're working at close ranges, but they can help in identifying
birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about birding is that you can start in your own
back yard,'' Szypula said, ``and you'll see all sorts of stuff.
Then you can work to more serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Audubon offers help for youngsters who want to get started
birding, with more than 4,000 Central Texas youngsters already
involved in its Junior Audubon program. Information is available
at: http://www.audubon.org/chapter/tx/tx/jr/. Information for
adults can be found at http://www.audubon.org/chapter/tx/tx/ or by
calling (512) 306-0225.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon information Web site for birds and sightings is
http://www.audubon.org/chapter/tx/tx/birds.html.

 &HT;    A love for doves
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Your shooting ability aside, dove season is
always good in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The number of birds in any given field might vary, but overall
hunting success varies very little, according to Jay Roberson, dove
program leader for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   Texas hunters numbered about 390,000 last year, and each spent
an average of 1.3 days in the field. They killed about 11 birds per
person, not bad in a sport in which the national average is about
one dove per every five shells.
</P>
<P>
   But the size of the bag is only a portion of the attraction of
dove hunting in Texas. There's the sport, of course, and the
fellowship of being outdoors with other hunters. Then you have the
privilege of eating the doves you kill.
</P>
<P>
   However, the biggest attraction of dove hunting might be the
fact that the Sept. 1 opening day each year means the long, hot
summer of waiting is over. We can finally take the guns out of the
closet, dust off the old game bag and warm up the retriever.
Hunting season is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting success to jump up this year over last year,''
Roberson said. Much of that success could be attributed to rain, or
the lack of it. ``Water holes will be important because of the
drought,'' he said. ``And the places that have been able to
irrigate or have gotten enough rain for crops to grow will attract
even more birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Doves are one game bird that must find water every day. They
will descend in great numbers on very small watering holes when
there's nothing else available. Afternoon hunts, especially, are
good around water holes and even better during years when there
hasn't been much rain.
</P>
<P>
   August storms could fill tanks and put enough water in cattle
tracks to spread doves out over large areas, but if the rains don't
come, be sure to have a water hole on your list of hunting spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dove hunting is just lke the real estate business: location,
location, location,'' Roberson said. ``The guys who scout and are
fortunate enough to have leases in areas with good water and food
supplies will have the most doves and the best hunting. You like to
have both of those close to roosting and resting areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson did point out that dove populations throughout the
central section of the country have been in a slight decline since
1966, though the problem has been less noticeable in Texas. There
is enough concern that federal officials have put states on notice
that unless the trend reverses itself, there could be shorter
seasons or smaller bags in the future.
</P>
<P>
   TPWD biologists have begun looking at ways to determine just how
real the problem is and whether it represents a decline in numbers
or a shift in geography for doves. ``We're gearing up to do some
studies on what's happening in Texas,'' Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   The department will study whether the long-term routes it uses
for its spring call counts could have lost enough habitat to have
shifted nesting doves into other areas. Satellite imagery is one
way in which the problem could be studied, Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem is real, but I'm not comfortable at this
time in saying what it is,'' he said. Changes in agricultural usage
could be having an impact on doves, as could urbanization of
certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   All of which doesn't mean much when shooting time rolls around.
You're either in the doves or you aren't. If you are, then the
trick is to hit the ones you shoot at.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of tips:
</P>
<P>
   1) Use quality shells. Try 7 1/2s with at least an ounce of
shot, for instance, instead of cheaper shells that might be the
special of the season. You'll get better performance, more shot in
the air and kill more birds.
</P>
<P>
   2) Adjust your choke to the conditions. Afternoon water hole
shooting can easily accommodate improved or even skeet chokes. For
pass shooting and windy conditions, you'll probably want to use
modified for longer shots.
</P>
<P>
   3) Pick one shot you're comfortable with and try to use it as
much as possible. You might not fire the gun as much, but your
percentages will go up.
</P>
<P>
   4) Shoot your shotgun ahead of time. You need to know if it's
shooting high or low, left or right and you need to get your eye
and shoulder into condition for lots of shooting.

 &HT;    It's good to be an outdoors know-it-all
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first license I ever bought cost a quarter,
and I didn't even need it unless I was going to hunt deer.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrels and birds were free and the two deer tags _ bucks only
_ were just a vanity thing, since there aren't that many in the
river bottoms where we grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed since then. The license costs more, of
course, even though it's still fairly cheap. On the license now
there are five deer tags, four turkey tags, a redfish tag, your
federal Harvest Information Program data and a partridge in a pear
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Life's more complicated, and so is the Texas hunting and fishing
license. The standard license now costs $19 for hunting or fishing.
Residents can buy a combination license for $32. The best buy,
though, is the $49 Super Combo license, which includes licenses and
all stamps except for the federal migratory game bird stamp.
</P>
<P>
   This year's license list also includes a $25 Senior Super Combo
for residents 65 and older. Seniors also can buy the $6 special
resident license for hunting or fishing. That same license is
available for residents 17 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   Licenses are required of any individual who hunts any animal or
bird in the state. That would include frogs, for instance, as well
as feral animals such as pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department publishes an annual
hunting booklet that details license fees and requirements, as well
as county-by-county regulations for hunting seasons and bag limits.
It's a good thing to study the booklet, especially for the counties
in which you hunt and for general regulations that might affect
you.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things you'll find in the book:
</P>
<P>
   One fully feathered wing must be retained on all migratory game
birds except doves until the bird has reached its final
destination. All birds imported from Mexico must have a wing
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Deer tags must remain with the carcass, not the head. If you
take the head to a taxidermist, leave tags and permits with the
meat. The head should have a wildlife resource document, noting the
hunter, license number, ranch, who receives it and other
information. A sample document is available in the back of the
annual booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics showing how to properly measure a fish or a crab, as
well as diagrams for puncturing the air bladder on a saltwater fish
so that it can be released alive.
</P>
<P>
   Identification tips for yellow, white, striped and hybrid
striped bass. You look at the tongue, and the booklet tells you how
to identify them.

 &HT;    Final Four will remain in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NCAA Final Four basketball tournaments will be played
in Atlanta despite calls from civil rights activists that they be
moved because the Confederate emblem is part of the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-member executive committee of university presidents,
meeting in Indianapolis, said they would continue to monitor the
situation and did not rule out the possibility of revisiting the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Christian Leadership Conference's president, Martin
Luther King III, has requested that the men's basketball Final Four
in 2002 and 2007 and the women's basketball Final Four in 2003 be
taken out of the Georgia Dome if the state does not remove the
Confederate emblem from its flag.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact of the three events is estimated to be more
than $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a matter of considerable concern to this committee and
this organization,'' said NCAA Executive Committee Chairman Charles
Wethington, who is president of the University of Kentucky. ``Our
paramount concern is for the welfare of student-athletes who are
asked to travel to specific locales to participate in NCAA
championships. So we will continue to watch these issues closely.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag question is to go before the Georgia Legislature when
it next meets in January. Meanwhile, there is nothing the city can
do about it, said Gary Stokan, president of the Atlanta Sports
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Stokan called Tom Jernstadt, executive vice
president of the NCAA, to explain Atlanta's position. ``He
understood where we were coming from and just asked us to keep him
up to date,'' said Stokan. ``(Atlanta) won the bid based on all our
qualifications. This is just something we'll have to deal with in
the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes has said that barring the Final Four tournament
``would not be productive to the ongoing debate about Georgia's
flag.''
</P>
<P>
   But Julian Bond, the NAACP's national board chairman, was not
happy about the NCAA's decision. ``The Confederate swastika is an
abomination and incites hatred, and we think it ought not to be
displayed at any public event,'' he said. The executive committee
also voted to keep the first and second rounds of the men's
basketball tournament in Greenville, S.C., in 2002. The NAACP and
the National Association of Basketball Coaches called for that
tournament to be moved because the Confederate flag, while no
longer flying over the South Carolina Capitol, is still displayed
on the Capitol grounds.

 &HT;    Techniques that will trigger a good shot
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Successful shotgun shooting is so simple.
</P>
<P>
   But if that's the case, why don't more people do it well?
Because they make some simple mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one successful shooter and teacher, there are three
fairly easy problems to identify, even if it's not always easy to
do away with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first thing, the most common thing people do is they
stop the gun when the trigger is pulled,'' said Leon Measures, who
has developed a basic shooting cocessarily equal practice, though.
Shooting thousands of rounds at live or clay targets without the
proper form and motion can mean you're doing nothing more than
locking in bad habits. Good instruction from the beginning helps
teach the right foot placement, how to mount the shotgun and keep
the gun moving.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Measures wants shooters to point, not aim. The shotgun
should follow the eye, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking at the front bead on a shotgun, if you can
see that clearly, you cannot see the target and you won't hit what
you're shooting at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Measures doesn't worry about dominant eye or whether a shooter
is left- or right-handed. The key is building a repetitive motion
that allows the gun and eye to function within a field that helps
the shot intercept the target.

 &HT;    Powers: `I did it to create some opportunities'
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Shorty Powers is no shrinking violet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you'd better WANT him to have your phone number,
because if he thinks you can help him get disabled individuals
outdoors, he's going to call. And call again.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas resident, himself a paraplegic in a wheelchair,
founded POINT, Paraplegics On Independent Nature Trips. Through
hard work and sheer force of will, Powers has pushed the cause to
the forefront in Texas. He's been able to involve the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department and other organizations in offering outdoor
opportunities of every kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it to create some opportunities for physically
challenged people that they might not have otherwise,'' Powers
said. ``They might not have uncles or dads to hunt and fish and can
take them.''
</P>
<P>
   With POINT involved, Powers said, those with physical challenges
know there will be other individuals who understand their special
needs or the obstacles they might face in getting into a boat or a
deer stand. ``They know things are going to be set up for them,''
he said. ``It's a better environment and a chance to be around
people they know.''
</P>
<P>
   POINT has been around for more than 20 years, but Powers still
hasn't reached the plateau he would like to. ``We still don't have
a place we can call our own,'' he said. ``We'd like to have it for
a whole season and bring people in to hunt. We need a place to hunt
ducks and deer that's centrally located.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has been able to secure one such location in
East Texas, on Caddo Lake near Marshall. It's small, though, and
doesn't allow the numbers of people Powers would like.
</P>
<P>
   Powers already does fishing and hunting activities for children
and adults, as well as other outdoors activities. There are
chapters in Houston, Austin and Dallas. ``We obviously are looking
at San Antonio and Corpus Christi,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   For information about POINT and its activities, contact Powers
at (214) 827-7404. In Austin, call Chuck Dahkle, (512) 793-3120 or
Mike Haynes, (512) 867-5141.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Birding is an inexpensive, simple and exciting
way to increase your time outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   It can turn a park into an oasis or make four dull hours in a
deer stand pass faster than they ever have.
</P>
<P>
   There are no seasons other than the ones imposed by the birds
themselves. Bird-watching works everywhere, from your back yard to
wilderness areas. And if you're a beginner, you probably are
further along than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, I was amazed at how many birds I already
knew,'' said John Szypula, executive director of the Audubon
Society in Austin. ``I knew blue jays and cardinals and chickadees.
And most people already know quite a bit about it. Once they get
started, their interest really perks up.''
</P>
<P>
   Audubon is the big bird of resource and bird conservation
organizations, with established chapters in Travis County, Bastrop,
Bexar County and Waco. Those local chapters provide the perfect
setting for new birders who want to get started or serious folks
who want to interact with other longtime bird watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of just taking that first step,'' Szypula said.
``Once you get started, you can find a place to go and people who
are willing to help.'' Audubon maintains a Web site with space
dedicated to Texas birds. It gives birders a place to ask for help
or just find out which birds are being seen where in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texbirds is a good place for serious birders and you can get
information on trends, sightings and it's a good place to go
because there are people there who can help you,'' Szypula said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is the place for birding, boasting more species (more than
600) than any other state. ``It's the birdiest state and the best
place to get started,'' Szypula said. ``Right now is a great time,
too, because you've got fall migrations starting. The sheer numbers
and diversity of bird life in Texas is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Szypula offered these tips for getting started in birding in
Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a good field guide, especially one that's more local than
not. It will help you find birds that you're more likely to see in
your area,'' he said. Audubon publishes field guides, as does the
American Bird Conservancy. There also are Texas bird guides that
can be purchased in local book stores.
</P>
<P>
   A mentor can help with getting into the sport and with learning
how to identify birds, or even setting up feeding stations around
your house. Joining a local chapter is a good way to find mentoring
help.
</P>
<P>
   Binoculars help. They don't have to be super expensive, since
you're working at close ranges, but they can help in identifying
birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about birding is that you can start in your own
back yard,'' Szypula said, ``and you'll see all sorts of stuff.
Then you can work to more serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Audubon offers help for youngsters who want to get started
birding, with more than 4,000 Central Texas youngsters already
involved in its Junior Audubon program. Information is available
at: http://www.audubon.org/chapter/tx/tx/jr/. Information for
adults can be found at http://www.audubon.org/chapter/tx/tx/ or by
calling (512) 306-0225.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon information Web site for birds and sightings is
http://www.audubon.org/chapter/tx/tx/birds.html.

 &HT;    A love for doves
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Your shooting ability aside, dove season is
always good in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The number of birds in any given field might vary, but overall
hunting success varies very little, according to Jay Roberson, dove
program leader for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   Texas hunters numbered about 390,000 last year, and each spent
an average of 1.3 days in the field. They killed about 11 birds per
person, not bad in a sport in which the national average is about
one dove per every five shells.
</P>
<P>
   But the size of the bag is only a portion of the attraction of
dove hunting in Texas. There's the sport, of course, and the
fellowship of being outdoors with other hunters. Then you have the
privilege of eating the doves you kill.
</P>
<P>
   However, the biggest attraction of dove hunting might be the
fact that the Sept. 1 opening day each year means the long, hot
summer of waiting is over. We can finally take the guns out of the
closet, dust off the old game bag and warm up the retriever.
Hunting season is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting success to jump up this year over last year,''
Roberson said. Much of that success could be attributed to rain, or
the lack of it. ``Water holes will be important because of the
drought,'' he said. ``And the places that have been able to
irrigate or have gotten enough rain for crops to grow will attract
even more birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Doves are one game bird that must find water every day. They
will descend in great numbers on very small watering holes when
there's nothing else available. Afternoon hunts, especially, are
good around water holes and even better during years when there
hasn't been much rain.
</P>
<P>
   August storms could fill tanks and put enough water in cattle
tracks to spread doves out over large areas, but if the rains don't
come, be sure to have a water hole on your list of hunting spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dove hunting is just lke the real estate business: location,
location, location,'' Roberson said. ``The guys who scout and are
fortunate enough to have leases in areas with good water and food
supplies will have the most doves and the best hunting. You like to
have both of those close to roosting and resting areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson did point out that dove populations throughout the
central section of the country have been in a slight decline since
1966, though the problem has been less noticeable in Texas. There
is enough concern that federal officials have put states on notice
that unless the trend reverses itself, there could be shorter
seasons or smaller bags in the future.
</P>
<P>
   TPWD biologists have begun looking at ways to determine just how
real the problem is and whether it represents a decline in numbers
or a shift in geography for doves. ``We're gearing up to do some
studies on what's happening in Texas,'' Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   The department will study whether the long-term routes it uses
for its spring call counts could have lost enough habitat to have
shifted nesting doves into other areas. Satellite imagery is one
way in which the problem could be studied, Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem is real, but I'm not comfortable at this
time in saying what it is,'' he said. Changes in agricultural usage
could be having an impact on doves, as could urbanization of
certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   All of which doesn't mean much when shooting time rolls around.
You're either in the doves or you aren't. If you are, then the
trick is to hit the ones you shoot at.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of tips:
</P>
<P>
   1) Use quality shells. Try 7 1/2s with at least an ounce of
shot, for instance, instead of cheaper shells that might be the
special of the season. You'll get better performance, more shot in
the air and kill more birds.
</P>
<P>
   2) Adjust your choke to the conditions. Afternoon water hole
shooting can easily accommodate improved or even skeet chokes. For
pass shooting and windy conditions, you'll probably want to use
modified for longer shots.
</P>
<P>
   3) Pick one shot you're comfortable with and try to use it as
much as possible. You might not fire the gun as much, but your
percentages will go up.
</P>
<P>
   4) Shoot your shotgun ahead of time. You need to know if it's
shooting high or low, left or right and you need to get your eye
and shoulder into condition for lots of shooting.

 &HT;    It's good to be an outdoors know-it-all
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first license I ever bought cost a quarter,
and I didn't even need it unless I was going to hunt deer.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrels and birds were free and the two deer tags _ bucks only
_ were just a vanity thing, since there aren't that many in the
river bottoms where we grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed since then. The license costs more, of
course, even though it's still fairly cheap. On the license now
there are five deer tags, four turkey tags, a redfish tag, your
federal Harvest Information Program data and a partridge in a pear
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Life's more complicated, and so is the Texas hunting and fishing
license. The standard license now costs $19 for hunting or fishing.
Residents can buy a combination license for $32. The best buy,
though, is the $49 Super Combo license, which includes licenses and
all stamps except for the federal migratory game bird stamp.
</P>
<P>
   This year's license list also includes a $25 Senior Super Combo
for residents 65 and older. Seniors also can buy the $6 special
resident license for hunting or fishing. That same license is
available for residents 17 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   Licenses are required of any individual who hunts any animal or
bird in the state. That would include frogs, for instance, as well
as feral animals such as pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department publishes an annual
hunting booklet that details license fees and requirements, as well
as county-by-county regulations for hunting seasons and bag limits.
It's a good thing to study the booklet, especially for the counties
in which you hunt and for general regulations that might affect
you.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things you'll find in the book:
</P>
<P>
   One fully feathered wing must be retained on all migratory game
birds except doves until the bird has reached its final
destination. All birds imported from Mexico must have a wing
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Deer tags must remain with the carcass, not the head. If you
take the head to a taxidermist, leave tags and permits with the
meat. The head should have a wildlife resource document, noting the
hunter, license number, ranch, who receives it and other
information. A sample document is available in the back of the
annual booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics showing how to properly measure a fish or a crab, as
well as diagrams for puncturing the air bladder on a saltwater fish
so that it can be released alive.
</P>
<P>
   Identification tips for yellow, white, striped and hybrid
striped bass. You look at the tongue, and the booklet tells you how
to identify them.

 &HT;    Techniques that will trigger a good shot
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Successful shotgun shooting is so simple.
</P>
<P>
   But if that's the case, why don't more people do it well?
Because they make some simple mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one successful shooter and teacher, there are three
fairly easy problems to identify, even if it's not always easy to
do away with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first thing, the most common thing people do is they
stop the gun when the trigger is pulled,'' said Leon Measures, who
has developed a basic shooting course called ``Shoot Where You
Look.'' He uses air rifles and repetition to teach better shooting.
</P>
<P>
   However, no shooting course, no finely tuned shotgun and no
fancy clothes can make a load of shot intersect with a flying
target if the gun isn't moving before and after the trigger is
pulled. Mind overcomes muscle, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to the first gun you ever shot, which was
probably a BB gun,'' Measures said. ``Somebody taught you from the
beginning that you have to put your head down on the stock, close
one eye, line up the front and rear sights and hold that barrel
still if you want to hit anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that that first BB gun or .22 rifle came with a bunch
of bullets probably means those shooting steps have moved past
instruction and become instinct, Measures said. ``I have to teach
you to unlearn that instinctive movement and creat a habit of not
stopping the gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Measures has drills to do just that, and he teaches those in his
course. Almost any shooter, though, can work on the problem if he
knows he has it and if he does it in the proper way. All of which
brings us to the second problem: lack of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, when dove season starts, haven't had that gun out
of the closet since the last shot they fired last year,'' Measures
said. ``There's not much way they're going to hit anything with it.
You wouldn't think of just going out and running a marathon without
practicing, but people try to do that with a shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Repetition doesn't necessarily equal practice, though. Shooting
thousands of rounds at live or clay targets without the proper form
and motion can mean you're doing nothing more than locking in bad
habits. Good instruction from the beginning helps teach the right
foot placement, how to mount the shotgun and keep the gun moving.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Measures wants shooters to point, not aim. The shotgun
should follow the eye, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking at the front bead on a shotgun, if you can
see that clearly, you cannot see the target and you won't hit what
you're shooting at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Measures doesn't worry about dominant eye or whether a shooter
is left- or right-handed. The key is building a repetitive motion
that allows the gun and eye to function within a field that helps
the shot intercept the target.

 &HT;    Powers: `I did it to create some opportunities'
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Shorty Powers is no shrinking violet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you'd better WANT him to have your phone number,
because if he thinks you can help him get disabled individuals
outdoors, he's going to call. And call again.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas resident, himself a paraplegic in a wheelchair,
founded POINT, Paraplegics On Independent Nature Trips. Through
hard work and sheer force of will, Powers has pushed the cause to
the forefront in Texas. He's been able to involve the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department and other organizations in offering outdoor
opportunities of every kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it to create some opportunities for physically
challenged people that they might not have otherwise,'' Powers
said. ``They might not have uncles or dads to hunt and fish and can
take them.''
</P>
<P>
   With POINT involved, Powers said, those with physical challenges
know there will be other individuals who understand their special
needs or the obstacles they might face in getting into a boat or a
deer stand. ``They know things are going to be set up for them,''
he said. ``It's a better environment and a chance to be around
people they know.''
</P>
<P>
   POINT has been around for more than 20 years, but Powers still
hasn't reached the plateau he would like to. ``We still don't have
a place we can call our own,'' he said. ``We'd like to have it for
a whole season and bring people in to hunt. We need a place to hunt
ducks and deer that's centrally located.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has been able to secure one such location in
East Texas, on Caddo Lake near Marshall. It's small, though, and
doesn't allow the numbers of people Powers would like.
</P>
<P>
   Powers already does fishing and hunting activities for children
and adults, as well as other outdoors activities. There are
chapters in Houston, Austin and Dallas. ``We obviously are looking
at San Antonio and Corpus Christi,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   For information about POINT and its activities, contact Powers
at (214) 827-7404. In Austin, call Chuck Dahkle, (512) 793-3120 or
Mike Haynes, (512) 867-5141.

WHEN ``KILL THE UMP!'' JUST DOESN'T CUT IT
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   If you ask me (and even if you
don't), the main thing wrong with major league baseball today is
not exorbitant salaries, greedy owners or the fact that you can't
afford to bring your family to a game without taking out a second
mortgage on your house.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The main thing wrong with baseball is hecklers. There just don't
seem to be any good ones around anymore. When I say ``hecklers,'' I
am not referring to the drunken thugs in the bleachers who throw
batteries, bullets and golf balls at opposing players.
</P>
<P>
   That is not heckling; that is assault. Good hecklers hurl words,
not deadly missiles. A good heckle is caustic and pointed, but not
so mean that the player is likely to leap into the stands or throw
a ball at your head. A good heckle should get a laugh from the fans
sitting near you; it should not make them run for cover.
</P>
<P>
   A good heckle should be creative and show a little imagination.
Yelling ``kill the umpire'' is neither and, considering how twitchy
everybody is about gun violence these days, it may even get you
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Some heckles are so bad they actually make you feel sorry for
the ballplayer, even a ballplayer you would otherwise dislike. I
was at a Tampa Bay Devil Rays/Baltimore Orioles game a few weeks
ago. We were seated in right field, behind ``controversial''
Baltimore slugger Albert Belle. (When sportswriters use the word
``controversial,'' that means there is unanimity of opinion that
the player is a jerk.) When he first broke into the major leagues
and before he became ``controversial,'' Belle went by his given
name, Joey. The fans next to us thought it would be incredibly
clever to chant ``Jo-ey, Jo-ey'' at Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Not just once, but for the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   This got old after about the third ``Jo-ey,'' so we moved to a
different part of the stadium where the most vocal heckling came
from a woman who was snoring with a book on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be this way. There is now a Web site,
www.heckledepot.com, where fans can stock up on dozens of clever
(and not so clever) heckles to hurl at players, umpires, managers
and other fans the next time they go to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of umpires, heckles are usually variations on three
themes: The ump is blind, the ump is on the take and/or the ump is
grossly overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Some possibilities include:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When your dog barks twice, it's a strike!''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hey, ump! The manager called! Your uniform is ready!''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hey, ump! Move around! You're killin' the grass!''
</P>
<P>
   Heckles directed at pitchers usually focus on a lack of control,
a lack of speed and/or a tendency to give up a lot of long home
runs. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What the matter? You need a running start?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``There's a fight at the bat rack.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``With this guy pitching, the ground crew will have to drag
the warning track after the fifth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitters probably absorb the most heckles, especially when
they're in a slump and are psychologically fragile. Lack of power,
low batting average and unenthusiastic running are common themes:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You couldn't hit sand if you fell off a camel!''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You've had fewer hits than Vanilla Ice!''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Run! What are you doin'? Draggin' a piano?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are your miscellaneous heckles, directed at whomever
happens to be handy:
</P>
<P>
   To a vendor: ``Watch out! He's sellin' corked hot dogs!''
</P>
<P>
   To other fans: ``If you throw all your peanuts at me, what are
you going to feed your mother?''
</P>
<P>
   To an ugly player: ``Did your mother feed you with a
slingshot?''
</P>
<P>
   Heckling is an integral part of baseball, like spitting and
crotch-scratching. Let's keep the tradition alive.

ANALYSIS: PONDERING THE IMPACT OF BUCHANAN AND NADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The five-party system of Democrats, Republicans,
Greens and two Reform parties is something new in American
politics, and right now it is helping Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
in important ways.
</P>
<P>
   The fracture in the Reform Party has dampened whatever slim
hopes the ex-Republican Pat Buchanan had for weakening Bush from
his right. And the energetic campaign by the Green Party's Ralph
Nader, at least for the moment, is helping Bush maintain his lead
over Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the election is not right now, and the fluctuations
in the polls reinforce the impression that it is far from the minds
of most Americans, even those who state a preference. And Buchanan
and Nader have a potential for hurting Bush, too _ Buchanan with
social conservatives and Nader with diehard campaign reform voters,
the old John McCain crowd. But not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last fall, when Buchanan's romancing of the Reform
Party seemed to threaten Bush? Well, his need to reinvent himself
as an authentic Reform Party man distanced him from his core
anti-abortion, anti-homosexual, anti-immigrant base. And even
though Buchanan tried to return to his first love Thursday with a
statement of social value principles, Bush has used the last 10
months to fill the conservatives' dance card, and stir their dreams
of Supreme Court justices who will reverse Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The impending weeks or months of dispute over who gets the
Reform Party's $12.6 million in federal funds _ even if Buchanan
ultimately prevails over his rival, John Hagelin _ mean that he
will be handicapped in using the money strategically. Lots of
important television time, after all, has already been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Nader, ranging between 5 and 9 points in national
polls and thus plainly able to tip some battleground states like
Michigan, Washington Wisconsin and maybe California to Bush by
draining support from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Nader and his backers say that is not their purpose.
And Gore and his backers say that won't be his effect, eventually.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore folks are whistling past the graveyard. The threat
to Gore is the real meaning of the Nader campaign. Right now there
is no question that two-thirds or more of Nader's backers, in state
after state, are coming out of the vice president's potential
voters. And some Gore backers outside his campaign itself admit the
problem. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., for example, wrote in an Op-Ed
piece in Thursday's New York Times that ``A vote for Mr. Nader is a
vote for Mr. Bush and environmentalists who join his personal
crusade risk marginalizing the conservation movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader takes on that argument on two fronts. First, he says he is
running to win, which is about as realistic as General Motors'
defense of the Corvair when Nader attacked it as unsafe in 1965.
Second, he says that while Gore might be a teeny bit better than
Bush on the environment and a couple of other things, the
differences are too small to matter.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars of third parties argue that such candidacies always
fade. John Anderson went from 15 percent to 6 percent in 1980.
Henry Wallace declined similarly in 1948. And even Ross Perot, the
eccentric billionaire who founded the Reform Party in 1992, dropped
from about a third of the vote in polls to 19 percent on election
days, and after spending $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   John Bibby, a retired political scientist at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a student of third parties, said: ``Nader
looks like he could do respectably now. My guess is his vote would
go down as you get closer to the election. The closer the election,
the more significant is the wasted vote argument.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``When it comes down to it, you want your vote to be
meaningful.'' A Gore strategist agreed. He said: ``I don't see
Nader being like Perot in being able to communicate. He won't spend
$56 million.'' And he argued, ``As people get to know Gore better,
I think it's going to make it a lot easier to see him as someone
who fights for people and will be on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Republican strategist was unconvinced, arguing that Nader
would hold on to enough support to be a factor. ``He has a
long-standing reputation among a core group of voters he doesn't
need ads to purchase,'' the strategist said.'' He added that
because of his consumer record, Nader ``gets a little bit of an
earned media ride, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, and Buchanan, too, also argue that their differences from
the Republicans and Democrats are enabling them to make voters out
of non-voters. Nader sometimes argues that even if Gore loses, the
Green Party's missionary efforts will help elect more Democrats to
the House, and make Rep. Dick Gephardt speaker.
</P>
<P>
   That's what third party candidates always say. Curtis Gans, head
of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate and a
student of voter turnout, said he saw only ``a slight chance that
Nader will stir some increase among young people,'' and no
indication that he was bringing in other potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Patterson, head of a Harvard study of ``the Vanishing
Voter'' that uses weekly polling to learn what is behind low
participation, said he saw no evidence that either Nader or
Buchanan ``really seems to be popping'' and exciting voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is another target for Nader _ the Perot voter who reacted
in 1992 to Perot's criticism of the way campaign cash and lobbying
fees dictate results in Washington. This week Nader started showing
a television commercial (with an authentic old politics touch, his
staff refused to say where the modest purchase of advertising time
was taking place or how much was spent). It parodied recent ads for
Mastercard with lines like ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser:
$1,000 a plate'' and ``Finding out the truth: priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   But clever as that ad is, the Nader campaign says it plans to
spend no more than $5 million on commercials for the entire 2000
campaign. While ads for which little time was bought, like the
Willie Horton ad to promote Bush's father in 1988, have sometimes
become effective by being shown often on news programs, there is no
indication that will happen with Nader's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The only real money available for the outsider candidates is the
$12.6 million for the Reform Party. Even if Buchanan gets it, the
Bush campaign dismisses him as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said ``The sun has set on Pat
Buchanan's candidacy and will not rise again. Pat Buchanan is old
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Federal Election Commission can speed up its
normal pace and get a check in the mail before the 2004 campaign,
Buchanan could be at least an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Maisel, co-author with Bibby of the 1998 book ``Two
Parties or More,'' said he thought if Buchanan spent his money
wisely, in a few small states with big anti-abortion movements, he
might still matter. The Colby College professor of government said
Nader might fade faster. He said, ``I think there is more
ideological zealotry on the part of the anti-abortion people than
there is on the part of labor and the environmentalists.''

 (Includes Ruiz career text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There is only one question on the mind of everyone
who has ever known John Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Can he do it?
</P>
<P>
   Can a relatively unknown heavyweight from Massachusetts find a
way to beat the greatest heavyweight of his era Saturday at the
Paris Hilton to win the World Boxing Association title? Can a guy
who was knocked out in 19 seconds six years ago by David Tua
survive the onslaughts of Evander Holyfield and conjure up some way
to defeat him?
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics, of which there are many, answer that with another
question. Can elephants fly?
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the skeptics are right because many of
those same experts said barely four years ago that matching
Holyfield against Mike Tyson was a felony. They said Holyfield's
entrance music that night should have been ``The Executioner's
Song'' because he was walking into a fistic electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven rounds later, Tyson was bloody, beaten, and half
unconscious and suddenly many of the same wiseguys were saying they
knew it all along.
</P>
<P>
   So can John Ruiz beat Evander Holyfield? Yes, he can.
</P>
<P>
   Will he? That's up to him and, to a lesser extent, Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the best Ruiz could not beat the best Holyfield _ but
that Holyfield no longer exists. He is nearly 38 years old and has
been through two hard nights with Lennox Lewis and a similarly
difficult one with Michael Moorer before he finally stopped him
nearly three years ago. That's not to mention his three wars with
Riddick Bowe, fights that changed both men for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ruiz's battle plan, which is to test Holyfield by
working at a fast pace from the outset and hitting him wherever he
can whenever he can, regardless of the location of the punches, is
a sound one. It is based on a simple question: What does Holyfield
have left?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make Holyfield fight Johnny's fight,'' said Gabe
Mari, Ruiz's trainer. ``Punch and move. Make him work more than he
wants to. Don't let him set the pace. Don't let him get
comfortable. Hopefully, Johnny'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the real question with Ruiz (36-3, 27 KOs), of course.
Will he do it? He can, but will he?
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is a skilled journeyman, what I call a professional. In
boxing, being called a professional is being spoken of with great
respect. It doesn't mean you are the most skilled fighter in
history or that you are a legend in the making. What it does mean
is you know your trade and how to ply it.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz has learned his the hard way, in small arenas for small
money until his chance finally came. But he has learned, reaching a
point several years ago that shocked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three or four fights ago I really started feeling
comfortable,'' Ruiz said. ``That's why I think this fight came at
the right time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If it did, it will be because Holyfield (36-3-1, 25 KOs) is no
longer what people think he is and Ruiz is more than they think he
is. If Ruiz is that, he can win because he comes to the ring with a
hard jab, the ability to move and box, and enough cumulative power
to wear down an opponent and take him out.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a one-punch knockout artist, but neither is Holyfield.
Both are boxers more than fighters, with Holyfield the consummate
counterpuncher, which means Ruiz must be careful when he presses
the attack not to get caught by a counter left hook as he jabs. He
must keep his right hand up to protect himself at those moments.
But that jab and the movement that is supposed to follow is what he
must use to bother Holyfield and drag him into the deep water of
the fight's late rounds, when Ruiz's youth (28) becomes a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will beat Holyfield's jab,'' Mari warned. ``Even Lewis
didn't beat him with his jab. But the difference between Johnny's
jab and Lewis's is Lewis throws pillows. There's night and day
difference between them. Johnny's jab does damage. We need to use
it and avoid fighting Holyfield's fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to walk out and knock Johnny out and go home. So we
have to start fast, too. We got youth on our side, so who benefits
if they go to war a little bit?''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis is on the words ``a little bit.'' If a brawl breaks
out early, Holyfield probably wins it. But if a fight breaks out
with punches and counterpunches and a fast pace it could take more
out of Holyfield than it does Ruiz. There are several small things
pointing to Holyfield not being as ready as he should be.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield weighed in Thursday at 221 pounds. It is the heaviest
he has ever weighed for a fight. Combined with the fact he already
had the match postponed once when he claimed a rib injury makes you
wonder how seriously he has taken the 224-pound man in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Holyfield has fought down to the level of his
opponent. He rose up in the big fights with Bowe, Tyson, and, to a
lesser extent, the Lewis rematch, but struggled against Moorer
twice, Bobby Czyz, Alex Stewart, and Vaughn Bean. If that pattern
persists Saturday, the three-time champion may find it far more
difficult to become the four-time champion than he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   That Holyfield has little respect for Ruiz was clear when he
stood up at the final press conference and said, ```I'm preparing
for a better person that I see.''
</P>
<P>
   For a longtime Holyfield watcher that meant he doesn't see much,
if he's even bothered to look. He felt the same way about Czyz and
trained three weeks for the fight. He won, but looked so bad Tyson
decided that night to fight him.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue is, who will Ruiz really have in front of him?
He will have an old champion who has not looked like himself since
the second Tyson fight (June 28, 1997). He will have an old
champion who is coming off two straight big fights with Lewis,
neither of which he did well in. He will have an old champion
asking himself to get up mentally for a guy he says doesn't look
like much as a ``person.'' He will have an old champion whose
greatest fights have always been as much mental exercises as
physical ones, nights in which his will overwhelmed bigger,
stronger, and more heavily favored opponents.
</P>
<P>
   As he has aged, Holyfield has begun to face what most athletes
do. Good as his body looks, he admits to having more bad days than
good ones. More days when his shoulder is stiff, or his legs cramp,
or his back is sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure that's happened,'' said Jim Thomas, Holyfield's advisor.
``But Evander is as well-conditioned an athlete as I've ever seen
at 37.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so but can he be in better shape than he was for the two
Lewis fights? What will he feel like when he leaves for the arena?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe like the old Evander Holyfield. Or maybe just like an old
Evander Holyfield. If the latter happens, and Ruiz remains mentally
strong and follows Mari's plan, it may become clear finally why
Ruiz is only a 4-1 underdog, not 6-1 or 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny has a shot,'' veteran fight trainer Lou Duva said last
week. ``I know this guy (Holyfield, who Duva once trained and
managed). Evander isn't Evander anymore and Johnny can fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the reticent Ruiz acknowledged this week that he is not the
only one with questions about himself when the bell tolls around 11
p.m. Holyfield does too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he comes in,'' Ruiz said. ``I'm ready for that. Making
him work hard is my main goal. From the first round I have to
fight. I'm the underdog. I got more questions to answer than he
does. I have to change people's minds from the beginning to the
end. But I want to see what he still has in the tank after a couple
of rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect Ruiz to use his jab and his right hand behind it to score
early. But also look for a lot of movement that forces Holyfield to
pursue him, using his energy to get into position to punch.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see Ruiz loading up, however. Rather he will
look to hit Holyfield anywhere, including on the arms and elbows,
as often as he can while carefully trying to avoid the counterpunch
and uppercut that have turned so many nights Holyfield's way.
</P>
<P>
   If Ruiz's plan is successful, he will make Holyfield work late
into the night, into rounds he never thought he'd be facing. What
happens if they get there will tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield is a great fighter, but he's an old fighter,'' Mari
said. ``I've watched him a lot on tape. I don't think he can see
the punches anymore. I don't think he can get out of the way of a
punch anymore. That's why Lewis hit him so often.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he does have is experience. John doesn't. You have to
rise to the occasion. He has. Now John has to. Everybody has bad
days on the job. But if you're a fighter, you can't have a bad day
on a night like this or you won't be a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   No you won't. But that applies not just to Ruiz. It also applies
to an old warrior who may not be ready for the young brave who is
waiting for him with more arrows in his quiver than Holyfield
thinks.

SPELLS SUCCESS FOR CENTRIST DEMOCRATS  
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ Evidently a J.D.,
Ph.D or M.B.A. is no longer the ticket to political success in the
Democratic party _ candidates should instead have DLC after their
names.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly anointed vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman is the
current chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist
political coalition that also counts President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore among its prominent members.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore and Lieberman are elected, it would extend DLC dominance
over the White House to 12 years, quite an achievement for a group
formed in the mid-1980s to give Southern Democrats a voice to
counter what they saw as the increasingly liberal posture of the
national party.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gore, a founding member, the roll call of DLC political
figures includes the late Lawton Chiles of Florida, Louisiana Sen.
John Breaux, Florida Sen. Bob Graham, former Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, Virginia Sen. Chuck Robb and dozens of other House members
and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have created the formula that helps win
elections,'' said Matthew Frankel, a spokesman for the group. ``The
DLC is an important breeding ground for the new Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the old Democratic party that worried its Southern
members more than a decade ago. They felt politically exposed as
their region became more suburban and Republican while the national
Democratic leadership became more allied with labor, minority
groups and other activists typical of big-city politics. Some
Democrats bolted to the GOP but others stayed and created the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   The group stressed welfare reform, more responsible fiscal
policy, tougher anti-crime laws, stronger defense and other
positions not typically associated with Democrats. It found an
audience and launched Clinton to the White House. In fact, some
analysts equate the compassionate conservatism message of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush with a GOP version of the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is evidence of the appeal the group has for
politicians outside the South. DLC members say the centrist senator
could make an impact in the region if voters look beyond the fact
that he is from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are trying to get that word out. ``He's just a
Northern Sam Nunn,'' Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes told a rally in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER SIDE OF REFORM
</P>
<P>
   Welfare reform may have been a winning political message for the
DLC, but it is driving up the number of low-income parents without
health insurance in Southern states, according to a new report from
a consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA blamed the push to reduce the welfare rolls for
jumps in the uninsured in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North
Carolina and Tennessee among other states. The group said that
low-income adults moved into the labor market by welfare cutbacks
often lose their Medicaid coverage but end up in low-wage jobs that
don't provide health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of thousands of low-wage working parents are cast
adrift without health care when they do the right thing and find
jobs,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of the liberal group.
He wants the government to expand Medicaid access to working
families.
</P>
<P>
   SEA TO SHINING SEA
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fritz Hollings of South Carolina is known for making waves
with his independent streak, but he may have hit a new highwater
mark.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has signed into law Hollings' Oceans Acts of
2000, which creates a new commission to undertake a comprehensive
evaluation of the nation's hodgepodge of coastal and ocean
policies. Its findings could lead to an overhaul of fishery
management and environmental regulations much like the work of a
similar panel 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings said the 16-member commission, which will include
oceanographers, policymakers, industry representatives and
conservationists, should ``help us develop consistent national
policies that reflect our country's evolving national relationship
with our oceans and coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA GOES HOLLYWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Southern California already has the Rose Bowl parade, but Los
Angelenos should brace for the Mardi Gras parade planned for the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Sen. John Breaux is the host of a mega-event to be
held Tuesday night on the backlot of Paramount Studios. The
corporate-sponsored party will feature such entertainers as Rockin'
Dopsie Jr. and the Zydeco Twisters and the Storyville Stompers from
New Orleans. Even laid-back LA might find it hard to resist that
sort of bayou boogie.

DEFYING THE GOVERNMENT, BANK OF JAPAN RAISES INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.

 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Forcefully asserting its view that Japan's economy is
now growing firmly after years of false starts, the central bank
raised interest rates Friday for the first time in a decade,
defying strong pressure from government officials to keep borrowing
costs close to zero.
</P>
<P>
   In what was described as a difficult all-day meeting, the Bank
of Japan's nine-member board voted to abandon the zero-interest
policy it had adopted in February 1999 as an emergency measure to
keep the economy from slipping further into recession.
</P>
<P>
   While the move by the Bank of Japan had been widely expected, it
nonetheless sent a powerful message about the central bank's view
that the Japanese economy, the world's second-largest, has now
achieved enough momentum to keep expanding. The move also
represented an unprecedented display of independence by the central
bank, which had been given more autonomy under a change in the law
a few years ago but until Friday had never exercised it.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank said it would steer a benchmark rate known as
the overnight call rate _ the interest rate banks charge each other
_ to 0.25 percent from virtually zero.
</P>
<P>
   The official discount rate, which is the largely symbolic rate
on loans the central bank charges to private banks, was left
unchanged at 0.5 percent, a record low.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the first time since 1990 that the central bank had
raised rates, which it had lowered repeatedly in response to
Japan's seesaw pattern of recession and feeble recovery that
characterized much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present, Japan's economy is showing clearer signs of
recovery, and this gradual upturn, led mainly by business fixed
investment, is likely to continue,'' the central bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the benchmark rate will lead to higher borrowing
costs for consumers and businesses. Even so, the benchmark rate
remains extraordinarily low in this country. The comparable rate in
the United States is 6.5 percent and in Europe it is 4.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the rate increase came after the close of
the financial markets. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks was
up 141.85 points, or .89 percent, to 16,117.50. The yen was little
changed against the dollar. The markets were not expected to react
much when they reopened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the central bank's decision drew sharp criticism from
government officials, political leaders and many economists who
have argued that Japan's economy is still too delicate to sustain
an increase in interest rates, no matter how small. Many critics of
the increase view it more as a statement of independence on the
part of the central bank than sound economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Bank of Japan has probably moved too soon in light
of the economic situation,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief
economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. ``The onus is on
them to demonstrate their decision was correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist for Commerz Securities in
Tokyo, said the rate increase was ``a brave move but not
necessarily one that the economy justifies.''
</P>
<P>
   While Japan's economy grew 2.5 percent in the first three months
of 2000 and the government projects economic growth this fiscal
year will be 1 percent, double the rate of a year earlier, Bevacqua
said Japan's growth was peaking and would slow.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which early this week denounced any rate
increase as premature, asked the central bank at its meeting Friday
to postpone a decision on rates until next month, when
second-quarter gross domestic product figures will be available,
allowing a better assessment of the country's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the board immediately rejected the request by a majority
vote, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the meeting, Masaru Hayami, the
central bank's governor, stressed that the zero-rate policy had
been an extraordinary measure meant to ward off deflation _ a
dangerous downward spiral of prices and incomes that can lead to a
full-scale depression. But Hayami said such a policy had to end at
some point and that the deflation threat had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami has long stated the need to raise interest rates, arguing
that the zero-rate policy essentially encourages nearly free
borrowing that keeps money-losing businesses from making painful
cutbacks. It also hurts the incomes of Japan's growing population
of retirees whose savings are barely earning interest.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hayami had conducted a public relations
campaign of sorts, proclaiming the necessity of raising rates. Many
analysts said he had gone too far to turn back. One central bank
board member who attended Friday's meeting said that Hayami had
convinced most board members that it was their duty to vote for the
rate increase, as a measure not only of their independence but
their legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All economic data, ranging from corporate investment to jobs
and spending, have gotten better in August and July,'' Hayami said.
``Board members took these data as proof that deflation fears have
dissipated.''
</P>
<P>
   At its board meeting last month, the central bank had been
widely expected to lift the zero-rate policy, but the collapse of a
highly indebted retailer, the Sogo Co., sent shudders through the
financial system and the bank decided to maintain the policy while
it monitored the impact of Sogo's failure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the immediate impact of the rate increase was
likely to be a tightening of credit available to small and
medium-sized businesses, which would increase bankruptcies and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vulnerable are the real estate, construction and
retail sectors, which are the most heavily indebted. Higher
interest rates will also make it more costly for the government to
borrow money to feed the extensive spending projects that have
helped keep Japan's economy from faltering even further over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase puts Japanese banks in a particularly
difficult position. The banks, which have received massive
government aid because of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of
unpaid loans on their books, have promised that they would make
more loans to small and medium-sized businesses. But they will be
hard pressed to keep those promises while raising their loan rates.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the rate increase was mixed in the Japanese business
community. Takashi Imai, chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., told the
Kyodo news service that he found it difficult to understand the
central bank's decision. ``Given personal consumption and prices,
it can hardly be said we have come to a point where we can be
certain that concern for deflation is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Fuji Xerox Co., welcomed
the rate increase, saying: ``The Japanese economy is now in a very
good shape. The decision is confirmation that concerns about
deflation are gone and that the economic recovery is getting on the
right track.''

JUDGE ORDERS TESTS FOR THREATENING BOYFRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A judge has ordered that Vincent J. Froio Jr. -- whose
arrest last weekend for allegedly breaking into his ex-girlfriend's
apartment, ransacking it, and threatening to kill her was detailed
in The Boston Globe -- be held in custody at a New Hampshire
psychiatric facility until Monday, when he will be transferred to
Bridgewater (Mass.) State Hospital for a 30-day evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark Summerville ordered the transfer after determining
that the psychiatric facility where Froio was admitted earlier this
week, Elliot Hospital in Manchester, N.H., did not provide adequate
security.
</P>
<P>
   Once Froio's evaluation is complete, his case will be referred
for further review to Summerville, who will then determine whether
to jail him pending trial, or to release him with electronic
monitoring or other security measures.
</P>
<P>
   The move represented a dramatic shift by the judge who last week
had set Froio free on $30,000 bail without electronic monitoring
but with the requirment that he seek treatment in a psychiatric
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Froio, 33, a lawyer with the law firm of Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot,
was arrested at about 4:30 a.m. last Saturday after police found
him sitting shirtless and blood-splattered on the front steps of
the trashed apartment of his ex-girlfriend, Angelique Uhlmann.
</P>
<P>
   A former competitive bodybuilder, Froio allegedly broke into the
apartment after smashing the door off its hinges, destroyed much of
Uhlmann's property, and smeared blood throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers who arrived at the apartment said the scene was
so disturbing that they believed they had encountered a homicide,
possibly involving mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   Froio was bleeding from a nearly severed finger when he was
discovered by police. Froio's lawyer, Desmond Fitzgerald, said
Froio cut his finger when he fell while walking to Uhlmann's house
and may have gone to her apartment ``for assistance with his
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhlmann, a fourth-year medical student at Tufts, is studying to
be a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday Froio, apppeared in Boston Municipal Court, where
prosecutors asked Summerville to hold him without bail, arguing
that he was too dangerous to release. Summerville instead set bail
at $30,000, rejecting prosecutors's requests that Froio be tethered
to an electronic bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   Froio made bail and was freed later that day after promising to
check himself into a New Hampshire psychiatric hospital. Because of
a problem finding a bed, he was not admitted to a hospital until
nearly 27 hours after leaving jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after learning about Froio's delay in being
admitted, Summerville ordered that his defense attorney provide
additional information about the psychiatric facility where Froio
was admitted.
</P>
<P>
   And, after reviewing that information, Summerville ordered that
Froio be transferred Monday to Bridgewater for a ``competency and
criminal responsibility'' evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly feel better than I did after Monday's result,''
said Uhlmann, who is in hiding. ``Of course my ultimate wish would
be that he was behind bars until the trial, because only that would
give me complete safety. But at least it gives me some comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald declined to comment.

HOW BURIAL PLOTS AND BINGO CONNECT WITH FOOD STAMPS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In California, New York and many other states, people applying
for food stamps are asked if they own a burial plot. Nebraska and
Nevada want to know if applicants have sold their blood, and for
how much. Hawaii demands garage-sale receipts, South Dakota wants
documentation of bingo winnings, and Minnesota, on page 20 of a
36-page eligibility application, asks if anyone in the household
earns money from a paper route.
</P>
<P>
   Food-stamp applications in most states have become so onerous
that they are deterring needy people from applying for the
subsidies, a comprehensive analysis by a national network of food
banks and advocacy groups has found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the inquiries about income and assets have no connection
to legal requirements for food stamps but are either aggressive
responses to federal mandates to deter fraud or part of recent
state and local efforts to cut welfare costs by eliminating
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   State administrators contend that they are simply complying with
federal pressure to be tight-fisted with taxpayers' money and
properly enforcing the tougher rules passed by Congress in the 1996
welfare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials say that the report, conducted by
America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest food-bank network,
adds to their worries that such stringency may be one reason that
12 million people who need the benefits, and are eligible, are not
getting them.
</P>
<P>
   Food-stamp use is plummeting at a faster rate than can be
explained by economic growth. Since 1996 the number of people using
food stamps has declined to 17.2 million people from 23 million,
though a growing bipartisan consensus now holds that food stamps,
like Medicaid, are supports needed to keep low-wage parents
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in this program we have not looked at the big
picture,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in an interview
about the survey, which will be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my goal to keep hungry people out of the program _
that's a disgrace,'' Glickman said. ``But it's also my job to keep
fraud down. It's tricky to balance those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, he added, ``is actually helpful. We are going to
continue to work with the states to make sure that the income
limits aren't ridiculous,'' and that anti-fraud techniques are not
``outside the bounds of what we ought to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new sleuthing methods for countering fraud are
parking-lot espionage in Tennessee, computerized credit checks in
Delaware and Texas, and calls to employers and landlords in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want you to have nothing,'' a disabled woman of 56,
who asked that her name not be used, whispered as she peered at the
question about a burial space in the shabby waiting room of a
food-stamp office in the Harlem area of New York. ``It's none of
their business. You want to tell the truth, but they make it so if
you tell the truth, it don't help.''
</P>
<P>
   When the comment was repeated to the sponsors of the study,
which examined application forms from all 50 states and a sampling
from the United States' 3,143 counties, they said it underlined the
unfairness of such questions, though they are not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's afraid she'll go hungry if she's honest,'' Deborah Leff,
president of America's Second Harvest, said of the woman's concern.
``Isn't that a mess?''
</P>
<P>
   Though the federal government finances and oversees the
food-stamp program, states administer it, with wide variations. The
shortest application, in Florida, is only a page, but most are more
than 10 pages, and all warn that misleading answers are punishable
by a stiff fine and up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the study found, many questions are unintelligible to the
average applicant, and some are mind-boggling even to the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you or anyone in your household fleeing from New Jersey?''
Ohio's eight-page application asks. Researchers nicknamed the query
the Soprano Clause, after the television drama about a Mafia
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in Cleveland,'' said Sharon Davis, 39, a single mother
of three who was laid off last month from her job as a machine
operator and had spent most of the afternoon applying for food
stamps. ``Why would they ask if you're from New Jersey?''
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, state administrators contend that all the
questions _ including that one _ reflect local efforts to comply
with a stream of federal dictates, including periodic crackdowns on
fraud, stiff penalties on states that overpay even by $5, and new
rules in the 1996 federal welfare legislation.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the so-called Soprano Clause, for example, Ohio
food-stamp administrators pointed to a provision by Congress in the
1996 legislation. It excludes from the food-stamp program any
fugitive from prosecution of a felony, which in New Jersey is
called a ``high misdemeanor.'' To be on the safe side, said Jon
Allen, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family
Services, Ohio added an extra question just to cover New Jersey's
terminology.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Nebraska, which was fined $1 million for
food-stamp errors in a 1998 federal audit, asks about money from
blood-plasma donations and counts it against a family's food
allotment _ which food-bank analysts say is simply wrong _ because
in 1986 an obscure federal policy memorandum defined such money as
earned income.
</P>
<P>
   As for burial plots, some state administrators justify
questioning elderly applicants about them because a federal
provision notes that only one grave per customer can be discounted
when calculating a household's assets. To be eligible for food
stamps at all, a household cannot have assets of over $2,000, or
$3,000 for senior citizens, including checking and savings accounts
and the value of any car above $4,650.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that some people seeking food stamps have
been turned away or cut off in a push to divert them from welfare _
sometimes illegally, as a federal court found in New York City last
year. Many other people either do not know they are eligible or are
discouraged by the requirements, especially in states that
shortened eligibility to three months instead of a year, which is
allowed by federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Applications take an average of five hours and two visits,
Agriculture Department figures show, and the benefit, only $73 a
month per person on average, can be as low as $10. Ninety percent
of households getting food stamps have income under the poverty
line, or $14,150 for a family of three. Three-quarters have no
countable assets.
</P>
<P>
   Though many longer applications include questions relating to
cash assistance and medical benefits, a recent study in Western and
Southern states found that 78 percent of those seeking food stamps
were not told when they qualified for the other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials are now urging outreach
efforts, and this year for the first time they are offering modest
rewards to states that increase participation. But state
administrators see a certain hypocrisy in the new thrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only message we have heard for years is accuracy; your
error rate is what matters,'' Ann Sessoms, Minnesota's welfare
reform manager, said. ``If you miss a plasma donation, if you miss
a paper route, the state is held liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last September the Agriculture Department's quality-control
arm praised the Tennessee Department of Human Services' ``Project
Parking Lot,'' in which Nashville investigators patrol for cars
whose blue-book value exceeds the $4,650 limit. They feed the
license-plate numbers into a computer listing people on the benefit
rolls, and have cut off $3 million to $4 million in benefits as a
result, according to Larry Evitts, the director of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy,'' said Stephanie Manning, who oversees a
Nashville food pantry that limits aid to three boxes of groceries
every six months. ``You can't eat your car,''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Harris, administrator of food stamps in Nebraska, said that
the dollar limit on cars, raised by only $150 since it was set by
Congress 20 years ago, shows how states get stuck enforcing
obsolete regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's happened to the price of cars,'' Harris said.
``It's like, come on, people!''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest enforcement trend, some states either require
electronic fingerprinting of food-stamp recipients or are planning
it. Texas has contracted with computer information brokers who
provide, among other tidbits, a listing of 10 neighbors who could
be asked about an applicant's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware pays $2 or $3 an inquiry for credit-card histories on
applicants whose answers seem suspicious to a caseworker. Though
privacy laws make it illegal to use credit information in a
criminal case, William Garfinkel, director of audit at the Delaware
Department of Health and Social Services, said that nothing barred
using it to determine government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They count everything,'' Anna Santana, a divorced bookkeeper
in Lincoln, Neb., said, citing a $25 gift certificate from her
church for her three children's Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Before she qualified for food stamps, she added, there were
times when she fed the children first and ate only if they left
something. But her older daughter, then 5, caught on.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started cutting back on what she was eating,'' Santana
recalled. ```I'm not hungry, Mommy, you need to eat, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said some state actions seemed overzealous,
congressional mandates notwithstanding. ``The irony here is that we
don't ask farmers to do anything like we do our food-stamp
recipients,'' Glickman added, referring to federal farm subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   A few states stand out in the study as exceptions. Indiana, for
example, has a two-page application that does not ask about burial
plots, bingo or blood products. Federal audits last year found
fewer mistakes in its calculations of benefits than they did in
California, which squeezes 120 questions onto 21 pages. Indeed, the
study found that there was no correlation at all between the length
of a state's application and the accuracy of its payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states have shown a lot of good judgment and simplicity
in complying with the requirements,'' Glickman said. ``Other states
have gone down a much more complicated route. Our job is to try to
help all the states run a simpler system.''

   At the GOP Convention, Carmakers Toot Horns
</P>
<P>
   It was the battle of the cars at the Republican National
Convention, between GM and DaimlerChrysler. On Sunday night, GM,
which gave $1 million to the convention's host committee, held a
party for 2,000 people. It featured Hank Williams Jr. and a replica
of the Batmobile. DaimlerChrysler, which had given the host
committee $250,000, held a reception honoring Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma that featured the Temptations and a gold Phaeton, a
futuristic concept car.
</P>
<P>
   The carmakers have a tradition of treating the conventions as
marketing opportunities. GM plans equally lavish events at the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, but with the United
Automobile Workers as a Democrat-friendly partner.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes Raises Some Capital
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who has spent nearly $70 million on two bids for
the Republican presidential nomination, now spends much of his time
running Forbes magazine. But not all of it.
</P>
<P>
   He was at his party's convention to _ what else? _ promote his
tax policies and raise money for other candidates. With his old
buddies Jack Kemp, who has become something of a venture
capitalist, and Lawrence Kudlow, the Wall Street economist, he
talked up their new venture, the Club for Growth, at a breakfast
meeting. Joining the club requires a political donation, which the
group will use for Republicans sharing Forbes' supply-side economic
views. ``I'm trying to help get kindred souls elected,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Hats Enter the Ring
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Mattel decided to promote the new Barbie by
announcing that she would run for the presidency. But at the
Republican convention, GetSetClub.com, a Web-based doll maker in
Philadelphia, ambushed her by showcasing its own candidate,
Vanessa, an African-American doll said to have a college degree and
a history of struggles and successes. According to GetSetClub, she
is running as a candidate of the Surprise Party.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, Mattel struck back by stuffing little Barbie
doll delegates into the Republicans' welcome bags. Mattel hasn't
decided whether there will be a showdown at the Democratic
convention in Los Angeles, and it is leaning against having Barbie
accept Vanessa's challenge to debate. ``Barbie is really busy
serving as a delegate at the convention,'' said Julia Jensen, a
spokeswoman at Mattel and Barbie's campaign manager. ``She doesn't
have time to accept the debate.''
</P>

   Two Other Tigers on a Celtic Course
</P>
<P>
   With the spotlight on the PGA tour and Tiger Woods all summer,
other, less-known golf tournaments have been largely overlooked.
But the Stone of Accord Tournament last month at the Old Head
course in Kinsale, Ireland, was also a display of American golfing
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   First Ralph Crowley, chief executive of Polar Beverages, a
soft-drink company in Worcester, Mass., shot a hole in one. Using a
6-iron, Crowley got what was not only his first hole in one, but
the first ever on the 180-yard 16th hole of the course, which
opened in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Dan Hoffstad, another member of Crowley's group,
finished the round with a 72, just one stroke over the course
record, held by Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley, with a 12 handicap, said he was happy about his game,
but added that his wife, Joan, defeats him regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Water, Water Everywhere, And That Means Funds, Too  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Internet funds hemorrhaging cash and wireless funds
careening after an earnings warning from Nokia, America needs a
cool new mutual fund sector. How about water? It's eternal. It's
cool. And this most basic of life's necessities even has its own
mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the initial returns of the $4.5 million Water
Fund have been slightly soggy. Since its introduction last Oct. 28,
the fund has gained just over 2 percent, compared with the 8.2
percent return of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is managed by Avalon Trust Co., a Santa Fe, N.M.,
investment concern that specializes in socially conscious
investing. Despite the slow start, Owen M. Quattlebaum, the fund's
manager, predicts that opportunities for water investments will not
dry up anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has elements of a scarce commodity,'' he said. ``More
people appear to be looking to use it in areas where the supply is
not growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quattlebaum said the bulk of his portfolio was devoted to
playing mergers and acquisitions in domestic water utilities and to
buying companies developing water filtration technologies. &QL;

<P>
   The Estate Tax's Pulse
</P>
<P>
   The possible death of the death tax, to borrow from Mark Twain,
has been greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``repeal'' of the levy, known in less partisan terms
as the estate tax, has been passed by both houses of Congress,
Republican leaders have yet to send the bill to President Clinton,
who vows a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republican leaders appear to have decided that there
are more votes in attacking Democrats for preserving the so-called
marriage tax _ the president recently vetoed a remedy of it _ than
in seeking tax relief for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Republican bill _ or a less ambitious Democratic
alternative _ became law, it would not mean that the government
would stop taxing estates, at least not anytime soon. For one
thing, the levy would phase out over a decade, not disappearing
until 2010. At that point, to minimize revenue loss, the Treasury
would start collecting tax on a buildup of capital gains that it
now disregards _ the amount by which a stock, for example, has
appreciated before an heir receives it.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, estates bigger than $675,000 are hit with taxes
progressing from 37 percent to 55 percent; the threshold is to rise
to $1 million in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   With so much uncertainty over the tax, planners are giving
general advice to remain financially flexible. They also remind
clients that they may need more, not less, professional counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be frozen into thinking that, `Oh boy! This might go
away,''' David Megaw, second vice president at Lincoln Financial
Advisors in Hartford, said of the tax issues. ``You'll probably be
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Context for Spending
</P>
<P>
   Consumers follow the three S's _ spend, save and share _ in that
order, emphasizing the first, says Nathan Dungan, vice president of
stewardship and brand development at Lutheran Brotherhood, a
financial services group in Minneapolis. Americans ``are caught in
a web of hypnotic consumption,'' he said. ``We're at an all-time
low in savings and there's little energy invested in sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the order, Dungan offers seven tips for financial
planning:
</P>
<P>
   _ Think it through before you act.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evaluate spending to determine if it reflects what you value.
</P>
<P>
   _ Budget with values in mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Protect income for your family.
</P>
<P>
   _ Save for goals like a child's education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give to a cause that counts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teach the next generation about financial values.

 &HT;    Mmm, mmm ...dove breasts (with gravy, of course)
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I hate to hear anyone say that wild game,
especially doves, tastes gamy and they don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Dove breasts, grilled or fried, are one of God's chosen
favorites. The only thing you have to do is cook them.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two simple recipes that both start with filleted
breasts. Just run a sharp knife down either side of the breastbone
and turn it out along the rib cage. You'll have two nice fillets
from each bird.
</P>
<P>
   To grill them, use two fillets, wrapped in a piece of bacon and
held together by toothpicks. Purists place a slice of jalapeno
between the two breast fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Soak them in zesty Italian dressing for at least an hour, or
overnight if you can. Grill until the bacon begins to crisp and the
fillets are slightly firm to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   This can work as appetizers or a main course, and it will work
with wine or beer.
</P>
<P>
   Frying starts with the same breast fillets, soaked in milk or
butter milk for an hour. Dredge in seasoned flour and fry in a
quarter inch of oil in a cast iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Gravy is required.

 &HT;    Thanks to TPWD, the season is young
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Tradition is the foundation upon which hunting
is built.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting leases, guns and even secret places to hunt have been
passed down from one generation to the next, providing a continuity
that's rare in any other sport.
</P>
<P>
   But the changing face of America _ single-parent families,
urbanization, time demands from work and other leisure activities _
have cut into the tradition of youngsters following parents and
grandparents into the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been working to
reverse the downward trend by offering special youth hunting days
and supporting youth hunting activities in concert with other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there will be a special statewide youth-only season
for whitetails, turkey and quail on Oct. 28-29. Only youngsters 16
and younger may hunt during the special weekend. Check your local
county listings for bag and possession limits.
</P>
<P>
   The department also is sponsoring youth-only hunts for waterfowl
in the three duck zones in Texas: Oct. 14-15 in the High Plains
Mallard Management Unit, Oct. 21-22 in the North Zone and Oct.
21-22 or Dec. 2-3 in the South Zone. Federal rules allow youngsters
17 and younger to hunt waterfowl on the special days.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Wildlife also has special youth-only hunts on some of
its public hunting areas. Youngsters must have a valid hunting
license and a special hunting permit, as well as be accompanied by
a licensed adult. There are hunts for alligators, deer and
javelinas this year.
</P>
<P>
   For information on public hunting opportunities for youths,
contact the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department at (512) 389-4505.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the Texas Youth Hunting Association, sponsored by
the Texas Wildlife Association, provides a series of structured
hunts for youths throughout the year. For information, contact
Jerry Warden at (210) 930-2177.

 &HT;    Texas' smorgasbord is open year-round
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Throw in feral hogs and pigeons, and Texas
hunting is a year-round sport.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of us tend to think of seasons as starting with dove
hunting in late summer and ending with turkey hunting in spring.
For formal hunting periods, that's a long time, slightly more than
eight months altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is opportunity personified, really, since the number of
species and the length of seasons is unique to our state. Few
others can boast both species of deer, antelope, exotics, ducks and
geese, quail and doves, turkeys, woodcock, snipe, sandhill cranes,
javelinas and squirrels, to name more than a few. And those aren't
all the animals available.
</P>
<P>
   Things start with dove season, which opens Sept. 1 in the North
and Central zones of Texas. The South Zone season for doves will
open Sept. 22. North Zone hunters have through Oct. 30 to chase
doves. The Central Zone will close Oct. 17 and the South on Nov. 5.
The South and Central zones each have a shorter late season that
opens Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other season openings and closures include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Special teal only: Sept. 15-30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special white-winged dove area: Sept. 2-3, 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woodcock: Dec. 18-Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ White-tailed deer: Statewide, Nov. 4-Jan. 7; South Zone, Nov.
11-Jan. 21; special late season for spikes and does, Jan. 22-Feb.
4. Statewide archery, Sept. 30-Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mule deer: Panhandle, Nov. 18-Dec. 3; Trans-Pecos, Nov.
25-Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turkey: same as deer season in fall. Spring: North Zone, April
7-May 13; South Zone, March 31-May 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Squirrel: Most counties have no closed season. East Texas,
Oct. 1-Feb. 4 and May 1-31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ducks: North Zone, Oct. 28-29, Nov. 11-Jan. 21; South Zone,
Oct. 28-Nov. 26 and Dec. 8-Jan. 21; High Plains Mallard Management
Unit, Oct. 21-23 and Nov. 11-Jan. 21.

 &HT;    Texas' smorgasbord is open year-round
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Throw in feral hogs and pigeons, and Texas
hunting is a year-round sport.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of us tend to think of seasons as starting with dove
hunting in late summer and ending with turkey hunting in spring.
For formal hunting periods, that's a long time, slightly more than
eight months altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is opportunity personified, really, since the number of
species and the length of seasons is unique to our state. Few
others can boast both species of deer, antelope, exotics, ducks and
geese, quail and doves, turkeys, woodcock, snipe, sandhill cranes,
javelinas and squirrels, to name more than a few. And those aren't
all the animals available.
</P>
<P>
   Things start with dove season, which opens Sept. 1 in the North
and Central zones of Texas. The South Zone season for doves will
open Sept. 22. North Zone hunters have through Oct. 30 to chase
doves. The Central Zone will close Oct. 17 and the South on Nov. 5.
The South and Central zones each have a shorter late season that
opens Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other season openings and closures include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Special teal only: Sept. 15-30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special white-winged dove area: Sept. 2-3, 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woodcock: Dec. 18-Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ White-tailed deer: Statewide, Nov. 4-Jan. 7; South Zone, Nov.
11-Jan. 21; special late season for spikes and does, Jan. 22-Feb.
4. Statewide archery, Sept. 30-Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mule deer: Panhandle, Nov. 18-Dec. 3; Trans-Pecos, Nov.
25-Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turkey: same as deer season in fall. Spring: North Zone, April
7-May 13; South Zone, March 31-May 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Squirrel: Most counties have no closed season. East Texas,
Oct. 1-Feb. 4 and May 1-31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ducks: North Zone, Oct. 28-29, Nov. 11-Jan. 21; South Zone,
Oct. 28-Nov. 26 and Dec. 8-Jan. 21; High Plains Mallard Management

 &HT;    The Teal deal
 &HT;    By Mike Legget
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Teal don't play favorites.
</P>
<P>
   They'll make a fool of the guy with a $10,000 engraved 12 gauge,
just as easily as a poor boy with a single-shot .410. It doesn't
matter. But they'll always be there for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   If you want fast, they've got it. If you want plenty, teal are
your boys. If geography is important to you, teal are all over the
map.
</P>
<P>
   The special early teal season that Texans enjoy every September
is a wonderful opportunity to get in some early shooting at one of
nature's sportiest targets. This year's season runs Sept. 15-30,
with a daily bag limit of four birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a truckload of them this year,'' said
Vernon Bevill, migratory wildlife and wetland ecology program
director for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. ``We had the
biggest breeding population on record this year for bluewings, 7.4
million birds.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of teal that will migrate down through the Central
and Mississippi flyways and on into Mexico will probably be double
that number, Bevill said. Blue-winged teal travel south quite
early, and the special season is scheduled to allow hunters a
chance at the birds before they move through. Hunters will see a
few greenwings, but the majority of the bag will be bluewings.
</P>
<P>
   Texas hunters bag some 70,000 to 80,000 bluewings every year,
Bevill said. Nationwide, the numbers approach 1 million teal.
``There are actually more greenwings in the harvest each year, even
though there are only about one-third as many greenwings and
bluewings,'' Bevill said.
</P>
<P>
   The early teal season has a number of things going for it, not
the least of which is the accommodating nature of the birds. ``Teal
are easy to decoy,'' Bevill said. ``All you need is half a dozen
decoys, and you don't have to call them very much. If they can see
the decoys, they'll usually come in for a look.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-bird limit is reachable, even on days when not many
birds are flying. Bevill said Central Texas hunters can have
success on small lakes and tanks, especially if there are enough
hunters to cover several lakes in one area. ``That way you can keep
the birds moving from one lake to another and usually have enough
to shoot,'' he said. ``They are using lots of stock tanks all over
Texas, especially during the regular season. There are all kinds of
ducks on those tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought that has plagued much of the state has positive and
negative impacts on duck hunting, especially teal, Bevill said.
Coastal hunters with water likely will see quality hunting
throughout the season. Areas with food supplies also will be able
to attract enough teal for hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Panhandle has gotten a lot of water this year, and they
should have a great season,'' Bevill said. ``The later season we're
having this year could help because it will encourage people to
pump water during the season that will hold teal and also stay in
the ground long enough to help during the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in so-so hunting years, the early teal season remains a
good opportunity for hunters. ``Just go,'' Bevill said. ``It's an
opportunity that's underutilized for the most part. Only about 30
percent of the regular duck hunters hunt teal.''
</P>
<P>
   Equipment for hunting teal is simple; a few decoys and a
camouflage shirt work fine. You don't even need waders, but they
might help keep away some of the mosquitoes and fire ants. A head
net is a good way to fight mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Shotguns can be whatever you're comfortable with. Twelve and 20
gauges work equally well, and you can even get bismuth shot for
.410s if you're feeling tough. All shot must be steel or some other
approved non-toxic load.

 &HT;    White-winged doves are piling up frequent-flyer miles
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ White-winged doves are not the bird of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Once thought to be a bird limited by weather and constitution to
the Lower Rio Grande Valley, the whitewing has exhibited a unique
ability to find suitable living conditions almost anywhere. The
doves might be pushing out other species as they move, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all over Texas, other states, too,'' said Gary
Waggerman, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's whitewing
program director. ``We had one at a feeder in Newfoundland about a
month ago and in the winter of 1999 we had reports of birds at
feeders in Nebraska and Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're moving everything else out. In my opinion, they do,''
Waggerman said. ``We're trying to get a study going to look at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the good things, of course, about whitewings and their
current territorial expansion is that Texas dove hunters should
benefit. ``I think everybody's going to just about have to have a
whitewing stamp this year,'' Waggerman said. ``The only exception
would be in deep East Texas, and there are even some over there.''
</P>
<P>
   White-winged doves once lived almost exclusively in deep South
Texas and Mexico along the Rio Grande. They found nesting
conditions in the citrus groves of the valley to their liking.
However, following the 1983 freeze that killed most fruit trees,
the birds began to change their habits.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, Waggerman pointed out, there were more
whitewings living in San Antonio than in the Valley. They have only
continued to increase in numbers, as well as move northward into
cities such as Austin and Waco. ``We counted 799,000 in the city of
Austin this year,'' Waggerman said. ``We counted 507,000 in the Rio
Grande Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Waggerman thinks that San Antonio could boast a population in
excess of one million birds. And the doves are beginning to expand
outside the city limits, where more than 100,000 were counted in
one area.
</P>
<P>
   Waggerman pointed to another intruder showing up around Central
Texas, the Eurasian collared dove. The non-native dove was first
seen in Texas in 1997, but has rapidly established itself in every
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been seen in Van Horn and Dalhart,'' Waggerman said.
``Hunters should know that they are not a protected species at all,
just like a pigeon. You see them around grain elevators a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Austin and San Antonio are accustomed to seeing
whitewings at their back-yard feeders, where they seem to be more
aggressive about staking out territory than mourning doves. As they
expand outside city limits, the birds are more available to
hunters, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting white-winged doves is no different than hunting mourning
doves, though they might not be seen in the same areas. Whitewings
show up in feeding areas such as grain fields and often can be shot
when they're passing from feeding to watering areas. They are
larger than mourning doves and have a distinctive white wing patch
visible in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The limit is 15 birds per day outside the special white-winged
dove area in South Texas. In the special zone, the limit is 10
doves per day with no more than five mourning doves and two
white-tipped doves. Hunters who take white-winged doves must
possess the $7 whitewing stamp, which can be purchased along with
the regular Texas hunting license.

 UNDATED: their work.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These multimedia simulations differ radically from current
online offerings. ``When you look at online courses now, what do
you see?'' Schank said. ``Text online with a quiz. We're not taking
a lecture and putting it on screen. We're restructuring these
courses into goal-based scenarios that will get kids excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Schank says that such courses will render traditional classes _
and many professors _ obsolete. ``The idea of one professor for one
class is ancient,'' he said. ``New technology is going to give
every student access to the best professors in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But many academics dismiss Schank's prediction that traditional
teaching methods will soon become obsolete and question software
learning's pedagogic value. ``Education depends on relationships
between people,'' said David Noble, a history professor at York
University in Toronto and a critic of online learning.
``Interactive is not the same as interpersonal. What Schank doesn't
recognize is that teaching is not just about relaying knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Others warn against accepting radical new technology without
pause. ``The American university system is a highly functional
institution,'' said Phil Agre, an associate professor of
information studies at UCLA. ``The danger is that we will apply
overly simplistic ideas about technology and tear apart the
institution before we really know what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another assessment of the value of Schank's work is offered by
Prof. Howard Nusbaum, chairman of the psychology department at the
University of Chicago. ``Schank's idea in principal is a very sound
one,'' Professor Nusbaum said. ``But in the case of software
learning, its success or failure will depend on implementation more
than theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's top universities are experimenting with
ways to implement new technology-based teaching methods. Seymour
Papert, a professor and researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's Media Laboratory, was among the first to advocate
computers as teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing so fast that the concept of schools
teaching people what they need to know is no longer viable,''
Papert said. ``We're moving into a time when people need to know
how to learn things they weren't taught in school. Second, we now
have the technology to let kids learn better. This will not just
allow them to learn the same things better; it will teach kids to
learn radical new things at all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel Resnick, another professor at MIT's Media Laboratory,
said: ``Computers offer kids multiple ways to learn, where in the
past there was only one way. Ultimately, you want kids to have a
tool chest of different options they can bring to bear when solving
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But new technology also threatens to exacerbate current
inequities. Resnick worries that the so-called digital divide will
not be one of access to computers but a ``fluency gap'' between
those able to use them for learning and those who merely use them
to play games.
</P>
<P>
   Schank does not think his programs will be a victim of the
digital divide. He believes that poorer schools are likely to
benefit first from his programs. Top high schools ``don't want this
_ their kids get into Harvard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But poorer schools,'' he continued, ``aren't going to turn
down a college level software course that's endorsed by
Columbia.''.
</P>
<P>
   Schank pointed to the example of the Daniel Jenkins Academy, a
public high school in Polk County, Fla., a poor district that will
switch to online teaching this fall. Students will gather in
classrooms where they will take Web-based classes on computers.
They will be taught remotely by teachers working from their homes.
Schank suggested that once disadvantaged students began
outperforming those from better schools, many of the long-held
assumptions about teaching will go the way of the slide rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole country of people who agree on education, and
they're all wrong,'' he said with characteristic bluntness.
``School just isn't that relevant anymore. We'll make it relevant.
We're trying to overthrow the system.''

 &HT;    Mmm, mmm ...dove breasts (with gravy, of course)
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I hate to hear anyone say that wild game,
especially doves, tastes gamy and they don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Dove breasts, grilled or fried, are one of God's chosen
favorites. The only thing you have to do is cook them.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two simple recipes that both start with filleted
breasts. Just run a sharp knife down either side of the breastbone
and turn it out along the rib cage. You'll have two nice fillets
from each bird.
</P>
<P>
   To grill them, use two fillets, wrapped in a piece of bacon and
held together by toothpicks. Purists place a slice of jalapeno
between the two breast fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Soak them in zesty Italian dressing for at least an hour, or
overnight if you can. Grill until the bacon begins to crisp and the
fillets are slightly firm to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   This can work as appetizers or a main course, and it will work
with wine or beer.
</P>
<P>
   Frying starts with the same breast fillets, soaked in milk or
butter milk for an hour. Dredge in seasoned flour and fry in a
quarter inch of oil in a cast iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Gravy is required.

 &HT;    White-winged doves are piling up frequent-flyer miles

benefit. ``I think everybody's going to just about have to have a
whitewing stamp this year,'' Waggerman said. ``The only exception
would be in deep East Texas, and there are even some over there.''
</P>
<P>
   White-winged doves once lived almost exclusively in deep South
Texas and Mexico along the Rio Grande. They found nesting
conditions in the citrus groves of the valley to their liking.
However, following the 1983 freeze that killed most fruit trees,
the birds began to change their habits.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, Waggerman pointed out, there were more
whitewings living in San Antonio than in the Valley. They have only
continued to increase in numbers, as well as move northward into
cities such as Austin and Waco. ``We counted 799,000 in the city of
Austin this year,'' Waggerman said. ``We counted 507,000 in the Rio
Grande Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Waggerman thinks that San Antonio could boast a population in
excess of one million birds. And the doves are beginning to expand
outside the city limits, where more than 100,000 were counted in
one area.
</P>
<P>
   Waggerman pointed to another intruder showing up around Central
Texas, the Eurasian collared dove. The non-native dove was first
seen in Texas in 1997, but has rapidly established itself in every
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been seen in Van Horn and Dalhart,'' Waggerman said.
``Hunters should know that they are not a protected species at all,
just like a pigeon. You see them around grain elevators a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Austin and San Antonio are accustomed to seeing
whitewings at their back-yard feeders, where they seem to be more
aggressive about staking out territory than mourning doves. As they
expand outside city limits, the birds are more available to
hunters, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting white-winged doves is no different than hunting mourning
doves, though they might not be seen in the same areas. Whitewings
show up in feeding areas such as grain fields and often can be shot
when they're passing from feeding to watering areas. They are
larger than mourning doves and have a distinctive white wing patch
visible in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The limit is 15 birds per day outside the special white-winged
dove a listings for bag and possession limits.
</P>
<P>
   The department also is sponsoring youth-only hunts for waterfowl
in the three duck zones in Texas: Oct. 14-15 in the High Plains
Mallard Management Unit, Oct. 21-22 in the North Zone and Oct.
21-22 or Dec. 2-3 in the South Zone. Federal rules allow youngsters
17 and younger to hunt waterfowl on the special days.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Wildlife also has special youth-only hunts on some of
its public hunting areas. Youngsters must have a valid hunting
license and a special hunting permit, as well as be accompanied by
a licensed adult. There are hunts for alligators, deer and
javelinas this year.
</P>
<P>
   For information on public hunting opportunities for youths,
contact the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department at (512) 389-4505.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the Texas Youth Hunting Association, sponsored by
the Texas Wildlife Association, provides a series of structured
hunts for youths throughout the year. For information, contact
Jerry Warden at (210) 930-2177.

<P>
   On a recent Friday lunch hour in Kmart's underwear department in
Flushing Meadows, N.Y., in Queens County, it was obvious where the
action was. The aisles of billowy white panties were deserted. The
racks of hip-hugger briefs stood virtually untouched. But a
half-dozen women _ from chubby teen-agers in capri pants to
middle-aged moms pushing full carts of housewares _ were bravely
shopping where few women had, until recently, shopped before: the
thong section.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm liking this one,'' said Maria Mantalusa, 46, a nurse from
Kew Gardens, who was shopping with her niece Kim, 25. She held up a
baby blue thong with white stripes _ probably no more than three
square inches of fabric all told _ against her generous curvy hips.
The younger woman, whose array of thongs on little white plastic
hangers already weighed down her index finger, nodded
enthusiastically and said, ``You can't ever have enough of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it only three years ago that Monica Lewinsky shocked the
nation by flashing her thong at the president? Or just a few
seasons ago that the randy roommates on ``Friends'' traded
reproving quips about thongs, comparing them to dental floss? Could
that be the thumping bass of Sisqo's ``Thong Song'' _ a
chart-topper since March _ piped through the sound system at the
local mall?
</P>
<P>
   Once the sole province of pubescent underwear models and Rio de
Janeiro beach bunnies, thongs, it seems, have made it into the
mainstream. Sisqo's racy video aside, the thong is going from a
flag of sexual provocation to a common item in the lingerie drawer
of even modest women.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret sold nearly 20 million thongs in 1999. Thongs
and their even briefer counterpart, the G-string, now account for
40 percent of the underpants sold by the chain. Five years ago, it
was only 10 percent. Even at Macy's, where the average shopper is
older _ in her 30's and 40's _ thongs make up 20 percent of the
total sales for women's underpants, said Carolyn Moss, director of
ready-to-wear. That is a 100-percent rise in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds unbelievable, but thongs have become the core
of our business,'' said Monica Mitro, a spokeswoman for Victoria's
Secret. ``And it cuts across ages and body types.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular style is a ``dressy'' black satiny polyester,
Mitro said, but the second favorite is white cotton. Victoria's
Secret is increasingly offering thongs in casual everyday styles,
like polka dots and lily pad green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it was the bolder girls who wore thongs,'' Mitro said.
``Now, that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising that a style so revealing _ and according
to some, so uncomfortable _ would catch on in a population that on
average has never been older or fatter. Bathing suit manufacturers
attempted to import thong bikinis from Brazil a few years ago, but
the trend fell flat. Women felt a thong was too revealing to wear
in public. Yet, they began taking to them in private, wearing them
under clothes, lured by their practicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways you can trace the culture through its taste in
women's undergarments,'' the fashion historian Valerie Steele said.
``What is sexy or practical changes in pretty dramatic ways as the
mores change.'' Just as confining panty girdles expressed the
repression of the 1950s and navel-baring bikini briefs seemed to
epitomize the newfound sexual freedom of the 1960s and 70s, the
dawn of the 21st century, when sex is numbingly omnipresent, is a
time when underwear is threatening to disappear entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, as Steele notes, is that society's attitude toward
underwear has come full circle. Until the 1860's, well-bred women
didn't wear underpants at all, opting instead for slips and
corsets. ``To wear underwear was scandalous _ only courtesans wore
bloomers,'' she said. ``It was considered a sign of looseness.''
</P>
<P>
   Only with the introduction of the hoop skirt were underpants
invented, as a necessity due to the skirt's precarious construction
(after, say, a slip on the ice, the stiff hoop could send a
Victorian lady's skirt sailing over her head). ``Now, after nearly
150 years of fetishizing underwear,'' Steele said, ``fashion seems
to be dictating that it be invisible again.''

   Some of the thong's popularity can be attributed to changes in
the clothing designed to cover it. Hemlines may have been long in
recent seasons, but garments have, paradoxically, become more
revealing. Innovations in fabrics _ Lycra and new stretch
synthetics _ have tempted designers to make almost every article of
clothing clingy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even bother to try any of those on without the right
underwear,'' a saleswoman advised a reporter touring Bloomingdale's
to check out the racks of clothes shot through with stretch fibers.
``It'll just ruin your day.'' . Designers from Stephen Tyler to
Kmart's own Kathy Ireland have also slashed and cut skirts and
pants to reveal skin in unlikely places, with daring slits, and
slacks that lace up to show patches of flesh to the thigh. ``You
can trace the huge rise in thong sales directly to the rise in
body-conscious clothing,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   The fashionista pronouncement against pantyhose in recent
seasons has also been a boon to the thong business. Last winter,
fashion magazines counseled bare legs, form-fitting skirts and
stiletto sling-backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I started to wear thongs,'' said Kathy Irise, a
model, who was shopping last week at La Petite Coquette, a lingerie
store in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers attribute the uptick in thong sales to new ``intimate
fabrics'' that make them more comfortable. Mitro said sales of
whisper-thin microfiber thongs had been especially vigorous
recently. ``They're so comfortable that you actually don't want to
run and take them off as soon as you get home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case just a few years ago. Back in 1998, when
Shoshanna Lonstein went from being Jerry Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend
to a fashion designer, her first line of frocks came with a pouch
containing a matching hip-hugger thong.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was well received, but the thongs themselves ``were
incredibly uncomfortable,'' she admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of thongs is not merely a matter of
practicality, it's a mark of the cultural climate. Even though
thong underwear covered by clothes may be not be as racy as a thong
bikini worn at the beach, it does show ``a certain confidence,''
said Bobbi Queen, the innerwear editor at Women's Wear Daily.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests that an increased interest in sports and fitness
among women may mean some are prouder of their derrieres.
</P>
<P>
   The thong also got a verifiable lift from Lewinsky. The tale of
how she flashed her waistband at Bill Clinton was interpreted by
the public as a symbol of sophomoric sexuality and bad judgment,
but for some plus-size women it was heard as a rallying cry against
the anorexic aesthetic of fashion magazines. ``If Monica can do it,
I figure I can,'' said Mantalusa, the nurse from Queens. ``I may
not be a model, but I'll bet I have a better behind than she
does.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years the issue of reparations has exploded among
nations wrestling with the past. Scholars are beginning to see the
German payout of $60 billion to Jewish victims of the Holocaust,
the U.S. decision to pay reparations to Japanese-Americans who were
interned during World War II and even Japan's awkward efforts to
settle with Korean ``comfort women'' as bedrocks of a new political
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Elazar Barkan, the chairman of the cultural studies department
at Claremont Graduate University in California, contends that since
the end of the Cold War, the West has in particular entered a
neo-Enlightenment period of political morality in which restitution
increasingly plays a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Political language has shifted, he writes in ``The Guilt of
Nations''(W.W. Norton), from machtpolitik, the politics of power,
to a shared belief among nations in the rights of individuals and
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Consent and cooperation have become the buzzwords of global
relations, Barkan says, and agreement is now being achieved through
negotiation rather than force. ``Certainly the eagerness of leaders
_ Clinton, Blair, Chirac, the pope _ to atone has been mocked,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``But there is a growing sense that
you have to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In this new era, Barkan and others argue, the issue of American
reparations because of slavery _ straitjacketed for decades in a
kind of intellectual bedlam _ is beginning to look sane.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long it was just ludicrous for black folk to even bring
up the notion that they might be entitled to some just
compensation,'' said Michael Eric Dyson, the Ida B. Wells Barnett
professor of religious studies at De Paul University in Chicago.
``It was simply crazy.'' But after so many successful reparation
campaigns, including those for economic and cultural restitution to
various American Indian tribes, the African-American case has
gained momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since 1989, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., has sponsored
a bill to establish a commission to study reparations for slavery.
It remains stuck in committee, but away from Capitol Hill other
developments are having a significant impact on the national
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Black intellectuals like Randall Robinson, the president of
TransAfrica, a lobbying group, and the author of ``The Debt: What
America Owes to Blacks,'' and the Harvard University professors
Charles T. Ogletree and Henry Louis Gates Jr. have publicly
supported reparations.
</P>
<P>
   Individual cities and towns are confronting their racist pasts:
some, like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Dallas, support federal
hearings on reparations, while others, like Tulsa, Okla., Rosewood,
Fla., and Elaine, Ark., either are considering or are paying
monetary damages for past atrocities. As Dyson explains,
``African-Americans themselves are beginning to be politicized
around this debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkan writes that slavery remains ``the most glaring example of
an unaddressed historical injustice in the United States.'' He adds
that this ``stands in direct contrast with the public culture that
embraces the concept of attempting to redress its imperfect past.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of reparations commonly argue that other examples
of past imperfection are redressable in ways that slavery is not.
In the case of the Japanese-Americans, the victims themselves were
compensated for quantifiable, provable suffering at the hands of an
identifiable perpetrator, the U.S. government. With the descendants
of slaves, this argument goes, the situation is entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   It is, first of all, said to be impossible to determine the
actual present-day effect of slavery _ to trace the impact of
slavery on, for example, today's overwhelming incarceration rate
among black men, or to calculate all those generations of lost or
artificially depressed wages. Not to mention the quagmire of
determining who should be compensated. All blacks? Only those who
demonstrate direct linkage to a slave? Should those of mixed race
be included? What about Oprah?
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of reparations find this line of argument irrelevant.
``The way I look at historical crimes or historical injustices is:
Do the victims still suffer, whether it is the victim or the
victim's descendants?'' Barkan says. ``Another issue that's been
raised is: `Why should I pay for it? I didn't do it.' It is a
foolish argument. No one is responsible personally for any
wrongdoing. But just to stop the action doesn't mean to have paid
for the past. The perpetrator is very clear. It's the identity of
the U.S. The U.S. as an entity is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott L. Malcomson, the author of the forthcoming ``One Drop of
Blood: The American Misadventure of Race'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux) points out that whites have been distancing themselves from
moral culpability for slavery since as far back as the
Revolutionary period. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, argued that
it was the British who were to blame. Even so, many abolitionists
at the time supported their own form of reparations: the
establishment of a colony in Africa for freed slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barkan writes in ``The Guilt of Nations'' that national
identity is a result of history, ``for better and for worse,'' and
that therefore we ``should pay our historical debts,'' Wendy
Kaminer, a fellow at the Radcliffe Public Policy Center, recently
argued the opposite point. Writing in American Prospect magazine,
she said that the campaign for reparations ``reflects some of the
premises of the aristocracy it attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``It allows the past to define our entitlements
in the present; it relies on a belief in the justice of
inheritance. ... If equality is a birthright, you don't have to
purchase it with the sufferings of your ancestors, any more than
you should be able to purchase privileges with your ancestors'
achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, how the past should be used is at the crux of the
debate. Ian Buruma, who has written extensively about the legacies
of World War II, contends that the quest for reparations tends to
mire the petitioners in the very victimization for which they seek
payment, as well as encouraging a never-ending flood of
restitution-seekers. ``If every group that feels a historical wrong
wants compensation, how far back do you go?'' he asked in an
interview. ``It becomes problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   As ethnic groups in the United States and elsewhere have
assimilated, Buruma went on, they have tended to replace their
cultural identities with the residue of past discrimination. This
leads, in his view, to resentment, which undermines the possibility
of mutual understanding between groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of identifying as an American entitled to freedoms and
rights and all men created equal,'' he said of African-Americans
seeking reparations, ``you are born into an aggrieved group
deserving compensation. Then that's your whole identity and you can
never get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the argument against reparations is simply that any
kind of compensation would be a wholly inappropriate and inadequate
recompense, not just for slavery but also for the entire array of
racial injustices that trailed in slavery's wake.
</P>
<P>
   As the sociologist Glenn C. Loury wrote recently in The New York
Times: ``Who can say what the out-of-wedlock birth rate for blacks
would be, absent chattel slavery? How does one calculate the cost
of inner-city ghettos, of poor education, of the stigma of
perceived racial inferiority? The severity of slavery's `injury' is
far more profound than any cash transfer will be able to reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   But for proponents, the word ``reparations'' can cover a host of
interventions, from cash payments _ the current equivalent of, say,
40 acres and a mule _ to a direct, official apology from the
president. Some argue that affirmative action policies already in
place should be considered sufficient, though Barkan responds that
affirmative action aims at fixing present injustices rather than
compensating for past ones.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Ogletree, among others, have suggested that
reparations be used to finance social and economic development
programs for the benefit of all black Americans. In another
development, a lawyer named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann is compiling
evidence for lawsuits against a dozen companies that she says
demonstrably benefited from the slave trade. Among them are
Providence Bank, a precursor of FleetBoston Financial Corp., and
Aetna Insurance Co. of Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, many proponents of reparations see the issue
as a moral one that cannot be dismissed because the practicalities
seem byzantine at the moment. ``I think it's part of the social
contract of justice in America,'' Dyson said, ``that if black
people have done what they've done and have been treated the way
they've been treated, then they deserve what they deserve. And we
can argue about what that desert should look like, but it ain't
come yet.''

REQUEST TO NCAA THROWS LIMELIGHT ON EFFORT TO CHANGE GEORGIA'S
FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A quiet effort to negotiate a new state flag for
Georgia that eliminates its Confederate symbol has suddenly become
very public, after a leading civil rights organization asked the
National Collegiate Athletic Association to move its planned
basketball championships from Atlanta if the flag is not changed.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Thursday, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, which was founded by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., asked the NCAA to move the 2002 and 2007 Men's Final Four and
the 2003 Women's Final Four from Atlanta if the flag is not
redesigned by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA executive committee met Friday in Indianapolis and took
no action on the request, but issued a statement criticizing any
official symbol that ``conveys discrimination and racism,'' and
urging more discussion of the issue. Charles Wethington, president
of the University of Kentucky and chairman of the committee, said
the organization would watch the issue closely because it is
concerned about the welfare of student athletes who travel to
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the Georgia flag consists of the Confederate flag
, placed there by the state Legislature in 1956, two years after
school segregation was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. Many
historians believe the flag was changed as an act of defiance
against federal civil rights legislation, and the city of Atlanta
refuses to fly it on official buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Christian Leadership Conference's request, signed
by its president, Martin Luther King III, surprised several black
elected officials who said they hoped to change the flag's design
in the next session of the Georgia Legislature, which begins in
January. Many who want a new flag are hoping to change the minds of
opponents without the kind of boycott that polarized a similar
recent debate in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to have more dialogue than action at this time,''
said Calvin Smyre, chairman of the Democratic caucus of the Georgia
House of Representatives and a prominent black legislator. ``At the
appropriate time, external pressure may be the right course of
action, but right now we need to have some internal political
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyre, a life member of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, said he was not criticizing the organization, but was
surprised by its action.
</P>
<P>
   Many white state legislators, both Democratic and Republican,
and particularly from rural areas, have said they fear that if they
agree to change the flag, they will be turned out of office. Even
Gov. Roy Barnes said recently that the state is not ready for a new
flag yet, and has not publicly advocated a new one.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of a new flag say that the time for change may
come soon after a new Legislature is elected in November, because
it will be two years before another election, by which time voter
anger may have faded. As a result, talk of a boycott has been muted
in the hope that white legislators would not feel pressured. An
boycott of South Carolina by the NAACP angered many lawmakers, but
ultimately the Legislature there voted to remove the Confederate
flag from the statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   King did not return phone calls Friday. In his letter to the
NCAA, he said that the boycott of South Carolina was a ``key factor
for change,'' and noted that his organization had canceled its
convention there last year. Without being specific, he said his
organization has now initiated a campaign to remove the Confederate
symbol from the Georgia flag.

   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories _ Sidewalk pennants that
proclaim Yellowknife the ``Diamond Capital of North America'' help
explain why Canadians are working to ensure that their baubles are
not confused with the ``blood diamonds'' of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clean, upfront business,'' Stephen Kakfwi, the
provincial premier, said in an interview, throwing diplomatic
subtleties to the Arctic winds. ``You don't have to go through the
jungles of Angola or Sierra Leone, dealing with guerrillas and
dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   In the largest industrial project above North America's tree
line, Ekati Mine opened almost 200 miles northeast of here two
years ago and now produces about $1.3 million worth of diamonds a
day, or 5 percent of the world production. When two other mines
start producing nearby, by 2005, the Northwest Territories is
expected to produce as much as 15 percent of the world's diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The only large producer in the Americas, Canada will then join
the ranks of the world's top diamond producers, which include
Botswana, Russia, South Africa and Angola. With this future
glittering on the horizon, like a mineral aurora borealis, Canadian
officials are acting to protect the future image of diamonds, in
contrast to the trafficking in uncut stones that helps to pay for
guerrilla armies in Sierra Leone and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do otherwise would be to court commercial catastrophe,''
Canada's ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Fowler, told the
World Diamond Congress, an industry group, in a speech in Belgium
last month. ``In Canada in the 1970s, we watched our fur industry
_the business upon which our country was founded _destroyed by a
small number of very shrill and very effective animal rights
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Indian families have yet to recover income lost when
consumer resistance to fur coats wiped out in a few years a
tradition of commercial trapping that dated back to the 1700s, and
a potential consumer backlash against diamonds strikes fear in the
Northwest Territories, a vast wilderness larger than Texas and
California combined, but with a population of only 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kakfwi, the premier, who is a member of the Dene tribe,
estimated that the portion of his people making a living from
trapping has plunged, to five percent today, from 65 percent a
quarter century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Irving, the territorial director of diamond projects,
said, ``We have been through it with fur, and we don't want to go
through it with diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``If the issues with conflict diamonds don't get
solved, the consumer is not going to be able to differentiate
between the different kinds of diamonds, and is going to be against
diamonds, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are developing a technology
that would ``fingerprint'' diamonds, identifying them by trace
impurities that could be tracked to known mines.
</P>
<P>
   To promote Canada's Arctic diamonds, the Territorial government
now provides certificates to show that the diamonds were mined and
cut in the Northwest Territories. One cutting and polishing company
working here, Sirius Diamonds, now etches with a laser a tiny polar
bear on each diamond. Other Canadian cutters use as their brands a
maple leaf and a snow goose.
</P>
<P>
   And Canadians are actively involved in the crackdown on diamonds
from war-torn areas. Fowler chairs a U.N. committee that is
investigating violations of an embargo on the purchase of diamonds
from Angolan rebels. Ralph Hazleton, a Canadian diamond expert,
recently testified at the United Nations about Liberia and Burkina
Faso buying diamonds from Sierra Leone guerrillas in violation of a
second embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to images of war associated with West African
diamonds, Irving said that Canadian marketers want to associate
Arctic diamonds ``with images of the north _ ice, clean, pristine,
crystal clear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To provide jobs, the Territorial government has insisted that
diamond mines market at least 10 percent of their raw diamonds
locally.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Sirius and two other cutting and polishing
companies have opened here, with the cutting skills largely coming
from Antwerp, Belgium. In future years, billions of dollars of
diamond mining investments are expected. Today, mining projects are
underway for only 12 out of the Territory's estimated 325
kimberlite pipes, the funnel shaped veins of diamond-bearing rock
associated with ancient volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   From London, DeBeers Consolidated Mines, the company that
controls about two thirds of the world trade in uncut diamonds, is
suddenly focusing its investing telescope on this laid back
frontier town of 18,000 people. Since late June, DeBeers has
invested in one company prospecting for diamonds in the Northwest
Territories, and has begun a hostile takeover bid for a second
company that is about four years from production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be an international diamond center, a place where
Israelis, where people from New York will come to secure their
diamonds,'' said Kakfwi. That will be a stretch for a territory
whose sole air links are daily flights to Edmonton, Alberta.

BELIEFS: JEWISH VIEWS ON CHURCH AND STATE ARE COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Corrects ``Harvard'' to ``Brandeis University'' in 5th
graf.) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While many American Jews waxed enthusiastic about the vice
presidential candidacy of Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman, more
than a few have also raised eyebrows at his very public expressions
of religious faith and his advocacy of a closer partnership between
government and religion.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews have long been among the strongest supporters of
strict separation of church and state. That has not changed, a new
study indicates, despite talk of growing Jewish disenchantment with
liberalism and growing popularity of Jewish religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also shows the complexity of Jewish views,
including large gaps between the Jewish public and Jewish
leadership, and indicates that Jewish leaders appear simultaneously
to insist on strict separation of church and state and to defend
the involvement of organized religion in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish strict separationism dates only from the 20th century.
Before that, Jews were generally willing to work within the
prevailing assumption that government should be supportive of
religion rather than neutral toward it. Jews simply demanded that
Judaism receive the same benevolence and privileges as
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish attitudes changed, according to Jonathan Sarna, professor
of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, when prominent
Christian churchmen (perhaps feeling their world imperiled by mass
immigration, industrialization and urbanization) began campaigning
to have the United States explicitly declared a Christian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jews reacted by allying themselves with nonreligious secularists
in a struggle to make public schools and other government
undertakings religiously neutral.
</P>
<P>
   This background is mentioned in a new survey conducted for the
Center for Jewish Community Studies in Philadelphia. It is part of
a larger research project on ``Jews and the American Public
Square,'' which in turn is part of a cluster of studies financed by
the Pew Charitable Trusts of major religious groups and American
civic life.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to detect any recent changes in Jewish views on church
and state, the survey compared three groups: a representative
sample of American Jews, a representative sample of non-Jewish
Americans that mirrored the Jewish sample in educational level and
geographic distribution, and a sample of Jewish leaders taken from
participants in the annual conference of the Jewish Council for
Public Affairs, a prominent Jewish communal defense agency.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding issues like religion in public schools, government aid
or vouchers for religious schools, and the display of Christmas
mangers or Hanukkah candles on government property, the study found
that American Jews remain firmly separationist. And their leaders
are even more so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 59 percent of the non-Jewish Americans in the study
favored allowing nondenominational prayers to be read in public
school classrooms. By contrast, only 20 percent of the Jewish
public favored allowing such prayers, and for Jewish leaders the
figure was 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish leaders' even stricter separationism cannot be
attributed to secularity. On virtually every measure of religiosity
or involvement in organized Jewish life, the leaders outscored the
general Jewish public. They light Sabbath candles, fast on Yom
Kippur, attend synagogues, visit Israel, pursue Jewish education,
and attest to the importance of Judaism in their lives at
significantly higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   At one fascinating point in the survey, this pattern suddenly
shifts into reverse. Asked whether ``belonging to a church or
synagogue makes one a more aware and engaged citizen,'' the Jewish
leaders are more apt to say yes than the Jewish public, and
virtually as likely as the parallel sample of non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the clergy can discuss political candidates or
issues from the pulpit, twice as many Jewish leaders as members of
the Jewish public say yes (73 percent to 35 percent), and more Jews
say yes than do their non-Jewish counterparts (35 percent to 30
percent). Half of the Jewish leaders defended the anti-abortion
movement's right to use religion in making its case, whereas 42
percent of the non-Jewish counterparts did and 15 percent of the
Jewish public.
</P>
<P>
   On the statement ``Churches and synagogues should keep out of
political matters,'' 44 percent of the Jewish public agreed, as did
36 percent of the non-Jewish counterparts _ but only 14 percent of
the Jewish leaders did.
</P>
<P>
   The survey presents an overall ``index of support for church
involvement in politics,'' giving the non-Jewish counterparts a
ranking of 49 percent, the Jewish public 46 percent, and the Jewish
leaders 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for this combination of strict separationism with a
defense of religious involvement in politics are not hard to come
by. Jewish leaders' commitment to freedom of speech or religion
would suffice, and then there is plain self-interest. To some
extent, they are simply defending their own role in public policy
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey reveals some curious anomalies. Fewer than one
of every five Jewish leaders agree that ``Democracy in the U.S.
works better if Americans are religious,'' and scarcely more than
one of 10 rank-and-file Jews agree Only 20 percent of the leaders
agree that ``The influence of religion in American life should
increase,'' and only 30 percent of the Jewish public hold this
view.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Cohen of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, who
designed and oversaw the survey, offers this interpretation. Jewish
leaders ``are, indeed, more committed than the Jewish public to the
right of religious institutions and leaders to engage in public
life and discourse,'' but like the Jewish public, the ``leaders are
unhappy with the actual exercise of that right.''
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that the explanation is not so logical, that
in-depth interviews would show different phrases conjuring up
different images in the minds of the survey's respondents. When
asked whether they are ``pleased when political leaders publicly
affirm their belief in God,'' Jews are far more likely to think of
a Christian political leader than, say, Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder only 22 percent of the Jewish leaders and 30 percent
of the Jewish public said yes, compared with 70 percent of the
non-Jewish counterparts.

BUSH CALLS ON GORE TO DENOUNCE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Gov. George W. Bush called on Vice President Al
Gore on Friday to emphatically state his disapproval of President
Clinton's sexual conduct in office and to send Americans a clear
message that he would maintain a high level of integrity if elected
to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has pledged ``to restore honor and dignity'' to the
White House, conceded that Gore could accomplish the same task. But
he said that Gore first needed to signal his intent to do so and to
acknowledge that Clinton had done the country damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's got a problem with what went on in the past, he ought
to explain what it is,'' Bush said aboard his campaign plane as he
flew here from Sacramento, Calif., during a four-day campaign swing
through states on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that if Gore was determined to govern with a set
of scruples different from Clinton's, ``he ought to say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were clearly related to Clinton's affair with a
White House intern, a subject that reporters had broached. But a
few more strongly worded remarks that had come just a bit earlier
in the conversation with reporters on his campaign plane Friday
morning also seemed to touch on the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore has got differences with the president, he ought to
say them loud and clear,'' Bush said, referring in part to a
published interview in which Gore stated that he wanted to give the
country ``a fresh start.'' ``He ought to let us know where he
differed from the president, on policy matters as well as
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-minute conversation, which came on the heels of an appeal
by Clinton on Thursday that voters not let whatever misdeeds he
committed affect their judgments about Gore, was noteworthy for
several reasons. In saying that Gore was also capable of bringing a
renewed dignity to the White House, Bush seemed to undercut a
principal argument for his own candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the conversation also reflected and distilled Bush's
continuing attempts to have it several ways in his campaign,
especially when it comes to the topics of Clinton's affair and
Gore's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, insisted
that this race was about the future, as he often has. ``This is a
campaign that is going to be writing new chapters in the 21st
century,'' he said. ``We're moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bush once again summoned the specter of
Clinton's past, which he clearly sees as a useful wedge against
Gore, his Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's delicate and sometimes awkward attempt to straddle this
contradiction was evident when he quibbled with reporters who noted
that he and his advisers had frequently said he would ``restore
honor'' to the Oval Office, a clear assertion that this virtue had
been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered Friday that his standard pledge, at the end of
almost every stump speech, was not to restore but ``to uphold the
honor and integrity'' of the presidency. He did not acknowledge the
occasional use of the other, more loaded phrase or the fact that
both he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, have at times in the
last two weeks added the word ``decency'' to the list of qualities
that the next occupant of the White House should possess.
</P>
<P>
   The semantic squabbling took an even odder turn when Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, who had stood beside Bush on the plane,
introduced him at a subsequent rally here. McCain opened his
remarks by saying that Bush would ``restore dignity, honor and
respect to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been doing his own balancing act, trying to associate
himself with the prosperity of the Clinton era but not with
Clinton's personal behavior. He rarely makes reference to Clinton's
affair, but he has condemned the president's behavior on a few
occasions, once branding it ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said that Bush should talk
about his plans, not Clinton's past, and that Bush was ``only
offering Americans a rear-view-mirror vision for the country's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has vowed time and again to run a positive and upbeat
campaign, said on his plane that he was simply noting an important
reality. ``The president embarrassed the nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that American voters sought some reassurance that
the next president understood that and wanted to fix it.
``Unfortunately, in this point in history, it's a pledge that those
of us running for office must make and should keep,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   When one reporter noted to Bush that many Democrats, along with
Republicans, had publicly blamed Clinton for dishonoring the
presidency, Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the
Bush campaign, interjected, ``Joe Lieberman said that, and Al Gore
did not.'' She was referring to Gore's running mate, the
Connecticut senator.
</P>
<P>
   When another reporter asked Bush if Gore could be an agent of
the reassurance that voters needed, Bush said, ``I think he can. He
ought to say so.''

OIL PRICES FALLING? DON'T COUNT ON IT, SAYS A WALL ST. EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a sharp run-up, which helped put gasoline back onto front
pages in the spring after a long absence, oil prices have subsided
and politicians rail no longer about supposed industry gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem unshaken in thinking oil prices can only slide
further, following the pattern traced after the 1973-74 Arab
embargo, the 1979-82 period that included revolution in Iran, and
the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles T. Maxwell, regarded as the dean of Wall Street's
oil analysts, contends that things are different now. Maxwell, with
Weeden &AMP; Co., made the case on Thursday for his against-the-grain
view. Here are excerpts from the conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're predicting that oil will average $24 a barrel through
2003 in contrast to a Wall Street consensus that it will return to
$18 to $20 within the next year or two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Excess world capacity, what could quickly be brought
into production, has ranged between about 7 and 10 percent over the
last 50 years. It reached 18 percent in 1986, when prices
collapsed. Today it's around 5 percent, and we need 2 to 2{ percent
as a cushion against emergency, such as weather or strikes. So we
are as tight now as I have seen in my 44 years studying the
industry. It's not political maneuvering by OPEC _ the oil
physically isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is this a result of reduced supply or higher demand?
</P>
<P>
   A. Both. Low prices until recently not only created
disincentives to invest, but they've also limited the capital
available to invest because earnings collapsed. And then demand
rebounded in the Far East and Europe, and we've got unprecedented
prosperity in America.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But profits are now pretty robust, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. It takes as much as four years from the time a major
development project gets approved to the time when oil begins to
flow. Besides, national oil companies in Venezuela and elsewhere
must compete for budget money, and the Exxon Mobils of the world
are sensitive to stockholder values and their own options. Every
dollar they put into buying back shares because they're cheap is a
dollar that doesn't go into the drill bit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the tight market what caused the price of gasoline to jump
recently, to as much as $2.50 a gallon in the Midwest?
</P>
<P>
   A. It may have been a modest contributor, but what happened
there was basically an environmental issue _ making reformulated
gasoline. They brought supplies from other areas, and the problem
quickly dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So will the government investigation prove to be fruitless? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No investigation we've had yet has found a conspiracy of the
oil companies. I'm not going to say there weren't individual
operators or terminals that were gouging. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If profits are good and you think oil will stay above $20,
why are most industry stocks, except for the oil-field service and
exploration companies, in the dumps? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Investors have ``learned'' from experience that a high price
elicits an investment cycle, which creates an expanded supply,
which drops the price quickly and leaves them hanging. And while I
think the process this time will be gradual, irregular and
stretched out, the business is regarded as more cyclical than 20
years ago, when people saw growth in it.
</P>
<P>
   As the price of oil holds in the mid-20s, I expect people to
realize what good value these stocks are. The stocks have suffered
from being ``old economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Hasn't Chevron, for one, been bragging about becoming a
high-tech company? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's be serious. They're going to do a little Internet
purchasing, but I think it's laughable. When Internet P/Es get low
enough, they won't even mention it again.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the industry continue to consolidate? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The game's not over. Chevron probably won't merge, but Texaco
is likely, with Royal Dutch the most logical candidate. Conoco,
Amerada Hess and Phillips would be perfect for takeover. Phillips,
which doubled reserves when it bought ARCO's Alaskan assets, is
most appealing, selling for 9 times earnings, compared with 15{ for
its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do oil companies stand to gain if George W. Bush and Dick
Cheney, both of whom worked in the industry, win in November?
</P>
<P>
   A. When push comes to shove, the parties would make geopolitical
decisions about such things as imports and subsidies pretty much
the same way. But Bush's would be a looser environmental policy, on
offshore drilling, say, than Gore's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did Cheney do as chairman of Halliburton, whose stock has
a P/E of 65 and has jumped 30 percent this year? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't call him a brilliant businessman, but he did a
workmanlike job organizing the company, putting a face on it and
winning business. He certainly met the expectations of the people
who put him in.

 &HT;    Resilient Holyfield says he's `driven by love'
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Be they matters of the heart or of the fist, Evander
Holyfield gets knocked down, picks himself up and bulls in for
more.
</P>
<P>
   An admitted two-time loser at marriage, he vows to exchange vows
again someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, I make it difficult on myself. I just need to
be a little patient, give it a little more time,'' Holyfield, who
acknowledges his hasty decision to wed for the second time led to
divorce this year, said recently in training camp before arriving
in a city known for its ubiquitous wedding chapels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I'm going to have a (third) wife. I will not quit
till I hit a home run. I will never give up until somebody runs
around the bases with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who normally accepts questions head-on, is coy about
any current relationship. He has turned gun-shy since his marital
split was played out in the media and disclosures that he has borne
out-of-wedlock children, staining an otherwise saintly reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But he volunteered his dream to say ``I do'' once again and even
discussed adding to his brood after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be responsible for someone, and someone to be
responsible for me,'' Holyfield said. ``I want to take care of
someone, and want someone to take care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   He grinned. ``I'm driven by love.''
</P>
<P>
   The only ring, presumably, on Holyfield's mind today is the
large, square one in which he will work against John Ruiz. Only a
four-time fight loser (he admits but to two, with the others blamed
on the judges) in 16 remarkable years of dueling for dollars,
Atlanta's indomitable boxer and incurable romantic is back for his
first bout in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The setting, appropriately, is a re-creation of the world's
capital of romance _ the Paris Hotel and Casino, complete with
soaring faux Eiffel Tower. The fighters will dance about the ring
in a ballroom with 9,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonjour, monsieur,'' Holyfield said, tapping his limited
retention of the language from a French high school class.
``Comment t'allez vous?''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, in fact, is doing quite well. Oblivious to the
possibility that his next bout could be his last, he exudes
confidence that the three major heavyweight belts will return to
his closet.
</P>
<P>
   Only the WBA's is for the taking tonight. Lennox Lewis has the
others. With so many cross-currents flowing through the heavyweight
division, keeping logical opponents apart, there is no telling when
_ or if, even _ Holyfield will get a chance to gather them all up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, two months from his 38th birthday, Holyfield insists he
will hang around as long as it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue,'' he said, ``until I'm the undisputed
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Reclaiming the WBA wing of the heavyweight class would make
Holyfield a champ for the fourth time. From one angle, it can be
viewed as a dubious honor because it means he has been deposed on
three occasions. Unbeatable fighters, by definition, are champions
but once.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's situation certifies his peerless resilience. ``A
setback,'' said his manager, Jim Thomas, ``is nothing but an
opportunity for a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was not always one to eagerly dust himself off and
return to battle. He recalled his first taste of defeat at age 11
as if it were asparagus. One Cecil Collins was Holyfield's first
foe to punch back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, he hit me,'' little Evander whined in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to boxing,'' said the coach, patting him on his
scrawny chest.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield charged out and tackled Collins, resulting in
disqualification. He ran home, embarrassed, and announced his
retirement. This time, only his mother heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't quit,'' she scolded. ``Go back in there.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent tournament, Holyfield crossed his fingers and
hoped Collins had not entered. No such luck. Before their rematch,
Holyfield cried and prayed aloud for divine assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, he's calling Jesus,'' a friend said that day. ``He must be
scared.''

   As a pro, he has uttered the R-word to the world in the
aftermath of a loss but would unretire after the self-inflicted

THE POLITICS OF TIMBER ENGULFS WESTERN BLAZES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., N.M., Idaho)   By DOUGLAS JEHL with ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With wildfires still burning out of control across
a dozen Western states in what may be the worst fire season in a
generation, a fierce debate in timber politics has begun to rage
over who may be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Fire experts have warned for years that combustible material had
accumulated in Western forests to dangerous levels. But federal
agencies did not begin to address the problem until a policy shift
in 1995, and conservative critics _ including the Republican
governor of Montana _ were arguing Friday that, even afterward, the
administration did not move fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration didn't cause these fires, but their
policies have left the Forest Service underfunded and underprepared
for this crisis,'' Gov. Marc Racicot said in an interview. ``I
don't think it's a conspiracy, but it's a philosophy they have that
leads to explosive fires that destroy everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the attack, which was echoed by representatives
of the timber industry, was a contention that the priority given to
environmental concerns within the administration had prevented
officials from confronting the fire threat as might have been most
appropriate, through emergency logging measures.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and their allies were quick to rebut
the criticism, suggesting that the critics were speaking mostly out
of self-interest and arguing that the Forest Service and other
agencies had acted responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a campaign year, and these charges are politically
motivated,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a telephone
interview from Colorado. Babbitt conceded that ``some bottlenecks''
had slowed efforts to move ahead with forest thinning programs and
other fire-prevention measures, but he said the delays did not
reflect any lack of administration will.
</P>
<P>
   Independent fire experts in the West have said that the blazes
appear to be following no particular pattern, burning with roughly
equal fury in areas that had been logged in the past and those
where development had been prohibited. But some said there were
indications that the recent use of fire-prevention measures had
given some areas an additional margin of protection.
</P>
<P>
   The finger-pointing hinted at some of the emotions being laid
bare in a summer in which fires had already burned more than 4
million acres of the West, or an area larger than Connecticut. At
least 25,000 firefighters are battling the blazes across the
region, with reinforcements that include contingents from Australia
and New Zealand, as well as from the Army and Marines, which
together have dispatched three battalions.
</P>
<P>
   In Boise, Idaho, the National Interagency Fire Center said
Friday that the number of large fires burning in the West had been
reduced to 60 from 65.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hot, dry weather that has fueled the blazes showing
no sign of abating, most experts say that some blazes will continue
until the first snows, in what is now widely expected to become the
worst fire season in at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.4 million-acre toll for the season so far is already
nearly double the average from the last 10 years, and it well
outstrips notorious fire years like 1988, when a large portion of
Yellowstone National Park burned.
</P>
<P>
   With this year's fire control costs already above half a billion
dollars, and with the Republicans looking for potent issues to help
them win the White House, the political debate may well get even
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Racicot of Montana said he had
warned officials from the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management since 1992 about the dangers of increased timber
buildup. He said he had written unsuccessfully as recently as
January to the Forest Service chief, Mike Dombeck, to request that
more timber operations be authorized in Montana's national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Racicot said he blamed those he called strong environmentalists
within the administration, portraying them as opposed to timber
cutting under any circumstances, including thinning, that might
have reduced the severity and extent of the fires. ``Ultimately,
the White House is responsible, just as I am responsible for what
happens to our state forests here in Montana,'' said Racicot, who
is regarded as a close ally of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Among others who spoke scathingly about what they called the
administration's mistakes was Michael Klein, the chief spokesman
for the American Forest and Paper Association, an industry group
with close ties to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to not really understanding that to save a
forest, you have to cut a tree,'' Klein said in a telephone
interview from the group's headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, timber harvests on national forests have fallen from
12 billion board feet per year to less than 3 billion, in large
part to address environmental concerns, such as threats to
endangered species like the spotted owl. That trend, Klein said,
was a sign that ``this administration is in the hands of a radical,
environmental fringe wants to tie the hands of the federal land
managers by removing tools from their toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmental activists who were quick to defend the
administration said they believed that this year's fires had little
to do with any shift in logging practices. ``This is more a
phenomenon of the weather than any forest management policy,'' Bob
Ekey, regional director of the Wilderness Society, said in a
telephone interview from Bozeman, Mont.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, all fire experts agree, the main reasons
for the current, fire-prone state of Western forests must be traced
back much further, to the kinds of practices that have prevalent
over the last 100 years. Through nearly all of that period, most
fires were suppressed as a matter of federal policy and selective
logging of large trees was widely permitted, creating the
conditions that have left most of today's woodlands choked with
trees and brush.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 20th century, when fires tended to be small and
frequent, trees like Ponderosa pines grew in densities of as few as
20 to 50 trees an acre. Now, in much of the West, the same variety
of trees tend to be much smaller but are found in densities that
can range from 300 to 900 trees an acre, creating conditions ideal
for intense, fast-growing fires.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after a review conducted after the 1994 fire season,
the administration formally embraced a fire policy for wild land,
which identified thinning, preventive fires and other steps as key
tools to be used toward the goal of trying to assist forests in
returning to their natural, less-dense state.
</P>
<P>
   But progress has been slow, in part because of legal challenges
and other opposition from environmental groups like the Forest
Guardians of Santa Fe, N.M. Such groups object to practices that
they would construe as allowing commercial logging in the national
forests.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management
seem to prefer preventive fires over cutting in their efforts to
thin forests. But public confidence in the man-made fires was dealt
a heavy blow in May, when one such fire set near Los Alamos, N.M.,
swept out of control and damaged hundreds of homes.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing Friday that the administration had failed to take the
fire danger seriously enough, some critics pointed to a memorandum
written in January by Lester Rosenkrance, who was then director of
the Bureau of Land Management's firefighting arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should calamity strike, in the form of being unprepared for a
severe fire season that results in injuries or deaths among the
fire personnel, the agencies will be held accountable,''
Rosenkrance wrote in the memo, which was addressed to Tom Fry, the
agency's director.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenkrance complained that inadequate funding of the agency's
fire presuppression budget requests was leading to insufficient
training of federal firefighters and reduced training for local
government firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is doubt in my mind that we are placing the public and
property at greater risk as our ability to respond quickly and
aggressively to wild land fires decreases,'' Rosenkrance wrote. But
senior bureau officials not only ignored his warnings, said
Rosenkrance, they asked him to transfer to another job. After more
than 30 years with the agency, he chose to retire instead.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Interior Department, which oversees the land
management bureau, declined Friday to discuss the issues
surrounding Rosenkrance's retirement. But they said there was no
danger that the agency would short of money needed for fire
suppression, in part because Congress had already authorized
emergency funding and was likely to provide more after the summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lesson from this summer is that we've got to ask Congress
for 100 percent funding of our requests,'' Babbitt said. ``But we
can draw on open-ended funding during the fire season. Money is not
an issue.''

DEMOCRATS TAKE A CUE FROM REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, BUT STRESS
DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to figuring out the dos and don'ts of
running a convention, the Democrats seem to have picked up a few
pointers from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, when the Republicans were paying tribute to their
three living former presidents, Ford, Reagan and Bush, with brief
videos, Vice President Al Gore was watching intently from a beach
house along the North Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by the films, Gore got on the phone the next morning to
the sole living former Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, and
asked him to come to the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles next week.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who has had strained relations with President Clinton
and who spent the 1996 Democratic convention vacationing in
Montana, had been wavering about attending this year's event. But
when Gore called, he said yes. (An aide to Carter said the former
president had a good relationship with Gore.)
</P>
<P>
   And so on Monday night, the Democrats, too, will pay video
tribute to their last former president, while Carter looks on. (He
will not address the convention, his aide said.)
</P>
<P>
   Carter's tribute is not the only way the Democrats have designed
their convention to be like, or unlike, the Republican gala in
Philadelphia last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans ran a ``cotton candy convention'' without much
discussion of specific issues, the Democrats say. So their
convention will be loaded with policy discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, they will hold carefully staged panels featuring
people Gore has met during the campaign _ some of them just happen
to be Democratic delegates _ talking about the big issues, like
health care, crime and the economy. To provide a little Hollywood
flavor, the actor Jimmy Smits will help lead a session on health
care with Sen. John D. Rockefeller 4th.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore campaign has been reacting to everything Gov. Bush
has done since the beginning of the campaign,'' said Dan Bartlett,
a spokesman for Bush. ``It's not surprising they might be following
our lead on the convention as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another marked contrast to the Republican program,
congressional Democrats will have prominent roles in their
convention. In Philadelphia, the Republicans gave few prime-time
speaking slots to their congressional leaders, saying they were
trying to leave the limelight to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats contend the Bush campaign was trying to distance
itself from an unpopular Republican congressional majority. Not so
with Gore and the congressional Democrats, they say.
</P>
<P>
   And to prove it, they have laced their night sessions with
speeches by congressional Democrats. On Monday, all six of the
Democratic women in the Senate will speak, along with the president
and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for senator from New
York. On Tuesday, the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts will address
the convention, followed by the keynote speaker, Rep. Harold E.
Ford Jr. of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, women members of the House, Speaker Dick Gephardt
of Missouri and Sens. Rockefeller of West Virginia and Charles
Schumer of New York will all have prominent speaking roles. And on
Thursday night, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa will speak before Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut is nominated as the party's
candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we trying to do things differently? Absolutely.'' said
Jennifer Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee. ``This makes an understated political point: Unlike the
Republicans, everyone in our party is running on the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett replied, ``If they want to wheel out Washington-based
politicians to display as their face at the convention, that's fine
with us.''

 &HT;    Showers wash out attempts to qualify
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ A series of showers washed out qualifying
Friday for the Global Crossing at the Glen Winston Cup race at
Watkins Glen International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   After a 75-minute practice this morning, the Cup cars will
attempt at 10 to set the field for Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Rain hit the track Friday 15 minutes into the scheduled 2
1/2-hour practice session on the 2.45-mile road course that began
at 10:30 a.m. The rain finally stopped and the track was dry at
3:45 p.m. But track officials had to accommodate Cup practice and a
32-lap modified race before dark, so they moved qualifying to
today.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear brought its rain tires to the track, but no Cup teams
were eager to bolt them on. Defending champion Jeff Gordon said the
track would have to be in a state of ``perfect wetness'' for the
tires to be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Benson, driver of the No. 10 Pontiac, probably best
summed up the sentiment in the garage: ``If it's raining, I think
the fans will have a great race to watch. In fact, I think I will
be sitting in the stands with them. Only a few guys have had a
chance to race in the rain, and I'm not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   MCREYNOLDS TO THE BOOTH
</P>
<P>
   Larry McReynolds' year-end departure as crew chief for Mike
Skinner's No. 31 Chevrolet has led to speculation that Skinner also
will be leaving, but team owner Richard Childress denies it.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds resigned his job with Childress this week to join FOX
television as an analyst on racing telecasts next season. He'll
team with Darrell Waltrip, who will be retiring after 29 years as a
driver. McReynolds will stay with Skinner the remainder of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skinner is going to be in that car for two more years,''
Childress said Friday. ``We had a meeting with our team. The team
said they want him, and he says he wants to stay. I've got a
contract for two more years with him. Everybody is happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting offers, and when he starts getting offers, I get
other drivers coming to me. It opens a chain. Everybody is trying
to make something out of something that isn't there. Mike Skinner
will be in the 31 car next year.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds said he still has hopes of being a team owner some
day, but he couldn't pass up the opportunity to make as much money
as he does in racing and still have a little more time for his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this 20 years,'' McReynolds said. ``My kids
are 11, 9 and 2. Linda and I have been married almost 17 years. If
I can give some more time to them and make as good a living as I'm
making now, still be in the sport, still do something I enjoy
doing, it's basically a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   N.Y. LOVES BODINE
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bodine's team picked up a big-hearted sponsorship Friday.
The ``I Love New York'' logo, which features a heart, will be on
Bodine's No. 34 Chevrolet for Sunday's race and as an associate
sponsor on his No. 66 car in the Busch series the remainder of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Governor Mary O. Donohue made the announcement as Bodine
participated in a late-afternoon practice. He is a native of
Chemung, N.Y. The new money topped an already significant weekend
for Todd and his brother, Geoffrey. ``We're getting inducted into
the sports hall of fame in our hometown,'' Todd said, ``and that's
going to be really neat.''

LOOSENING UP AT LORD &AMP; TAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although dressed in a flowing, almost-formal black pants outfit
by Yeohlee, Jane T. Elfers, the 39-year-old merchant promoted
recently to be president of Lord &AMP; Taylor, says she is instituting
a new more relaxed dress code for executives _ and that she is
leading by example. ``See?'' she said, jovially pointing to her
feet, which were stuffed into a pair of pointed black pumps. ``No
hose.''
</P>
<P>
   Elfers took the helm of Lord &AMP; Taylor, a division of May
Department Stores, in June, facing a tide of disappointing sales.
Still, she has made it clear that she plans no sharp shift in
strategy for this venerable retailer. Her incremental loosening of
the dress code is a sign of her approach: an oh-so-gentle movement
of the stores to a younger, funkier market, she has demonstrated,
will be the hallmark of her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see a lot of new, young and exciting
designers,'' she said, ``but I think loyal customers will still be
very comfortable with us.''
</P>
<P>
   By consensus, Elfers treads a delicate path. On one hand, much
of Lord &AMP; Taylor's charm comes from being among the last of the
grand-dame Fifth Avenue stores to maintain its old-world ambience:
the dressing rooms are clean and spacious, the staff is shockingly
courteous and the merchandise is capaciously spaced.
</P>
<P>
   But its genteel atmosphere has also been a weakness in the
increasingly competitive and vamped-up retail world. In the women's
sportswear department, for example, the background music is more
likely to be easy listening (think Chris Cross), where at
Bloomingdale's, shoppers might be blasted with 'N Sync. Such
ambiance has helped give Lord &AMP; Taylor a reputation in the industry
and among some shoppers for being out of touch with what is young
and hip _ a potentially deadly faux pas in the retail world.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking clout with the profitable juniors market, the chain's 79
stores have seen sales per square foot decline from $237 in 1997 to
$218 last year, as much of the rest of retailing was seeing a
spectacular boom. Total sales have also suffered as the chain has
relied heavily on markdowns to entice shoppers. ``They've trained
their customers to play the coupon game,'' said Candace Corlett, a
partner at WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm based in New
York. ``You can see new-season merchandise and know that you will
get it on sale with a coupon within the season. It is a
self-defeating strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for Lord &AMP; Taylor to right itself has been compounded
this year as May, which has been a smooth operator of chains
including Foley's and Filene's, has stumbled. While Federated
Department Stores, a big rival, has delivered strong sales
increases, May's growth has been so disappointing that, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial, stock analysts' consensus estimate
for annual earnings has continued to drop.
</P>
<P>
   But Lord &AMP; Taylor, which has been around for 174 years, has a
loyal customer base that might be alienated by too much updating.
``If you look at the demographics of Lord &AMP; Taylor, they are
older,'' said Shari Schwartzman Eberts, a stock analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities. ``Of all the formats, they need to be the purest
to the tradition of the brand name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If gradual change is the best path, the genial Elfers appears
well suited for the job, by both temperament and training. Elfers
grew up in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., and inherited her interest in the trade
from her father, Thomas H. Taylor, who was a marketing executive at
Sears. She graduated from Bucknell University in 1983 with a
business degree and joined Lord &AMP; Taylor in 1989 as a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 11 years, Elfers rose within the organization,
which has a reputation for rewarding efficacy rather than
revolutionary thinking. Her latest post was executive vice
president with responsibility for dresses, suits, sportswear, coats
and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Elfers is one of the youngest top executives in the
business; many of the stock analysts who follow May were unfamiliar
with her record. She says Lord &AMP; Taylor's problem is not so much
that it attracts older customers, but that it is perceived that
way. ``The younger customer is in the store,'' Elfers said. ``My
job is to position Lord &AMP; Taylor's image to make it more obvious
that she is here'' _ without, of course, forgetting about its more
traditional customers.
</P>
<P>
   A new campaign will begin soon, focusing on direct mail
advertisements with modern, colorful presentations of more
fashionable merchandise. For newspapers, the chain will keep its
distinctive, classic pen-and-ink ads of women with tiny upswooped
noses.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is not to say that Elfers is just starting a public
relations campaign. She is changing the merchandise mix to appeal
to a trendier customer. This spring, she introduced Betsey Johnson,
a wild woman of fashion known for pushing the more outlandish
colors and styles. She also added young contemporary collections by
French Connection and Nine West Sportswear, as well as more
offerings from the suddenly hot designer copycat genius, ABS by
Allen B. Schwartz. In lingerie, amid the staid Maidenform bras and
panties, there are now Lilly of France changeable bra straps in
animal print and hot magenta. Coming soon to the shoe department
will be teen-friendly Skechers.
</P>
<P>
   But such tweaking may not be enough in a roughly competitive,
fast-cycling fashion environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Wal-Mart and H &AMP; M are setting the shopping culture,''
pondered Corlett, herself a loyal shopper, ``is there still a place
for Lord &AMP; Taylor? I hope so.''

</P>
<P>
   MARLBORO-MUSIC (Marlboro, Vt.) _ We've been trying to figure out
what to call this thing for 50 years,'' Frank Salomon said of the
venerable Marlboro Music School and Festival, which ends its 50th
season here August 13 with a public concert. ``It is not what
people customarily think of either as a school or as a festival.''
True, it is an odd school that has no teachers or students; only
participants, as they are called, some with much experience, some
with little, purposefully mixed and working together in rehearsals
and performances of chamber music. The learning is in the doing.
And it is an odd festival that determines its concert programs only
a week or so in advance, trusting listeners to travel from far and
wide all unknowing, and to welcome whatever pieces and performers
happen to come around. By James R. Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   YIDDISH-PINAFORE-THEATER (New York) _ The good ship Pinafore
looks familiar enough, with its big nautical steering wheel at
center stage, but why is it flying the Israeli flag? The tunes are
Arthur Sullivan's good old tunes, but what's with the lyrics? ``Ich
bin der keynig fun dem yam.'' What happened to ``I am the monarch
of the sea?'' Welcome to the Gilbert and Sullivan Yiddish Light
Opera Company's production of ``Der Yiddisher Pinafore,'' currently
anchored at Manhattan's New 14th Street Y. By Julius Novick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ALTAMONT-FILM (Undated) _ What gets called the '60s had any
number of endings, most of them elusive or much debated. But for
those who understood the decade (or era, or moment) as more a
cultural than a political phenomenon _ a last, late Romantic
pastoral _ the end came quite precisely and inarguably: Friday
night, Dec. 6, 1969, at the Altamont Speedway not far from San
Francisco, as the Rolling Stones, distracted and distraught, worked
their way through ``Under My Thumb.'' This moment is understood in
such terrible detail largely because of ``Gimme Shelter,'' the
extraordinary cinema verite account of the Stones' 1969 American
tour that ended in the Altamont darkness. By Gerald Marzorati.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-FILMS (New York) _ For five weeks, through Sept. 14,
Film Forum is showing some wonderful foreign classics made in the
years 1945-65, everything from ``Children of Paradise'' and ``Open
City'' to ``The Seventh Seal'' and ``Breathless.'' The series is
titled ``The Golden Age of the Foreign Film,'' a challenging claim;
it sounds almost too good to be true. By Phillip Lopate.
</P>
<P>
   STANLEY-TONG-FILM (Hong Kong) _ When Stanley Tong left his
hometown for Hollywood in 1996, Hong Kong's film industry was
headed for a crack-up as spectacular as anything in a Jackie Chan
movie. Box office revenue was plummeting, scripts were threadbare
and rampant piracy was driving a whole generation of movie-watchers
away from theaters. Now, Tong has returned to Hong Kong and is back
on familiar ground _ shooting an action film about the Chinese
police busting a smuggling ring. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADER-DANCE (New York) _ In the show ``Wanted:
X-Cheerleaders,'' a squad of 10 real-life ex-cheerleaders rant and
cheer about women's issues. Their routines, which feature flying
pompoms, kicks and jumps, are at once authentic cheerleading drills
and carefully choreographed movement. Although ``X-Cheerleaders''
may or may not fall under the rubric of contemporary dance, it is
exactly the kind of movement-dominated performance that is carving
out a niche in the New York International Fringe Festival, which
will envelop the Lower East Side for 12 days beginning on August
16. By Kevin Giordano.
</P>
<P>
   TROCKS-DANCE (New York) _ What renowned American classical
ballet company garnered enough engagements in 1999 to employ its
dancers for an impressive 41 weeks? The Joffrey Ballet, maybe?
American Ballet Theater? No, it was Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte
Carlo, fondly known as the Trocks, home of bulldozing etoiles like
Olga Supphozova and Ida Nevasayneva. The company, opening at the
Joyce Theater on August 15, will present two repertory programs
consisting primarily of Slavic chestnuts, including the New York
premiere of an impeccably affected ``Raymonda's Wedding,'' coached
by Elena Kunikova. By Joseph Carman.

<P>
   NC-DANCE-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ Dance is getting itself happily
mixed up. Some choreographers are having a ball with rock 'n' roll
and all that jazz. Others are uniting seemingly disparate music and
dance styles. The results can be artistically provocative, the best
of such productions making theatergoers gaze in wonder at both
dance and the world from which it comes. Take two refreshing
productions at this summer's American Dance Festival in Durham,
N.C. Mark Dendy's new work was performed to a potpourri of rock and
pop music of the recent past. By Jack Anderson.

<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-ROUTES-MUSIC (Undated) _ Nick Spitzer's uncompromising
passion for American music in all its vast variety has found
expression in the nationally syndicated public radio program
``American Routes.'' Part travelogue, part oral history, part
musical survey, the show is 100 percent Nick Spitzer, which is to
say that in a given two hours each week it might range from
Thelonious Monk to Doc Watson to Lauryn Hill, stopping along the
way to interview a New York cabbie or a Delta barber, deliberately
heedless of categories. By Samuel G. Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE-WOMEN-BLUES (Undated) _ Why do white women sing the blues?
It's grueling work to peer over the broad shoulders of old masters
like Son House, Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf. It's anonymous
work, too. Yet it happens, enriching the culture. By Dana Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Decisions are now being made about
a cluster of major civic projects that, between them, will exercise
an unprecedented impact on the immediate and long-range future of
New York. All the projects have an important role to play in
meeting the fundamental challenge faced by New York and other aging
urban centers: the transition from the industrial city of the 19th
century to the cultural matrix of the 21st. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXHIBITS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-INSTRUMENTS (Washington) _ Africans _ and their
descendants in the diaspora _ always seem surrounded by music. So
it hardly comes as a surprise for a museum curator to decide that
traditional African instruments should not only be listened to but
looked at. Such is the point of ``Audible Artwork: Selected African
Musical Instruments,'' a pleasant, though rather modest, exhibit
showing here at the National Museum of African Art through April 8,
2001. By Stephen A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   MALE-NUDE-PHOTOGRAPHY (Undated) _ The first photographer to make
male nudes popular subjects for both homosexuals and heterosexuals
was Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden (1856-1931), a German who worked in
Sicily, primarily from 1890 to 1914. Forty-one of his images, most
of them of young Italian boys dressed like ancient Greeks, are on
view at Throckmorton Fine Art in Midtown Manhattan through Sept.
9). By Vicki Goldberg.

at near-record lows, automakers are selling all manner of
four-wheeled vehicles at a record pace. Profits are good. The
companies are flush with cash. And there are no labor disputes
looming anywhere close to the horizon. Yet Wall Street has looked
at these fundamentals and effectively said ``Big Deal.'' Auto
stocks, which peaked during the spring, are down, in some cases way
down. The stock market is anticipating a slide in demand that may

His investors have been rewarded. The fund returned 16.6 percent a
year, on average, for the three years through July 31, compared
with 7.3 percent for its peers in the small-blend category of

predictions that it was time for a rebound in the euro, the unified

distance of new lows, bedeviling American investors by erasing

are revamping their decor and introducing luxury services to
bolster the spirits of patients and give them a sense of
well-being. In recent years, doctors and hospitals have integrated
alternative and Eastern-influenced treatments with conventional
Western medicine. Now they are extending that holistic approach to
the look and feel of the clinical environment. Think of it as the
aesthetic equivalent of acupuncture. In the New York City area,
health care institutions and a spate of wellness centers are wooing

applies if you are bashing into your trees with that mower. Stop,
unless you want to kill them. Plant a ground cover from the tree's
trunk clear to its drip line. Or even farther, if you would like a
sustainable, low-maintenance landscape. By Anne Raver.

   NEW YORK _ Gordon Lightfoot may be 62 and none the better for
wear, but he could be a movie star. The singer-songwriter, who
played his first New York City show in 32 years on Wednesday at
Manhattan's Town Hall, has the same laconic appeal that allows
wrinkling leading men like Peter Fonda and Nick Nolte to maintain
careers. He's a rugged guy who knows how to melt. The slow thaw
defines his music and his enduring charm.
</P>
<P>
   American listeners might not instantly associate Lightfoot with
reticence, because his most famous song, ``The Wreck of the Edmund
Fitzgerald,'' is so long-winded. Lightfoot gave the ballad, perhaps
the only sea chantey to become a major hit in the arena rock era, a
straightforward reading midway through his set. In this context
``Wreck'' revealed its commonality with Lightfoot's other material.
Like ``Sundown,'' his trip to a rock-and-roll bordello, and
``Carefree Highway,'' his ode to easy riding, ``Wreck'' captures
high drama in sepia tones.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot's melodies are the key to his transformation of bloody
red into earthy rust. His lyrics mix colloquialisms with
high-flying metaphor, but his music is fanatically centered.
Phrases are short, inching up and down the scale to suit his
stalwart baritone. At Town Hall the upper register showed the pinch
of age, but it mellowed as the two-hour show progressed, and the
melodies did their work no matter what. They seemed more like
primordial emanations than one person's composition.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot developed his style by listening to Bob Dylan, whom he
honored with a cover of ``Ring Them Bells,'' Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton
and the folk songs popularized by anthologies like the Folkways
series in the 1960s. Country music was also a major influence, and
it resurfaced on Monday in the tasty licks of the guitarist Terry
Clements.
</P>
<P>
   Few of Lightfoot's folk-rock peers could fall back so easily on
the masculine stereotype he embodied. This Canadian outdoorsman,
who has spent much of his nonmusical life working for environmental
causes, easily taps into the lineage of the singing cowboy. His
most flowery songs, ``Minstrel of Dawn'' and ``Don Quixote,'' are
saved from utter corniness by his reserve as a musician and a
personality. He introduced the latter Wednesday as ``about the
world in general, I guess.'' Such understatement is his gift.
</P>
<P>
   His band was equally modest. Aside from the occasional soft-rock
crescendo from the keyboardist Mike Heffernan, the four-piece group
let the songs emerge like crops growing on the prairie. Even
``Canadian Railroad Trilogy,'' originally composed for a television
special and performed with a full orchestra, chorus and dancers,
shrunk to manageable size when Lightfoot performed it. He made
grandiosity genial.

<P>
   A study of Concorde's engines carried out two years ago found 55
``significant risks'' inherent in their design. Air France and
British Airways, the two airlines that operate Concorde, are
halfway through a program to eliminate these risks. A spokeswoman
for British Airways says: ``It's part of an ongoing program of
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   But New Scientist has learned that some of the risks identified
could lead to catastrophic problems including uncontrolled fire and
multiple engine failure. Both figured in last month's crash outside
Paris when a blazing Air France Concorde smashed into a hotel two
minutes after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport, killing
113 people.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the disaster is still unknown. But one theory being
considered by accident investigators is that debris from a burst
tire was sucked into the engines. The debris may have caused the
engine to break up, which led to the fire. It is not clear whether
any of the 55 risks identified in the study would have made the
effects of tire ingestion worse.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways commissioned the risk analysis of Concorde's
Olympus 593 engines because it wanted to keep the 30-year-old
supersonic plane flying until 2012. The risk analysis was done by
the airline in conjunction with Rolls-Royce, which built Concorde's
engines, and BMT Reliability Consultants of Fareham, Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at all the problems that could arise with the
engines and examined the history of previous failures to calculate
the odds of each event. It divided the consequences into five
classes-ranging from trivial to ``catastrophic.'' The latter
included ``non-containment of high-energy debris, engine
separation, uncontrolled fire and multiple engine failures.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis identified 152 separate risks, but it showed that
Concorde's engines did not fall short of the safety standards
required by the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain and its
counterparts in France and the US. British Airways emphasizes that
the CAA has not required it to improve the plane's engines. The
reliability of Concorde's engines has remained constant over the
past 10 years, with each engine being shut down about once in every
600 trans-Atlantic flights due to mechanical faults.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, British Airways and Rolls-Royce ``immediately
initiated activity on the most significant 55 risks'' identified in
the study, according to a paper given to a meeting of the
Confederation of European Aerospace Societies in Cambridge last
year. Both companies established an action plan requiring weekly
progress reports on reducing the risks.
</P>
<P>
   The paper does not give details of the individual risks and
neither the authors nor Air France would comment on its contents,
because of the French judicial inquiries into the cause of last
month's crash. However, it does say a quarter of the
``significant'' risks identified in the study require design
changes to engine parts and half of the risks are said to require
``further analysis''. &QL;

   Cinnamon may prevent or at least delay a type of diabetes that
develops with age, say researchers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials of mon extract are due to begin within a
year, but nutritionist Richard Anderson says patients with type II
or non-insulin-dependent diabetes could benefit now by adding the
spice to their food or drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend people take a quarter to a full teaspoon a day of
cinnamon, perhaps in orange juice, coffee or on oatmeal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Type II diabetes kills 100 million people prematurely each year.
In patients with the condition, fat and muscle cells gradually lose
their ability to respond to insulin, the hormone that directs cells
to remove excess glucose from the bloodstream. As a result, glucose
builds up in the blood, causing symptoms such as fatigue, weight
loss and blurred vision.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier laboratory experiments, Anderson and his colleagues
at the U.S. Agricultural Research Service's nutrition labs in
Beltsville, Md., established that cinnamon rekindles the ability of
fat cells from type II diabetics to recognize and respond to
insulin, increasing their glucose metabolism twentyfold. Now the
team has discovered the substance responsible, a polyphenol called
methylhydroxy chalcone polymer (MHCP).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says the extract doesn't replace insulin by binding to
the hormone receptor itself. Experiments have shown that it simply
makes fat cells more responsive to insulin, ensuring that the
``remove glucose'' message registers inside the cell.
</P>
<P>
   In unpublished studies, abnormally high glucose concentrations
in diabetic mice fell drastically when they were given MHCP. Blood
pressure also remained stable in spontaneously hypertensive rats,
rodents with an insensitivity to insulin whose blood pressure
normally soars when they eat a high-sugar diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any work in this area is welcome,'' says Cathy West, a
spokeswoman for London-based Diabetes UK.
</P>
<P>
   She says that around two million people have type II diabetes in
Britain, but cautions that it is too early to start recommending
that people take cinnamon to treat the condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we look forward to the results of further research.'' &QL;

   Olympians competing in Sydney this year may shatter several
world records thanks to running shoes individually tuned to damp
down the vibrations shuddering through their bodies. The shoes
could also one day be used to boost the performance of elderly
walkers.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes, designed by Benno Nigg, James Wakeling and their
colleagues at the Human Performance Laboratory in the University of
Calgary, Canada, contain conventional sport shoe materials. But by
manipulating the viscosity, elasticity and stiffness of the sole,
the researchers believe they can boost performance by up to 4
percent. This could slice around 4 minutes off the time of a
marathon runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between finishing first or
twenty-second,'' Nigg says. ``We have athletes that have tuned
spiked shoes at the Olympics. We think we will see some world
records.''
</P>
<P>
   The new shoes emerged from research into the damaging effects of
vibrations on the body. Studies of drivers and people working
machinery revealed that long-term exposure to vibrations can reduce
blood circulation and the speed of nerve impulses to muscles. So it
is important to minimize such vibrations, Wakeling says.
</P>
<P>
   To mimic the leg vibrations caused by running, Wakeling's team
strapped subjects onto a suspended bed with their feet held at a
steady angle to the wall. The bed was then swung like a pendulum so
that their heels struck the wall every two-seconds. By measuring
electrical activity in their leg muscles, the researchers found
that muscles naturally tighten to help dampen vibrations in the
surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The muscles retune the natural frequency of the leg,''
Wakeling says. And this stops the leg resonating when the foot hits
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But this retuning requires energy, so the researchers designed a
shoe that could do the job instead. Wakeling found that a
relatively soft sole is best for damping the vibrations, and allows
the muscles to do the least work. Ideally, the shoes should be
tuned to the vibrations of each individual by varying the blend of
material. Depending on their training and build, people's muscles
resonate at different frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might explain why there is no such thing as a sport shoe
that suits all,'' Wakeling says.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes may also reduce the wear and tear on athletes' legs
caused by repetitive training. And Nigg hopes they will one day be
adapted to make walking less physically tiring. ``If you do it
right, an elderly person may be able to walk two miles rather than
one and a half miles.'' &QL;

   In the film ``Outbreak,'' U.S. Army doctor Sam Daniels, played
by Dustin Hoffman, saves the town of Cedar Creek and the entire
United States from certain death by an Ebola-like virus. The
dynamic Daniels finds a monkey carrying the virus, draws off some
serum, then makes enough of the stuff to treat the town and save
his ex-wife-all in the space of a day.
</P>
<P>
   While the method behind Daniels's frenzied activity may have
been true to life, the time frame certainly was not. Researchers
searching for what triggers childhood diabetes can only dream of
such powers. The notion of a virus prompting the immune system to
destroy the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas has been
around for more than 20 years. But identifying the viruses with any
certainty is proving very tough indeed.
</P>
<P>
   So a paper from scientists at the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute in Melbourne, Australia, is causing great excitement. The
researchers have found that rotaviruses, the most common childhood
stomach bugs, may trigger diabetes in susceptible children. The
immune systems of children who later developed diabetes appeared to
attack their own beta cells whenever they contracted a rotavirus.
</P>
<P>
   Rotaviruses fit well with the epidemiology of diabetes. New
cases tend to peak in the cold, dark months, which is just when
rotaviruses go to work. Several studies have also found that
diabetes is on the increase in areas where parents send young
children to day-care centers, which are hotbeds of infection.
</P>
<P>
   So, could a rotavirus vaccine stop children developing diabetes?
At first glance the answer looks like ``yes.'' But the Australian
research questions this. One theory suggests that amino acid
sequences carried by beta cells and the virus are very similar. The
argument goes that this molecular mimicry triggers diabetes-immune
cells attacking the virus also take out beta cells. So a diabetes
vaccine with these amino acids could trigger the disease instead.
</P>
<P>
   One other hope is that a vaccine could be made with amino acids
from the virus that are different from those found in beta cells.
This would sidestep molecular mimicry. Repeating the Australian
study with children who have received such a vaccine could prove
whether rotaviruses really spark off diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   So it's all clear then? Unfortunately not. The Melbourne team
looked at children with only two of the 16 or so gene variations
thought to increase the risk of diabetes. Other viruses are also
implicated. Children who contract rubella in the womb have a raised
risk of diabetes, and there is evidence against other viruses, such
as Coxsackie B. Then there's the mechanism: molecular mimicry is
only one theory. Perhaps viruses infiltrate beta cells, and the
immune system mops them up as it does other infected cells.
</P>
<P>
   At the molecular level, childhood diabetes looks nothing like a
single disease. This is not the sort of message that Sam Daniels
would have wanted to hear, but life is rarely as cut and dried as
Hollywood portrays it. What the Australians show is the power of
combining genetics, virology and immunology. And as we plumb the
genomes of humans, viruses and other pathogens, you can bet there's
more to come. &QL;

   Although Michael Nadel is just getting started as an investor,
he says the mutual fund industry has already lost him as a
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Nadel, 26, a Washington lawyer, says he grew frustrated a few
months ago when he could not determine what was causing the sharp
decline in the value of his shares of an Internet stock fund.
Because most mutual funds disclose their complete holdings only
twice a year and with a significant time lag, he said, ``I don't
know what they own or how they make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that he could generate better returns by calling his
own shots, Nadel shifted a retirement savings account to
Folio((fn)), an Internet-based start-up that lets investors build
their own baskets of stocks and trade them as often as they like,
for a monthly fee of $29.95. ``I have no desire to be in a managed
fund any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadel is an early convert to a new breed of investment services
that are using Web technology to create alternatives to mutual
funds and traditional brokerage accounts. Since Folio((fn))
introduced basket investing for individual customers in May, a raft
of upstarts have appeared, promoting similar products they
variously call folios, e-baskets or personal funds. As they race to
harness the Internet's power to sell investment advice and
flexible, low-cost products, they threaten to siphon off some of
the $7 trillion that is now in mutual funds and the trillions more
parked in brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Each start-up is trying to carve out its own slice of the
spectrum between actively managed mutual funds and online brokerage
accounts. Some, like Folio((fn)) and Unx.com, will let customers
choose preselected baskets of stocks or build their own. Others,
like NetFolio and Smartleaf, plan to advise investors on how to use
baskets of individual stocks to manage their taxes, trading costs
and investment risks. Yet another venture, Personal Fund, which is
backed by the financial journalist Andrew Tobias, is selling
software to brokerage firms and financial planners that would help
them manage these baskets.
</P>
<P>
   All these young companies share an underlying belief that the
Internet provides a way for investors to combine the simplicity of
mutual funds with the greater control of owning stocks through a
brokerage account _ and that they can make money by exploiting that
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' executives argue that mutual fund shareholders
pay too much in taxes and fees to managers who exert complete
control, disclose too little about what they are doing and
routinely underperform the overall market. Online brokerage
accounts, on the other hand, leave investors to navigate a sea of
choices without much guidance, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of potential in the idea,'' said John
Rekenthaler, director of research at Morningstar Inc.
``Diversification with more customization, more ability to control
one's tax bill and potentially lower costs _ that's an attractive
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not for everybody,'' he continued. ``It's a minority
audience that's going to want to make their own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why start-ups like NetFolio and Smartleaf are
emphasizing the value of the advice they offer and are leaving it
to others to buy the stocks to place in the baskets. James J.
Atkinson, a fund executive, says this sort of unbundling of
investment ideas _ from the packages they come wrapped in _ reminds
him of the controversy that is roiling the recorded-music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson, who heads the domestic mutual fund operations of
Investec Asset Management, says the Internet is opening financial
services to an early-stage ``disruptive technology'' like the one
that spawned Napster, the service that lets people swap music files
over the Internet instead of buying compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fund industry is no longer the way to get packaging and
convenience, they will lose the ability to control pricing of their
intellectual content,'' just like recording companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say these personalized funds are more likely to
draw money away from mutual funds than from brokerage accounts. But
it is the brokerage firms that have begun to respond with plans for
baskets of their own. Meanwhile, executives of the two biggest
mutual fund companies, Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group,
say they do not see the new products as much of a threat to their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors have already shown an appetite for new twists
on the decades-old format of mutual funds. In the last two years,
companies have rolled out dozens of products that look like mutual
funds but trade all day like stocks, including several from Merrill
Lynch called Holdrs. In the first six months of the year, assets in
all of these exchange-traded funds grew almost 50 percent, to $52.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the established financial companies are not waiting to
see if personalized funds will catch on. Etrade, the second-largest
Internet brokerage firm in trading volume, recently bought one of
the upstarts, the Electronic Investing Corp. of San Francisco.
Before year-end, Etrade plans to offer the ability to create and
manage baskets of stocks _ either directly to its customers or
through affiliated financial advisers. Etrade has not said how it
will price the products.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the leading online brokerage firm, is developing
a similar service and may introduce it as soon as early next year.
But as the operator of the largest mutual fund supermarket, Schwab
has more at stake than most brokerage firms: about 30 percent of
its customers' assets are in mutual funds, which pay service fees
to Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Hubbard, a Schwab spokesman, said that fact would not
stop Schwab from offering baskets if the company's executives
decided to proceed. ``We don't believe these products represent a
direct challenge to mutual funds or to our relationships with
mutual fund companies,'' Hubbard said. ``The real issue is whether
there is enough investor interest.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James P. O'Shaughnessy, a money manager who sold his mutual fund
business this year to get into the business of advising investors
on setting up their own baskets of stocks, has no qualms about
butting heads with the fund industry. Visitors to his NetFolio Web
site are greeted with the headline: ``Goodbye mutual funds. Hello
NetFolio.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Shaughnessy, who has built a following among individual
investors who think there are ways to consistently outperform the
market, said: ``I've always thought that mutual funds were the
investment of choice for the masses. But I think the enabling
technologies of the Internet are going to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   For as little as $200 a year, NetFolio will advise investors on
buying one of more than 100 ``e-baskets'' of 5 to 40 stocks to fit
their investing goals and appetite for risk. The customers will be
able to make changes in the baskets or create their own from
scratch. The stocks will be held in brokerage accounts at Bear
Stearns, said O'Shaughnessy, whose desk in NetFolio's temporary
offices in midtown Manhattan is a folding table. Bear Stearns,
which has invested $1 million in O'Shaughnessy's company, plans to
offer NetFolio's service to its wealthy brokerage clients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The folio approach has already caught on with some hedge fund
managers and investment advisers, said Matthew Ridenour, chief
executive of Unx.com, an online brokerage firm based in Burbank,
Calif., that specializes in such investing for the institutional
market.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, professional and individual investors alike have
sought ways to diversify efficiently by investing in groups of
stocks, through actively managed mutual funds, index funds, hedge
funds or other packages of securities. Ridenour predicted that as
much as $2 trillion could move from these existing funds into the
new breed of basket over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Unx.com, which has assets of about $250 million, plans to
develop an offering for individual investors. ``My argument,''
Ridenour said, ``is that no one ever needs a mutual fund again.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Wallman, a former member of the Securities and Exchange
Commission who founded Folio((fn)), is trying to make a competitive
issue of the fees, expenses and taxes rung up by mutual fund
investors. Wallman says folios allow investors to better manage
their tax bill because they can sell losing positions to offset
profits on winners. Mutual fund investors are not able to manage
their taxes in that way, because fund managers decide when to
distribute gains.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the typical mutual fund pay about 1.35 percent of
assets annually in management fees _ about $500 on the median
investment of $38,000. Many funds also charge sales fees when you
buy into, or sell out of the funds, some as high as 5.5 percent. If
that fee is paid up front, it reduces the amount that an investor
puts into the account _ a significant factor in certain
tax-deferred retirement accounts, like IRAs, in which the fee cuts
into annual contribution limit.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, paying a flat fee to set up a personalized
fund can also cost less than buying the same stocks through a
discount broker at $10 to $30 a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The new investment vehicles have attracted the support _ and
participation _ of some big-name financial experts. Steve Ross, a
professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
is an adviser to Smartleaf, a start-up that wants to use the
Internet to deliver advice to individual investors on managing
trading costs, taxes and risk.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, the Personal Fund co-founder who for years has been
warning investors through his books and columns about the hidden
costs of mutual funds, said he would be endorsing the concept as a
low-cost alternative to mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stuns me how many folks currently pay a sales fee to buy a
high-expense mutual fund over which they have no tax control,'' he
said. ``We can help them see how much better they could be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Sharkansky, the chief executive of Personal Fund, said
that mutual funds would be around for a while, but that, ``over
time, the mutual fund structure will be displaced by
mass-customized personal accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharkansky says companies that do not offer customized funds in
some form will risk losing investors like himself. Four years ago,
he was the kind of customer whom most brokers dream about: he had
been the president and the biggest shareholder of Prospero Systems,
an Internet communications company that was acquired for $3
million, and he wanted to invest his share of the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the costs of actively managed mutual funds, and
after a big brokerage firm quoted him commission rates as high as 2
percent, Sharkansky decided to pick his own stocks, using an online
broker. But in short order, he said, he became frustrated with this
stock-by-stock approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owning individual stocks is pretty appealing, but it's too
much damn work to have to pick them one at a time,'' he said. ``I
really wanted a more convenient solution which would help me get
reasonable diversification and also appropriate tax strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   When he could not find online tools for building a more coherent
investment strategy, he said, he decided to create his own. ``Just
as Pierre Omidyar invented eBay so his girlfriend would have a
place to buy Pez dispensers, I invented Personal Fund in order to
satisfy my own needs,'' Sharkansky said, referring to one of the
resounding success stories of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Personal Fund is preparing to offer free access to the
portfolio-planning and tax-management tools on its Web site,
www.personalfund.com, while it tries to strike deals to sell its
basket-management software to brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Sharkansky cites his wife, Irene Song Sharkansky, as an ideal
prospect. A lawyer and a former employee of General Electric, she
owns ``a fair amount'' of shares in GE, one of the most widely held
stocks in the world. ``Now, when she buys a mutual fund in her
401(k) at work, what is she buying?'' he asked. ``More GE, which
she doesn't need.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is a problem that even the most cost-efficient index funds,
like Vanguard's 500 Index, cannot conquer. By definition, funds
that are intended to match the major stock-market indexes own
shares in the biggest American companies. Occasionally, they also
surprise their shareholders with taxable gains, because they must
sell shares of companies that are deleted from indexes and buy
shares of their replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the person who wants to buy big stocks and big stocks
only, Vanguard 500 is a good choice,'' said O'Shaughnessy, the
former money manager, who spelled out his quantitative approach to
investing in ``What Works on Wall Street'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposition,'' he said, ``is that most people don't want
to buy just big stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   All this talk about a brave new investing world does not seem to
be rattling executives of the biggest mutual fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Pozen, a vice chairman of Fidelity Investments, said
he thought the products would run into regulatory hurdles. Doing so
could slow their development and drive up their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Purveyors of the new products assert that they are not subject
to the Investment Company . Act of 1940, which governs mutual
funds. ``These are people who are trying to make believe that
they're not mutual funds, but they're coming very close to the
line, and I would say they're actually crossing the line,'' Pozen
said. ``I think that issue will be litigated, and properly so.''
</P>
<P>
   John Brennan, chief executive of Vanguard Group and chairman of
the mutual fund industry trade group, the Investment Co. Institute,
was more dismissive. ``I think it's likely to be a niche product at
best,'' he said. ``It's hard for me to see the competitive
advantage in them.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Vanguard executives, including
Brennan, have spoken out against a new twist on mutual funds. In an
interview in the February issue of Money magazine, George U.
Sauter, head of Vanguard's indexing division, criticized
exchange-traded funds. But by May, after several competitors had
introduced them, Vanguard announced that it would also hop into
that arena.
</P>
<P>
   If the mutual fund giants doubt the viability of folios, there
are believers on the outskirts of the industry. Among them is
Atkinson of Investec, a London firm that manages $27 billion
worldwide. Investec's limited presence in the United States has
driven Atkinson to devise out-of-the-ordinary products _ including
a mutual fund that tracks an index created by the editors of Wired
magazine, as well as the first wireless mutual fund _ to attract
investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, Investec is considering offering individual
baskets of stocks ``as some kind of complementary products to our
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may cannibalize the fund business,'' he added,
``we're more interested in serving our investors' needs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TherE are still plenty of skeptics who say they have seen
threats to the mutual fund industry come and go, but the whiff of
potential for the new personal funds seems to have many nostrils
flaring.
</P>
<P>
   A recent check of available Internet domain names that
incorporate the word ``folio'' revealed that dozens had already
been taken. Among them were Schwabfolios.com and
Vanguardfolios.com, though they were not registered by Schwab or
Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other domains with the word ``folio'' were registered
by Peter Moran, the chief marketing executive for Turner Funds,
which manages $10 billion, after he read an article in the July 31
issue of Barron's that mentioned Folio((fn)).
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he had intended to reserve only one generic domain
name, managedfolios.com, and had registered the other names
unintentionally while experimenting at Register.com, a Web site
that charges $35 to reserve an Internet address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell mutual funds through Schwab _ obviously that's a faux
pas,'' he said, adding that he planned to cancel his transactions
for the Schwab and Vanguard domains. But he has been following the
development of Folio((fn)) and NetFolios for some time and wanted
to find his own way to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more of a California gold rush _ jump on your horse and
throw your stake in the ground,'' Moran said. But he is planning to
keep managedfolios.com, in case the concept takes off, he said,
adding, ``It might be the best $35 I ever spent.''

 &HT;    Rosenbaum recaps eclectic inquiries
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The documentary filmmaker Erroll Morris calls Ron Rosenbaum
``one of the great masters of the metaphysical detective story,''
which certainly sounds more highfalutin on a dust jacket than
``really smart journalist.'' Rosenbaum describes what he does as
``journalism that asks the questions literature asks.''
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, there is no easy slot for Rosenbaum, a
pathologically curious and eclectic writer, a sifter of cultural
meaning. Catch him on one of his goofier assignments, and he's
whipping through a deadpan deconstruction of Mr. Whipple of Charmin
toilet paper fame, and getting off on a tangent about how the white
fluffy stuff is manufactured. History buffs who read his brilliant
1998 book ``Explaining Hitler,'' however, found a dense but
compelling amalgam of history, travelogue, psychological profiling
and philosophical meditation on the nature of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Remember all the hoo-ha about George Bush belonging to Skull and
Bones, the secret Yale society? Rosenbaum was unearthing all their
secret rituals back in 1976, years before it became fodder for
``Doonesbury.'' He also hung with ``phone phreaks,'' early '70s
kids who had figured out how to rip off Ma Bell big time, the
spiritual forefathers of today's computer hackers. ``Computer
freaking may be the wave of the future,'' he wrote in 1971, at a
time when practically no one envisioned what computers would
someday become.
</P>
<P>
   The geeky phone phreaks and the secretive Yalies are among those
covered in the 56 pieces (articles, essays, musings) collected in
``The Secret Parts of Fortune'' (the title is an obscure line from
``Hamlet''). It's a massive compendium of Rosenbaum's best work
from the early '70s, when he wrote for Esquire and The Village
Voice, through the '90s, when he's been a columnist for The New
York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, there is nothing as dated as the journalism of 20 to
30 years ago, which is why it's better to think of Rosenbaum's work
as metaphysical detective stories. He does the legwork, but more
important, he does the brain work. A literature student at Yale
before postmodernism took over the academy, he learned the art of
``close reading,'' of examining poetry for ambiguity and nuance.
Later, he applied those literary tools to ``trial transcripts,
autopsy reports, congressional-hearing records,'' in search of
``the shadow of some submerged truth that belies the surface
intention of the words.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Catcher in the Driveway,'' for example, Rosenbaum shows
off his legwork/brain work double play when he tracks J.D.
Salinger, the notoriously reclusive author of ``The Catcher in the
Rye,'' to his home in rural New Hampshire. Rosenbaum is by no means
the first nor last to try to sniff out Salinger; there is an entire
underground of Holden Caulfield obsessives who have made the
pilgrimage, and we meet some of them on Rosenbaum's journey.
</P>
<P>
   But as he ponders whether to violate the ``No Trespassing''
sign, Rosenbaum digresses into an explanation of the Zen koan
``What is the sound of one hand clapping?'' which Salinger used as
the epigraph to his ``Nine Stories.'' The answer to the riddle is
that it is awareness of the absence of sound, of silence, the
silence in which Salinger has submerged himself for decades.
Rosenbaum then jumps from the silence of the author to the silence
of God; it's amazing Salinger wasn't disturbed by the whirrings of
Rosenbaum's mind as he stood outside Salinger's house.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fox Mulder, he wants to believe. He listens, long past the
point where any normal person would run away screaming, to people
who have it All Figured Out: the JFK conspiracy theorists, the
researchers (some legit, some bogus) who search for the Meaning of
It All in Elvis, Hitler, Watergate or the Dead Sea Scrolls. He
sifts their ravings and reads their reports, these modern-day
Ancient Mariners, as he calls them, for kernels of truth, or at
least meaning. Skeptical but rarely cynical, he finds that even
cranks sometimes have something to contribute.

 &HT;    Fall TV _ and other risky Bettes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's practically the 17th ``Survivor,'' the 11th member of the
``Big Brother'' cast. If you've seen a moment of either show, you
know from the relentless promos that Bette Midler has a sitcom
coming on CBS this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And even by the beyond-Barnum parameters of TV hucksterism, CBS'
touting of ``Bette'' has been as outsize as Midler's own persona.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, viewers watching ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' on
ABC hear the drumbeat for Geena Davis' new sitcom, while Fox folks
are wondering what the deal is with the futuristic ``Dark Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately (or fortunately, in many cases), you'll have to
wait until October to see most of these. With the Summer Olympics
running until Oct. 1 on NBC, the official start of the fall 2000
season is the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   What's coming among the 31 new series? You'll notice a lot more
African-Americans, the result of the NAACP rubbing the networks'
noses in their too-white schedules (but still a near-shutout of
Latinos). A smattering of star power: Midler, Davis, Tony Award
winner Gabriel Byrne, Yasmine Bleeth (hey, she's a star to a
certain section of the audience).
</P>
<P>
   There are shows that try to break the rhythms of traditional
network categories, mixing drama, comedy and a twist: NBC's ``Ed,''
CBS' ``That's Life,'' WB's ``Gilmore Girls'' and Fox's ``Boston
Public'' (the last from David E. Kelley, about high school
teachers).
</P>
<P>
   And as is the case every season, there are a few shows with
enormous promise, scattered among the six networks' schedules like
rubies in a cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the pilots have been sent to TV critics and ad buyers
yet _ some have not even been shot _ but of what's in circulation,
three stand out:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gideon's Crossing'' (10 p.m. Wednesdays on ABC) _ Andre
Braugher, the late great Frank Pembleton of ``Homicide,'' returns
to series TV as Dr. Ben Gideon. In the pilot, he reluctantly treats
a repulsively slick financier. Braugher and the writing are nothing
less than brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dark Angel'' (9 p.m. Tuesdays on Fox) _ In a
post-apocalyptic, semi-fascist America, a genetically enhanced
young warrior-woman (Jessica Alba) searches for her hidden past and
aids a cyber-journalist freedom fighter. Oh man, not another one of
those. The two-hour pilot, co-created by ``Titanic's'' James
Cameron, rocks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ed'' (8 p.m. Sundays on NBC) _ After losing his job, a
lawyer (Thomas Cavanaugh) returns to his small town of
Stuckeyville, buys a bowling alley and tries to woo his high school
crush. A sweet, offbeat hour that floats along on its own
wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bad news: Don't bet a dime on any of these shows
succeeding in the ratings. ``Gideon'' is too dark and off-putting
(Dr. Feelgood he ain't), ``Angel'' will crease your brain trying to
follow its convoluted story and ``Ed'' will battle tough
competition (``Touched by an Angel,'' ``The Simpsons'').
</P>
<P>
   A fall TV season is about the most ruthless Darwinian system
ever devised, and recent history is littered with great shows that
couldn't get the necessary audience. (Requiescat, ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' ``My So-Called Life,'' ``Now and Again.'')
</P>
<P>
   Also looking good enough, if not memorable:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bette'' (8 p.m. Wednesdays on CBS) has the brand name, the
marketing muscle and an A for effort; it just needs to settle down
and not be so frantic. Midler, very game, plays a version of
herself.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Geena Davis Show'' (9:30 p.m. Tuesdays on ABC) finds the
Oscar winner as a single career gal engaged to a widower (Peter
Horton) with two kids. It, too, is trying too hard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gilmore Girls'' (8 p.m. Thursdays on WB) is a very agreeable
mother-daughter show; like ``Ed,'' it has a tenderness you don't
usually see on TV. Also, like ``Ed,'' it'll soon be toast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Fugitive'' (8 p.m. Fridays on CBS) is a ready-made
franchise and is pumped up more like the movie than the old David
Janssen series.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The $treet'' (9 p.m. Wednesdays on Fox) gives us predatory
Wall Street slimebags; the fun is figuring out which one you loathe
the most.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Welcome to New York'' (8:30 p.m. Wednesdays on CBS) comes
from David Letterman's production company and is about a TV
weatherman from Indiana. But the guy isn't close to Letterman. Go
figure.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nikki'' (9:30 p.m. Sundays on WB) has Nikki Cox shedding her
bimbo image and pairing up with likable newcomer Nick von Esmarch
in a romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's NBC. Aside from ``Ed,'' you can turn to the
Peacock for your turkeys this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``DAG,'' the new sitcom starring David Allan Grier, is, uh,
watchable. But ``Cursed'' (which gets the post-``Friends'' Thursday
slot) and ``Tucker'' are like Satan's yardstick, the device by
which truly awful television is measured. The aforementioned Bleeth
show on NBC is called ``Titans'' because ``Rich, Messed-Up People
Having Sex'' wouldn't fit in TV grids.
</P>
<P>
   And the pilot for ``The Michael Richards Show'' has been
scrapped and is being redone from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Come fall, there will be much, much more. Consider yourself
warned.

 &HT;    At 61, Kenny Rogers is the oldest in CMA history to be up for
contemporary award
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting on the sofa in his Alpharetta mansion, country superstar
Kenny Rogers is surrounded by the kind of tokens of success that
would make any 61-year-old grateful for a winning ride.
</P>
<P>
   His massive living room looks designer perfect, as if poised for
the next gawking tour of homes _ black lacquer furniture,
cream-and-taupe upholstery, family photos grouped in silver frames.
On the wall are dozens of autographed photos: Kenny with a former
president (George Bush). Kenny with Lionel Richie. Kenny with Dolly
Parton. A massive, floor-to-ceiling cabinet, encased in
look-but-don't-touch glass, holds the awards _ two gold gramophones
for his Grammy wins, three shelves of crystal American Music
Awards, a slew of engraved statuettes signifying he was the
People's Choice for such 1970s hits as ``The Gambler,'' ``Coward of
the County'' and ``Lucille.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that this is the home of someone who has
made it, the framed sheet music to ``We Are the World'' _
autographed by everyone from Michael Jackson to Cyndi Lauper _ is
carefully encased behind a frame over the fireplace (the music was
given to artists, such as Rogers, who participated in the monster
fund-raiser, the first of a long string of '80s ``cause''
projects).
</P>
<P>
   But this morning, as the sun comes up over the trimmed golf
course that slopes down from Rogers' back yard, the singer isn't
getting ready to tee off, catalog his awards or inspect his stock
portfolios online. In fact, taking it easy is the last thing on
Kenny Rogers' mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I really wanted?'' he says, his thick hand
casually tugging on his famous white beard. ``I didn't want to die
somewhere without having had a hit since 1985. I didn't want to go
out like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four decades into a recording career, Rogers isn't going out at
all.
</P>
<P>
   On this hot August morning, 300 miles away in Nashville, young
country starlet Lee Ann Womack is reciting the names of the most
recent Country Music Association award nominees for TV cameras.
Sandwiched in between such 20-something acts as Faith Hill and Brad
Paisley is Rogers, whose song ``Buy Me a Rose'' has been nominated
for single of the year.
</P>
<P>
   What Womack doesn't say is how utterly unlikely this moment is.
</P>
<P>
   Casually munching on a sausage bagel (``Oops,'' he says, at a
tray table in the kitchen. ``You caught me eating my McDonald's''),
Rogers seems remarkably nonplussed calm to have just become one of
the oldest artists in the history of the CMA awards to be nominated
for a major, contemporary trophy. While most of his peers wish for
one last gasp of notoriety _ perhaps a plaque in the Hall of Fame
or at least an episode on A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' _ Rogers has bucked
the system to become a player in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   His latest album, ``She Rides Wild Horses,'' was recently
certified platinum. The hit single ``Buy Me a Rose'' shot up
country charts _ past acts more than half his age _ to hit the No.
1 spot. His current single, ``He Will, She Knows,'' is also
climbing Billboard charts with a bullet. While many of his
contemporaries have retired to group-tour dinner theaters in
Branson, Mo., Rogers is in the middle of a cross-country tour of
major venues, including the Fox Theatre on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   What are the odds of a grandfatherly singer having such a career
resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   ``A million to one,'' says Phyllis Stark, editor of the country
charts for Billboard magazine. ``He was fighting a bias at country
radio against older artists, and against his own image. For years,
he was sort of perceived as someone that would appear on your
father's country station. The younger, hipper, hot country stations
weren't about to play Kenny Rogers, even to say his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers discovered that truth the hard way, more than a decade
ago, via an incident in an Athens grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother-in-law was in line buying groceries, and I was there
on the cover of People magazine. The fellow (at the cash register)
didn't know who she was, and he said, `If I see this guy on the
front of one more magazine, I'm gonna throw up.' At that point I
said, `Stop. Back up. I don't want to do anything else.' That's the
moment when the grass roots come up and tell you what's going on.
And they were sick of Kenny Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Michael Jackson and his glove or Madonna and her bustier,
the silver-haired crooner realized his smooth, master-of-ceremonies
style had become a caricature of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   At that same time, the city that Rogers had ruled for more than
a decade was going through a fairly radical makeover. By the early
1990s, Nashville stars were no longer middle-aged, pop-oriented
acts turning out such crossover tunes as Rogers' zillion-selling,
pillow-talk hit ``Lady.'' They were young, brash and wearing cowboy
hats. As artists such as Garth Brooks began dominating country
charts, Rogers retreated to his Athens, Ga. farm (where he was
living with fourth wife Marianne) to contemplate his future.
</P>
<P>
   He studied photography. He played golf. He immersed himself in
business ventures, such as his fast-food chain of chicken
restaurants, Kenny Rogers' Roasters. His marriage fell apart. Then
the tabloids got wind of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by three
women who claimed Rogers engaged them in kinky phone sex. Suddenly,
the publicity machine that had made him a star was eating him
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that people who are truly successful
create their own demise,'' he says today, reflecting on a darker
period in his life. ``I think you get to the point in your life
where you say, `You know what? Success is not as important as my
life.' And when you are that successful, you have no life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers made a different kind of life for himself _ which
included meeting and marrying Valdosta native Wanda Miller, 32, and
auctioning off his palatial Athens estate (to two men who later
backed out of the agreement) _ and moved to the landscaped suburbs
of north Atlanta. He started making music again, only to discover
he was out of step with the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a new record out, and was going to radio stations to get
audience reaction. But here's what I realized,'' he says, flashing
back three years. ``Everyone wanted to interview me. They were
totally in awe of what I had accomplished, and they'd talk about
how good I had been for country music. But they could care less
about what I was doing now. They'd put on my new song, turn it
down, talk over it. No one would listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mitchell, program director of Atlanta country station
Y-106.7, recalls the post-Garth days when Rogers couldn't get
noticed: ``He hadn't had a hit record on the radio in years. And he
wasn't even getting much airplay of the songs he had had on the
radio in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching his singles drop off music charts as fast as they
were released, Rogers came to a startling conclusion: ``All of the
people who were in radio when I had my success were gone. That was
a sad realization. ...I knew that if I was ever going to make it, I
had to reinvent myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rogers opened his own record label, Dreamcatcher
Entertainment, with just one artist: himself. He then spent months
looking for new songs, eventually turning to old friend Don
Schlitz, the man who wrote Rogers' signature piece, ``The
Gambler.'' Schlitz had penned a sweet tune about a little boy
playing baseball called ``The Greatest,'' the kind of meandering
story song Rogers has always delivered so well.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying only an acoustic guitar, Rogers began playing the tune
on the air at country radio stations. His timing was impeccable: It
was spring 1999 _ the beginning of baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had this theory that if you tear yourself down,
people always build you up,'' he says. ``So on the air, I would
say, `I don't know whether people out there would care to hear this
song,' and inevitably the phones would light up.''
</P>
<P>
   Billboard's Stark says the grass-roots demand for ``The
Greatest'' was ``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That record came completely out of left field, and he worked
it like you wouldn't believe,'' she says. ``Kenny did a smart
thing. He didn't lower himself by calling stations that weren't
playing the record and beg for airplay. He's beyond that. He called
stations that were already playing it and thanked them.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for ``The Greatest'' was unlike anything Nashville
has seen in years. As soon as Rogers would perform the song in
studios of large and small radio stations, listeners would call to
request the tune. He opened ballgames, did interviews with
small-town papers, and generally made the public remember that he
was, well, a really nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some million-selling pop artists, who tend to wander
through their accomplishments like jaded royalty, Rogers exudes an
uncanny sense of how to navigate today's music business. He
analyzes it like a card dealer at a game, raising his fingers in
front of his face to draw an imaginary rectangle, calling country
radio ``a box.'' Pointing to the left, he cites the careers of
pop-leaning artists such as Shania Twain and Garth Brooks. Moving
his hand to the right, he talks about steel guitars, banjo and
songs about drinkin' and cheatin'.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was crossing over between pop and country decades
before today's hot acts ever held a microphone, Rogers believes he
has found himself somewhere in the middle of the pop vs. twang
debate. A new album, set for release in October, sounds decidedly
more country than many of today's rock-influenced Nashville hits,
with guest vocals by such traditionalists as Diamond Rio and
Paisley. ``Buy Me a Rose,'' the song that earned a CMA nomination,
features the pure mountain vocals of fiddle queen Alison Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I've included the country community with me on there,''
he says. ``For a while we thought we might go down the Americana
road. And if I have two or three hits off this record, I can do
anything I want. I can move the (country) box. But you've got to be
really careful when you pull power plays. Like, I think Garth
Brooks made a tragic mistake on (the way he handled the career of
his alter ego, rocker Chris Gaines). Musically, it was better than
anything I've ever heard him do. ... But that is one of the
tragedies. It's like the more you see somebody, as a rule, the less
you like them. He's doing exactly what he should do right now _
taking a couple of years off and getting out of the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' 10-year disappearing act may be the best career move he
has ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, executive director of the Nashville-based Country
Radio Broadcasters Association, says it's rare for an artist to
have not just one comeback, but two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anybody else who has come back as often as he
has. Remember, when he was with the First Edition, he was playing
rock. Then he paused, and came back in country. Now he's taken
another pause, and he's back again. I really think he is one of the
smartest people when it comes to the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking out a wide picture window at the sunlight bouncing off
his swimming pool, Rogers doesn't look like a man who is planning
to pause ever again. With 19 million-selling albums, he doesn't
need the money. His trophy cases barely hold room for another
award. His look _ the silver-tinged hair, neatly trimmed beard and
round cheeks _ is much like it was in his '80s heyday, though the
famously crinkly eyes appear to have been tucked and he's mixed a
little light red into his trademark gray locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody got on this new, young country thing, but what I
kept saying is, `Hey, guys, all you're doing is building
obsolescence.' You can be new but once, and only young for a while.
Look, we're not athletes. We shouldn't have to retire at 25 or
30.... You really need three things in life to be happy: You need
someone to love. Something to do. And something to look forward
to.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Rogers is looking forward to tomorrow. And the day
after that. Throughout his career, he never drank or smoked, and
credits his clean health habits for the energy he feels today.
However, longevity is on his mind. He chats about spending an
entire day at the doctor's to keep a close check on his heart. He
travels only on the weekends, avoids the Nashville party scene and
gets up with the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a contemporary hit record changes everything. It
changes the audience's perception of me and, more importantly, it
changes my perception of myself,'' he says. ``When I walk on the
stage, I am no longer someone doing hits from the '80s. I am a
factor in the music business. And there is nothing worse than being
a nonfactor. ... As you get older, you stop striving for success
and start striving for significance. I think that's kind of where I
am. This is not about money, it's about a place in history.''

 &HT;    Role-playing fans snap up copies of new handbook
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dungeons &AMP; Dragons, the ``mother of all role-playing games,''
has produced its first offspring in more than a decade. There's a
new player's handbook for the game in which participants act out
adventures filled with monsters and magic, wizards and warring
tribes. In the second day of sales Friday, metro Atlanta dealers
reported that D&AMP;D devotees had snapped up virtually every copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenal, just phenomenal,'' said Kirk Stephens, owner of
the War Room, a 4,000-square-foot game, model and book store in
Norcross, Ga. ``Sales have been going crazy. We got 50 in
yesterday, and they're just about all spoken for. I'm getting 20
more today, and expect they'll be gone over the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same story at Titan Comics in Tucker. ``We ordered
three (12-book) cases and have gone through two cases and have only
four books left in the last case,'' said Roger Davis, who works in
the store. ``It's been pretty brisk, like the Christmas season.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Johnson, a 13-year veteran of playing D&AMP;D, walked in less
than five minutes after Titan Comics opened for business Friday. He
headed straight for the new handbook, which is the third version of
the rules since the game came out 26 years ago. Johnson, a
23-year-old employee of a technology company who lives in the
Northlake area, said the friends with whom he regularly plays D&AMP;D
also are eager to see what has changed in this complicated game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping they've cleared up some of the rules problems that
they've had,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says D&AMP;D creators have removed some of the arcane rules.
``There are things like mathematical calculations for the strength
of armor that have been taken out.''
</P>
<P>
   The new handbook won't appease critics who accuse D&AMP;D of
inciting teen violence. The game still calls for players to immerse
themselves in an imaginary world in which survival depends on
vanquishing foes, with weapons ranging from magic spells to bloody
swordplay.
</P>
<P>
   While Seattle-based Wizards of the Coast, which created and
markets the game, said the new handbook is more inviting for novice
players, Davis said the game remains beyond most young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People under 12 don't have a chance,'' he said. ``It's played
by people 16 and over mostly. It's not for young kids. That's what
Pokemon is for.''

U.S. TEMPORARILY HALTS TRADE IN ARGENTINE BEEF 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The United States and Argentina have
temporarily halted trade in Argentine beef because of concerns of a
possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease here.
</P>
<P>
   In statements Friday, the two governments called the step
precautionary and said the disease did not pose a long-term threat
to the growing trade in one of Argentina's most popular exports.
Nevertheless, the halt in shipments is more bad news for President
Fernando de la Rua in his lagging efforts to pry Argentina out of a
two-year recession.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's quota of beef sales to the United States is 20,000
tons a year and it is lobbying hard to increase the quota. The
United States refused fresh Argentine beef until 1997, when the
Agriculture Department lifted a ban linked to recurrent outbreaks
of foot-and-mouth disease in the early part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine beef has become a gastronomic fashion in much of the
United States. Fed on grass rather than corn and allowed to roam on
the pampas, Argentine cattle produce beef that is lean and tasty,
if slightly chewy.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a week ago, Argentine officials found antibodies for
foot-and-mouth disease in 10 head of cattle smuggled from
neighboring Paraguay. Foot-and-mouth, rarely suffered by humans
although they can be carriers, is a virus characterized by fever,
weight loss and mouth blisters. As a precaution, the Argentine
government ordered the slaughter of 3,000 head of cattle in
northern Formosa, Corrientes and Entre Rios Provinces and suspended
most exports of fresh beef, not only to the United States, but also
to Canada, Venezuela, Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the cattle with the antibodies were not
actually sick.
</P>
<P>
   After Argentina took action, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
put a ``temporary hold'' on fresh, chilled or frozen Argentine
beef. Cooked and canned beef imports will still be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Antonio Berhongaray said Friday that his
government took Washington's action in stride. ``There is no
inclination on the part of the United States to prohibit the import
of Argentine beef,'' Berhongaray said. ``This was a move that was
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement Friday, the American Embassy praised
Argentina for taking prompt action. ``As soon as this situation is
resolved,'' the statement read, ``exports of fresh beef will be
able to resume.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth largest beef exporter, Argentina expected to sell
350,000 tons of beef products abroad this year. Three months ago,
international monitors declared Argentine beef free of
foot-and-mouth disease, a finding that officials had hoped would
help them increase exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina made the decision to cease meat exports until the
sanitary situation is resolved,'' the Argentine Agriculture
Department said in a statement that predicted a resolution of the
problem in a week.

   &QR;  Resides: Primary residence in Cartersville. Also owns a
vacation home in Destin, Fla., and a cabin in the Alaska wilderness
outside Anchorage.
</P>

   &QR;  All in the family: Thompson is the divorced dad of a daughter,
18, and son, 17. His older brother, Dent Thompson, is vice
president of the Cartersville firms, where Mark Thompson's
British-born fiance, Jackie Sawyer, also works. His late father,

 &HT;    Potter series reaps both applause, censure from religious
readers, leaders
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maureen Lovett would rather eat a whole bag of
earwax-flavored Bertie Bott's jelly beans than give up her family's
Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett and her five children, ages 8 to 23, are self-described
``Harry Potter junkies'' who attended five parties last month
celebrating the debut of the latest volume in the wildly popular
children's fantasy series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get enough of that Potter stuff!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To Connie Snellbacher, none is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be considered a religious fanatic but our
values are important to us and we would like to put better material
in front of our child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett, a Catholic mom from Chamblee, Ga., and Snellbacher, who
attends a Southern Baptist church in northwest Cobb, represent
extremes in the divergent views of the nerdy little wizard whose
most astonishing trick may be enticing children to turn off their
video games and turn the pages of books instead.

   For the hopelessly Muggle-minded, here's a synopsis:
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter is introduced in volume one, ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone,'' as an 11-year-old orphan living with the
Dursleys, a mean aunt and uncle who make him sleep in a cupboard
under the stairs while they indulge their darling son, Dudley. But
Harry, as it turns out, is really a wizard whose parents were
murdered by the evil Voldemort, who also tried to kill the infant
Harry. As a result of the encounter, Harry has a lightning
bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Harry is soon off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
with friends who help him understand the difference between the
Muggle world of his aunt and uncle and the world of magic, and who
introduce him to goodies such as Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans
(that means every flavor).
</P>
<P>
   The four volumes in what is intended to be a seven-volume series
have broken all kinds of publication records _ including the
largest first-printing in history for volume four (3.8 million in
the United States alone). They have also become the most
complained-about books in the country, according to the American
Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   The little wizard and his creator, British author J.K. Rowling,
are sparking philosophical, ethical and theological discussions
usually reserved for much heavier works of art.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning bolt on Harry's head represents an ``S'' for Satan
and the books are tools of the devil to ensnare the world's
children, according to Berit Kjos. ``If you get them when they are
young, then you have them for life,'' he says on his
nondenominational ministry's Web site, headquartered in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine Christianity Today, founded by evangelist Billy
Graham, editorialized, ``Rowling's series is a `Book of Virtues'
with a pre-adolescent funny bone. Amid the laugh-out-loud scenes
are wonderful examples of compassion, loyalty, courage, friendship
and even self-sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   The books have been compared to C.S. Lewis' ``Chronicles of
Narnia'' and the fantasy novels of J.R.R. Tolkien and George
MacDonald. New Yorker critic Joan Acocella even related them to
Milton, as in ``Paradise Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject of the Harry Potter series is power, an important
matter for children, since they have so little of it,'' Acocella
writes. ``How does one acquire power? How can it be used well, and
ill? Does ultimate power lie with the good? In other words, is
there a God? If so, why is there so much cruelty around? These are
questions that Milton, among others, addressed before Rowling, and
she is not ashamed to follow in their wake.''
</P>
<P>
   The books answer a deep human hunger that goes back through
history as people have used stories to communicate transcendent
truths, says Rolland Hein, professor emeritus of English at Wheaton
College in Illinois and author of ``Christian Mythmakers,'' a book
about Christian writers of fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cannot live without myth,'' he said. ``I think the
contemporary mind is starved.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Harry and company, ``I don't have a great deal of
enthusiasm for Rowling and what she's doing,'' he says, ``but it
could be a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Harry Potter books say they are concerned that:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Harry Potter glorifies onmagical humans, are portrayed at best
as dull and at worst as sinister.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Harry and his friends practice situational ethics with an
end-justifies-the-means view.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There is no clear theology of the source of power and
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario of poor misunderstood Harry finding acceptance
among witches and wizards perpetuates the appeal of the occult,
says Marcia Montenegro, a former Atlanta astrologer who now lives
in Arlington, Va., operating a ministry called Christian Answers
for the New Age. ``I talk to a lot of teenagers who are involved in
the occult and witchcraft. It seems for a lot of them, it is an
escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the rules
</P>
<P>
   John Andrew Murray, who taught at Whitefield Academy and
Westminster Schools in metro Atlanta before becoming headmaster of
Raleigh's St. Timothy's-Hale private Episcopal school this year,
says he is also concerned about witchcraft in the Harry Potter
books. But he is even more worried that children may emulate other
aspects: Harry and his friends lie and steal and break rules to
achieve their purposes. ``There are no absolute truths here,''
Murray says. ``You do what's right in your own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry's defenders counter that the books present a classic
battle in which good prevails over evil and that witchcraft and
magic are just tricks of the storyteller's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Author Rowling says she is not trying to encourage children to
take up witchcraft and finds the idea ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have met thousands of children now, and not even one time
has a child come up to me and said, `Ms. Rowling, I'm so glad I've
read these books because now I want to be a witch,''' she told CNN.
``They see it for what it is. It is a fantasy world, and they
understand that completely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Harry,'' says Hazel Karp, media specialist at
Greenfield Hebrew Academy of Atlanta. Within Harry's world, Karp
says, ``these are the values _ compassion and friendship and
loyalty to one's friends. Heroism. Being able to stick it out and
do what's expected of you even if you don't like it. Being
courageous. Being a good sport. Being generous is important, too.
That comes through all the books. To me, the values are universal
and the story is fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harry does flout the rules, he feels guilty, points out
Alan Jacobs, professor of English at Wheaton College. In an article
in the Christian magazine First Things, Jacobs writes, ``Rowling's
moral compass ... is sound _ indeed, I would say, acute.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their other-worldly setting, the books help readers face
a very real ethical difficulty of today _ technology, according to
Jacobs. Just as Harry and his friends must try to learn to use
their magical powers wisely, today's society has to come to terms
with its inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who have given serious consideration to the Harry
Potter books find them much like Bertie Bott's beans _ a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's theology is ``a hodgepodge'' of traditional
Judeo-Christian values, occult practices and secular elements, says
Lindy Beam, a youth culture analyst for the Christian organization
Focus on the Family. Parents need to be prepared to help their
children sort out the meaning for themselves, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Certain situations from Harry Potter books can even serve as
``trail markers'' to point to God, says Anne McCain, a Virginia
children's minister who wrote an analysis of Harry Potter for
World, a Christian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mirror of Erised'' (read Erised backward) in the first
book _ which shows people their deepest wants _ can be used to
spark a discussion of contentment, values and the longing for God,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have pressed me _ are the books good or are they bad?''
she says. ``They're neither.''
</P>
<P>
   WGST radio talk show host Ian Punnett, who examines contemporary
issues of ethical concern, has featured the Harry Potter books on
several shows. Punnett, a student at Columbia Theological Seminary
in Decatur, Ga., says he finds many good values exemplified, but is
``challenged'' by the need of Harry and his friends for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   When reading the books with his two young sons, ``at times when
Harry finds himself wanting to get back at someone, we use that as
a sort of talking point about why we try harder to avoid the need
for revenge than Harry does,'' Punnett says.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to his callers and other parents: ``It's important to
think critically all the time. Come to the conclusion that's right
for you and reflects your family's values, and have the courage to
stick with it.''

<P>
   If you don't know Jack, check out the new 16,000-square-foot
Jack Daniel Distillery Visitor Center in the tiny burg of
Lynchburg, in south central Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance, say howdy and ``Happy 150th Birthday'' to
Jasper Newton ``Jack'' Daniel, specifically, a 1,800-pound marble
sculpture of the pioneering distiller. The life-size statue _ all
of 5-foot-2 _ was moved to the visitors center after having stood
guard at Cave Spring since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 people are expected this year to take one of
the free daily guided tours. The tours show each step of the
process by which Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has been made
since 1866, making it the oldest registered distillery in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor center houses more than 30 exhibits and displays
about Daniel and his whiskey and includes a video presentation.
You'll learn such facts as: When Jack was 13, he and his cousin
Button drove wagonloads of whiskey down to Alabama where they sold
it to Civil War soldiers. And he steadfastly refused to grind more
than 99 pounds of corn a day to keep the government from stationing
a ``revenuer'' at the distillery.
</P>
<P>
   You'll know Jack, but you won't sample his whiskey (unless you
buy a commemorative decanter for $37.98). Moore County remains dry.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Visitor center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New
Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Upcoming events: Jack Daniel's
Birthday Party and antique car show Sept. 2 and Jack Daniel's BBQ

 &HT;    Midway Atoll: At peace in the Pacific
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDWAY ATOLL _ As viewed out the window of our plane banking
toward the runway, these three North Pacific lily pads hardly seem
big enough to harbor all the history, nature and hope that have
survived here. But Midway Atoll looms large in American military
and natural history, and the native Atlantan piloting our
Gulfstream G-I, Mark Thompson, has invested millions to ensure its
future, so others can appreciate it _ and never forget.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Thompson and his newly incorporated Carters-
</P>
<P>
   ville-based firm, Midway Phoenix Corp., entered into a
one-of-a-kind cooperative agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to operate the atoll when the Midway Naval Air Facility
closed. At no cost to the American government or taxpayers,
Thompson's company maintains the imposing infrastructure for what
is now the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in exchange for
being allowed to run a low-impact eco-resort on the largest and
only inhabited of the three isles. The Fish and Wildlife Service
focuses on animal and habitat conservation and education.
</P>
<P>
   Visitation is limited to 100 at a time on the atoll, nesting
ground of nearly 1 million Laysan albatrosses (the world's largest
colony of ``gooney birds''), 14 other species of migratory
seabirds, the endangered Hawaiian monk seal and plenty more marine
life. Tourists sleep in handsomely updated 1950s officers quarters
on Sand Island, 2 1/2 miles long and 1 1/2 miles wide, and dine in
the old galley or a chic new beachside French restaurant tended by
a Paris chef. They pass their days viewing the wildlife, searching
out military memorials and artifacts or enjoying typical resort
diversions: fishing, scuba diving, swimming, sunbathing, bicycling
or plain goofing off. It's the first time the public has had a
chance to experience Midway in more than five decades.
</P>
<P>
   From our bird's-eye vantage point, the atoll appears the
definition of pacific: at peace. West of Honolulu by 1,200 miles,
2,600 miles east of Tokyo, 140 miles east of the international date
line, in a time zone virtually its own, it floats tranquilly, its
turquoise lagoon a jewel set against the vast, deep, dark blue
ocean. A bridal veil of white surf defines the 6-mile-diameter
coral reef, formed millions of years ago on the slopes of a
volcano, and sugar-white beaches outline the three islands within
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sand Island's 7,940-foot runway (as well as the one no longer in
use and quickly returning to nature on neighboring Eastern Island)
was integral in the heroic 1942 battle considered the World War II
turning point in the Pacific theater. It was also key in the
transfer of Midway's custody from the Navy to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. Without a private-sector partner versed in
running an airport, which Midway Phoenix's sister corporation does
in Cartersville, Fish and Wildlife probably would have been forced
to operate the refuge as a remote field camp with minimal or no
public access.
</P>
<P>
   That would've been fine for the gooneys and other fauna. But
Fish and Wildlife's Pacific Islands operations manager Robert Smith
says it would have been ``a tragedy'' for any American interested
in the legendary battle. Here, the patriotic can see firsthand
where outmanned U.S. forces ambushed the Japanese fleet, inflicting
heavy losses, including 3,500 soldiers, 300 planes and four
aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   It's that potent combination of blood and beauty that captured
the imagination of Thompson, 49, when he began landing at Midway,
to refuel and occasionally bunk overnight, beginning in the
mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   An Army helicopter pilot in the Vietnam era, Thompson has
charted an intriguing professional course since his 1972 honorable
discharge. He went from running a parachute jump business to flying
freight, to working as an Alaska bush pilot, to starting a new, and
ultimately ultra-successful, aviation company to haul explosives as
a Department of Defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility and contacts that his firm, Phoenix Air Group,
gained internationally on those dangerous missions paved the way, a
dozen years ago, for its transition into a new role as a provider
of electronic warfare training to a host of U.S. and international
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's firm, named after the mythic bird that symbolizes
Atlanta's rise from the ashes, became a regular in the remote
Pacific. And Phoenix's success brought him riches to afford his own
stock-car racing team and countless other pricey toys, as well as a
quiet confidence to itch for even bigger challenges.
</P>
<P>
   That itch got a good scratching in the early '90s, when he
landed at Midway and heard the first rumblings of the Department of
Defense's plan to close the base, one in a series of post-Cold War
cuts. Not only would the airfield be closed, Thompson was told,
most everything would be demolished and the island returned to
nature _ all that history mothballed, buried or hauled away.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, whose sly sense of humor and insouciant flyboy
demeanor somewhat obscure a lavalike intensity, couldn't believe
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearl Harbor gtest naval defeat. Yet Midway, which was the
greatest naval victory in American history, was going to be
abandoned,'' he says, his disbelief still as hot as embers. ``The
fact is, at Midway, lots and lots of Americans died so that people
today can sit at home and watch CNN on their color TVs and have
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to come off like a ``flag waver,'' Thompson pauses
and measures his words. ``I think this is _ and I don't want to
sound strange here _ hallowed ground. And yet they were going to
close it. It was like, `See ya.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Midway, the old veteran, had found a new defender.
</P>
<P>
   `No place like this'
</P>
<P>
   In the galley, holding a food tray with enough mileage on it to
be a Korean War relic, I met Norm Isaacs, host of ESPN's ``Inside
Big Game Fishing.'' We had just arrived. He, having taped fin
features around Midway for three weeks, was heading back to Hawaii
on the regular Aloha Airlines flight that night.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to have hooked a fresh ear, Capt. Norm boasted of catching
(and releasing) three marlin in the neighborhood of 500 pounds _
each _ offshore. ``It's not like if you don't get a marlin, you
don't get anything,'' he added. ``You can get your arms pulled off
by big wahoo or yellowfin tuna or. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   But Norm had something more than fish tales to share. Smiling
serenely, like a sun-baked Yoda, he said sagely, ``You won't want
to leave. There is no place like this anywhere. You have to be here
to fully understand it. By the time you leave, you'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure what ol' Norm meant, and wondered if he'd been
bobbing on boats for a few too many days, but I was curious to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial impression at least, Midway doesn't look all that
cosmic _ it's more lost-in-the-'50s Mayberry than mystical
Marrakech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Town Center'' is a walking-distance circle of winding roads
dotted with white-painted, cinder-block former officers' homes
fronted by low fences and banana plants, hibiscus and other
flowering shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are the guest quarters, where we were whisked from the
airport _ well, as much as a loaded-down golf cart can whisk. The
rooms' glossy white-painted cinder-block walls, spotless gray
carpeting and slow-moving ceiling fans convey ``cool,'' and they
are as nice, if more austere than, those at a good chain hotel.
Despite the makeover, the three-story former officers quarters are
still called Bravo and Charlie, typical of the way the island is
being modernized while maintaining the thread of the past.
</P>
<P>
   As all-American as Midway's '40s- and '50s-built structures make
it appear, its ethnic flavor sneaks up on you. As was the case when
the Navy ran the atoll, the workers, who keep the power running and
water treated and all the other services going required in any
small town, are mostly foreign nationals. Along with 30 Americans,
there are 120 workers who hail from Thailand, Sri Lanka and the
Philippines. Their retreating presence _ a smile and a nod or wave,
but rarely any words _ is most clearly felt at the cafeteria line,
where a flavorful pork adobo might be warming beside the
standard-issue fries or spaghetti and meat sauce. In this galley,
Aunt Bee more likely would be whipping up some green curry and rice
than a blueberry pie _ or maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   That was just one small way that Midway veered from
expectations. As I explored Sand Island, my whole sense of
perspective got off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the bigger-than-life scale of the military
infrastructure _ the massive pipelines at the fueling dock, the
water tower and tanks capable of storing 17 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
   But empty streets and the occasional driveway leading to nowhere
also made me cognizant of open fields where once there were
workplaces and homes for military personnel and their families _
4,000 residents during the Vietnam-era peak. For instance, all that
remains of the George Cannon School _ named for the hero who
refused to leave Midway's command post despite being mortally
wounded in shelling from Japanese ships returning from Pearl Harbor
_ is the marble marker out front. The school was one of more than
100 buildings razed during the Base Realignment and Closure
procedure that was part of the atoll's transfer to the Interior
Department (which runs Fish and Wildlife).
</P>
<P>
   In handing over the ``key to Midway'' (appropriately, in the
shape of a Laysan albatross), Navy Secretary John Dalton proclaimed
that the government was ``trading guns for goonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, plenty of a military nature remains, some of it off
unpaved paths that cut through thickets of ironwood trees. The
wandering guest can find a tiny graveyard for military doctors,
rusted weapons arsenals hiding under mounded soil, even the
battle-scarred command center where Cannon perished, becoming the
first Marine Medal of Honor recipient from the Pacific theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find unexploded ordnance, please don't bring it into my
office,'' ranger Jennifer Schramm warned us during orientation,
garnering a laugh but not kidding. ``Mark it on your map and show
us.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where I went with my map, I was struck by how huge
little Sand Island seemed. The quietude had something to do with
it, as did the wide, long beaches, where I was more likely to
encounter a Hawaiian monk seal taking a siesta than a sunning
tourist. But at some point it finally dawned on me that the sense
of vastness I was feeling had more to do with the endless Pacific
than our wee place in it.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never felt so much like a speck in my life. Not that I was
complaining, cooled as I was by subtropical easterly winds by day,
watching billions and billions of stars and silver-edged clouds
float across the sky at night, all the while inhaling deeply the
cleanest air I've ever breathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sit by the beach at night, you can't help but be awed
by the whole universe,'' said Pete Hansen, a California State
University professor emeritus. He visited in July as part of a
National Science Foundation-funded course that he hopes will be the
first step toward establishing a permanent teaching center on
Midway.
</P>
<P>
   Miracles of nature are almost commonplace here, and visitors
have the rare opportunity to witness some from an intimate
distance.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if most of the seabirds don't seem particularly
alarmed when humans are nearby, it's because they have important
business to conduct. They are pelagic _ of the ocean _ and they
need terra firma only to perpetuate their species. ``The only thing
they haven't figured out how to do on water is lay their eggs and
nest,'' explains Fish and Wildlife Pacific chief Smith. ``These
birds are hard-wired to return to Midway to reproduce and bring up
their young.''
</P>
<P>
   An astounding 2 million birds visit the atoll yearly. Alas, we
managed to miss the star attraction, the nearly half-million pairs
of Laysan albatrosses _ representing 70 percent of the breeding
population worldwide _ that nest here November to May. The goonies,
graceful in air with a nearly 6 1/2-foot wingspan, clumsy on the
ground, have the absolute run of the place _ nesting almost
everywhere and clacking, lowing and clambering about deep into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   But we were more than taken by the fairy terns, snow-white
creatures that swoop down and flutter right in front of visitors'
faces _ blurring the line between watcher and watchee. These
seabirds don't bother building a nest; they lay a single speckled
egg directly on a branch or other surface. Perhaps because of that
precarious arrangement, the parents serve up meals of freshly
snagged whole fish or squid. Under the eaves of the French
restaurant, the Clipper House, I saw one chick very slowly choke
down a guppy that was almost as big as he was.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't my most unforgettable nature moment.
</P>
<P>
   It came one afternoon on a fishing boat, heading out to go
snorkeling. As soon as we got far enough from the marina to
accelerate, we were out of nowhere joined by a school of 20
Hawaiian spinner dolphins that cavorted beside and in front of the
vessel like a class of kindergartners at White Water. Overhead,
perhaps sensing a fish snack in their future, a flock of sooty
terns had taken flight. I couldn't stop staring at their white
underwings, which looked solid aqua from the reflection of the
water _ which itself, of course, takes its color from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Words barely do this scene justice _ you really needed to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   I was starting to see what Capt. Norm was talking about. I was
starting to sound like him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Man with a vision
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Mark Thompson heard that Midway stood a real chance
of being closed, he began brainstorming ways to make it
self-sustaining. He figured selling fuel to military aircraft and
ships would be a steady revenue stream. He thought he could strike
a deal with Boeing, which had a vested interest in keeping Midway's
airport open _ to meet a federal regulation in case of an emergency
involving one of its extended-range twin-engine 777 jets crossing
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism, the third moneymaking idea he arrived at, was way
outside his usual realm, but he was excited by the idea of
Americans getting to experience the beauty and emotion of a place
so long off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Air's board didn'tHe hung tough, and his advisers,
recognizing how strongly he felt, ultimately deferred to his
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a bit of a bumpy flight since Thompson founded Midway
Phoenix, signed the 20-year agreement with Fish and Wildlife and
set out to save the little atoll that casts a giant shadow.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $4 million a year to keep Midway running, and Thompson
figured at best he could break even. The one thing he hadn't
counted on was how tough it would be to get tourists to make the
pilgrimage. Until recently, he was paying Aloha $64,000 a week for
twice-a-week charter service from Honolulu, and admitted that only
a handful of flights weren't money losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up in the morning and Midway cost you another $8,000
or $10,000 last night,'' he complained when we visited last summer.
``It's a substantial hit. It's not like I'm Ted Turner. I'm
light-years away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, while the partnership with Fish and Wildlife
has basically been solid, there have been some tensions in trying
to balance the rules of wildlife protection and the rights of the
paying customer. Thompson cracked sarcastically that Fish and
Wildlife's initial orientation sessions were so hard-line that it
was if guests were being welcomed to Alcatraz, not Midway.
</P>
<P>
   The ironwood trees, which provide shade and a windbreak but are
invasive nonnatives, became a particularly contentious matter. Fish
and Wildlife removed a forest's worth from uninhabited Eastern
Island, believing it to be impenetrable for goonies and other
long-wingspan birds in search of nesting habitat. That was fine
with Thompson, but he objected when trees were poisoned on Sand
Island, especially some on the south shore, where more than a few
veterans enjoyed sitting on a bench, looking out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't,'' Thompson recalls, ``impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But those differences have been ironed out, and there is
improved communication between the private and public partners.
There are several other developments over the past year that have
Thompson more optimistic about Midway.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Aloha replaced the charters from Honolulu with
regular scheduled weekly flights on 737s, lowering ticket prices
and Midway Phoenix's expense. Coverage in travel magazines,
including a piece by Paul Theroux in the July/August issue of
Islands, has helped fill more of those seats. There was even a
celebrity sighting at Midway recently: Barbra Streisand and hubby
James Brolin. Increased military refuels and overnight stays, as
well as the prospect of establishing the collegiate learning center
here, bode well, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always viewed Mark as somewhat of a visionary,'' says
Smith, one of Fish and Wildlife's main negotiators in forging the
partnership with Thompson's company. ``Midway probably pushes the
envelope of anyone's vision. It's an enormously complicated
situation and an unprofitable one. But I think it's Mark's way of
giving something back.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of sentiment is a mite mushy for the gung-ho Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a private citizen, keeping an island open for the American
public is insanity,'' he says, before adding drolly, ``but
everyone's got to have a hobby. Ted Turner raises buffalo; I ended
up with an island.''

 &HT;    Books make a connection that can't be found elsewhere
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a time when you're online or out of line, no one has much
good to say about the simple book. Oh, people still buy them and
quite a lot of them. But we'll soon be able to download books like
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Books, after all, are only vessels of information, and that now
can be conveyed electronically. And so there are people gathering
under the elms, waiting rather impatiently to give the book an
indecent burial.
</P>
<P>
   The time might one day come. But before it does, someone should
aver that books were never worth much if they were only
transmitters of ``information.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, they are the expression of a mind.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, while reorganizing the landfill I call my study,
I came upon a yellow pocket-size spiral notebook. I hadn't seen it
since I was in elementary school, but I recognized it at once. In
it, from cover to cover, I had entered words I did not know _
useful everyday words such as ``inveigh'' and gaily unvarnished
words such as ``gimcrackery.'' I wrote the word, the definition
and, in some instances, the sentence in which I'd encountered it.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, for some reason, that many of those words were
furnished by the novels of Jack London. He was not Henry James, but
there it was _ testimony to one mind not fully able to engage
another.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows why things lie in a back corner of the memory,
collecting dust, while more urgent matters _ a meeting, a new
organizational chart _ evaporate like dew drops? Who knows how
ideas leap from the pages of a book, disembodied like ghosts, and
take shape in other minds?
</P>
<P>
   Altering the world in significant ways
</P>
<P>
   Words are only the beginning. Hard or simple, they are both the
kernel and husk, the grain from which ideas sprout. There are no
ideas without words, but it is the ideas that germinate,
challenging and sometimes changing our understanding of the world
and even of ourselves. And the conveyor of ideas has been, for half
a millennium, the book _ taken for granted, under threat of
extinction, unappreciated these days even in its last refuge, the
public library.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is everyone's choice as the engine of change, but
more often than not it has been books and ideas that have altered
the world in significant ways. Examples abound. To name only three,
obvious to anyone who's dabbled in the humanities: Freud's ``The
Interpretation of Dreams,'' Charles Darwin's ``The Origin of
Species'' and the Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas
Jefferson and edited much to Jefferson's displeasure by John Adams.
(Writers and editors are ever at odds, even in rebellion against
authority.)
</P>
<P>
   In our own time, examples are more numerous than we realize.
Modern feminism did not originate with Betty Friedan's ``The
Feminine Mystique,'' published in 1963, but it achieved through
Friedan's book a rejuvenated spirit.
</P>
<P>
   It could almost be said that what we call the environmental
movement did begin with a single book: Rachel Carson's ``Silent
Spring.'' Originally published as a series of articles in The New
Yorker, it created a firestorm that has long since been forgotten.
Carson was a biologist with the soul of a poet. She had written
elegantly about sea life, but was a stranger to the thunderings of
oil men and lumber men and the harrumphing of politicians who did
their bidding. And, of course, she was a woman _ it was 1962, after
all _ and what would a woman know of things inextricably tied to
business and governmental policy? (``The little lady,'' she was
more than once referred to.)
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, Michael Harrington's book ``The Other
America'' was making us aware of poverty even before President
Lyndon Johnson waged war on it. Indeed, the war on poverty had much
of its impetus in Harrington's book. Contrariwise, another book,
``The Unheavenly City,'' by sociologist Edward C. Banfield,
disputed the arguments for the Great Society and provided the
groundwork for the conservatism to come.
</P>
<P>
   Helping us to look inside ourselves
</P>
<P>
   In every decade, a small handful of books set new terms for
public debate, even if they do not alter the landscape. Recall the
chord that Allan Bloom's ``The Closing of the American Mind''
struck in the '80s, remaining atop the best-seller list for the
better part of a year. No one, least of all its publisher, had any
such expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Books reinforce or revise our understanding of what is just and
unjust, of what purposes are served or not served by our social
institutions. And then there are other books that read us more than
we read them, and, in so doing, help us know better who we are.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, preparing for a week at the beach, I conducted my
annual ritual of packing into a bag more books than will get read.
No room could be found for Bloom or Freud, and I don't believe I
even own a copy of ``The Feminine Mystique.'' But along with that
little yellow notebook I came upon a slender edition of Anne Morrow
Lindbergh's ``Gift From the Sea,'' published almost a decade before
anyone had ever heard of Betty Friedan.
</P>
<P>
   Slight in appearance, almost too poetic to be taken seriously,
it is a ``woman's book.'' My older sister told me it had been a
favorite of our mother's, something I had not known. Maybe I should
read it, I told myself, but I never did. Thumbing through it now,
the beneficiary not just of an education she never had but of more
years than were given her, I find not even a single unfamiliar
word. I find instead many familiar ones gracefully arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Their simplicity is deceiving, of course. But they were the
pellucid means by which one mind once engaged another, in ways I
can only guess at, and would now engage mine. In such a way do we
better know not just ourselves but others, too.

EGYPTAIR DOCUMENTS REVEAL MORE ABOUT CO-PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The co-pilot of EgyptAir Flight 990, who US investigators have
alleged may have deliberately crashed the Cairo-bound jet last year
killing everyone on board, was investigated for allegedly exposing
himself in a New York hotel, according to documents released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That revelation was contained in FBI interviews that are part of
more than 1,600 pages of investigative work by the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The documents exacerbated the ill-will between the United States
and Egyptian officials, who find it inconcievable that co-pilot
Gamil El Batouty would take his own life and those of 216 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful examination of the FBI interviews indicates
(Batouty's) behavior in a New York hotel is largely
unsubstantiated,'' said Shaker Kelada, vice president of safety for
EgyptAir and a member of the Egyptian investigative team that
worked with NTSB investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempts to focus on this are a smokescreen _ designed to
divert attention from the fact there is no credible evidence
anywhere to indicate he intentionally dove the aircraft into the
ocean,'' Kelada said.
</P>
<P>
   But NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, in an unsual news conference before
releasing the documents, said, ``Our investigators have determined
that the interview may be relevant to our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB normally releases a packet of documents when it holds a
public hearing into a crash. However, Hall said that the NTSB staff
``had recommended that a hearing not be held on this crash because
they believe there are no unresolved safety issues that require
such a forum.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials have said there was no mechanical, weather or
air-traffic issue to explain the plane's rapid descent from
cruising at an altitude of 33,000 feet and that the only
explanation is the descent was a deliberate action by a crew
member. The plane crashed in the waters off the coast of Nantucket,
Mass. last Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Former NTSB board member Carl Vogt, a Washington lawyer who is
working for the Egyptian government, said he could not recall
another major crash where a public hearing was not held.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir, which is owned by the Egyptian government, issued a
statement saying the Boeing 767 may have crashed because of a
failure of components in the airplane's elevator control system.
The elevator, flaps at the back of the horizontal stabilizer, are
moved to change an airplane's pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released Friday also included an Arabic transcript,
and an English translation, of the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support conflicting versions of how the plane crashed
are using the document to support their version of events.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript, Batouty, a member of the relief crew
who had not been scheduled to fly the plane until much later in the
trip, enters the cockpit shortly after takeoff saying he cannot
sleep and takes the first officer's seat.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, at 1:48 a.m., Capt. Ahmed El Habashy, says,
``Excuse me, Jimmy, while I take a quick trip to the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the sound of an electric seat motor operating and
the sound of the cockpit door being operated. A split second later,
Batouty responds, ``Go ahead please'' and, Habashy continues,
``Before it gets crowded. While they are eating and I'll be back to
you.'' Then there is another sound resembling the cockpit door
being operated.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript indicates the sound of a ``thunk'' and a
``clink'' followed by a cryptic utterance of three syllables with
the accent on the second syllable.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an unusual footnote adds to the mystery: ``The five Arabic
speaking members of the group concur that they do not recognize
this as an Arabic word, words, or phrase,'' the transcript states.
``Four Arabic speaking group members believe that they heard the
words similar to `control it.' One English-speaking member believes
that he heard a word similar to `hydraulic.' The five other members
believe the word(s) were unintelligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine seconds later Batouty whispers ``Tawkalt,'' or, ``I rely on
God,'' a phrase he repeats 10 more times in the next 89 seconds,
before the plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:49 and 44.98 seconds the auto-pilot is disconnected and at
1:49 and 48.42 seconds, Batouty says for the second time, ``I rely
on God.'' Then there are a series of thumps heard and then four
tones similar to the Master Caution aural beeper, as Batouty keeps
repeating, ``I rely on God.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:50.06 Habashy is heard saying, ``What's happening? What's
happening?'' Batouty says, ``I rely on God.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 22 seconds, Habashy repeats the question, saying,
``What's happening Gamil? What's happening?'' He then says, ``What
is this? What is this? Did you shut the engines?''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:50.29 Batouty responds, ``It's shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, over five seconds, Habashy says, ``Pull. Pull with me.
Pull with me. Pull with me.'' Two seconds later, the tape ends.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the voices revealed that ``the speaker of
`tawkalt' and `it's shut' was expressing no more than a first stage
of stress, while the speaker of `pull with me' was expressing a
higher stage of stress in response to the emergency nature of the
situation,'' one NTSB dcoument states.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the plane entered a steeper diver reaching nearly
supersonic speed, Batouty continued to utter ``tawkalt'' in a
passive voice. ``Speech duration often becomes shorter with
increasing psychological stress. However, the speaker of the phrase
`tawkalt' did not appear to display a significant shortening in the
speech duration,'' a NTSB report states.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB offered no analysis with the documents.
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptian sources said Batouty's actions as the plane began
its dive are reasonable, like slowing the engines to try and keep
airspeed down.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been trying to crash the plane, ``he would have locked
the cockpit door, given full power and rolled it over.''
</P>
<P>
   To restart the engines they would have to be shut down and
relit, which is why Habashy was saying ``shut the engines,''
Egyptian soruces believe.
</P>
<P>
   The plane did pull out of its dive and climb before plunging
into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The docket indicates that the aircraft recovered from a sharp
descent during the final movement of the flight, indicative of the
crew's attempt to save the aircraft,'' said Vogt.
</P>
<P>
   That the elevators were split _ Habashy's was trying to give the
plane lift, while Batouty's was pointing the plane down _ does not
indicate a struggle for control of the airplane, but rather could
have resulted from shock waves affecting the surface of the plane
as it reached supersonic speed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For one bright but ultimately fleeting moment in
the 1980s, the financial industry here was as hot as Malibu in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert financier,
presided over an X-shaped desk in Beverly Hills, managing a brain
trust that helped finance the restructuring of Corporate America.
The headquarters for two of the country's largest commercial banks,
Security Pacific Bank and First Interstate, anchored the downtown
business district. And the savings and loan business prospered,
offering cheap loans to home buyers and fueling California's
housing boom.
</P>
<P>
   In a place built on the notion that fantasies can be
manufactured with little more than plywood and good lighting,
financiers became the Hollywood equivalent of bankable stars. Even
Wall Street was awestruck by the hundred-million-dollar bonuses and
huge fees generated by the junk-bond legerdemain of Milken and his
minions.
</P>
<P>
   But fame, like natural beauty, can fade. By the end of the
decade, many of the movers and shakers who enjoyed the city's
moment in the sun were burned badly. Drexel declared bankruptcy in
1990; Milken served time in prison for securities violations. The
major commercial banks were taken over. And many of the savings
institutions, like Columbia Savings and Loan Association, crumbled
under the weight of too much debt.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Silicon Valley, the center up north of almost all
things wired, grew to a point that, though its only game was
venture capital, it could claim status as the financial capital of
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Angelenos have always been adept at reinventing themselves.
And quietly, the city's financial types are trying to do just that.
A new generation of financiers is emerging in Los Angeles,
providing financing in more diverse ways then before.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling idea factories, called ``incubators'' because they
seek to grow new companies quickly, are sprouting up from Pasadena
to Santa Monica. Young, wealthy technology entrepreneurs are
turning themselves into angels _ investors who use their own money
to back ideas in which they believe. Even investment banks are
growing again. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, for example, one of the
premiere Wall Street institutions, has doubled the size of its
banking staff in Los Angeles in the last three years, to 32
professionals, adding bankers to cover the burgeoning new-media
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, the venture capital business has had a
facelift. The number of venture firms based in Los Angeles County
has grown fourfold since 1995, to 32, according to the National
Venture Capital Association.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised, meanwhile, has quadrupled between 1997 and
1999, when it reached $1.34 billion, according to VentureOne Corp.
which also tracks the venture capital industry. That is much more
than in any other county in Southern California, which raised $5.4
billion over all in the last 15 months. Such numbers are sure to
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This level of venture investment will likely transform the
self-image of Los Angeles from an entertainment and defense economy
to an entrepreneurial and technology environment,'' said Dave
Witherow, chief executive of VentureOne in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Los Angeles may never rival Wall Street, with its
abundance of brokerage firms, commercial banks and investment
firms. And it is no sure thing that this generation of financial
innovators will have more staying power than the one that preceded
it. Already, a handful of promising endeavors have not panned out.
</P>
<P>
   And some seasoned venture capitalists are playing down the
prospect that Los Angeles will come into its own anytime soon.
Sure, Silicon Valley financiers are making investments in Southern
California companies. But they are not moving here. Instead, they
are choosing to set up new operations in London or, in the case of
the blue-chip firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers, remain
focused on start-ups close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a decision by omission,'' said John Doerr, a
partner at Kleiner and one of the most sought-after venture
capitalists. While Kleiner plans to make investments in Southern
California companies, he said, it has no plans to open offices
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Chess Game &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An example of the new class of investors that is rising here is
Stephen Rader, a co-founder last May of Clarity Partners, a $1
billion venture firm. For him, the less competition from outsiders
like Doerr, the better. ``This is great to hear,'' he said,
sounding upbeat during an interview in his ninth-floor office not
far from Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. ``They figure they can fly
in and do it? Great,'' he said. ``We are across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles deal makers have been buzzing about Rader and his
Clarity team all summer. It seems that almost anyone with a desk, a
pile of cash and a Rolodex can claim to be a venture capitalist
these days, but the Clarity team has experience running companies
and, some industry experts say, promises to be the firm to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Rader, for one, helped bring public Univision
Communications, the Spanish-language television company, in 1996.
His partner, Rudy Reinfrank, has managed investments for the Disney
family and Marvin Davis. Two other partners, Barry Porter and David
Lee, who has a Ph.D. in physics, are founding executives of Global
Crossing, a fast-growing telecommunications upstart with offices in
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The four are close friends as well as business colleagues: Rader
and Reinfrank were introduced by their wives 25 years ago, Rader
said. In the 1980s, both Rader and Porter were investment bankers
at Bear Stearns in New York. ``This time is an inflection point for
telecommunications and traditional media,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their peers, who have concentrated on one aspect or
another of the Internet, say e-business, Clarity's partners expect
to invest in five areas: network infrastructure, wireless
communications, service providers (like Global Crossing),
e-commerce and broadband media.
</P>
<P>
   But besides seeking investments for its own fund, Clarity is
providing advice to media executives who, perplexed by their
inability to crack the Hollywood code, need help navigating the
e-tainment world. ``They say, `You guys are in L.A. What do you
think we should do?''' Porter said. ``They are sifting through this
treasure trove and don't understand the digital environment.''
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true in the wake of several announced mergers
of old and new media. ``You make a choice like Vivendi-Universal
and there is a finality to it,'' added Rader, referring to the
recently announced acquisition of Seagram Co., which owns Universal
Studios, by Vivendi SA, the diversified French company. ``This is a
chess game and you can see how the pieces are being taken off the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   A Financial Culture Clash &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that outsiders are vexed by the ``Let's do
lunch'' crowd. Hollywood hates party crashers and, like the British
upper class, has peculiar customs that preclude success by the
uninitiated. Bryan Lourd, a partner at Creative Artists Agency, a
talent agency in Beverly Hills, said: ``It looks like English. It
sounds like English. But it is a very different way of doing
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Matthew Cowan. In 1996, Cowan, then an executive at
Intel Corp. and now a partner at Bowman Capital in San Mateo, moved
into an office at the headquarters of Creative Artists Agency to
help it set up a technology lab and invest in emerging media
companies. But after a little more than two years, he packed his
bags and moved back home, frustrated with a business culture at
odds with that in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest complaint was about the blatant disregard for a
start-up's Spartan budget. First, he said, there was the
entertainment executive who demanded that he have three assistants
along with a private car and driver. The man also insisted on
giving parties that were closer to theatrical productions, with
costly headline bands, than friendly afternoon beer bashes. ``You
sat there watching your small bank account dwindling,'' he said.
``It is upsetting to see so much capital go into people's pockets
and not into building companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, he added, executives were reluctant to acknowledge
failure _ a badge of honor in Silicon Valley _ and did not learn
from their mistakes. ``In L.A. I didn't see a lot of
course-correcting going on,'' Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who live and work in Los Angeles are wary of the
entertainment industry's naivete when it comes to creating ideas
that will sell on the Internet. Greg Martin, an associate at
Redpoint Ventures' offices in Los Angeles, warned: ``People in
Hollywood think their taste is better. They think they are funnier.
My comment to that is if you have better taste than me, then I'm
not going to get it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the New Winners &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there is money to be made in new ventures, financiers
are often the first to figure out how it can be done. And no one
has had a better seat watching the changing Los Angeles financial
scene than Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. A decade ago, Ken Moelis,
a former Drexel managing director who is now head of Donaldson's
corporate finance department, joined the firm with nine Drexel
associates in tow. Since then, the banking staff has grown to 120
professionals. It is by far the most prominent office of any Wall
Street firm here, including the Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley
and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County has always claimed its fair share of the
California economy; real estate and industrial manufacturing are
predominant. But the mix is changing, Moelis said, and along with
it, his business. About two-thirds of the revenue from Donaldson's
Los Angeles office now comes from advising technology, media and
telecommunications companies, particularly younger concerns. To
illustrate how the economy has shifted, David Posnick, one of
Moelis' colleagues, suggested following the career paths of some
Drexel alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Art Bilger, who used to be co-head of investment
banking at Drexel. In 1990, when the firm filed for bankruptcy, he
left to become a partner in Apollo Management, a buyout shop
started by former Drexel executives. In the mid-1990s, he served a
short stint as president of the New World Communications Group, the
television broadcaster, and later joined Akamai Technologies, the
Internet information delivery service, as a vice chairman. In his
latest career turn, he started Shelter Ventures, a fund that
invests in _ you guessed it _ communications and media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is a small town on the business side,'' Moelis
said in a recent interview. To prove his point, he turned and
looked out the glass wall of his 33rd floor office in Century City
and pointed out several new financial ventures in the row of
high-rises leading to the Santa Monica beaches. ``We can almost see
each other,'' he said. ``People know where to make phone calls to
make things happen. That's what kind of place this is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Incubator Experiment &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from Moelis' tower, an example of the most recent
business phenomenon of the technological age is tucked away in a
small office complex in Santa Monica: Ecompanies, a factory-like
builder, or incubator, of Internet start-ups. At first glance, it
looks like a typical start-up itself, with concrete floors, exposed
air ducts, the obligatory table-tennis game and a shower stall in a
side room. There is also a surfboard hanging in the lobby, and on
one recent day, the 29-year-old co-founder, Sky Dayton, who also
started the Internet portal Earthlink, dashed around the office
eagerly showing off the stitches in his forehead from a recent
surfing accident.
</P>
<P>
   Incubator is a dirty word on Wall Street these days. Analysts,
for one, are questioning this get-rich-quick approach to building
companies, where entrepreneurs are offered a soup-to-nuts menu of
services that include business development, recruiting and
marketing advice. ``So far the incubator model is unproven,'' said
Witherow of VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, shares in several of those that have already gone
public _ including CMGI and the Internet Capital Group _ are
trading well below their highs. Idealabs, the Pasadena-based
brainchild of the entrepreneur Bill Gross, has also run into
trouble. Almost all of the public companies in its portfolio have
stumbled recently, some down as much as 90 percent since the
technology-stock meltdown in April.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Idealabs has delayed its own initial public
offering until the market is more receptive. Executives there
declined several requests for interviews, citing the pending
offering.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street's discomfort with the incubator business model
is of little concern to Ecompanies' other co-founder Jake Winebaum,
41, a former chairman of Walt Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group.
He says he does not feel pressure to take Ecompanies public anytime
soon. ``The rationale for starting this,'' he said, ``was not to
start an incubator.'' Instead, he added, he and Dayton want to be
efficient entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Ecompanies has created one company a month since it
opened last year. But none have gone public yet, and critics say it
has had few successes, with the exception of Icebox, an Internet
content creator.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Ecompanies has become its own experiment, changing
to suit the difficult and amorphous investing environment.
Recently, the venture capital arm of Ecompanies has had trouble
raising funds, industry executives said. As a result, Ecompanies is
expected to unveil several partnerships with both old- and
new-economy players in the next week. Winebaum would not discuss
any pending changes at the company.
</P>
<P>
   What he would say is that the past year has been one of lessons
learned. Most important, the strategy group _ Step One in
Ecompanies' ``Henry Ford approach'' to creating companies _ no
longer writes the business plan for a new concern. That is left to
the founding executives, he said, so that ``the idea becomes their
own.'' Second, Ecompanies' executives have learned not to
micromanage start-ups, letting them succeed or fail on their own.
In particular, the venture arm of Ecompanies is less inclined to
invest in in-house companies, forcing entrepreneurs to find their
own financing. ``If we do too much for a company then it fails,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Eparties, an online party service inspired by his
grade-school-aged daughter. He said Eparties' executives were
ill-equipped for the rigors of the corporate suite, having been
coddled by Ecompanies' advisers. And Ecompanies, for its part,
failed to recognize that the company could not survive on its own.
As a result, certain Eparties assets were sold to eToys in June for
$1.6 million in stock. ``It's amazingly like parenting,'' he said,
reflecting on the experience. ``Your child does most of its growth
when it leaves. But when they want to move back in you ask, `What
are you doing here?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Upside of Networking &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Randall Kaplan, the 31-year-old founder of Jump Investors, a
network of individuals with $50 million to invest in young
companies, is the first to acknowledge that he was in the right
place at the right time when he helped write the business plan for
the wildly successful Akamai Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the most intelligent guy in the world,'' he said.
``But I don't have to be. I'm a hard worker, and I have a good
business gut.'' The payoff for his yearlong stint with Akamai
included options on an estimated three million shares of stock _
now valued at more than $200 million _ and the opportunity to join
the leisure class of young Los Angeles investors who have decided
to manage their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But what Kaplan does best is not what he most wants to be
remembered for: networking. If there is any doubt, consider his
13-page, single-spaced, coded correspondence log from 1995. It is a
who's who of Hollywood finance _ more than 360 phone calls or
meetings _ and shows how organized and determined the young Kaplan
can be. Still, in a recent interview, he balked at the comparison,
almost with disdain. ``I'm not a Hollywood guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Jump takes a stake in a company, he said, he wants to be a
hands-on investor who can influence the direction the company
takes. And that, he contended, ``is different than `let's do
lunch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan has put about $25 million of his own money into Jump,
with the other $25 million coming from 54 other investors. For the
privilege of being part of the Jump network, participants must be
active investors willing to help entrepreneurs the way a venture
capitalist would.
</P>
<P>
   Among this new class of investor-cum-adviser, said Moelis at
Donaldson, ``the lines are blurring.'' They emulate venture
capitalists, but are not beholden to corporate investors like
pension funds and colleges who pay them a management fee.
</P>
<P>
   For Kaplan, a Michigan native who got his start at SunAmerica,
the insurer, under Eli Broad, his new wealth gives him access to
promising companies and the freedom to pick and choose whom he
wants to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I called John Doerr, he may not take my call,'' he said.
Then he smiles, rethinking his answer in light of his recent
success. ``Well, maybe now he will.''  &QL;

 INVESTING WITH: THOMAS J. DiBELLA, AETNA SMALL COMPANY FUND  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investing is much more fun than public accounting, says Thomas
J. DiBella, who made the career switch almost 10 years ago and now
runs the $239.5 million Aetna Small Company fund. ``It's a lot more
exciting to predict the future than to record the past,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But all those years spent poring over balance sheets as a
certified public accountant were not wasted. ``I audited and
prepared a lot of financial statements, which helps me dissect the
financial statements of companies I buy for the fund,'' DiBella
said from his office in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   His investors have been rewarded. The fund returned 16.93
percent a year, on average, for the three years through Aug. 8,
compared with 8.11 percent for its peers in the small-blend fund
category, according to Morningstar Inc., and 7.73 percent for the
Russell 2000, on average, for the three years through July.
</P>
<P>
   As a ``blend'' manager, combining value and growth styles,
DiBella, 48, says he looks at stocks two ways. ``My personal bias
is to look for value,'' he said, ``but I understand the power of
momentum investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth-value split in his portfolio is seldom wider than
60-40 either way. Right now, he is adding more value issues to
bring them up to 50 percent of the fund. Health care and technology
stocks, particularly semiconductor companies, have had problems in
recent weeks, he said, ``so we're looking for a few more basic
industry businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing stocks for the portfolio, DiBella starts with a
universe that includes Russell 2000 companies plus a few hundred
more, mostly with market capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion.
Every two weeks, the fund screens for stocks using six fundamental
factors that he says can drive stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The four most important screens examine earnings estimate
revisions, price-to-earnings ratios, earnings momentum and stock
price momentum. The other screens look at earnings consistency and
the ratio of the share price to reinvested earnings. The computer
model ranks companies from 1 to 10 on each factor, calculates
composite scores and produces a list of the the top 20 percent, or
roughly 400 companies.
</P>
<P>
   To whittle down the list, he does research to see if the
business momentum of individual companies can be sustained. He
analyzes a company's balance sheet, looking primarily for minimal
debt and excess cash flow. Balance-sheet assets can also indicate
other factors, like acquisitions, that do not show up in the
computer model.
</P>
<P>
   DiBella gets a second list of possibilities by using a value
screen, again every other week, that looks for companies with at
least one-third of their market capitalizations in net cash _ a
cushion that can reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   He also spends time interviewing management, particularly about
its sensitivity to the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed by management that forget that their stock is the
biggest asset they have,'' he said. ``In many cases, they should be
thinking about buying back shares or about acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   He considers selling a stock when it falls into the bottom 50
percent of the computer ranking. On the value side, he reviews a
stock when its price falls about 20 to 25 percent from the purchase
price. He may also take profits if a stock's climb has been
particularly sudden.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's turnover rate is about 250 percent, on the high side,
DiBella conceded. But not too high, he argued. ``The market's been
very volatile,'' he said, ``and these types of stocks can be very
illiquid.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, DiBella bought shares of Houghton Mifflin, the textbook
publisher, at $46.46. ``We're seeing a lot of consolidation in the
U.S. educational publishing market,'' he said, ``and this company
could be an attractive acquisition target.'' Moreover, Houghton
Mifflin is a leader in the school market from kindergarten through
12th grade; that market is growing, he added, because of increasing
enrollment and more spending per student.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street predicts that earnings will grow 20 percent a year,
on average, over the next three years. Shares closed on Friday at
$49.5625, or 14.79 times the consensus earnings estimate of $3.35
for 2001. His 12-month price target for the stock is $70.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Oak Technology, a Sunnyvale, Calif., company
that makes integrated circuits for the optical storage and digital
imaging markets. The company recently introduced a product that can
transfer information onto CD's significantly faster than can be
done with current technology, DiBella said. It just added
significant CD business from Samsung, the Korean electronics
manufacturer, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street expects the company's earnings to grow 80 percent a
year, on average over three years. He bought shares in May at
$15.70; they now trade at $25.4375, or 72.68 times Wall Street's
earnings estimate of 35 cents a share for the fiscal year ending in
June 2001. His 12-month price target for the stock is $35.
</P>
<P>
   DiBella also likes Emisphere Technologies, a biotechnology and
drug delivery company in Tarrytown, N.Y., that converts injectable
drugs to oral medications. It is currently testing an oral version
of insulin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in April at $28.13, after the technology-stock
plunge, but sold the position by June 28, at an average price of
about $50. The price then fell again, and he bought more shares on
Aug. 2 at $28.50, when the company showed up on his value screen
because it held $12 a share in cash; it now trades at $26.5625. His
12-month price target is $45.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street predicts that the company will have a loss of $2.73
a share in 2001; he expects it to become profitable by 2003.

MOVING HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR THE CITY OF ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He helped lead the charge to lure the Democratic
National Convention. He helped finish the fund-raising for a grand
new concert hall. He helped recruit the new school superintendent.
He founded one art museum and has plans to vastly expand another,
and to revive a historically anemic downtown. He's the mayor's best
friend, and helped bankroll campaigns to elect a new school board
and pass a new city charter. And, oh, did we mention, he's the
richest man in town, worth more than $5 billion?
</P>
<P>
   Almost every sphere of civic life in Los Angeles these days
bears the fingerprints of one soft-spoken, silver-haired
67-year-old man: Eli Broad, chairman and chief executive of Sun
America Inc., the financial services and investment giant that for
most of the 1990s was the fastest-growing company on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx-born son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who began his
career at 21 as the youngest certified public accountant in
Michigan history, then developed a home-building empire that
stretched from Detroit to Los Angeles, Broad has in the last few
years become his adopted city's ultimate go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats arrive next week, Broad (rhymes with road) will
be front and center to welcome them, though perhaps not as front
and center as he wished. He did not get either the speaking slot at
the convention or the skybox at the Staples Center that he had
asked for. (He will have to share one of three skyboxes with the
local host committee, of which he is a co-chairman and to which he
gave $1 million while helping raise several times that.)
</P>
<P>
   But Broad, and his supporters and critics alike, are quick to
agree that he has flourished in Los Angeles as he could have in few
other cities, if any, where tradition, schools, clubs and old-boy
networks matter more and moxie and money matter less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' Broad said as the afternoon sun filtered
over a broad swath of Beverly Hills outside his office window.
``It's a meritocracy. You can come here without the right family
background, which I don't have, the right religion, the right
political affiliation, and if you're willing to reach out and
really work and spend your time, energy and sometimes your money,
you're accepted. That's not true of most other cities in the world
or North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's one of the reasons I love the city, because it's
allowed me to do all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, who has known him since
they worked on Alan Cranston's campaign for the U.S. Senate more
than 30 years ago, said Broad ``is making a herculean effort to
fill a vacuum'' in Los Angeles' civic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he does something, he does it all out,'' Kantor said.
``Most of the time he succeeds. Sometimes he does not. But the fact
is that some people, whether they are threatened by it or resent
it, are irritated by anyone who pushes that hard and demands
action. He does not sit around and suffer inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican businessman who has
recruited Broad, a lifelong Democrat, to help in innumerable civic
causes, finds a more mischievous way to describe his friend's
bluntness: ``Eli knows nothing about foreplay.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention is a case in point. Broad was among a handful of
people who wanted the chance to show off the city's recovery from
the fires, earthquake, riots and recession of the early 1990s, and
was one of the original co-chairmen of the local host committee,
which pledged to finance the convention by raising more than $35
million and to use city money only for municipal services like
transportation and security.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles got the convention, but ever since has had trouble
raising the promised money. And Broad has complained publicly and
privately that at least one of his fellow co-chairmen, the record
and movie mogul David Geffen, failed to put up any of his own. Andy
Spahn, Geffen's chief political aide, said Geffen had made clear
from the beginning that he would help bring the convention to Los
Angeles but intended to direct his fund-raising and contribution
efforts to the actual electing of Democrats, beginning with Vice
President Al Gore. ``This is a case of no good deed going
unpunished,'' Spahn said.
</P>
<P>
   But bad blood and embarrassing headlines have lingered for
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened?'' Broad said of the controversy. ``I'll tell
you what happened. I got all the press, that's what happened. And
why did I get all the press? I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Every city has a cadre of civic leaders who support the elected
government, raise money for cultural institutions and charitable
causes, and offer private advice to public figures. In the 1950s
and '60s, Los Angeles itself had the Committee of 25, a shadowy
conclave of businessmen who helped pick candidates for appointment
or election to public office and generally set the tone in the city
until the Watts riots set off changes in the municipal power
structure.
</P>
<P>
   But with a shift in the region's economy from large, home-grown
industries like aerospace to multimedia conglomerates, with a wave
of mergers and acquisitions that have left downtown Los Angeles
lacking a headquarters of a single Fortune 500 company, and with
his own considerable ambition, Broad has emerged as a virtual
committee of one, or, as he puts it, a venture philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   That has not always endeared him to some officials and fellow
billionaires here, who complain _ invariably under cloak of
anonymity _ that he is too quick to claim credit, too willing to
hog the spotlight, too wrapped up in his own pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a big ego,'' Broad said matter-of-factly in a recent
interview in his 38th-floor headquarters in a Century City office
tower. ``I like to be thought of well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Broad is also something of a rarity in an age of handlers
and spin doctors, consultants and retainers. He returns his own
phone calls, often flies commercial and still shows up at the kinds
of business breakfasts and chicken dinners that most moguls eschew.
A few years ago, he used his American Express card to buy a Roy
Lichtenstein at Sotheby's for $2.5 million, because he had
calculated the interest he could earn by delaying the payment for a
month. (He also got 2.5 million frequent-flier miles, most of which
he gave away to a local arts college for student travel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, people are visionaries or doers, but not both,'' said
Riordan, who regularly vacations with Broad on cruises and bike and
ski trips. ``He is both a visionary and an incredible doer, who
gets onto something like a pit bull and won't let go until he gets
it done. To a point that drives you nuts sometimes. On vacation,
you want to avoid him. He spent our last vacation, in Sun Valley,
on four major topics of what the city needed to do. I just wanted
to run the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked a couple of years ago what Broad wanted, one leading
Angeleno, a respected graybeard among the city's power players,
said, ``I think he wants to be the single most influential private
citizen in Los Angeles,'' adding with a chuckle, ``And he's got the
money to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad has not managed to get everything he wants _ his bid to
draw a National League Football team to a revamped Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum failed last year, as did his rivals' _ but it is
not for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say that working for him is like working for a
jackhammer, that he is fair but relentless, keeping four aides busy
in his outer office alone. Golf and other leisure activities hold
not the slightest allure; he keeps his perpetual tan by holding
long business meetings or reading papers outdoors. His speech, in
the flat accent of Michigan, is economical, tending to omit
prepositions and definite articles, so that he says, ``I was born
New York City.'' Even his passion, collecting modern art, is a
business, with a curator and a lending foundation.
</P>
<P>
   His impatience is also legendary. A few years ago, irked that
the world-famous architect Frank Gehry was taking too long to
finish his new house in the Brentwood section, Broad hired another
architect, with the result that Gehry disowned the house. (That
feud threatened to derail Broad's later efforts to raise money to
finish the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, which Gehry
also designed, but things were smoothed over.) Just now, on the
site of two former houses in Malibu, Broad is building a
4,000-square-foot beach house designed by Richard Meier, who
designed the new Getty Center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a white Richard Meier house,'' Broad said, ``and I think
white Richard Meier houses look great in beach areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad's current projects, both just beginning, are an expansion
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, on whose board he serves,
with a new wing and pedestrian arcade (an effort to which he will
presumably give millions of dollars), and a public-private
undertaking to revive Grand Avenue, the downtown street that is
already home to the Los Angeles Music Center and the Museum of
Contemporary Art (which Broad helped found 20 years ago) and that
will soon see the completion of the Disney hall and a new cathedral
for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Just talking
about downtown gets him so excited that he pulls out a pad and
starts sketching his vision of a new park, pedestrian-friendly
sidewalks, restaurants and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't own anything downtown,'' Broad said. ``All downtown
does is cost me a lot of money. But every great metropolitan area
needs a core. This city doesn't have any real core. It doesn't have
a place where people from different communities can come for free
concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some elected officials have complained that Broad involves
himself in matters, like selecting a new school superintendent,
that are none of his business. But he professes pride in such
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think I'm doing what's right,'' he said, ``I think at the
end of the day people will appreciate it and I'll feel good about
it. And along the way I'm not looking for votes.''

DREXEL ALUMNI MOVE ONWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with LOS-ANGELES-FINANCE)  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Drexel Burnham Lambert filed for bankruptcy in 1990, it was
the end of an era in Los Angeles. No other Wall Street firm
commanded the attention that Drexel's high-yield bond operation
there did as it transformed not only the way that corporate America
financed acquisitions but the character of the city as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many of those who worked at Drexel's offices in
Beverly Hills wondered whether they would ever work in such a heady
environment again. As things turned out, Drexel alumni are all over
_ working on Wall Street, running their own investment firms, even
comfortably retired, managing the millions of dollars they were
paid more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Milken, who masterminded the junk-bond unit, has
continued to make headlines even after he pleaded guilty in 1990 to
violating securities laws and served time in prison. Now Milken, as
a financier-turned-philanthropist, is the chairman of the Milken
Institute, which is involved in charities and institutions that
finance prostate cancer research and education. He is also the
chairman of Knowledge Universe, which invests in Internet concerns;
he was a co-founder of the company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Winnick, a former senior vice president, has also received
much attention lately. He left Drexel in 1985, before it crashed,
to start what later became Pacific Capital Group, an investment
firm in Beverly Hills. More recently, he helped found Global
Crossing, an cable telecommunications concern that went public in
1998 and now has an eye-popping market capitalization of $23
billion, making Winnick a multibillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Off Santa Monica Boulevard in Century City, about a mile from
Global's headquarters, are the offices of Apollo Management. Apollo
was formed by a group of former Drexel executives, and several are
still there. John Kissick, Drexel's former head of corporate
finance on the West Coast _ and the man who took over as head of
the junk-bond department after Milken left _ is now a senior
partner at Apollo. So is Antony Ressler, a senior vice president at
Drexel who briefly managed the syndication desk, and Leon D. Black,
who works at Apollo Advisors in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Spurge, who preceded Ressler at the syndicate desk, is
now a Los Angeles-based adviser for a handful of investment firms
and a consultant for, among others, the music producer Quincy
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Moelis, a managing director, left Drexel in 1990, taking
nine associates with him down the street to Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, where he is head of corporate finance. Donaldson's Los
Angeles office has succeeded Drexel as the most prominent Wall
Street firm in the city today.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Milken's colleagues ended up in Southern California.
Peter Ackerman was Milken's right-hand man, heading the structured
finance unit and helping with the recapitalization of Mellon Bank,
among other companies. He is now an executive at Rockport Capital,
an investment firm based in Washington, making private investments.
He is also co-author of a yet-to-be published book called ``A Force
More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street executives said Warren Trepp, Milken's chief bond
trader, moved to Lake Tahoe at some point and manages his own
capital now. Trepp could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   And Dennis B. Levine, the Drexel banker who pleaded guilty to
insider trading and started the firm's fall, is now president of
the Adasar Group, financial advisers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, many executives who did not work at
Drexel but used its financial muscle and played a part in making it
an important player in the 1980s. One of the best-known was Thomas
Spiegel, the security-conscious former chief executive of Columbia
Savings &AMP; Loan Association, which was a big buyer of Drexel-backed
junk bonds. He caught the latest business wave and went to work for
MP3.com, the San Diego-based Internet music site, in business
development. Spiegel recently left MP3, but remains a consultant,
the company said. Spiegel did not return phone calls seeking
comment.

COMMENTARY: AL GORE'S CHICKEN SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: ``chutzpah'' in graf 2 should be in italics) By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So righteous, so brave, so bold. The verdict is in: Al Gore is
the best thing to happen to the Jews since Oskar Schindler.
</P>
<P>
   Such has been the ecstatic cry of the media bloviators once the
vice president showed the guts, the courage and, yes (all together
now!), the  &UR; chutzpah &LR;  to select a Jew _ an Orthodox Jew, yet _ as
his running mate. Never mind that Alan Greenspan and Robert Rubin
have been far more powerful than any vice president, Jewish or not,
will ever be. Never mind that the also-rans on Gore's uninspiring
list of potential running mates were of unambiguously lesser
caliber than Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. For a political press desperate for a new story line,
here it is: The Republicans may have Charlton Heston, but in the
newly daring Gore, the Democrats at last have their own Moses, who
just might lead them to the Promised Land in November after all.
According to one account, a presidential candidate considered
``dull, cautious and incapable of stirring emotional loyalty even
among his own supporters'' has with this surprise pick jump-started
his idling campaign. (Actually, the quote comes from The Times in
July 1984, after Walter Mondale anointed Geraldine Ferraro, but it
can stand for the collective wisdom of August 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gore made his choice in defiance of lethal anti-Jewish
bigots on the American fringe, from Sacramento to Crown Heights to
cyberspace. And yes, polls say that 12 percent of the country is
still anti-Semitic. But didn't Pat Buchanan have those votes sewed
up?
</P>
<P>
   I defer to a recent Hebrew school grad in my household,
16-year-old Simon: ``Gore gets to prove himself risky by doing
something completely unrisky, picking a middle-of-the-road
candidate like himself.'' His opinion was echoed by another Jew I
canvassed, Woody Allen, who finds the fact that ``people are
knocked out of their chairs'' by Lieberman's nomination
``ridiculous.'' He adds: ``It's an embarrassment for the country
that it took to the year 2000'' for a Jew to be on the ticket.
``Everyone is saying how tolerant the country is _ they settle for
so little!''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, all the self-congratulatory talk this week about
the tolerance of Jews is more unsettling than cheering, once it
becomes clear how little many non-Jews know about us. The constant
refrain _ ``Could a Jewish vice president wage war on his
Sabbath?'' _ has never been asked so vociferously of devout
Christians who might have to leave church if bombs dropped on a
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to an Orthodox synagogue, and do you know how many
beepers go off?'' says a laughing Abraham Foxman of B'nai B'rith's
Anti-Defamation League, noting all the Jewish doctors who,
apparently unbeknownst to most Americans, actually do whip off
their prayer shawls when called upon to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans, meanwhile, seem to think that one size
yarmulke fits all _ that all Orthodox Jews, Lieberman included, can
be patronizingly stereotyped as cultural reactionaries with views
closer to Jerry Falwell's than Gore's. Writing for The Wall Street
Journal, Peggy Noonan celebrated Lieberman as a blood brother to
such right-wing Orthodox Jews as Dr. Laura Schlessinger. Yet the
Connecticut senator shares few of the views of the anti-gay,
pro-life Dr. Laura (or others named by Noonan) and is in fact to
the left of the Clinton-Gore administration on ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' which he feels should be scrapped so that gays can serve
openly in the military. Lieberman's cultural conservatism mainly
consists of throwing occasional self-promotional press conferences
with William Bennett railing impotently against Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the Lieberman nomination for Democrats is that it
calls the Republicans' bluff on their new ``inclusiveness.'' George
W. Bush may have put minorities onstage in Philadelphia, but Gore
put one on the ticket. Better still for the Democrats,
compassionate conservatism has such a strict code of political
correctness that the Bush forces, already criticized by Jewish
groups for the governor's official declaration of a ``Jesus Day''
in Texas this year, will never dare pick on a Jewish candidate.
When Lieberman eloquently defended a woman's right to choose a
so-called partial birth abortion on ``Larry King Live'' this week,
you didn't hear any of the usual Republican cries of
``infanticide.'' Instead the GOP tried to argue that Lieberman, who
had a 95 percent voting record with the liberal Americans for
Democratic Action last year, was a closet Republican. Now, that's
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the press gives Gore excessively high marks for
doing the politically expedient thing in picking Lieberman, so it
oversells Lieberman's value to Gore. The conventional media wisdom
that the first Democratic senator to moralize against Monicagate
will now inoculate Gore from Clinton fatigue and Clinton sleaze is
beside the point, even if it were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not choosing a preacher, we're choosing a president,''
said Gore in 1988, when deflecting Jesse Jackson in the primaries.
Despite the biblical pandering by both tickets this year, the same
still holds. If puritanical preaching against Bill Clinton's sins
is such a sure winner, why did the Bush campaign lock Henry Hyde in
an attic in Philadelphia last week? Why, at the height of GOP
moralizing against Monicagate in 1998, did the Democrats gain seats
in the election? The same Washington geniuses who predicted _ with
stunning unanimity and inaccuracy _ that voters would punish
Clinton's party in '98 predict the same fate for Gore this year.
And they're probably wrong again. Now, as then, voters dislike
sanctimonious public scolds, regardless of faith or party, as much
as they dislike public scoundrels. Now, as then, they know when
Clinton is on the ballot and when he is not, and don't regard all
Democrats as his surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem for Gore this year isn't Clinton fatigue _ it's
Gore fatigue. And you feel it almost every time he opens his mouth.
Whether in small groups or large, on the record or off, the
hyper-cautious vice president has trouble speaking plainly and
candidly when trying to further his views or his candidacy. Most
Americans recognize that he is both far more experienced in and
knowledgeable about government than Gov. Bush. Few confuse his
private life with Bill Clinton's. Polls show that Americans agree
with Gore's positions on most issues and love the economy. But it
all may be for naught for a candidate who not only tells you how to
build a watch when you ask what time it is but still never gives
you the time.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example was Gore's appearance on ``Meet the Press''
last month. Asked by Tim Russert for his visceral reaction to the
photo of Elian Gonzalez at gunpoint, the vice president fudged (``I
wasn't there, I didn't see exactly what happened'') and droned on
in the impersonal legalese of Michael Dukakis' legendary debate
flub. Simple requests for his judgments of Ralph Nader and Viktor
Chernomyrdin yielded evasions like ``I don't really know him
personally'' and ``I have no idea.'' Did Gore agree with the
Supreme Court Boy Scouts decision handed down more than two weeks
earlier? ``I haven't read the opinion.'' Worse, each of these
non-answers was surrounded by yards of scripted boilerplate,
obfuscation or equivocation, occasionally interrupted by attempts
(thankfully foiled by Russert) to introduce charts. It's not good
news for Democrats that Gore is said to be writing his own
acceptance speech for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman, himself something of a droning orator and
equivocator (including on impeachment), couldn't solve this problem
even were he Sammy Davis Jr. The best any vice-presidential
candidate can do is no harm. Yet Abraham Foxman says that already
some worried Jews are calling the Anti-Defamation League with
``what if'' questions, as in, ``What if the ticket loses? Will Jews
be the scapegoat?''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. If Gore loses, it's not going
to be Lieberman's fault or Clinton's fault or some anti-Semitic
cabal's fault, but Gore's fault. And Lieberman will have proven
himself the wisest guy on the ticket anyway, by not having given up
his day job in the Senate to make the race.

SURE BEATS WACHING CONVENTIONS ON TV
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients on or after Aug. 14,2000) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the spectre of all local television programming being
ruined by boring convention or redundant civil unrest coverage this
week, concerned citizens might understandably wonder why
entertainment has to suffer when politics comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not necessarily the case. While our town _ more
specifically, Hollywood _ is not exactly known for making the kind
of trenchant political movies you'll find in the cinemas of, say,
Britain or Italy or Argentina, a solid body of astute work about
the American democratic process has developed over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   And our electoral system being what it is, many of these films
are pretty darn amusing. Here, then, is a list of 10 great
political films that you might want to rent in lieu of watching
this week's parade of empty speeches, prefab patriotism and broken
windows:
</P>
<P>
   ``All the King's Men'' _ This 1949, multiple Oscar-winner (best
picture, actor, supporting actress for Mercedes McCambridge)
remains American cinema's most perceptive look at populist
demagoguery. Adapted from Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize
novel, this thinly veiled critique of Louisiana despot Huey Long's
rise and reign benefits from Broderick Crawford's overwhelming lead
performance and a sophisticated insight into the mechanics of power
politics that Hollywood hasn't matched in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being There'' _ A superbly pitched satire that gently but with
utter ruthlessness skewers the Media Age dumbing down of our
national debate. Peter Sellers is the mildly retarded gardener
Chance who, upon the death of his guardian, leaves home for the
first time in his life. Knowing nothing but how to care for plants
and what he's seen on television, Chance proves the perfect
pablum-spouting politician for an electorate threatened by real
issues and drugged by vague platitudes. If Sellers, who died a year
after this 1979 release, were still with us, he could fit right in
at both parties' sappy symbolism conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Roberts'' _ Tim Robbins' self-starring, 1992 comedy about
a right- wing ideologue running for the Senate under folksy
camouflage suffers a bit from its own lefty smugness. Still, it's a
marvelously scathing look at the partisan monster behind the
presentable mask, and a timely caution against taking glib
catchphrases like compassionate conservatism at face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' _ It's hard to tell where fiction ends and reality
begins in Warren Beatty's hallucinatory, 1998 cry for a free and
meaningful contemporary politics. As the corrupted title senator
whose crisis of conscience goes hand-in-hand with a truth-telling
nervous breakdown, Beatty cuts a marvelously poignant ridiculous
figure. When he considered actually running for the Democratic
nomination last year, the poignance was noticeably missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Candidate'' _ This 1972 Robert Redford vehicle was a good
20 years ahead of its time, predicting as it did how telegenic
blandness would triumph over philosophical commitment by the 1990s.
Amusingly, the film's director, Michael Ritchie, attended Al Gore's
alma mater, Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave'' _ In a year when two fortunate sons of old political
families are trying to convince us they're champions of the average
guy, Ivan Reitman's 1993 fantasy about an everyday schlub's
successful misadventures as a presidential surrogate is a welcome
tonic. It's ham-prone Kevin Kline's best and subtlest film
performance, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabriel Over the White House'' _ Political looniness is hardly
a new phenomenon in America, as this utterly nutsoid, 1933 flight
of fascistic fancy demonstrates. Walter Huston is impressively
versatile as a corrupt, venal pol who, having recently been elected
to the highest office in the land, has a divine vision that turns
him into a zealous reformer _ who ain't shy about straightening
crooked America out at gunpoint. Alarmingly, the filmmakers seem to
condone his scorched earth approach to societal renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medium Cool'' Worried about potential violence between
demonstrators and police at this year's Democratic convention? Take
comfort in the fact that it couldn't be any worse than the
cataclysm that exploded around the party's Chicago conclave in
1968. Noted cinematographer Haskell Wexler was there, directing
this story about a cynical TV news cameraman's redemption odyssey,
and he got more than he bargained for when Vietnam protesters and
Mayor Daley's finest tore the city apart before his unblinking
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' _ While Frank Capra's work has
always been marred by sentimental hokiness, you'd be downright
un-American if you didn't leave this 1939 movie with misty-eyed
pride in our imperfect but wonderful form of government. Only Jimmy
Stewart could persuasively pull off the role of the naive young
senator whose inextinguishable decency survives assaults from all
quarters of the capital and even inspires the scoundrels there to
change their unscrupulous ways. Did I mention that Frank Capra's
movies never remotely resembled reality either?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wag the Dog'' _ Y'know, we're really gonna miss Bill Clinton.
No matter how untrustworthy, craven and downright dishonest our
next president will inevitably prove to be, it's hard to imagine
either contender inspiring a black comedy as entertaining as this
1997 tale of White House sexual misconduct, media subterfuge and
distracting military adventurism. And I do mean inspiring:
Remember, this movie was made before anyone had even heard of
Monica Lewinsky. A president who can generate so much entertainment
simply by being himself will be one hard act to follow.!end! &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Richard J. Riordan is not central casting's idea
of a big city mayor. He has no ``How'm I doin'?''  &UR; chutzpah &LR; , no
big stick. He is no speechmaker and is terrible on television. Even
some of his allies refer to him with a mix of affection and
exasperation as ``Mayor Magoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, at a ceremony related to the opening of the
Democratic National Convention, which he worked so hard to lure
here, Riordan, a Republican, actually said: ``I just want to say
those three magic words: Welcome to the City of Angels.'' He once
introduced the actress Tyne Daly as ``Tiny.''
</P>
<P>
   But for seven years, Riordan, a multimillionaire businessman and
lawyer who works for $1 a year, has presided over this city's
recovery from riots, fires, earthquake and the worst recession in
50 years with implausible success. With pots of his own money and
the help of wealthy friends, he financed successful campaigns to
limit the terms of local politicians, pass a new city charter to
restructure government and elect a new majority on the school board
to deal with the beleaguered schools, all in a city where his
official powers are weak and political involvement low.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does this `I'm just a country lawyer' thing and very slick
guys in blue suits screw up because they mistake that facade,''
said a former chief of staff, Robin Kramer. ``Because there's a
very capable, highly intelligent and very practical guy behind
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For about two minutes on the convention podium on Monday,
Riordan will stand in a national spotlight as he welcomes
Democrats. When he set out to bring the convention to town more
than two years ago, Riordan had no idea that delegates would arrive
in the midst of the worst police corruption scandal in decades and
amid fears of disruptive street protests. But he was philosophical
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a father putting on a wedding for his oldest
daughter, and being driven nuts,'' Riordan said in an interview in
the City Hall conference room, surrounded by autographed
photographs of President Clinton and photos of the restless,
70-year-old mayor biking and jogging. ``And then at the last minute
everything comes together and you have a great time. But, really,
this has not been easy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a typical understatement. For months, convention
planning had been plagued by money-raising troubles, infighting
and, for a time, Riordan's inattention. But last winter, Riordan
began making phone calls to raise some $5 million to cover
convention costs and spent at least 10 percent of his time on
planning. In the end, President Clinton's top fund-raiser, Terry
McAuliffe, had to step in to raise the rest of the needed money.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Riordan has had to contend with the worst
police corruption scandal in decades, in which rogue officers have
been accused of fabricating testimony and, in at least one
instance, handcuffing and shooting an unarmed man, then implicating
him and watching him go to prison paralyzed from the waist down.
The U &UR; .S.  &LR; Justice Department, which was already investigating
patterns of police misconduct here, has threatened a federal civil
rights lawsuit if the city does not accept a binding agreement to
make long-promised changes in officer training.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of his second term, even some longtime
supporters say Riordan seems adrift. Senior aides have left, and he
barely speaks to the man who was once his most trusted confidant,
William M. Wardlaw, a Democratic lawyer. Riordan has not forgiven
Wardlaw for backing the city attorney, James K. Hahn, a Democrat,
for mayor next year. Riordan, who built an unusual coalition of
white suburban homeowners and inner-city Hispanics in the wake of
the 1992 riots, favors a fellow Republican businessman, Steve
Soboroff.
</P>
<P>
   But Riordan insists he is busier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say, and I really believe this, that if you start
thinking about a legacy, then it takes your eye off the ball,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, who was born in New York City came to politics by a
nontraditional route. After graduating from Princeton, and ranking
first in his class at the University of Michigan Law School, he
made a fortune in the leveraged buyout business in the 1980s. He
has a longstanding interest in education, and his private
foundation has given away $30 million over 20 years in support of
education. Riordan said he would like nothing better when he leaves
office than to finance and become the principal of a new charter
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an odd combination, because he's such a restless guy,
with a short attention span and his mind always seems to be jumping
to the next thing,'' said Patt Morrison, a columnist for The Los
Angeles Times and one of the members of the mayor's book club _ a
group that includes the actor Alan Alda and the sociologist James
Q. Wilson _ which gathers in the 40,000 volume library at his home
in Brentwood to tackle authors from Stendhal to Raymond Chandler.
``And yet he takes on a great deal of serious reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Riordan's biggest failure has been his inability to get
along with the 15-member City Council, all but three of whom are
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more words than reality,'' he said. ``Some of the
liberals who would like to be friendly with me are afraid, afraid
they'd be thrown out of the liberal cult.''

COLLAPSE OF CAMP DAVID TALKS DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE KILLED PEACE
PROSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Less than three weeks after the Camp David push for
a final Middle East peace settlement ended without agreement,
perhaps the most promising development, by the reckoning of many on
both sides, is what has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dire warnings of bloodshed were the talks to collapse,
there has been almost no violence. Apart from minor clashes,
Israelis and Palestinians have gone peacefully about their lives.
Coordination between Israeli army and police commanders and the
security chiefs for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority,
unthinkable only a few years ago, has helped to keep things
tranquil. In fact, the Palestinian security forces have won high
praise from Israeli military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the warnings that the Arab world would unite to
stiffen Arafat's resolve not to budge on his claim to Jerusalem.
Instead, a whirlwind tour of his traditional backers among Arabs
and Europeans has left Arafat with almost unanimous advice to keep
talking.
</P>
<P>
   When Arafat set out on his tour, the assumption was that he was
hoping for a common front in backing his refusal to compromise at
Camp David. But as his itinerary has lengthened, some diplomats
have come to suspect that the Palestinian leader is taking
soundings on whether the Palestinians' traditional backers,
especially Arab countries, might accept a compromise over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's going to back off, and I don't say that he will, he's
going to need cover,'' one Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat traveled Friday to Moscow, one of more than a dozen
capitals on his itinerary, and encountered also there a reluctance
to see the peace process founder over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   According to news agency reports from Moscow, the Russian
president, Vladimir Putin, urged further negotiations with Israel,
and advised Arafat not to take ``unilateral decisions,'' the code
for Arafat's threat to declare a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it extremely important to continue the negotiations,
and to reach a peace agreement,'' Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign
minister, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important were upbeat comments from Arafat. ``We must
complete this peace process, no matter what difficulties we
encounter on our way, for the sake of our children, the children of
our children, for our future,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Egypt, where Arafat met with President Hosni Mubarak on
Wednesday, there were also signs of flexibility. Mubarak's chief
political adviser, Osama Baz, suggested a readiness for compromise
when he said on Thursday that Egypt would not dictate to the
Palestinians on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role is not to deliver the Palestinians, and not to exert
pressure on them,'' Baz said. ``On the other hand, our role is not
to tell them to harden and not accept what is offered. Our role is
to encourage.''
</P>
<P>
   From Moscow, Arafat flew to Finland, and then to Norway, where
he was to meet with Shimon Peres, the Israeli who shared the Nobel
Peace Prize with Arafat and the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin for their roles in forging the 1993 Oslo agreement that
launched the Israelis and Palestinians on a process toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Oslo said Arafat had arrived later than expected,
forcing the cancellation of a formal dinner and putting the talks
with Peres in question.
</P>
<P>
   Although he now holds a relatively junior Cabinet post, minister
for regional cooperation, and was unexpectedly defeated in a
contest for the Israeli presidency last week, the 77-year-old Peres
had arrived in Oslo saying he hoped to discuss possible future
courses for a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials continued to sound optimistic. Shlomo Ben-Ami,
Israel's new foreign minister, said in Barcelona that negotiations
with the Palestinians were continuing with the purpose of closing
``everything that needs to be closed'' and setting up a ``short and
decisive summit.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief U.S. mediator in the Middle East, Dennis Ross, was due
in the region next week for a round of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were also voices of discord. In talks with
Iran's leaders in Tehran on Thursday, Arafat was told to hold firm
on Jerusalem. The visit assumed special significance because Iran
is the current chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, a grouping of about 50 Muslim states.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Muslim can allow holy Jerusalem to remain under occupation,
and the Organization of the Islamic Conference will never let any
deal be made over Jerusalem,'' the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal
Karrazi, told Arafat, according to news agency reports.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Saudi Arabia suggested that the Saudis, who claim a
special authority on matters like Jerusalem because of their
guardianship of the two holiest sites in Islam, Mecca and Medina,
have also opposed any compromise on Jerusalem. But several Arab
states in the Persian Gulf, under pressure from the United States,
have shied away from any all-or-nothing statements on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats believe Arafat may find new negotiations hard to
resist even without an Israeli compromise on East Jerusalem. In
this view, Arafat, who is 71 years old, may find it difficult to
slam the door conclusively on proposals put forward by President
Clinton that would give the Palestinians, apart from Jerusalem, a
settlement that only a few years ago would have seemed chimerical _
including Palestinian sovereignty over much of the West Bank,
Israeli acceptance of Palestinian statehood, and a Western aid fund
that could run into billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Even the proposals for Jerusalem could be hard to reject if
Arafat were to conclude that a majority of Palestinians, and
traditional backers like Russia and Egypt, would back, or at least
not oppose, their acceptance.

MISSIONARY TO ENGLAND: A PAKISTANI-BORN BISHOP

<P>
   ROCHESTER, England _ For centuries the Church of England's
cathedral here has greeted pilgrims as the next-to-last stop on the
road to Canterbury. Signs inside still bid travelers welcome,
indicating the route's enduring popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But these days some wonder whether Rochester's bishop might one
day go to Canterbury himself _ not as a pilgrim but as successor to
the incumbent archbishop, whose retirement may not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would make him the Church of England's spiritual
leader, first among equals among bishops of Anglican churches
worldwide, among them the Episcopal Church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a historic transition, because Rochester's prelate,
Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, is a native of Pakistan. At 50 he already
has the distinction of being the only non-Caucasian in the Church
of England to head a diocese.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four decades, Christianity has grown rapidly in
Africa and Asia, and with it the influence of African and Asian
prelates. But if Europeans and Americans are to grasp the
significance of the trend, it may have to be personalized through
people like Nazir-Ali.
</P>
<P>
   And there are several like him. There is the Rev. Setri Nyomi,
the Ghanaian who is the top official of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, which includes the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
There is Nyomi's counterpart at the Lutheran World Federation, the
Rev. Ishmael Noko, a Zimbabwean.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Cardinal Francis Arinze, a Nigerian who heads the
Vatican's interfaith council. Within the Roman Catholic Church,
whose African membership has more than doubled since 1975, the
cardinal is considered to be among Pope John Paul II's possible
successors.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his study, the Cambridge-educated Nazir-Ali
discussed his rise to influence. ``I've never actually applied for
anything,'' he said. ``I've always been told to do it. I never
thought I would have a ministry outside Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice is heard well beyond Rochester, which lies east of
London. The Guardian, a leading British newspaper, recently
published an article he wrote calling attention to the persecution
of Christians in some Islamic nations. In it he cited verses in the
Koran supporting religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Christian convert, the bishop has Shiite Muslim
relatives. He speaks Arabic, Persian and Urdu, and is often invited
to speak in British mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Nazir-Ali has been an increasingly visible presence among
Anglican prelates since 1986, when Robert Runcie, then the
archbishop of Canterbury, invited him to help plan the 1988 Lambeth
Conference, the once-a-decade meeting of Anglican prelates
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   When the bishops met again in 1998, three years after he was
named to head the Rochester diocese, Nazir-Ali presided over a
conference committee concerned with Christian-Muslim relations and
spoke about Islam in the world. ``It was a very learned talk,''
said Bishop Henry N. Parsley of Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Parsley invited Nazir-Ali to lecture and preach to
Alabama Episcopalians. ``People in Montgomery and Birmingham were
delighted,'' Parsley said. But asked about his colleague's
ecclesiastical future, he said, ``Who knows, when you're talking
about the next archbishop of Canterbury or the next pope?''
</P>
<P>
   Nazir-Ali has heard the speculation and, not surprisingly, is
circumspect. ``I carry on with what I'm doing in the way I regard
as best,'' he said. Rochester and Canterbury, neighboring dioceses,
share major social work projects.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of Canterbury stands at the core of the British
establishment, by protocol outranking even the prime minister. To
live up to the job description, a prelate must function as local
bishop, leader of a diverse and often divided national church, and
head of a global religious association. Commenting on the
responsibilities, the bishop said, ``Nobody in their right mind
would seek such a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Others mentioned as candidates include Bishop Richard Charters
of London, who is considered close to the royal family, and
Archbishop Rowan Williams of Wales, who is admired as a theologian.
</P>
<P>
   The successor to the incumbent, Archbishop George Carey, will be
chosen by members of a royal commission as well as the prime
minister and Queen Elizabeth II. The decision may be years off.
Arch Carey, who was chosen in 1991, can remain in office until he
turns 70, in 2006. But he could step down sooner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Canterbury's Christian significance dates to 597, when a
missionary monk named Augustine arrived to evangelize the
Anglo-Saxons. One of his colleagues ventured west to the Medway
River, becoming Rochester's first bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese is economically varied, incorporating London's
eastern flanks, agricultural areas and new towns. Dickens grew up
within its boundaries. Now it contains an emerging religious
diversity, with Mormons, New Age spiritualists and others, part of
a wide challenge confronting the Church of England, whose problems
might have daunted even Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   Church attendance has fallen. Anglican leaders speak of a
society awash with ``pick and mix'' spirituality, in which people
choose beliefs and practices to suit their private needs.
</P>
<P>
   To examine the church's place in this, Nazir-Ali headed a
committee that published ``The Search for Faith'' (Church House
Publishing, 1996). The book examined the history of ideas
underlying contemporary thinking and suggested that the church find
new ways to communicate the Gospel to a postmodern culture.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop has also been quoted as saying that the British might
benefit from receiving missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain is a missionary situation,'' he said. ``There's no
question about that. It's a lack of even basic knowledge of the
Bible in the population. I was preaching at a Charles Dickens
international conference, and I was saying Dickens was immersed in
the Bible. But now when students study Dickens in university, they
have to be taught the Bible to understand Dickens.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, he said, ``needs help, in the sense of inspiration,
enthusiasm, new eyes to see its mission.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also need self-confidence. At times members of the clergy
inviting him to speak have urged him to avoid saying anything that
might upset people. But he still feels, as he put it, that ``the
world is willing to give us a hearing, as long as we're willing to
say something.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows reactions can be hostile. Earlier this year the bishop,
who is married and has two grown sons, touched off a furor by
writing that the church should continue to teach ``that having
children and their nurture is a basic good of marriage and not an
optional extra.''
</P>
<P>
   One critic, representing an organization for ``nonparents,''
called his message ``too offensive for words.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were pleased. ``That Michael would say that warmed my
heart,'' said Bishop Munawar K. Rumalshah, the head of a London
missionary society and a friend of Nazir-Ali for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nazir-Ali's becoming archbishop, his old friend said, would have
a big impact throughout the Anglican Communion _ would prove ``that
there is no black and white in Jesus.''

HOW BURIAL PLOTS AND BINGO CONNECT WITH FOOD STAMPS 
</HEADLINE>

 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In California, New York and many other states, people applying
for food stamps are asked if they own a burial plot. Nebraska and
Nevada want to know if applicants have sold their blood, and for
how much. Hawaii demands garage-sale receipts, South Dakota wants
documentation of bingo winnings, and Minnesota, on page 20 of a
36-page eligibility application, asks if anyone in the household
earns money from a paper route.
</P>
<P>
   Food-stamp applications in most states have become so onerous
that they are deterring needy people from applying for the
subsidies, a comprehensive analysis by a national network of food
banks and advocacy groups has found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the inquiries about income and assets have no connection
to legal requirements for food stamps but are either aggressive
responses to federal mandates to deter fraud or part of recent
state and local efforts to cut welfare costs by eliminating
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   State administrators contend that they are simply complying with
federal pressure to be tight-fisted with taxpayers' money and
properly enforcing the tougher rules passed by Congress in the 1996
welfare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials say that the report, conducted by
America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest food-bank network,
adds to their worries that such stringency may be one reason that
12 million people who need the benefits, and are eligible, are not
getting them.
</P>
<P>
   Food-stamp use is plummeting at a faster rate than can be
explained by economic growth. Since 1996 the number of people using
food stamps has declined to 17.2 million people from 23 million,
though a growing bipartisan consensus now holds that food stamps,
like Medicaid, are supports needed to keep low-wage parents
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in this program we have not looked at the big
picture,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in an interview
about the survey, which will be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my goal to keep hungry people out of the program _
that's a disgrace,'' Glickman said. ``But it's also my job to keep
fraud down. It's tricky to balance those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, he added, ``is actually helpful. We are going to
continue to work with the states to make sure that the income
limits aren't ridiculous,'' and that anti-fraud techniques are not
``outside the bounds of what we ought to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new sleuthing methods for countering fraud are
parking-lot espionage in Tennessee, computerized credit checks in
Delaware and Texas, and calls to employers and landlords in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want you to have nothing,'' a disabled woman of 56,
who asked that her name not be used, whispered as she peered at the
question about a burial space in the shabby waiting room of a
food-stamp office in the Harlem area of New York. ``It's none of
their business. You want to tell the truth, but they make it so if
you tell the truth, it don't help.''
</P>
<P>
   When the comment was repeated to the sponsors of the study,
which examined application forms from all 50 states and a sampling
from the United States' 3,143 counties, they said it underlined the
unfairness of such questions, though they are not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's afraid she'll go hungry if she's honest,'' Deborah Leff,
president of America's Second Harvest, said of the woman's concern.
``Isn't that a mess?''
</P>
<P>
   Though the federal government finances and oversees the
food-stamp program, states administer it, with wide variations. The
shortest application, in Florida, is only a page, but most are more
than 10 pages, and all warn that misleading answers are punishable
by a stiff fine and up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the study found, many questions are unintelligible to the
average applicant, and some are mind-boggling even to the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you or anyone in your household fleeing from New Jersey?''
Ohio's eight-page application asks. Researchers nicknamed the query
the Soprano Clause, after the television drama about a Mafia
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in Cleveland,'' said Sharon Davis, 39, a single mother
of three who was laid off last month from her job as a machine
operator and had spent most of the afternoon applying for food
stamps. ``Why would they ask if you're from New Jersey?''
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, state administrators contend that all the
questions _ including that one _ reflect local efforts to comply
with a stream of federal dictates, including periodic crackdowns on
fraud, stiff penalties on states that overpay even by $5, and new
rules in the 1996 federal welfare legislation.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the so-called Soprano Clause, for example, Ohio
food-stamp administrators pointed to a provision by Congress in the
1996 legislation. It excludes from the food-stamp program any
fugitive from prosecution of a felony, which in New Jersey is
called a ``high misdemeanor.'' To be on the safe side, said Jon
Allen, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family
Services, Ohio added an extra question just to cover New Jersey's
terminology.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Nebraska, which was fined $1 million for
food-stamp errors in a 1998 federal audit, asks about money from
blood-plasma donations and counts it against a family's food
allotment _ which food-bank analysts say is simply wrong _ because
in 1986 an obscure federal policy memorandum defined such money as
earned income.
</P>
<P>
   As for burial plots, some state administrators justify
questioning elderly applicants about them because a federal
provision notes that only one grave per customer can be discounted
when calculating a household's assets. To be eligible for food
stamps at all, a household cannot have assets of over $2,000, or
$3,000 for senior citizens, including checking and savings accounts
and the value of any car above $4,650.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that some people seeking food stamps have
been turned away or cut off in a push to divert them from welfare _
sometimes illegally, as a federal court found in New York City last
year. Many other people either do not know they are eligible or are
discouraged by the requirements, especially in states that
shortened eligibility to three months instead of a year, which is
allowed by federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Applications take an average of five hours and two visits,
Agriculture Department figures show, and the benefit, only $73 a
month per person on average, can be as low as $10. Ninety percent
of households getting food stamps have income under the poverty
line, or $14,150 for a family of three. Three-quarters have no
countable assets.
</P>
<P>
   A typical family of three leaving the welfare rolls has an
annual income of $11,500, according to one study, and qualifies for
just under $150 a month in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Though many longer applications include questions relating to
cash assistance and medical benefits, a recent study in Western and
Southern states found that 78 percent of those seeking food stamps
were not told when they qualified for the other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials are now urging outreach
efforts, and this year for the first time they are offering modest
rewards to states that increase participation. But state
administrators see a certain hypocrisy in the new thrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only message we have heard for years is accuracy; your
error rate is what matters,'' Ann Sessoms, Minnesota's welfare
reform manager, said. ``If you miss a plasma donation, if you miss
a paper route, the state is held liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last September the Agriculture Department's quality-control
arm praised the Tennessee Department of Human Services' ``Project
Parking Lot,'' in which Nashville investigators patrol for cars
whose blue-book value exceeds the $4,650 limit. They feed the
license-plate numbers into a computer listing people on the benefit
rolls, and have cut off $3 million to $4 million in benefits as a
result, according to Larry Evitts, the director of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy,'' said Stephanie Manning, who oversees a
Nashville food pantry that limits aid to three boxes of groceries
every six months. ``You can't eat your car,''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Harris, administrator of food stamps in Nebraska, said that
the dollar limit on cars, raised by only $150 since it was set by
Congress 20 years ago, shows how states get stuck enforcing
obsolete regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's happened to the price of cars,'' Harris said.
``It's like, come on, people!''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest enforcement trend, some states either require
electronic fingerprinting of food-stamp recipients or are planning
it. Texas has contracted with computer information brokers who
provide, among other tidbits, a listing of 10 neighbors who could
be asked about an applicant's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware pays $2 or $3 an inquiry for credit-card histories on
applicants whose answers seem suspicious to a caseworker. Though
privacy laws make it illegal to use credit information in a
criminal case, William Garfinkel, director of audit at the Delaware
Department of Health and Social Services, said that nothing barred
using it to determine government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They count everything,'' Anna Santana, a divorced bookkeeper
in Lincoln, Neb., said, citing a $25 gift certificate from her
church for her three children's Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Before she qualified for food stamps, she added, there were
times when she fed the children first and ate only if they left
something. But her older daughter, then 5, caught on.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started cutting back on what she was eating,'' Santana
recalled. ```I'm not hungry, Mommy, you need to eat, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said some state actions seemed overzealous,
congressional mandates notwithstanding. ``The irony here is that we
don't ask farmers to do anything like we do our food-stamp
recipients,'' Glickman added, referring to federal farm subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   A few states stand out in the study as exceptions. Indiana, for
example, has a two-page application that does not ask about burial
plots, bingo or blood products. Federal audits last year found
fewer mistakes in its calculations of benefits than they did in
California, which squeezes 120 questions onto 21 pages. Indeed, the
study found that there was no correlation at all between the length
of a state's application and the accuracy of its payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states have shown a lot of good judgment and simplicity
in complying with the requirements,'' Glickman said. ``Other states
have gone down a much more complicated route. Our job is to try to
help all the states run a simpler system.''

LIEBERMAN SELECTION HINDERS DEMOCRATS' EFFORTS TO REGAIN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ However much the selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman
has helped the presidential prospects of Vice President Al Gore, it
has dimmed the Democrats' flickering hopes of regaining the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes shot up when Georgia's former Democratic governor,
Zell Miller, was named to replace Sen. Paul Coverdell, a
Republican, who died last month. Miller is generally conceded to be
a sure winner in November. That meant the Senate had 54 Republicans
and 46 Democrats, so the minority had to gain five seats for a
clear majority, or just four if Gore won and his vice president
could cast a tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lieberman is elected vice president, his replacement
under Connecticut law would be an appointee of Gov. John Rowland, a
Republican who would not pick a Democrat. And the Democrats would
need, elsewhere, to win five more seats than they lost, giving them
50. (Lieberman could break a tie, so the Democrats would control
the Senate.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore-Lieberman ticket loses but Lieberman, as expected,
wins re-election to the Senate, the Democrats would still need to
win, elsewhere, five more seats than they lost, for a total of 51.
If they only had 50, Dick Cheney, as vice president, would break a
tie against them.
</P>
<P>
   So the Democratic goal is back to a net gain of five seats. Even
the minority leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, calls that
goal, with characteristic understatement, ``tough.'' For a gain of
that size, Democrats would need to get a victory by their only
embattled incumbent, Charles Robb of Virginia; take four out of
five open seats (in Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and
Florida), and then defeat five out of the nine more or less
vulnerable Republicans, in Delaware, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Montana, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle called those gains ``doable.'' Dave Hansen, political
director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said they
were far-fetched. He added that the choice of Lieberman had
``negated Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Republicans have taunted Lieberman to withdraw to
show his confidence in a Gore victory. But he is not taking the
bait.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, interviewed Tuesday on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''
said: ``I have the intention of continuing to be a candidate for
re-election to the Senate. The people in Connecticut have asked me
to do that. The law allows it. It is a very complicated process in
Connecticut. If I withdrew from the election, a very small group of
people would choose the nominee. And I don't know if that is fair
to the people of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said there ``could be a special election next year,'' so
the loss of a seat would be only temporary. But, in fact,
Connecticut law would have Rowland's appointee serve until the
election of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle had been given the same misinformation about Connecticut
law. He got it from Gore himself. Daschle had spoken publicly about
his hope that Gore would not choose a senator from a state with a
Republican governor. But on Monday afternoon, Daschle said in an
interview that Gore had told him that very day that Connecticut law
called for a special election early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle offered a different view on Thursday. He said what he
now knew about the law ``makes our situation a little more
complicated.'' He said, ``Connecticut is a very Democratic state,
and I'm sure when the election is held we'll retain it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign did not respond when asked how Gore happened
to misinform Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen of the Republican Senatorial Committee conceded that the
choice of Lieberman helped Democratic Senate candidates in Florida
and New York. In 1996, Jews cast 10 percent of the vote in New York
and 6 percent in Florida. But Hansen said, ``We're going to win New
York'' anyway.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With less than three months until Election Day,
Vice President Al Gore faces a crucial and perplexing question: Why
does his presidential campaign not seem to be benefiting from an
economy that is as good as it gets?
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Democratic National Convention next week in Los
Angeles, Gore can point to an array of indicators that would seem
to work powerfully to the advantage of the incumbent party in the
White House, especially when today's economic conditions are
compared with those that the Clinton administration inherited 7 1/2
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is down to levels not seen in a generation. Incomes
and homeownership are up. Budget deficits have given way to huge
surpluses, and the stock market has generated staggering wealth.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too early to count the economy out as a big factor in
Gore's favor. But so far, prosperity's glow has done little for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he trailed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in nearly
every national poll for months, but his efforts to portray himself
as a superior steward of the economy have fallen flat.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News poll last month found that 75 percent
of voters believed Gore was likely to keep the economy strong if he
was elected president, compared with 71 percent for Bush, a
statistical dead heat. Asked which candidate would do a better job
of managing the economy, respondents in a Business Week/Harris Poll
last month favored Bush by 51 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, the economy is not cutting for Gore as much as
I would like,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic
Leadership Council, an organization of centrist Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and officials of both parties said Gore might
have hurt himself to a degree by failing to stick to a simple,
consistent message about the economy, especially during the spring,
when he veered into issues like the Elian Gonzalez case. And they
said Bush had artfully tried to shift the debate from who gets
credit for prosperity to what should be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the real difficulty for Gore might be that times
had been good for so long that voters took prosperity for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's biggest problem on the economy is that this recovery
has been going on much longer than any previous recovery,'' said
Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary in President Clinton's
first term. ``It's become almost background noise, and people
assume the good economy will just keep on rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do voters show little willingness to grant credit to
Gore, analysts said, but the electorate does not see either
candidate as having much control over an economy that seems
increasingly driven by technological advances, globalization and
other forces beyond the control of any administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the economy we're in now, the public doesn't buy the idea
that the economy is good because of the Clinton-Gore
administration, and they'd be just as disinclined to credit the
Republican Congress,'' said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican
congressman from Oklahoma who is now a professor at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experience suggests that when Election Day rolls around,
a fat and happy electorate is likely to think hard before throwing
an incumbent party out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts _ as well as Gore's aides _ point to the last time
a sitting vice president ran for president with a strong economy at
his back _ in 1988, when Bush's father faced Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts. For most of the summer, Bush was behind despite
nearly six years of steady economic expansion and an unemployment
rate that had been halved, to 5.4 percent, since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in June 1988 showed Dukakis ahead of Bush by 52
percent to 38 percent, and when asked which candidate would do a
better job keeping the country prosperous, voters ranked the
candidates evenly at around 40 percent. But by November, Bush had a
52-35 advantage on economic management in the Gallup poll, and he
went on to win the election comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   ``History says that people's perceptions of a sitting vice
president's capability with regard to the economy can change,''
said Andrew Kohut, a pollster who is director of the Pew Research
Center for People and the Press. Mark Fabiani, Gore's deputy
campaign manager for communications, said most voters have not yet
focused on the election, and that when they do, they will conclude
that Gore has supported and shaped the policies that have brought
the economy to where it is and that his approach is more prudent
than his rival's.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Gore would seek to link Bush's economic plans to
those of his father, who presided over a recession that contributed
to his loss in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the end will focus on the economy as the most
important issue, and in the end will focus on whether we're on the
right economic track and whether they are better off than they were
four or eight years ago,'' Fabiani said. ``The answers to those
questions are good for Gore and bad for Bush.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If anything, Gore is stressing the economy more as the campaign
progresses, using a message that has two distinct components.
</P>
<P>
   One is unabashedly populist, and is aimed in part at the party's
liberal base and at people who do not feel they have fully
benefited from the economic boom. It is built around the assertion
_ challenged by Republicans _ that Bush's economic platform amounts
to tax cuts for the wealthy, an overhaul of Social Security that
would leave the retirement security of working people at risk and
deference to powerful special interests like oil and pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a promise to continue the policies of fiscal
responsibility that helped bring about budget surpluses and reduced
interest rates. This portion of his message is intended to stress
continuity with one of the most successful elements of Clinton's
record and to appeal to moderate swing voters.

AUSTIN USES HIS SHORT GAME TO CUT RIVALS DOWN TO SIZE
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. _ After starting the day in first place,
Woody Austin played well enough to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a 5-under 67 and hoping to end a five-year victory
drought, Austin entered the weekend with a two-stroke lead after
Friday's second round of the Buick Open. He was 14 under for the
tournament (63-67, 130), two strokes ahead of Rocco Mediate (12
under), who shot a 64, and four strokes ahead of Hal Sutton (10
under, 67-67), who was in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the enormous crowd that followed Tiger Woods around
Warwick Hills Golf &AMP; Country Club saw him struggle to his second
consecutive 70, leaving him 4-under, 10 strokes behind Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, of course, still believed he could win. But Austin still
believed in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for me to play aggressive and not be
happy where I was,'' said Austin, who started the day with a
two-stroke lead after blistering the course with an opening-round
63. ``My wedge game has been absolutely perfect this week. Every
chance I got with a wedge, I hit a really good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin did not putt as well as he did Thursday, needing 29 putts
Friday compared with just 21 putts in the first round. But Austin's
ball striking remained excellent, in a round that included six
birdies and just one bogey. Instead of looking uncomfortable with
the lead, Austin looked confident.
</P>
<P>
   As for Woods, it was clear that he was not as sharp as he
intends to be for next week's PGA Championship. Woods drove the
ball fairly well, but his approach shots lacked their usual
accuracy. For Woods, the goal is to peak next week. But on a course
where birdies have been plentiful, Woods still had time to get
himself in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it before,'' Woods said of his ability to come back,
before he headed to the practice range. ``I'm hitting the ball
well, just not as well as I'd like to.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for Austin to play any better. His only
victory on the PGA Tour came at the 1995 Buick Open. Currently
108th on the tour money list, Austin could use a title, or at least
a strong finish, to help restore his confidence. After 36 holes,
and with his best chance to win in a long time, Austin was eager to
see how he would react this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will probably be shaking in my shoes when I tee it up
tomorrow,'' Austin said. ``But if you're nervous and you're playing
well, it's easier to overcome. If you're nervous and you're playing
like a dog, you're going to play like a dog. I think I will be
fine.''  &QL;

KANSAS CITY LOOKING FOR A BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Kansas City defender Nick Garcia was
complimentary of the Los Angeles Galaxy's 5-1 victory over the
Wizards last week at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a great game plan. They executed very well in the
final third,'' said Garcia, a Rookie of the Year candidate. ``In
midfield, they dominated us. All the credit goes to them for
getting five goals on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something that coming into the season I would not
have expected anyone to do. We are definitely looking to go into
Los Angeles and trying to get our three points back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (13-6-5, 44 points), which once held a nine-point
cushion over its Western Division rivals, could watch its lead drop
to a single point with a month remaining if the Galaxy (11-7-7, 40
points) can beat the Wizards at the Rose Bowl tonight. Game time is
7 p.m. with a concert by Los Tigres del Norte following. Admission
to the concert is free with paid admission to the game.
</P>
<P>
   For Wizards coach Bob Gansler, tonight's task is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that we couldn't hold serve last week,'' he
said, sounding like a tennis player. ``But if someone breaks you,
you just have to break them right back.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid isn't concerned with a letdown. If the
Galaxy stumbles tonight, last week's big win is a wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to feel good about that game because we've got a
bigger one in front of us now,'' said Schmid. ``Our veterans know
what is at stake. If we don't take care of them at home, then we've
done nothing with this home-and-home series.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Wizards, Galaxy striker Luis Hernandez, who
scored a goal and notched two assists in last week's victory, is
unavailable because of World Cup qualifying commitments with
Mexico. However, Garcia admitted that Hernandez, along with
midfield general Mauricio Cienfuegos, make the Galaxy a dangerous
team heading into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched some of the goals they scored on us at practice
this week,'' said Garcia. ``Those two are definitely in sync. He
and Cienfuegos are much better oriented with each other. You can't
give them much space.''

   BRIDGEPORT, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph
Lieberman came to this small factory town outside Philadelphia
Friday to praise working women. They visited Little Souls, a
company owned by women that makes handcrafted dolls, where they
called for equal pay and expanded day care benefits. Both paid
elaborate homage to their own wives, daughters and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my sister and I were growing up,'' Gore told a small
audience made up mostly of women, ``there was never any doubt in
our minds that men and women were equal, if not more so.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmentioned, though, was the one topic that had their audience
buzzing Friday morning: aggressive efforts by Gore and the
Democratic National Committee to scuttle a Democratic
congresswoman's fund-raiser next Tuesday at the Playboy Mansion in
Los Angeles. Several women here described the site as the sleazy
epitome of a society that treats women not as equals but as sex
symbols to be exploited and degraded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not the right image,'' said Mary Beth Pratt, 57,
chief marketing officer of a Philadelphia law firm.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the Gore campaign had hoped to highlight proposals
for helping working women, it instead found itself facing questions
about values, its tolerance for sexually explicit publications and
campaign contributions from Playboy executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sure do enjoy that Playboy money,'' Jim Nicholson,
Republican National Committee chairman, said, all too happy to
portray Gore and his campaign aides as morally selective for
accepting contributions from Playboy executives even as they
criticized a Democratic congresswoman, Loretta Sanchez, for
planning a fund-raising event at the Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now Sanchez has resisted pressure from Gore's
emissaries to move the event, which was planned to raise money for
Hispanic voter registration efforts. But Friday morning, in an
appearance on NBC's ``Today'' show, she said that she was now open
to finding another location, so long as it has the ``kind of
cachet'' offered by the Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been about the Playboy mansion,'' Sanchez said, one
day after her speaking role at next week's Democratic convention
was canceled by Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. ``It's been about putting on a good event and raising
money.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, an executive with Playboy Enterprises who spoke
on condition of anonymity confirmed that Sanchez had decided to
move the event, and two managers at a blues club run by B.B. King
in Universal City, Calif., said that Democratic Party officials had
approached them about holding the event there. But they said no
final decision had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In a Fox television interview Friday, Gore said that he
supported Andrew's action, and during the appearance here at Little
Souls, Lieberman pointedly emphasized that a Gore-Lieberman White
House would work to help families teach strong moral values to
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work _ Al, Tipper, Hadassah and I _ to help renew the
moral center, the moral health of this nation, to support the
mothers and fathers who are trying so hard to raise their kids,
give them good values, give them discipline in the face of so many
competing forces,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the audience that Tipper Gore _ ``long before it was
easy to do so'' _ embarked on a campaign against explicit song
lyrics ``to try and help Americans to raise PG kids _ as she said _
in an X-rated society.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's efforts to put the Playboy matter behind him were
complicated by his refusal thus far to return a $1,000 campaign
contribution from Hugh Hefner, Playboy's founder, and a $500
contribution from his daughter, Christie Hefner, the chief
executive of Playboy Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apples and oranges,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's campaign press
secretary, when asked the difference between holding a fund-raiser
at the mansion and accepting campaign contributions from Playboy
executives. The Hefners' contributions, he said, represented only a
tiny fraction of the money raised by the Gore campaign, while the
fund-raiser is a major event for some 600 guests.
</P>
<P>
   Heather L. Parker, a 31-year-old elementary school teacher who
works summers at Little Souls, failed to see a distinction. By
taking money from the Hefners, she said, Gore has endorsed an
enterprise based on the exploitation of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be taking their money,'' she said. ``He should be
separating himself completely from them. It doesn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rosenzweig, executive vice president of Playboy
Enterprises, defended the company in an interview, saying that
Playboy is as ``American as apple pie'' and asserting that Gore and
other party leaders were ``following political correctness right
out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed in the party,'' he added. ``I would
never have expected this from a party that we have supported
financially and editorially through the pages of the magazine for
many years. It's very saddening to us to see this. We wonder what
pressure groups in the party are exerting this pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   According to campaign records, Playboy executives have made
several contributions to Democratic candidates. Rosenzweig
contributed $500 to the Clinton/Gore campaign in 1996, and another
$500 to the 1998 Senate campaign of Geraldine Ferraro. Helen
Isaacson, a senior vice president for Playboy, donated $500 to Bill
Bradley's campaign this year. In 1996, Christie Hefner donated $250
to John Dingell, a veteran Democratic congressman from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's sudden focus on Playboy, of all things, was only
one of the factors that diverted attention from Gore's intended
message Friday. On Thursday, Clinton apologized once again for his
affair with a White House intern. Clinton also said that Gore
should not be blamed for Clinton's moral failings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the Fox interview Friday whether he agreed that he
should not be blamed for Clinton's affair, Gore simply praised
Clinton for his remarks while predicting that voters would make
decisions based on the future.
</P>
<P>
   In between questions about Playboy and Clinton, Gore gamely
pressed on Friday with his campaign message, asserting that George
W. Bush's proposed $1.6-billion tax cut is, at its core, a huge
gift to the nation's wealthiest families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to these facts,'' he told an audience of about 150
crowded into a musty warehouse loft here. ``Under the Bush-Cheney
plan, for every 10 dollars of tax relief that would go to the
richest 1 percent, middle-class families would get a dime, and the
poorest families would get a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, his proposal to cut taxes by $500 billion
is ``targeted'' toward single mothers struggling to pay for day
care, toward couples trying to finance their children's college,
toward families trying to provide long-term care for sick or
elderly relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day Gore traveled to Detroit to formally accept the
endorsement of the United Auto Workers and then to New York City
for a fund-raising dinner that raised $500,000 for the Democratic
Party.

EDITORIAL: TIME FOR A CONVENTION UPDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 12:
</P>
<P>
   At one time America's presidential conventions earned the
nation's attention for the important purposes of choosing
leadership tickets and defining party principles. But today's
political extravaganzas survive for the more modern purpose of
providing a few video images and catch phrases that can be marketed
throughout the fall. Distilled down to their essence, the
Republican and Democratic conventions this summer are photo
opportunities built around balloon drops, confetti storms, sound
bites from acceptance speeches, and climactic tableaus of the
nominees with their families, defeated opponents and congressional
allies. Even in a political system built to accommodate change, the
role of national conventions has evolved _ some would say declined
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a half-century ago the Dixiecrat walkout kept
Democrats in front of their radios. Four years later, Republicans
were riveted by the televised nomination battle between Dwight
Eisenhower and Robert Taft. The last presidential convention that
kept delegates and television viewers on the edge of their seats
was in 1976, when an interloper from California, Ronald Reagan,
nearly edged out the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, for the
Republican nomination. In that year about 32 percent of American
households watched on one of only a few channels. Now, with more
than 60 channels available to most Americans, George W. Bush's big
night with his grand finale speech reached about half that
percentage of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the decline in audience is due at least in part to the
fact that real political battles no longer occur at these meetings.
Indeed, politicians view a news eruption as a mistake in convention
planning. Evidence for their view is provided by Patrick Buchanan,
who damaged the Republican Party in 1992 with his rabid rhetoric
and now appears to be helping the Reform Party remake itself into
two inconsequential parties rather than only one.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the retro-show from the hapless Reformers, we are far
removed from the day when Walter Cronkite and other broadcast
grandees were beamed into millions of living rooms in the role of
convention host. Fading, too, is the guaranteed air time for
big-name speakers. In Philadelphia, for example, ABC broadcast its
commentary about Colin Powell's speech while Powell was still
giving it. Dwindling air time on the networks reflects something
beyond a decline in real news. It also involves a cost-driven shift
of political coverage toward cable and the Internet, leaving the
broadcasters free to sell advertising around their entertainment
programming.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too early to tell if there is anything approaching a
one-to-one shift of political audience from old to newer media. One
rough estimate from Nielsen Media experts suggests that the overall
television audience for the GOP convention dropped as much as 12
percent from 1996. Some other analysts of this new data suspect
that as sites offering news expand, news seekers actually retreat,
perhaps overwhelmed with political detail from so many different
sources. A few political Internet sites even reported drops in
activity during the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NBC's promotion of MSNBC as the cable channel with
deeper convention news, MSNBC finished the Republican week with
fewer than 600,000 viewers per night. Perhaps the network's viewers
have made the same choice as the networks _ that entertainment
sometime must rank above civic duty, esp
</P>
<P>
   ecially during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by Jim Nicholson, the Republican chairman, that the
networks devote ``not a minute more'' to the Democratic Convention
than they did to the GOP gathering is clearly ludicrous. The
Democrats' more surprising vice-presidential choice and the drama
of President Clinton's farewell will probably mean expansion of air
time over the tightly scripted and predictable GOP show.
</P>
<P>
   But in the larger sense, there is no quick fix to restoring the
air time and audience that conventions once commanded. Recapturing
the drama of the brokered convention would require taking power
away from primary voters and giving it back to party bosses, an
unhealthy step for democracy. But the lesson of the under-watched
conventions of 2000 may be that it is time for the national parties
to find new ways to make them vital exercises in political
communication, rather than ritualized performances of outdated
ceremonies. &QL;

BUCHANAN CHOOSES HARD-RIGHT BLACK WOMAN AS RUNNING MATE

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As the latest twist in a political
convention filled with them, Pat Buchanan on Friday shattered the
emerging image of the Reform Party as a haven for white
conservatives by selecting as his running mate a black woman who
taught public school for years in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the larger of the party's feuding factions
nominated Buchanan as its presidential nominee. With the smaller
group nominating John Hagelin, the fight over $12.6 million in
federal campaign funds was officially enjoined, to be fought out
over the next few weeks before the Federal Election Commission and,
in all likelihood, a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's pick of Ezola Foster, whose hard-right views
virtually mirror his own, made her the first black candidate to
seek the vice presidency for what is, arguably, a major party.
(There have been other black candidates for president, including
Shirley Chisholm, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, who
sought the Democratic nomination in 1972.)
</P>
<P>
   In presenting Foster at a midday rally, where almost no one knew
who she was until he introduced her, Buchanan gave no indication
that the ticket would face further obstacles, legal or otherwise,
on the march toward the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this lady will be a tremendous benefit to our cause,
to our campaign and to our movement,'' he said, standing beside
Foster. ``She'll be an ambassador to America for what this party is
all about. This shows that we are a party that is open to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who has brought new energy to the Reform Party since
Ross Perot's second unsuccessful campaign for president in 1996,
had closely guarded the identity of his pick since the convention
began on Tuesday. But even with all the speculation over who it
might be, the rumored names never included Foster. This is a
convention, after all, in which the vast majority of delegates are
white, and most are men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Foster, 62, a former Democrat and a former Republican who
followed Buchanan into the Reform Party when he left the
Republicans last year, has been known to Buchanan for years.
</P>
<P>
   A public school teacher and administrator for 33 years and a
twice-failed candidate for the California Assembly, she is founder
of a California-based organization called Americans for Family
Values. She was an ardent supporter of Proposition 187, a 1984
California measure that sought to deny aid to illegal immigrants,
before courts struck it down. She favors local control of public
schools and opposes programs in them that promote safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Buchanan named her as a co-chairwoman of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At her introduction, Foster discounted any role that race might
play in her candidacy, insisting: ``We want to do what's right for
all Americans. We have to stop appeasing one group after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she seemed an unlikely choice for Buchanan, whose views
are so far to the right on many issues that he has especially
strong appeal to fringe groups that include white supremacists,
militia members and anti-Semites.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, who serves as chief campaign strategist for her
brother, said Foster emerged as the vice-presidential choice over
several others was because she shared Pat Buchanan's views on most
issues and because ``she could hold her own in debates.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any votes and support the ticket might lose because the
vice-presidential candidate is a black woman, Bay Buchanan said,
``If we lose them, then I say goodbye. I'm not interested in them,
and I hope this pick tells them we are not interested in their
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's selection was also well received by many Buchanan
supporters, who went out of their way to say they did not mind that
she was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so excited for her, and I'm from Alabama,'' said Sharman
Ramsey, whose husband, Joel, is a delegate from Dothan, Ala.
``We're not prejudiced against blacks. We want competent,
responsible people of any color.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Moore, a Florida delegate said: ``Her selection lends us
more credibility. It puts to bed a lot of the spin about us being a
party of whites, because we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's moment of triumph as a nominee came after delegates
in the faction supporting him voted almost unanimously to throw out
a monthlong primary in which hundreds of thousands had
participated. That vote is being replace in favor of a vote by
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in three presidential campaigns that the
will of ordinary voters, whom Perot had envisioned as holding the
ultimate power, was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But the move was widely viewed as a way to protect Buchanan
against legal action by Hagelin, who has accused the Buchanan
campaign of election fraud. In a complaint to the Federal Election
Commission filed on Thursday, the Hagelin campaign charged that
Buchanan's supporters sent primary ballots to as many as 500,000
people who were ineligible to vote in the Reform primary.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the primary were not disclosed to the larger
group. They were to the smaller. But even though Buchanan won
49,529 to 28,539, in voting totals that represented just 10 percent
of the ballots distributed, the pro-Hagelin group also voted to
throw out Buchanan's votes as fraudulent and named Hagelin by
acclamation its presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the nomination, Hagelin called on the feuding
factions and all independent parties to unite as an alternative to
Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of all we cherish has come from third-party
voices,'' Hagelin said. ``This is a powerful, powerful movement. We
should begin the process of healing and rebuilding, putting aside
the small ideas that divide us and replace them with grand ideas
that unite us.''

BRUINS HOPE THEY'LL HAVE THE ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ There are no questions about handicapped-parking
placards. No questions about quarterbacks who haven't taken a
meaningful snap. No questions about waves of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A season like UCLA's in 1999, in which the Bruins collapsed to
4-7 after back-to-back 10-win seasons, is one they're happy to have
behind them. Nobody more so than UCLA coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, his father died, his son-in-law was diagnosed with a
brain tumor that proved to be benign, his youngest daughter was
married and he was dealing with the fallout from the parking scam.
Then star quarterback recruit J.P Losman quit during fall camp, the
early games turned into a quarterback tryout, and injury after
injury were followed by loss after loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just tears you up,'' Toledo said of his fourth season as
head coach. ``When it was over, I was ready for it to end''
</P>
<P>
   The unranked Bruins begin practice today in preparation for the
season opener against No. 3-ranked Alabama on Sept. 2 at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But already Toledo's having a better year. This summer, he
enjoyed a trouble-free vacation playing golf around Southern
California and fishing for salmon in Alaska. And probably thinking
about some of these questions, ones that will determine if this
season is just as pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   __ QB or not QB? Whoever wins the job _ Cory Paus or Ryan McCann
_ the Bruins need much better play at the position than last year.
They don't need Cade McNown, just someone who doesn't make mistakes
and can execute routine plays consistently so the Bruins can put
the ball in the hands of playmakers like DeShaun Foster, Freddie
Mitchell, Brian Poli-Dixon and a trio of talented tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   __ Can't they have Kansas State's schedule? The Bruins will know
where they stand _ on both feet, they hope _ by the end of
September. After the opening-day test against Alabama, they face
No. 6 Michigan two weeks later, again at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In between could be a dangerous game against Fresno State.
Finally, on Sept. 23, they play their conference opener at Oregon,
which has a 14-game home winning streak. A 3-1 start and the last
two games of the season _ at Washington and home to USC _ might
mean something; a 1-3 start and it could be `99 all over again.
</P>
<P>
   __ Will free safety cost dearly? Traditionally the marquee
defensive position at UCLA _ Kenny Easley, Eric Turner, Don Rogers,
and Shaun Williams were all first-round draft picks _ it has been
makeshift since Williams left three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, former walk-on Joey Strycula filled the position
admirably when nobody else claimed it. This year, with talented
sophomore Lovell Houston out for the season with shoulder surgery,
little-used, fifth-year senior Jason Zdenek gets the first crack at
the job that could eventually go to true freshman Ben Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
   __ The O (no!) Line again? The offensive line was a complete
disaster in `99 _ decimated by injuries, inexperience and poor
play. The Bruins allowed 35 sacks, including six against USC, when
they lined up with the No. 4 center and one healthy reserve. Paus
was a victim of the pounding, suffering a separated shoulder and a
broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the running game totaled only 1,191 yards rushing
and 2.9 yards per carry _ the Bruins' worst output since 1963. So,
it's not necessarily good news that everyone is back.
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Brian Polak, who has started 23 consecutive games,
and junior center Troy Danoff, who was the best lineman until a
season-ending knee injury, are solid. The key might be the progress
of three former Parade All-Americans _ sophomore tackles Bryce
Bolander and Mike Saffer, and freshman Shane Lehman, who is pushing
senior Oscar Cabrera at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   __ Say what? The Bruins, so help them Edgerrin James, swear the
defense will carry them early in the season. And when's the last
time anyone's said that around Westwood? The Bruins have allowed
more than 28 points per game three of the past four years and
haven't led the conference in scoring defense since 1987. Yet, with
Bob Field back as defensive coordinator, they'll have the same man
in charge after having three different coordinators the past three
seasons. Also, the only projected starters who don't have a full
season in the lineup are freshman tackle Rodney Leisle and senior
safety Jason Zdenek.
</P>
<P>
   __ Star-crossed or star power? Defensive end Kenyon Coleman and
tailback DeShaun Foster are considered future first-round NFL
picks. Linebacker Robert Thomas and defensive tackle Ken Kocher
could be.
</P>
<P>
   All four have shown flashes of greatness the past two seasons,
but only Coleman has so much as made second-team All-Pacific-10. If
these four have breakout years, so will the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   __ Will there be a rush to judgment? UCLA allowed seven running
backs to rush for 100 yards or more last season and lost six of
those games. In the other loss, Stanford didn't have to run; it
passed for 465 yards. Defensive ends Rusty Williams and Coleman,
and 300-pound tackles Leisle and Kocher will find out against
Alabama and Michigan if this year is going to be different.
</P>
<P>
   __ Can they stay healthy? The Bruins, through injuries and
suspensions over the handicapped-parking scandal, used 45 different
starters last season. Toledo said the most he'd ever used at UCLA
was 31. While the Bruins can't expect a repeat, they aren't deep at
receiver, and Foster _ the focal point of the offense _ has missed
considerable time the past two seasons with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   __ Secondary concerns a primary problem? This unit is much like
the quarterback position: The Bruins don't need to be spectacular,
just solid. The past two seasons, the secondary has had two
problems _ it couldn't cover and couldn't tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jason Bell, often the victim of his own
aggressiveness two years ago, is back for his fifth year after a
heel injury cost him last season. Ricky Manning, who succeeded and
failed spectacularly last season, will start at the other corner.
Marques Anderson, who was suspended from school last fall, returns
with 15 additional pounds of muscle and a new position (strong
safety).
</P>
<P>
   If this unit isn't better, Alabama's Freddie Milions might
litter the Rose Bowl field with jockstraps next month.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big plays or bust? With playmakers like Foster, Mitchell and
Poli-Dixon, the surest sign that offensive coordinator Al Borges'
offense is back will be the big play. In 1998, when the offense
nearly carried the Bruins to the national title, they scored 25
touchdowns of more than 15 yards. Last year they managed just
seven.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ From 1992-98, tire blowouts were a
``related factor'' in 118,764 crashes nationwide, according to the
NHTSA. But that does not mean the defective tires were the primary
cause of the crashes, according to National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration spokeswoman, Liz Neblett.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville-based company Bridgestone/Firestone on Wednesday
recalled 6.5 million all-terrain tires. Motorists with certain
15-inch radial ATX, Radial ATX II and Wilderness AT tires should go
to a licensed Firestone dealer to get their tires replaced at no
cost. But be prepared to wait because the replacements are out of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The only Wilderness AT tires being recalled are those marked
with the Department of Transportation code beginning with VD. This
indicates that the tire was made at a plant in Decatur, Ill. The
code is usually found on the tire's inside sidewall, meaning you
must crawl under your car to find the code.

EDITORIAL: A RESCUE PLAN FOR CAMDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 12:
</P>
<P>
   When bankrupt cities are taken over, it is usually by
state-appointed control boards that dictate fiscal policy until the
cities return to solvency. The board that Gov. Christie Whitman of
New Jersey has proposed for the dysfunctional city of Camden may be
tough by New Jersey's standards but no tougher than the control
boards that revived the prospects of municipalities like New York
City, Chelsea, Mass., and, most recently, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Camden's difficulty in governing itself was underscored last
week when the City Council asked the state to assist in running the
city attorney's office, which has been incapacitated by scandal.
Instead of digging in their heels, state legislators who represent
Camden should embrace the Whitman plan and improve on it.
</P>
<P>
   Camden's troubles began in the 1970s, when middle-class flight
and job loss combined with corruption to undermine civic stability.
Three of the last five mayors have faced federal charges and have
presided over a government that has consistently failed to provide
even the most basic city services. In recent years Camden residents
have complained about undrinkable tap water, raw sewage in the
streets, abandoned buildings and open-air drug bazaars, all threats
to public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Whitman takeover plan argue that the state is
partly to blame, given that Camden has been under state supervision
through an existing finance board that can question or veto
decisions made by the city government. This arrangement has been
ineffective, partly because the board is precluded from taking
affirmative steps to deal with Camden's most pressing problems. As
it stands today, the state is paying 70 percent of Camden's
expenses and says it has spent $2 billion there over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration wants to ratchet up the state's
authority through a chief management officer who would have broad
powers during a period of civic ``rehabilitation.'' The manager
could break contracts, ignore Civil Service rules in hiring and
firing, issue or revoke licenses and direct all appointments and
spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is vague on how long the takeover would remain in
effect and what it should accomplish. But this can be clarified in
the Legislature, which should identify the circumstances under
which the takeover would be lifted and power returned to local
officials. This plan, however, should not become a license for
permanently suspending democratically elected leadership.

   Japan's Central Bank Ends Policy of Zero Interest Rates
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan ended its policy of zero interest rates on
Friday, defying government calls for a delay in a rate increase in
what has been the biggest public fight over Japanese economic
policy this century. After 17 months of near-zero rates, the
central bank raised its target for overnight lending to 0.25
percent _ the first rate increase in a decade.

   News Corp. to Buy Chris-Craft for $3.5 Billion
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. has agreed to acquire Chris Craft Industries, the
television station company, for $85 a share or a total of $3.5
billion, a person close to the discussions said Friday night.
Earlier Friday, Viacom pulled out of merger talks with Chris-Craft.
Such a merger would put tremendous control of television stations
into the hands of Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corp.
Chris-Craft, which is controlled by Herbert J. Siegel, owns 10 TV
stations, while News Corp. owns 22.

<P>
   Stocks rose as blue-chip companies surged on encouraging
economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 119.04
points, or 1.09 percent, to 11,027.80, crossing the 11,000
threshold for the first time since April. Broader stock indicators
were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was up
11.59 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,471.84, and the Nasdaq composite
index was up 29.48 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,789.47, having
recovered from a loss of 60 points earlier in the session.

   Firestone Struggles to Keep Up
</P>
<P>
   As confused consumers kept phones ringing off the hooks at
dealers across the country, Firestone struggled to cope with the
demand for replacement tires unleashed by its recall of 6.5 million
tires for sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Reports Suggest No Rate Change
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales rose in July at the fastest pace in five months,
while prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers
were little changed, two reports showed. Sales, led by gains at
auto dealers, department stores and building supply outlets, rose
0.7 percent in July after a revised 0.4 percent June increase, the
government said.

JOHN C. HARSANYI, 80; WON NOBEL ECONOMICS AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C. Harsanyi, who won the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Science for his work on game theory, died Aug. 9 in
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Harsanyi, 80, was a professor at the Haas School of Business at
the University of California at Berkeley, for 25 years until 1990.
He had Alzheimer's disease and died of a heart attack at home in
Berkeley, according to his son, Tom.
</P>
<P>
   A Hungarian of Jewish descent, Harsanyi barely escaped from the
forced-labor unit he was drafted into near Budapest close to the
end of World War II. While waiting at a crowded railway station to
be deported to a mine, Harsanyi removed his sweater with its yellow
star and walked away, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   A guard stopped him and asked him what he was doing there.
Harsanyi, according to his son, said: ``I am here to visit one of
my Jewish friends who is going to be deported. I think it is
important that we stand by our friends in their time of need.'' The
guard let him go. Tom Harsanyi said that of the workers in the
forced- labor unit, only his father and three others, who jumped
from the train, survived.
</P>
<P>
   Harsanyi won the Nobel award for his work in game theory, which
concentrates on competition among players, using mathematics to
forecast the outcome of games, like chess, and also trade wars,
hostile takeovers, price wars and other political and economic
conflicts. Unlike theories used to explain the interaction in a
market of many participants, game theory deals with the fact that
when there are just a few players, all of them have to worry about
the response of their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Harsanyi shared the award with two other economists, John F.
Nash of Princeton University and Reinhard Selten of the University
of Bonn. Nash laid out the basic principles of game theory, but he
assumed that the players all shared the same information and were
driven by self-interest. Harsanyi made the theory work when rivals
did not know much at all about what the other planned to do. He did
this, in part, by assigning probabilities to the possible moves of
the players and the outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found a way to allow people to think systematically about
markets in which there were a small number of players who had
access to different information,'' said John Quigley, a professor
of economics at Berkeley and the former chairman of the economics
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a large set of circumstances, game theory is the way
people think today,'' Quigley said. Harsanyi's work, Quigley added,
``was instrumental in making economic theory fit the imperfect
world in which we live.''
</P>
<P>
   Harsanyi was born in Budapest on May 29, 1920. His parents were
Jewish but converted to Catholicism before he was born. He was
raised as a Catholic. His main interests were in mathematics and
philosophy. But because of the political uncertainty of the time,
he earned a degree in pharmacology so that he could work in his
father's pharmacy. He was drafted into the forced-labor unit after
Germany occupied Hungary during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Harsanyi remained in Hungary, earning a doctorate
in philosophy from the University of Budapest. He was an assistant
professor of sociology at the university until the late 1940s, when
his views clashed with those of the communist government. He quit
his job and returned to work in his father's pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he escaped over the border to Austria with his future
wife, Anne, and traveled to Australia. He married Anne on Jan. 2,
1951, three days after arriving in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the University of Sydney at night to earn a master's
degree in economics and became a lecturer in economics at the
University of Queensland in Brisbane in 1954. But his son, Tom,
said that his father felt that he could not be effective in his
field from Australia. So in 1956, he enrolled in the Ph.D. program
in economics at Stanford University and studied under Kenneth
Arrow, a future Nobel winner in economics.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Australia to teach economics at the Australian
National University from 1958 to 1961 and then returned to the
United States to Wayne State University in Detroit from 1961 to
1963. He went to the Haas School at Berkeley in 1964 as a visiting
professor and became a full professor in 1965. He was appointed a
professor in the Berkeley economics department in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, before Harsanyi developed his procedure for dealing
with game theory players with incomplete information, he was asked
to be one of 10 game theorists to advise the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency on negotiations with the Soviet Union. The 10
advisers said they could not help because both ``players'' had too
little information about the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Harsanyi is survived by his wife, Anne, of Berkeley, and his
son, of Somerville, Mass. &QL;

LAZIO DISPUTES MRS. CLINTON'S CLAIMS ON ROLE IN ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's assertion that she played a quiet but
major role in several policy and legislative efforts by the Clinton
administration cannot be trusted and stems from a bid to
``reinvent'' herself for voters, Rep. Rick Lazio said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is this is just another attempt to reinvent Hillary
Clinton and that is why the people of New York have such a problem
with credibility when it comes to the Clinton campaign,'' Lazio,
who is running against Clinton for a U.S. Senate seat from New
York, said in an interview Friday after returning from a
cross-country fund-raising tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``She either was not forthcoming and not sincere when she said
she had nothing to do with these things all these years,'' Lazio
said, ``or she is communicating a very different approach to things
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article published Friday in The New York Times, Clinton
said that, contrary to what she and the White House previously had
said, she played an active role in proposing, lobbying and writing
legislation after her failure to overhaul health care in 1994.
Clinton said she cloaked her role and learned to be more subtle in
dealing with legislators on Capitol Hill after her blueprint for a
national universal health care program was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had voted for several of the bills that Clinton
now says she engineered or pushed. The legislation he supported
included bills to create the Corporation . for National Service, a
domestic version of the Peace Corps, and the Children's Health
Insurance Program, which provides $24 billion over five years to
states to insure children.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio said he was unaware of any role Clinton played in any
legislation. Democrats and some Republicans in Congress supported
Clinton's version of events, but a few Republicans say she is
taking too much credit for legislation they in fact sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spoke by phone after returning from a 14-city trip this
week, his first such cross-country tour. It included stops in
Cincinnati, Las Vegas; the Los Angeles area; Salt Lake City;
Portland, Ore.; Jackson, Wyo.; and, Friday, Bloomington, Minn.
Aides said he raised more than $1 million at fund-raisers.

GENERAL MOTORS PROPOSES AN ONLINE SITE FOR CAR SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the biggest concession by an automaker that the Internet is
transforming its business, General Motors has proposed a joint
venture with its dealers to establish a Web site offering cars made
by other manufacturers as well as its own.
</P>
<P>
   GM already has an elaborate site, called gmbuypower.com, that
refers potential customers to its dealers. But a vast majority of
online car shoppers have chosen sites offering all makes of cars,
like Autobytel.com and Microsoft's CarPoint. Moreover, an
increasing number of car buyers are using Internet services that
post no-haggle prices, rather than require the customer to
negotiate with a dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The details of GM's new service depend on talks with its
dealers, who have generally recoiled from posting their prices
publicly. But most likely it will let customers order cars at a set
price, much as they can buy books from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter this week to its dealers, Bill Lovejoy, GM group
vice president for sales, said the company was looking to fight off
the growing influence of the Web startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we _ General Motors and its dealer partners _ use the
Internet to take on those intermediaries whose mission is to come
between us?'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if GM and its dealers decided to go forward,
they would probably want to buy an existing auto sales site rather
than build a new one. Given the fall in stock market prices, even
the leader, Autobytel, has a market value of $100 million, pocket
change for GM.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said it would consider an acquisition, but that
it had not made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   GM and its dealers are increasingly worried that the new sites
may wrest customer relationships away from them. That is crucial
because dealers profit more from selling financing, insurance and
service than from the cars themselves. And the Web sites all want
to offer those services, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dealers have a love-hate relationship with the Internet,''
said Chris Denove, a partner at J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, an
automotive marketing and research firm in Detroit. ``They are
getting incremental business in the short run, but they fear that
it will ultimately do to them what it has done to other middlemen
like stock brokers and travel agents.''
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power estimates that more than half of all car buyers use
the Internet to shop for cars _ looking up dealer invoice prices,
for example. This year, it estimates, 4 percent of cars will be
purchased online, up from 2.7 percent last year and 1.1 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the car-shopping sites get fees from dealers for
sending them customers. A few buy cars from the dealers and sell
them at a markup.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said GM's new plan could remedy some of the problems
that have hurt its site in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers prefer to use the sites that sell all makes and
models because they think they can get a better deal,'' Denove
said. But he added that the plan requires an accord between GM and
the dealers giving the manufacturer a role in selling cars,
something that has caused explosive discord in the past. Earlier
this year, GM withdrew a plan to buy up 10 percent of its
dealerships so it could sell cars directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At least some GM dealers familiar with its plan, however,
praised it for including them in a way that GM's previous efforts
have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the majority of dealers will put their arms around
this because they know the Internet is here to stay,'' said Gene
Meyers, who owns Chevrolet dealerships in Paramus and Hawthorne,
N.J. ``This should be a joint venture. They have the clicks, and we
have the bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller dealers, which are still more reliant on personal
relationships, have been more resistant to the carmakers' Internet
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to reach an accord with dealers in the next
few months. And even before that it will start a test in one market
of a key aspect of the proposed new company: an Internet site where
customers can see the entire inventory of GM vehicles for sale in a
region and true selling prices for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move fast,'' said Mark T. Hogan, president of the
company's electronic commerce unit, e-GM. ``The Internet is about
launch and learn.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several other car makers have run tests to experiment with
posted car prices, but none have offered a plan as elaborate as
GM's. Ford has purchased a partial stake in CarPoint, but that site
is not favoring Fords over other cars. Rather, Ford plans to use
Microsoft technology in a new site.
</P>
<P>
   GM's proposal is complex. For one thing, manufacturers rarely
try to sell competitors' products. But the Internet has made for
some strange bedfellows. American Airlines controls Travelocity, a
site selling tickets for all carriers. And Bertelsmann has agreed
to buy CDNow, a site that sells music of all labels. As GM
envisions it, the new site would not use the GM name and would
offer information on all car models from neutral third-party
sources. Customers who decided to purchase a GM car would find more
detailed information and be able to complete the purchase online.
Those who wanted to buy a Ford, for example, would probably be
referred to the Ford site, or to a participating Ford dealer. (Many
larger GM dealers own franchises to sell other makes, and they
could get referrals from the new site for those cars.)
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially more contentions issue is GM's plan for the
new site to display the dealers' actual prices and inventory, as
some sites already do. Dealers have been concerned about such
systems, hoping to prevent online price wars.
</P>
<P>
   But some dealers familiar with GM's proposal say they are not
likely to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the Internet hasn't compressed
prices,'' said Jerry Seiner, the owner of 10 GM dealerships in Salt
Lake City. ``We make so little money from new cars, there isn't
much more you can cut.''

WALTER MAGGIOLO, 92, FEDERAL LABOR MEDIATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.Y.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Andrew Maggiolo, a top trouble-shooter for the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service in the 1950s and '60s, died Aug.
7 in Arlington, Va. He was 92 and lived in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   His career as a labor-management negotiator started in 1933
when, as a freshly minted lawyer in private practice, he was asked
to mediate a protracted strike in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distrust, enmities, and failure of the parties to try to
understand each other's problems,'' Maggiolo recalled later,
``persuaded me that this was a challenging field to which I could
and should make a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Over nearly four decades, that contribution helped end
stalemates or avert walkouts in labor disputes that had national
repercussions. He helped settle a nationwide telephone strike in
1957 and a shutdown of the steel industry in 1959. A lasting
contribution was a national master agreement he mediated in 1964
for the trucking industry and the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts also kept New Yorkers supplied with milk and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Since mediators have no enforcement power, Maggiolo relied on
persuasion, perseverance and mutual trust. As his reputation grew,
management and labor both came to rely on his counsel.
</P>
<P>
   His Washington executor, Hugh Beins, said Maggiolo, as a Roman
Catholic, was guided by the teachings of the church as they applied
to his field. He attributed his professional success to the
principles set forth in papal encyclicals as far back as Rerum
Novarum of 1891, in which Pope Leo XIII stated that workers had a
moral right to a living wage and to a voice in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Bronx, Walter Maggiolo graduated from Holy Cross
College in 1930 with a degree in philosophy. He received his law
degree at Harvard University in 1933 and went into private practice
in New York.

NADER FIRST TELEVISION AD POKES AT BIG PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Nader unveiled his first television commercial this week,
the first truly irreverent candidate commercial of the 2000
election. A takeoff on the Mastercard ``priceless'' advertising
campaign, the 30-second commercial is running on cable and on local
broadcast stations in Los Angeles; San Francisco; Sacramento and
Santa Barbara, Calif.; New York; Portland, Ore.; Seattle, and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Northwoods Advertising (Bill Hillsman)
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN:
</P>
<P>
   With ``Hail to the Chief'' playing, stock footage rolls of Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore greeting and
speaking to supporters at various public functions, followed by a
video montage of Nader through the years.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a plate.
Campaign ads filled with half-truths: $10 million. Promises to
special interest groups: over $10 billion. Finding out the truth:
priceless. There are some things money can't buy. Without Ralph
Nader in the presidential debates, the truth will come in last.
Find out how you can help. Go to votenader.com. Vote Ralph Nader
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY:
</P>
<P>
   With a cheeky spot like this, hyperbole is the name of the game,
although one could easily make the case that millions going to
``campaign ads filled with half-truths'' is not off the mark. The
reference to the cost of ``promises to special interest groups'' is
a reflection of a central tenet of Nader's campaign, that without
campaign finance reform, the major parties are beholden to those
with deep pockets and are thus indistinguishable from each other.
The spot's advocacy of Nader's inclusion in debates refers to a
decision by the commission on presidential debates that only
candidates with an average of 15 percent or more in five leading
national polls will be allowed to participate. The threshold is
virtually unattainable, say Nader and another third-party
contender, Pat Buchanan, without the national exposure of a
televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD:
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats will be happy about
this spot. In other words, viewers may find it a genuine relief
from the earnest biographical and issue advertisements on which the
parties and major candidates have been spending tens of millions of
dollars all summer. Nader's media consultant, Hillsman, was the
mastermind of Paul Wellstone's successful media strategy in his
1990 race in Minnesota for the U.S. Senate, an offbeat campaign for
an offbeat candidate that is now considered a classic. With an
album of shots of a younger, crusading Nader, the Green Party
candidate for president, this spot takes advantage of Nader's
reputation for saying what others in politics will not. And it
cleverly shades a scathing message in parody as it tries to connect
with voters' cynicism about the way campaigns are financed. The use
of the airwaves to make the case for Nader's continued presence on
the airwaves, in the televised debates, is yet another of the
spot's nifty nuances.

SUPPORT FOR SUICIDE THEORY IN EGYPTAIR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reinforcing suspicions that a suicidal co-pilot was
responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last fall, the
United States' top air-safety investigator said Friday that there
were no safety issues in the crash that would require a public
hearing to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the official, James E. Hall, the
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, released
1,700 pages of documents, including FBI reports showing that the
co-pilot had been accused of a variety of sexual improprieties at a
New York hotel during visits there in the year before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hall drew no conclusion from the reports and said the board had
not yet analyzed the information it had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the crash, which killed 217 people when the
Cairo-bound Boeing 767 went down in the Atlantic Ocean off
Nantucket, Mass., last October, almost immediately became an
international problem for the United States. When some
investigators indicated early in the board's 10-month investigation
that it suspected a co-pilot had deliberately crashed the plane,
Egyptian officials reacted with outrage and demanded a broader
investigation of the airplane's flight-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   They strongly denied suggestions that the co-pilot, Gameel
el-Batouty, grabbed the controls and put the plane into a steep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   That the matter remains sensitive was evident in the fact that
safety-board officials stressed that they still had reached no
final conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly on Friday, Hall said there were ``no unresolved safety
issues'' that would require a formal public hearing, which is
usually held after a major crash. A final report is months away.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall also said, without elaboration, that the board thought
the FBI witness reports were relevant and should be included. The
files show that the co-pilot, Batouty, was the subject of numerous
complaints at the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York, where EgyptAir
crews stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Several women who worked at the hotel told security officers
that Batouty repeatedly propositioned them sexually. In another
incident, two teen-age girls accused Batouty of following them and
exposing himself through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Several people interviewed by the FBI described him as a moody
loner. One said he saw Batouty drunk on several occasions and
thought of him as ``a tragedy waiting to happen.'' One said that
Batouty was ``a religious person who was like a kid in a candy
store when in New York City,'' because he was unaccustomed to
seeing women dressed in relatively revealing clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The files show that EgyptAir was notified of the complaints by
the hotel, and that Batouty consistently denied the accusations,
saying the hotel was harassing him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts representing EgyptAir, including a former chairman
of the Safety Board, said the documents contained extensive
evidence that argued against the crash being a murder-suicide.
Other portions of the FBI files back up the assertion of relatives
and friends who have defended Batouty. Several people interviewed
on the West Coast, where he also traveled for EgyptAir, described
him as pleasant and sociable, considerate of others and looking
forward to retirement so he could spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The docket released Friday also included the transcript of the
cockpit voice recorder from the plane, which, as previously
reported, showed that Batouty had repeatedly uttered a religious
phrase in the moments before the crash. The common Arabic phrase
``Tawakalt Ala Allah,'' translated as ``I rely on God,'' could be
heard 11 times in the last minute-and-a-half of the tape.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the board releases only a transcript, not a copy of the
tape itself, but one person who has heard the tape described the
phrase being repeated ``like a mantra'' in an obsessive way.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Adel Fouad, an Egyptian psychiatric
consultant to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, in a letter
submitted to the Safety Board and released Friday with its reports,
said that the phrase reflected an Islamic belief that humans are
supported and controlled by God, and that it ``is used only when
one embarks on a good action and not a bad one.''
</P>
<P>
   The board said in a footnote disclaimer that Fouad's statement
was not developed using board procedures and that his views were
``not necessarily''' those of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the significance of the phrase to the
investigation, a committee of experts analyzed all of the
utterances for their acoustic qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Language and behavior experts say that people under stress talk
faster. The analysis found that the first utterance was the
longest, 1.02 seconds. But the phrases did not become progressively
more panicked as the plane's fatal dive continued, varying from .73
to .87 second each, which the committee called ``relatively
regular.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript catches the crew carping about the airline and
about one another.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty seemed to be in a mood to throw his weight around.
Shortly after takeoff, he used his seniority to oust the junior
co-pilot, Adel Anwar, scheduled to be on duty for that part of the
trip. Anwar, 36, expressed surprise that Batouty was not resting in
the rear, a typical routine for a relief co-pilot early in the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something,'' Batouty said. ``I'm not going to
sleep at all. I might come back and sit for two hours, and then
...'' Anwar indicated that he himself was well rested and happy to
stay in his regular seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean you're not going to get up?'' Batouty said. ``You
will get up ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have told me,'' Anwar protested. ``You should have
told me this, Captain Gameel.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar later complains to the captain about Batouty: ``He does
whatever he pleases. Some days he doesn't work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash was in international waters, and the plane, a Boeing
767, was registered in Egypt, which by treaty would put the
Egyptian government in charge of the investigation. But Egypt
delegated the job to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety Board will not establish a probable cause of the
crash for months, and after that the Egyptian government will have
60 days to review the report before it is made public. But in
another indication of the board's thinking, the crash has resulted
in just one formal recommendation thus far: that video cameras
should be in the cockpits of commercial airliners, joining the
microphones that have been standard for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear again Friday that the Egyptian side was
uncomfortable with the results of the investigation to date.
</P>
<P>
   An Egyptian investigator, Capt. Mohsen el-Missiry, of the
Ministry of Civil Aviation, said pointedly, ``Additional work
remains to be done, particularly in assessing the design of the
Boeing 767 elevator control system.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's position is that it will listen to arguments from
participants about what should happen next, but that, for now at
least, it believes that it has completed all the necessary
investigative work, leaving it ready to turn to analysis.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, at one point an Egyptian reporter asked
Hall why the sexual allegations were relevant to the cause of the
crash, and then began discussing President Clinton's sexual
activities in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Hall replied, ``We are very aware of the important
responsibility that we have to the victims'' to perform a thorough,
fair investigation, and added, ``The statements you refer to are a
very small portion of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was clearly being careful. He responded to the question
about why there would be no public hearing on the crash by reading
from a prepared statement. He said the board's staff had
``recommended that a hearing not be held on this crash because they
believe there are no unresolved safety issues that require such a
forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his assertion Friday that the board had made no
conclusions on the crash squared with his statement on Nov. 15 that
the board was considering turning the case over to the FBI because
it might be a crime, he simply referred the questioner to a
statement posted on the Safety Board's Web site. (The statement, on
Nov. 19, said that after consultation with the FBI and the
Egyptians, the board concluded that more work had to be done.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many staff investigators are persuaded that the crash
was a suicide and are eager to move on to other mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials said Friday that they would let the documents
they had released speak for themselves. But those documents formed
a sort of Rorschach test, with experts hired by the Egyptian side
drawing contradictory conclusions from the material, which, like
much evidence in crash reports, was ambiguous in places.
</P>
<P>
   For example, EgyptAir believes Batouty was never alone in the
cockpit; Safety Board investigators believe he was.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve minutes before the end of the recording, the cockpit tape
captures three syllables.
</P>
<P>
   The five Arabic-speaking people who helped prepare the
transcript agree that it was not an Arabic word; four of them
believe they heard words similar to ``control it.'' One
English-speaking member of the committee thought it might be
``hydraulic.'' Five others say it is unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said writing a transcript of a half-hour tape, complete
with analysis of cockpit sounds, usually takes 16 hours, but this
one took 130.
</P>
<P>
   The former Safety Board chairman, Carl Vogt, a lawyer here who
now represents the Egyptians, pointed out that according to data
released Friday, the tail elevators, the devices that change the
plane's pitch, never moved to the maximum extent they are able to,
indicating that the dive was not deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   And, he noted, the flight data recorder captures someone in the
cockpit cutting engine power. ``When the nose of your airplane goes
down, to maintain constant air speed and not accelerate, you always
pull off power,'' said Vogt. ``That to me is compelling evidence
against any intent to do anything but preserve the airplane and fly
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some government investigators, though, say they do not
understand why someone _ presumably Batouty _ turned off both
engines as the plane screamed toward the water, approaching the
speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   But Vogt made another point that other pilots have also raised,
that diving is not the fastest or surest way to crash a plane.
``You'd turn the thing over, and apply power to make it go
faster,'' he said. ``This flight crew maintained wings level.''

CLEMENS' NEW DEAL IS MOST UNUSUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Roger Clemens will sign an unusual multiyear
contract extension that obligates him to play two years for the New
York Yankees, for $30.9 million, and perhaps allows both sides to
address peripheral issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited to lock up one of the greatest pitchers in
baseball history,'' said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will receive a $5 million signing bonus, to be paid over
the next two years, and a salary of $7.8 million in 2001 and in
2002. There is a third-year option for $10.3 million, with a twist.
Clemens has the right to accept the option and play for the
Yankees. Or he can reject the option and still collect $10.3
million. The Yankees hold a $7.2 million option for a fourth year
that contains no guaranteed money.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed the Yankees' acquisition of Clemens
in the spring of 1999, his agents and the Yankees reached an
understanding on a two-year deal worth between $28 million and $30
million, according to several baseball officials. The two sides
negotiated the final terms of the contract in the last three weeks,
and the Yankees announced Clemens' contract as a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   With this structure, the annual average value of Clemens' deal
is $10.3 million, and the Yankees _ always aware of the perception
that they are contributing to baseball's salary escalation _ can
say they are giving Clemens a deal worth much less than the $15
million-a-year deal signed by Kevin Brown with the Los Angeles
Dodgers two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing stopping Clemens from playing two more years,
however, moving to within range of 300 victories _ he currently has
256 _ and then declining to play for the Yankees in 2003, and
earning the $10.3 million anyway. He could then seek a new contract
for 2003, with the Yankees or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If Clemens were to play for the Yankees in 2003 under his new
contract, he would effectively be playing for no monetary
compensation, because he is guaranteed to make $30.9 million
whether he plays two or three years with the Yankees; he would
merely be playing to ensure his ties to the Yankee franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it looks like it's the final stop,'' Clemens
said Friday night. ``It's great to know I can stay with a great
team.'' Clemens, who would have been eligible to be a free agent
after this season, said the new contract has a limited no-trade
clause, but said he wasn't sure of the details.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 38, sometimes labored in his first season with the
Yankees, going 14-10 with a 4.60 earned run average in the regular
season, but finished the year by winning the clinching game of the
World Series. He started slowly again this year, and was placed on
the disabled list June 10 with a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   But since he came back July 2, Clemens has been dominant,
winning all five of his decisions.

<P>
   Lech Walesa, who fought Communist rule for two decades before
its fall in 1989, was cleared of collaborating with the
Communist-era secret police and will be allowed to run for the
presidency, which he lost in 1995. He was forced to defend his
reputation in a special screening court, which dismissed
suggestions in old police files that he spied on fellow dissidents.
Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, was scrutinized under a 1998 law
that requires candidates to declare whether they cooperated with
the Communist secret services. There is no penalty for admitting
collaboration, but anyone found to have lied is banned from public
office for 10 years.

ROCKIES NOT CLOSE TO SIGNING HARRINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Right-hander Matt Harrington of Palmdale High,
picked seventh by the Colorado Rockies in the Major League Baseball
draft on June 3, is so frustrated about negotiations with the team
that he might honor his baseball scholarship to Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is the only player among the top 13 draftees who
hasn't signed, although many of them had come to predraft contract
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not discuss the numbers, but we told the Colorado
Rockies before the draft what it would take to sign me, and they
said they'd get it done,'' Harrington said. ``They're not living up
to what they said. They're playing games with us. If it gets done,
it gets done. If not, I'm going to school on Aug. 21.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, who throws 98 mph, committed to Arizona State before
the season. His stock rose after leading all regional high school
players in victories, strikeouts and ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He believes his slide the draft _ he was ranked the nation's No.
1 prospect by Baseball Weekly and No. 2 by Baseball America _ was a
result of his contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he said, all major-league teams knew how much money he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to sign, but I want it to be fair based on what (the
Rockies) told me,'' Harrington said. ``We were up front and they
said don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's agent, Utah-based Tommy Tanzer, is negotiating with
Colorado general manager Daniel O'Dowd, who did not return phone
calls from the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real anxious to turn this into a big public scene,''
Tanzer said, ``but as of right now, I have no indication at all
that this is going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harrington honors his scholarship with the Sun Devils, he'll
be locked in for three years. If he enrolls in a junior college _
Tanzer said Harrington is considering College of the Canyons among
others _ he can re-enter the draft after one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colorado has been threatening Matt with the alternatives and
asking him why a kid would want to tie his hands,'' Tanzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them Matt knows the alternatives. He's had 10 weeks to
study his alternatives. Matt could have signed a predraft deal with
Minnesota. Colorado knew ahead of time what we wanted and they were
thrilled to get us. They just haven't handled this right.''

THE GORE BALANCING ACT: EMBRACING CLINTON WHILE STANDING ON HIS
OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ For months now, Al Gore has been searching
for the proper degree of separation from Bill Clinton. He has used
measured words and occasional policy differences both to try to
distance himself from the president and demonstrate that he is his
own man, worthy of the presidency in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has hoped to benefit from his participation
in the administration that has presided over the longest economic
expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   But in an ultimate irony for Gore, it seems he may have to rely
on that very same president he is distancing himself from in order
to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is planning a multi-stage separation process
over the next few days, although there are still internal debates
over some of the details and how explicitly Clinton should allude
to his personal behavior and impeachment when he addresses the
convention on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   That process may have begun prematurely with Clinton's comments
Thursday, when he said in a lengthy public confessional that voters
should not hold Gore accountable for Clinton's sins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for the mistakes
I've made,'' Clinton said in an interview with a pastor in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore advisers have been frustrated over the months with
some of Clinton's moves, designed to be ``helpful'' but often
upstaging Gore, they said Friday that Clinton's most recent
comments could help the vice president _ because they expected the
light to shine brightly on Clinton at this point anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known for the last four months that the first few days
of the ramp-up into our convention was in large measure going to be
about Bill Clinton and the last eight years,'' said a top Gore
adviser. ``To do it any other way would be frankly ungracious and
not politically smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But such is the entangled relationship between the president and
vice president _ and such is the admiration for Clinton's political
skills _ that questions were raised about whether the White House
and the Gore campaign had actually planned Clinton's remarks as a
way for Clinton to give Gore some breathing space, even if they
dredged up the unpleasantness that led to the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps said no. Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman,
said that Clinton arranged the interview with his pastor and did
not clear it with the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore adviser said the same thing. ``I have no idea whether
Clinton's remarks were spontaneous or pre-meditated,'' he said.
``But they were not coordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of the distancing dance that will take place in the
next few days has been. In fact, the two camps have choreographed
an entire ``transition'' process over the next week that may occur
naturally as the country begins to focus on the election, but is
designed nonetheless to help dissipate the Clinton cloud that hangs
over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has given Clinton the starring prime-time role at the
convention on Monday. Both sides are envisioning not only a
celebration of Clinton's glory years but a clear signal that his
problems are of his own making and should not be used against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat close to Clinton said that the president used his
confessional interview on Thursday as a kind of rehearsal for the
convention speech. ``He's trying out the show in New Haven before
he gets to Broadway,'' this Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign says Clinton will not be so explicit. In any
case, Gore advisers are focused on other things. ``Clinton has
great job performance ratings and terrible personal ratings,'' one
said. ``The whole trick here is to try to be associated with the
job performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Tuesday, the Gore campaign and White House
officials have arranged for a symbolic ``passing of the torch''
from Clinton to Gore, to take place in Michigan. Their wives are
expected to attend the event as well, in an attempt to cement the
idea that the Clintons are basically getting off the bus now
(although Hillary Clinton is seeking a Senate seat in New York and
Clinton seems chronically unable to yield the stage).
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Question has been swirling around the Gore candidacy
for months, and Gore has dealt with it in various ways. He began
his campaign in June 1999 with his strongest comments to date about
Clinton's affair, but he seemed genuinely surprised along the
campaign trail to be asked about the president. Finally, though, he
figured out a fairly formulaic answer, which he has more or less
followed for several months.
</P>
<P>
   He told audiences that his relationship with Clinton consisted
of four parts. As he put it in January to New Hampshire Public
Radio: `'First of all, we're friends, and that friendship is
genuine. Secondly, I have been critical of the personal mistake
that the president made, which I've been asked about from time to
time in this campaign. Third, I have fought alongside the president
for this strong economy and for the other improvements that we've
seen during the Clinton/Gore administration. And fourth, I have to
win this race on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   `'Now,'' he continued, `'depending upon the question that's
asked or the perspective of the questioner, they may focus on one
of those four aspects of the relationship and not really hear the
complexity of it with all four, and if they hear only that I'm
running on my own, they may say, `Oh, he's distancing himself.' If
they hear I fought with President Clinton for a strong economy,
they may say, `Oh, he's embracing President Clinton.' Well, all of
those things are true, but it's not true that I'm either distancing
myself from him or that I am trying to run as a derivative
candidate. So it's a complex relationship, just as most human
relationships are.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in an interview with Fox News, Gore sounded kind of
ho-hum about Clinton's confessional comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate what the president said,'' Gore said. ``He's said
it before. I think that he also went on to say that this election,
as all elections, is about the future and not the past and I very
much agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore advisers acknowledge that this is an important week for
the Clinton/Gore relationship. And they acknowledge that Gore's
selection of a running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut,
who was the first Democratic senator to openly chastise Clinton for
his behavior, was part of the larger process of trying to inoculate
himself from Clinton's behavior.

</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton, who arrived in Los Angeles Friday for
Gore's nominating convention, is charting his own course in how a
president ought to hand off the baton. He has already broken with
the tradition of past presidents who arrived just as the
conventions for their vice presidents were set to begin.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles International Airport, a reporter shouted to
Clinton that his vice president was concerned that the president
was overshadowing him. Clinton tilted his head back, laughed and
said: ``I've never heard him say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is attending several galas in his honor, but aides said
the president would spend much of his time polishing his hand-off
speech. Clinton intends to give a valedictory address that is
shorter than former President Reagan's 53-minute speech in New
Orleans but just as focused on making the case for 12 years of
one-party rule. As is the custom, the White House has shared early
drafts of the speech with Gore. White House officials have told the
Gore campaign there will be no surprises when the president steps
to the podium, but at this point, it is not clear whether Clinton
will reiterate his thoughts from Thursday as he tries to make the
case for Gore's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, he's given this speech 100 times,'' said an
administration official. ``He'll say this is a big election. He'll
say there are big important differences between the parties and
that the Democrats are the only ones who want you to know what
those differences are.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House would coordinate its scheduling
and strategy with the Gore campaign even more than it is currently
doing. But he said the president would continue to have his own
agenda, from forging next year's budget to conducting foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said, ``Conventions have a certain
rhythm and they build to the presidential nominee's speech. I'm
sure the president will get an enthusiastic response on Monday, but
the reality is that by Thursday, Gore's moment will have arrived
and the president's remarks will have been forgotten.''

CHENEY'S DALLAS COMPANY GIVING HIM $20 MILLION RETIREMENT PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y., Ga.)   (Exclusive)  
 The following article is based on reporting by Lowell Bergman,
Floyd Norris and Diana B. Henriques and was written by
Henriques.   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The energy services company that Dick Cheney served for much of
the last five years as chairman and chief executive has agreed to
give Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, a
retirement package worth an estimated $20 million, according to
people who have reviewed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the Halliburton Co., which is based in Dallas,
approved the arrangements on July 20, five days before Gov. George
W. Bush announced his selection of Cheney as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote allowed Cheney to avoid a potentially costly
aspect of his employment contract, which said he would forfeit some
of his compensation if he retired before age 62 without the board's
permission. This provision, known as golden handcuffs, is routinely
included in executives' contracts to give them incentives to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who spent much of his life as a public official and
federal employee, became a wealthy man in his years with
Halliburton. He has been paid at least $12.5 million by Halliburton
since he joined the company in 1995 and has received stock and
options worth nearly $39 million at its current stock price.
</P>
<P>
   By permitting Cheney, 59, to treat his departure as early
retirement, the directors allowed him to keep $10 million worth of
stock and options he would have forfeited had he simply resigned,
the company's public filings show. It was not clear whether the $10
million was part of the retirement package or in addition to it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those briefed on the company's plan said the board was
told the package totaled about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   While not extraordinarily large by current corporate standards,
Cheney's retirement package solidifies and expands his personal
stake in the oil industry in general, and Halliburton in
particular, while he is on the campaign trail confronting energy
policy issues that will affect Halliburton's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Vande Beek, Cheney's spokesman, said details of the package
were being worked out. Cheney, he said, will remain an employee of
Halliburton until Aug. 16 with the title ``chairman in
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of Halliburton stock is substantially higher than it
was when Cheney took over, but his tenure was not an unqualified
success. The Halliburton board annually sets financial goals for
the company with the understanding that executive bonuses will be
withheld if the targets are not met. The company failed to meet
those targets in both 1998 and 1999, although the board decided to
pay Cheney and other executives bonuses anyway in 1998 because they
had engineered a major merger with Dresser Industries, another oil
services company.
</P>
<P>
   That Cheney bonus came to $1.15 million, nearly as much as his
$1.18 million salary for the year. In 1999, however, the bonus was
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said in interviews that he will sell off his
Halliburton stock if the Republican ticket prevails in the fall. It
is not yet clear how Cheney might handle his stock options, a major
part of his wealth, which, if retained, would give him a stake in
the company's performance for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The options give him the right to buy shares at a set price for
up to 10 years. Some of Cheney's options, however, cannot be
exercised before next January, unless the board waives restrictions
on them. Other options give Cheney the chance to buy Halliburton
stock at more than its current market price of $51 a share,
worthless now but potentially valuable if he can hold them until
the company's stock rises.
</P>
<P>
   A company representative, Wendy Hall, declined to discuss
Cheney's retirement. Hall said the company allowed some executives
to retire with full benefits after age 55 and that details of
Cheney's arrangement would be made public next week.
</P>
<P>
   According to one board member, the package approved for Cheney
was not discounted to reflect either his age or his short tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the contract calls for'' is what was approved for
Cheney, said W.R. Howell, a Halliburton director and former
chairman and chief executive of J.C. Penney Co. ``He's entitled to
full retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell added, ``There was nothing done at the board level of an
exceptional nature for Dick Cheney. The press release indicated
that Dick Cheney is retiring, and that's what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Cheney is covered by two retirement plans at
Halliburton, a profit-sharing plan and a second plan, intended to
provide a minimum pension if the profit-sharing funds are
inadequate. The company has not disclosed how much Cheney stands to
receive from those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's financial statements do not describe its early
retirement program, but such arrangements typically involve a
substantial reduction in the pension benefits the employee
receives.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a number of corporate boards have granted
departing chief executives pension benefits for which they did not
qualify under strict terms of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney joined the company's board on Aug. 10, 1995, and became
chief executive on Oct. 1, 1995. While details of the retirement
plans affecting Cheney are not clear from the company's public
filings, many such plans require an employee to have at least five
years of service to receive any benefits, a milestone Cheney did
not pass until Aug. 10 at the earliest, assuming his board service
is counted.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the company has won two important
international contracts, one with Petroleos Brasileiros, or
Petrobras, the Brazilian oil giant, the other a Defense Department
contract for the reconstruction of war-damaged Kosovo. Also on his
watch, to save money, the company laid off thousands of employees
and reduced retirees' medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's decision not to sell his stock until after the election
drew some criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a built-in conflict of interest throughout the
campaign,'' said Chuck Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, rejected that
view. ``America is best served when good people from the private
sector are willing to return to the public sector,'' Fleischer
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many good people like former Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin who have done so. Surely we want to encourage their
return,'' Fleischer added.
</P>
<P>
   The Halliburton board was well within its legal powers in
granting Cheney full retirement benefits earlier than the date
specified in his contract, said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities
law professor at Columbia Law School and an expert on corporate
governance practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of such `golden handcuffs' is to keep an
attractive executive from taking a competitive job in business,''
Coffee said. ``I don't think you need to extend that concept to
keep someone from becoming pope, vice president or chief justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is certainly a significant one for Cheney's own
financial security, since his tenure at Halliburton came after he
had spent most of his career in government service as a congressman
from Wyoming and as secretary of defense _ without amassing
significant wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he is wealthy. He exercised options on 100,000
shares and sold the stock at the end of May, earning a profit of $3
million. The other options and restricted stock he was given are
worth $35.7 million at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   History offers few examples of how other candidates in Cheney's
circumstances handled the effect of a campaign on their personal
financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates on a presidential ticket, even those with
business experience, actually entered the race from state or local
political office, said Judge Leslie H. Southwick, author of the
book ``Presidential Also-Rans and Running Mates, 1788-1980.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far less common for a full-time corporate manager to step
directly from the executive suite onto the campaign trail, where
campaign issues can affect his personal fortune.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions, of course. For example, Wendell
Willkie was president of Commonwealth and Southern, a large utility
holding company, when he made his bid for the presidency in 1940 at
a time when utilities were vehemently opposing New Deal projects
like the Tennessee Valley Authority, Southwick noted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Ross Perot sought the presidency on the Reform Party
ticket while overseeing Perot Systems, a computer systems company.
But the company was not publicly traded then. Jimmy Carter
campaigned for the White House in 1976 while helping run his
family's struggling peanut business in Georgia.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A smiling concierge in the lobby directed Debra Paget
toward the eighth-floor lounge, a sumptuous room, where she plunged
into a cushy banquette. Sitting with a friend amid fountains, pink
orchids and filigreed screens, she might have been at the Four
Seasons Hotel, waiting for a waiter to bring her a cocktail. In
fact, Paget was waiting to see her gynecologist, whose office was
tucked at the rear of the lounge behind a high ash-panel wall.
</P>
<P>
   This was the reception room at the Laurance S. Rockefeller
Pavilion, a satellite clinic built last year by Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The pavilion offers diagnosis and
treatment for cancer in a setting that is part luxury hotel, part
Zenlike retreat. And for Paget it represents a marked improvement
over Sloan-Kettering's main hospital cluster half a mile uptown,
where she was treated last year for ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-Kettering, with its narrow corridors and shabby furniture,
was ``like a bad scene from a 1950s movie,'' she recalled with a
shudder. Each time she visited, her blood pressure spiked. Now,
when she arrives at the pavilion waiting room for her quarterly
post-treatment checkup, the roar in her head has subsided to a hum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a fancy waiting room, even one with haiku engraved on
the walls, does not quite alleviate the stress of being treated for
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what you're here for, and no amount of design will
ever get your mind past that,'' said Paget, 45, a program manager
for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, more and more medical centers are keeping step with the
Rockefeller Pavilion, revamping their decor and introducing luxury
services to bolster the spirits of patients and give them a sense
of well-being. In recent years, doctors and hospitals have
integrated alternative and Eastern-influenced treatments with
conventional Western medicine. Now, they are extending that
holistic approach to the look and feel of the clinical environment.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the aesthetic equivalent of acupuncture. In the
New York City area, health care institutions and a spate of
wellness centers are wooing patients with amenities like on-site
hair salons, Zen tearooms and lavish kimonos, which make chilly
clinics and consulting rooms seem as dated as high-button shoes.
Efforts to warm the atmosphere vary from place to place. But at
wellness resorts and even in traditional hospitals, patients find
the mellow lighting, waterfalls, vanilla-scented candles and sea
grass common at a New Age spa.
</P>
<P>
   Even uniforms have been made over with cheery patterns and
bright colors, reinforcing the impression that the hospital staff
is as friendly and accessible as, say, one's favorite hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   To hear it from some physicians, medicine's new emphasis on
style is long overdue. Among the leading proponents of
soul-soothing decor is Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and
an outspoken champion of healing through design.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that in the past we have undervalued the
aesthetics of care,'' said Oz, whose office at New York
Presbyterian Hospital is furnished with Oriental carpets and wood
paneling. ``I wanted my patients to feel they were in my house,''
Oz said. ``If I could put a fire in the corner, I would.'' New Age
chimes tinkle on the sound system, and the scent of coconut wafts
from the corridors into the consulting room, where patients can
gaze out at the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The Integrative Health Center at the Rockefeller Pavilion is
similarly airy, offering acupuncture and massage as well as
chemotherapy in a room painted with blue skies and scudding clouds.
Other clinics have an earthier feel. Natural materials like slate
and silvered wood cover almost every surface at the SoHo
Integrative Health Center Manhattan, which opened this month. Run
by Dr. Laurie Polis, a dermatologist, the center is filled with the
reassuring sights, sound and scents of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to dispel anxieties that rise from memories of
walking down a sterile hallway, a nurse in white shoes coming at
you with a syringe,'' Polis said.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to create an anticlinical environment, she
commissioned Clodagh, an architectural designer known for her
woodsy spa interiors and stores, to create a setting that evokes a
Zen garden and a rain forest. Its focal point is a 27-foot wall of
water that plunges from the upper floors to the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Patients awaiting the removal of skin lesions or a consultation
with the house internist or ophthalmologist can steady their nerves
with a facial, a seaweed wrap or a visit to Steven Dillon, the
center's own hair guru. Cocooned in sand-color terry-lined robes,
the patients, who are called ``clients,'' sit in the waiting area
sipping iced green tea and inhaling the house fragrance, a blend of
ginger and passion flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A similar hush pervades the Continuum Center for Health and
Healing, an outpatient clinic of the Beth Israel Medical Center in
New York. Opened last June, the center offers traditional Western
medical treatments alongside Eastern therapies in an environment
that looks like a Hong Kong hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan carpets, rough-hewn wooden benches and a weeping fig
tree, among other features, were installed at the suggestion of
Alex Stark, a New York feng shui specialist. Chinese cabinets,
fountains and a limestone corridor make the reception area feel
like a sanctuary, compelling visitors to lower their voices.
</P>

<P>
   Across the Hudson, at Hackensack University Medical Center,
Suzen Heeley, the hospital's designer, was so infatuated with the
spa concept that she installed a health resort on the premises.
Hackensack's Beyond Day Spa, which she says is the first spa inside
a hospital, opened in June. It borrows liberally from the Asian
design themes and the treatment menus of upscale health resorts
like the Peninsula and Bliss in Manhattan. As its news release
perhaps too chipperly announces, ``Here is a place where women can
schedule a morning massage and manicure, and an afternoon
mammography.''
</P>
<P>
   She can also retreat to the Shangri-La-style meditation room to
sip rosebud tea through a perforated silver straw and sample a
sugar bath with litchi, one of the bath products offered by brands
like Fresh, Lazar-tigue and Creed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the services are extended to patients in the adjacent
hospital building. Those who cannot get to the Beyond Day Spa can
enjoy a bedside facial while watching seascapes and sailboats on
television sets tuned to the Relaxation Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Medical chic has found its way around the country, too. At
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, picture windows with
lakefront views are among the luxurious features that were built
into each room when the hospital was redesigned last year. Other
comforts include corner shelves to hold cards and flowers, carpeted
corridors, $30,000 patient beds that convert to easy chairs and
plush window seats that fold out for family members who stay the
night. The hospital says the cost for such features, which are
partly paid for by benefactors, will not be passed on to patients.
</P>
<P>
   When Northwestern's Women's Hospital, part of a $580 million
hospital development project, opens in 2004, painted landscapes
will decorate the ceilings in patient rooms. ``Research has shown
that patients who look at boats and beaches in pre-op do much
better in surgery,'' said Dr. Alice Domar, director of the Center
for Women's Health at the Mind Body Medical Institute of Harvard
University. Domar consulted with architects on the hospital's
design. ``Women especially are conscious of aesthetics,'' she said.
``If the room looks good, it makes them feel more confident in the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   It also makes them feel at home. Hoping to create an aura of
cozy domesticity, designers at Roosevelt St. Luke's Hospital in New
York decorated the labor rooms in the childbirth center in festive
chintz. The flower-pattern curtains and bedspreads, winged chairs
and rockers look better suited to a bed-and-breakfast in the
Cotswolds than to a delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of hospital gowns, St. Luke's maternity patients are
encouraged to wear their own nightclothes. At most hospitals and
clinics patients must still wear shapeless gowns in dispiriting
shades of teal and gray.
</P>
<P>
   Hackensack Hospital has commissioned Nicole Miller, a designer
known for animated prints, to give the classic gown a makeover.
Miller's breezy trousers, shorts and kimonos are patterned with
needles and stethoscopes. Not exactly calming but more uplifting
than standard-issue hospital blue.
</P>
<P>
   The health care industry's new emphasis on more stylish settings
also has a profit motive. To lure and keep clients who might
otherwise have defected to one of Manhattan's tonier wellness
centers, Jack Ferguson, the president of Hackensack University
Hospital, keeps one eye fixed on image, the other on the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do everything with style and class, from installing
mahogany paneling in the hospital's main lobby to providing
high-quality products at the spa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects his efforts to pay off and thinks the spa will clear
$50,000 in its first year. The funds are funneled back to the
hospital to pay for new facilities, Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clients at Hackensack and elsewhere around the country readily
pay for small luxuries like a reiki massage ($45) at the
Rockefeller Pavilion or a warm cream pedicure at the Beyond Day Spa
in Hackensack ($35), where the price of a single room is $1,600 a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Tortoriello, who spent a week with her husband, William,
at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he had surgery, seemed
enchanted with their $950-a-night room. ``We felt like we were in a
hotel,'' she said. Among the features that impressed her were deep
picture windows and a wing chair with an ottoman. ``It was as
though they were part of a Victorian parlor,'' she said. ``It
wasn't the hospital look at all, and that makes such a
difference.''

FIRESTONE SCRAMBLES TO MEET DEMAND FOR REPLACEMENT TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As confused consumers kept phones ringing off the hooks Friday
at dealerships across the country, Bridgestone/Firestone struggled
to cope with the demand for replacement tires unleashed by its
recall of 6.5 million tires for sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it planned to double its production of tires in
the United States and to step up its imports from other plants run
by Bridgestone, its Japanese parent. The domestic increases will
not include a plant in Decatur, Ill., to which Firestone has traced
a disproportionate number of the tire failures that led to the
recall, the second biggest in its 100-year history.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, dealers were still impatiently waiting for Firestone
to give them a definite timetable for when replacement tires will
roll in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are calling from the time we open until the time we
close, and we don't expect the calls to slow down before next
week,'' said Scott McClain, a sales manager at S&AMP;S Tire, which runs
22 retail stores in Kentucky and also serves as wholesaler to other
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The recall includes all of Firestone's ATX and ATX II tires for
15-inch wheels, as well as Wilderness tires of the same size with a
Department of Transportation 10-digit designation starting with the
letters VD; these latter tires are the ones made at the Decatur
plant. Because most of the reported incidents involve motorists
driving in hot-weather regions _ and because supplies of
replacement tires are short _ the recall is being conducted in
phases, starting in the Sun Belt states.
</P>
<P>
   The recall, a response to reports of 46 deaths in accidents and
hundreds of tire failures, has been extended to Canada and Mexico.
Most tires being recalled were supplied as original equipment on
Ford Explorers, the most popular sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   McClain said he spent two days this week walking through an S&AMP;S
retail outlet, checking tire pressure on customers' Ford Explorers.
Some were as high as 45 pounds per square inch _ an overinflation
level that could itself cause a tire to eventually burst _ and some
as low as 20 PSI. ``No tire is safe if you are running it
underinflated at 100 miles an hour,'' he said. Many dealers said
their customers were expressing wariness about all Firestone tires,
not just those being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Although Firestone is giving California, Arizona and other
hot-weather states first priority for replacement tires, dealers in
other states are unwilling to make their own customers wait. On
Wednesday, when Firestone announced the recall, S&AMP;S had 3,500
Wilderness tires _ not counting any being recalled _ in stock. It
has already used them up, and is almost out of similar tires from
other manufacturers as well. The company has ordered 2,500 more
SUV-compatible tires from Goodyear, Michelin and other Firestone
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Wright Tire, a large independent dealership in Anoka, Minn.,
that derives about 95 percent of its sales from Firestone tires, is
getting more breathing room. The owner, Thomas Wright, said he got
as many as 300 calls a day on Wednesday and Thursday, but that the
volume had tapered off by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But in his view, customer panic is misplaced. ``Probably 80
percent of the Firestone tires we've sold have gone on SUVs, many
of them on Ford Explorers, and we've never had one reported
problem,'' he said. ``If you keep the tire properly inflated, it
runs just fine.''

EDITORIAL: GERMANY'S IMMIGRATION DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 12:
</P>
<P>
   A bomb apparently targeted at foreigners went off at a
Duesseldorf train station recently, injuring nine immigrants, six
of them Jews, as they returned home from a German-language class. A
few days later, with great fanfare, a 25-year-old Indonesian
software specialist became the first recipient of a new visa
Germany plans to give to foreigners with computer skills. The
juxtaposition underscored one of the main challenges facing German
society and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government _ the
nation's need to be more welcoming to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Duesseldorf bombing, along with a rash of other attacks on
foreigners, has provoked much soul-searching. Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer of the Green Party urged Germans to speak out
against skinhead and neo-Nazi violence, lest the perpetrators
believe they are acting on behalf of a silent majority.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the moral imperative, an attitudinal change toward
immigration has become a matter of economic necessity. Where
Germany once grudgingly allowed in millions of guest workers,
mostly Turks, to do menial jobs, the nation's high-technology
industries must now rely on skilled foreigners in order to remain
competitive in the world market. The Federation of German Employers
says that the nation lacks as many as 1.5 million skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Schroeder pushed through a reform of citizenship laws
that had enshrined the principle that immigrants in Germany, as
well as their descendants, should forever remain foreigners. Now
the children of guest workers born on German soil may acquire
German citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's Social Democratic Party paid a heavy price for
championing this sensible reform, dampening its enthusiasm to take
further pro-immigration stands. But the political atmosphere is
changing. The growing sense of shame at the rash of attacks on
foreigners coincides with a realization that Germany will become
increasingly reliant on immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   There is a common misperception that Germany is a nation
overcrowded by immigrants. According to a government report, the
net population gain due to immigration last year was 202,000. But
because of the country's low birth rate, even if that number were
maintained every year, Germany would still lose 15 percent of its
population by 2050. Germany's social insurance programs face an
ever-shrinking pool of workers subsidizing retirees' benefits. It
should be clear to all Germans that immigration is vital to the
nation's health.

   News Corp., which owns the Fox television network, has agreed to
acquire Chris-Craft Industries, the TV-station company, for $3.5
billion, a person close to the discussions said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft, which is controlled by Herbert J. Siegel, 72, owns
10 television stations, while the News Corp., controlled by Rupert
Murdoch, owns 22 stations.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. is expected to pay $85 a share, a 21 percent
premium to the price of Chris-Craft stock this week.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom abruptly announced Friday that merger talks with
Chris-Craft had broken down, sending shares of Chris-Craft
plummeting to $62, down $8. Then, after the market closed,
Chris-Craft said it was in talks with another major media company.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to acquire television-station companies has been
intense. Viacom, which owns television stations and is also
part-owner of UPN, has been negotiating on and off for several
years to acquire the Chris-Craft stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the assets, but only at a price,'' Sumner Redstone,
the chairman of Viacom, said Friday night. ``The price wasn't
right, and we decided to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a merger would put tremendous control of television
stations into Murdoch's hands. For one thing, the News Corp.,
already owns WNYW, Channel 5, in New York. The purchase of
Chris-Craft would bring him WWOR-TV, Channel 9, a UPN affiliate.
That raises the issue of whether Murdoch would shut UPN out of the
New York market. The News Corp. would also own two stations in Los
Angeles, as well as in Phoenix and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the Federal Communications Commission did not
permit the ownership of two stations in a single market. The FCC
still limits station groups to ownership of stations that cover no
more than 35 percent of the nation's households.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules adopted in August 1999, the FCC allows dual
ownership in cities where there are a sufficient number of ``media
voices,'' which include all radio and television stations, large
daily newspapers and cable systems. Specifically, a city must have
at least eight independently owned television stations for a single
company to own two. And a company cannot own more than one of the
four top-rated stations in any market.
</P>
<P>
   Should the deal go through, it would also give the News Corp.
control of BHC Communications, of which Chris-Craft owns 80
percent. BHC operates very-high-frequency and ultra-high-frequency
TV stations. It has a market value of $3.18 billion. There are 4.5
million shares outstanding. BHC in turn owns 58 percent of United
Television.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chris-Craft tried to sell Viacom all its stations and
its half-interest in UPN. But Viacom thought the price was too
high. Viacom walked away from the deal and told Chris-Craft that it
would exercise a clause that allowed it either to buy Chris-Craft's
half-interest in UPN or sell its own half-interest to Chris-Craft.
Chris-Craft was then forced to sell its half-interest to Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, there was a second round of negotiations on the
stations, and Viacom walked away again, thinking the price too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft owns 10 stations: WWOR in Secaucus, N.J.; KCOP, Los
Angeles; KPTV, Portland, Ore.; KBHK, San Francisco; KMSP,
Minneapolis-St. Paul; KUTP, Phoenix; WRBW, Orlando, Fla.; WUTB,
Baltimore; KTVX, Salt Lake City, and KMOL, San Antonio.

WALTER CHAPPELL, PHOTOGRAPHER OF NATURE, IS DEAD AT 75
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.M., Ore.) By   ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Chappell, whose finely detailed, impeccably printed
photographs of landscapes, natural forms and the human body were
known for their mystical intensity, died on Tuesday in Santa Fe,
N.M. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from lung cancer and a lung
infection, said his companion, Linda Elvira Piedra.
</P>
<P>
   Although his work is represented in museums across the country,
Chappell was not widely known outside the world of art photography.
Within the field he was a constant if peripatetic presence for more
than 40 years. From 1957 to 1961 he was curator of prints and
exhibitions at George Eastman House in Rochester and was affiliated
with Aperture, the photography magazine (and now book publisher)
founded by the photographer Minor White in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s he was the driving force behind the
Association of Heliographers Archive Gallery, a photographers
cooperative and gallery on in Manhattan whose members included Paul
Caponigro, Marie Cosindas and Nicholas Dean. He published several
books of photographs and wrote widely on the subject, promulgating
ideas influenced by the writings of G.I. Gurdjieff.
</P>
<P>
   A student of White and Edward Weston, Chappell worked in a
tradition founded by Alfred Stieglitz that viewed photography as
the means to a deeper reality and therefore the equal of painting,
poetry and music. His richly toned black-and-white images exuded an
almost tantric air of concentration and often considerable sexual
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell was a free spirit. He moved dozens of times, built 25
darkrooms and at least three houses for himself; painted, played
the piano and wrote poetry throughout his life and also made films.
He supported himself as an oyster fisherman, carpenter and house
builder and as a photographer of celebrities (his subjects included
Nico, Sharon Tate and Dennis Hopper). In two marriages and several
long-term relationships he had seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell was born in Portland in 1925, the son of a singer with
the Portland Symphony Choir and a train engineer who was
one-quarter American Indian. He lived his first three years on the
Yumatillo Indian Reservation in northeast Oregon, which left him
permanently enthralled with American Indian ceremonies. After the
family moved to Portland, he studied music at a conservatory at age
6, then attended the Benson Polytechnical School, majoring in
architectural drawing. He met White, who became a lifelong friend
and mentor, when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
   After being a paratrooper in World War II, Chappell made San
Francisco his base for several years, joining a circle of
photographers that included White, Weston, Imogen Cunningham and
Ansel Adams. In the mid-1950s, he studied with the photographer
Winter Prather, a master technician who made his own lenses and
cameras. He then moved to Rochester, N.Y., where he resumed his
printmaking studies with White, who was working at Eastman House,
and began working there himself. In 1957 he had his first New York
exhibition at George Wittenborn Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Eastman House in 1961, Chappell settled in
Wingdale, N.Y., where a fire destroyed his house and nearly all his
work that year. In 1963, after a second house he built on the same
property was taken for a power line, he relocated to the Pacific
Coast. He lived in or near Santa Fe from 1965 to 1970 and returned
to the area in 1979. In 1987 he settled in El Rito, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell's first wife, Patricia Schmid, whom he married in 1956,
died in 1959. He was married to his second wife, Suzanne Lechau,
from 1977 to 1984. In addition to Piedra, he is survived by his
son, Dharma, of Bend, Ore., whose mother is Leslie Spears; the four
sons that he had with Nancy Barrett Dickinson, Theo, of Ukiah,
Calif., Aryan, of Redwood Valley, Calif., Piki, of San Francisco,
and Robin, of Eugene, Ore.; a daughter, Riversong, of Spokane,
Wash., whose mother is Lechau; and a stepdaughter, Ajna Lechau, of
New York City.

SPORTS COLUMN: DUSTY BAKER, THE GIANTS AND DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the midst of preparing for the opening game in a
series against the New York Mets _ tickets to get, coaches to
coordinate for a meeting _ Dusty Baker paused Friday at Shea
Stadium to contemplate a question about his second passion, music.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants' 51-year-old manager was asked to
consider a hypothetical scenario: He was exiled to a deserted
island and could only take five compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take Tupac, the double set. I'd take George Clinton; I'd
bring John Lee Hooker; I'd bring Santana, and I'd have to bring
something by George Howard,'' he said. ``Sometimes you need to be
up, sometimes you need to be angry. Sometimes you need to be
mellow, sometimes you need to enjoy. Sometimes you just need to be
entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Baker summed up his strength as a manager and laid
out the reasons he has been able to stay in one place for seven
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Baker became the Giants manager in 1993. Only Minnesota's Tom
Kelly, Atlanta's Bobby Cox and Montreal's Felipe Alou have been at
their current jobs longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple times I knew I was on the hot seat, but
seems like my teams would always win when I was on the hot seat,''
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   What is the source of his longevity?
</P>
<P>
   Baker cited God, but conceded a variety of extenuating factors.
Baker, who was born in the Southern California city of Riverside,
has settled into the Bay Area. ``I live in the community, and I'm
big in the community, too,'' he said. ``You have more people who
know you personally. That puts pressure on the organization not to
get rid of you quicker, too. If you're not big in the community and
you don't have any community people saying, `Hey don't do this,
don't do that,' people have freer rein to do what they want to do,
and nothing's said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps that San Francisco is a more liberated town,'' Baker
continued. ``The mayor is African-American, you have black civic
leaders, a powerful black clergy that's also big in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, under Baker, are a hard-nosed team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teams have always played hard,'' he said. ``My teams are
always in the thick of it. Whether we won it or not, we were
usually pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain spirit Baker brings to the game. Players feel
it; most of them like it. Darryl Hamilton played for Baker in 1997
and 1998. ``You knew that he was the guy in charge,'' Hamilton said
of Baker. ``Then again, you didn't. He kind of came to you like
another player. All the guys who played for him respected him
because of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still thinks he can hit,'' Hamilton said. ``He'd always be
talking to the hitters about hitting. I'd be like, `Dusty, come on,
man, you can't hit anymore.' He'd grab a bat and go out and hit.
Most managers aren't like that. They're not as easy to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Baker has an unyielding bottom line that you
cross at your peril. He uses it to distinguish between outer and
inner dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the outer dignity is stuff like our parents had to
learn that we didn't have to do.'' he said. ``You've got a wife,
kids, responsibility. So you take certain things for now, in order
to survive. ``But when it gets too personal, at that point, damn
the job, damn everybody because now you have penetrated my inner
core, my inner dignity, which no man has the right to intrude
upon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are treading perilously close to Baker's inner
dignity. Baker, one of only six managers to be voted Manager of the
Year twice _ in 1993 and '97 _ is a hot commodity. The Giants seem
to be playing loose and easy with Baker. They have a new stadium
and a solid team. Life is good. Maybe the franchise has deluded
itself _ as franchises often do _ into thinking the front office is
the source of the team's success and that it can get just about any
skipper to direct the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is not making his status an issue. That's an offshoot from
something else his father taught him. ``You've got to pick your
battles,'' he said. ``Sometimes you've got to say, `I'll take it
now, but I'm going to get you later.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the best-case scenario, Baker would lead San Francisco to the
World Series, then ride off, perhaps with his music to that
deserted island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm trying not to distract my team,'' Baker said.
``I told the team: `Who knows where anybody's going to be next
year, or tomorrow, for that matter? Tomorrow is not promised to
anybody. Let's go out, work hard, play hard, have a good time and
make this the most memorable year of your career. Let's go out and
make this a miracle year.'''

WITCHES EXPRESS RELIEF AS VEXING CASE IS CLOSED
</HEADLINE>
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ To the relief of witches throughout
Connecticut, the case of Kerri Lynn Patavino appears to be closed
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   In the case's final chapter, Patavino, a 32-year-old former
school bus driver and follower of Wicca, the witchcraft religion,
who was convicted in 1996 of having a sexual relationship with a
14-year-old boy, returned to court this week to admit her guilt and
to request that her prison sentence be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The admission meant one last round of headlines in Connecticut
newspapers about witchery and of stories recounting the
prosecution's allegations that Patavino, a mother of two, had used
a boy on her bus route in rituals of sex and blood-drinking on a
bed atop a large pentagram in her home in Monroe, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Witches, who say their religion has more to do with nature
worship than with dark, occult practices, say it is time for the
case to fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever religion somebody is doesn't change the fact that you
have folks who do rotten things,'' said Dawn Debbe, a witch in
Hamden who teaches classes in Wicca and magic, including spell
casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the emphasis should have been on the fact
that she is a witch,'' Debbe said. ``One of the things that
bothered me a lot was that they had declared her in the headlines
here as an alleged witch, which cracked me up because you never
hear of an alleged Catholic or an alleged Lutheran.''
</P>
<P>
   Patavino was convicted of multiple counts of sexual abuse and
risking injury to a minor and was sentenced to six years in prison.
In exchange for her admission of guilt, prosecutors did not oppose
her request for a shorter sentence. And on Tuesday, Judge Joseph T.
Gormley Jr. cut the sentence by one year.
</P>
<P>
   After her arrest, several witches set up a defense fund and
argued her cause in various online Wicca newsletters, one of which,
``Jane's Tidings,'' criticized the ``lurid publicity'' around the
case ``that emphasized and cheapened her religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The total number of witches in Connecticut is not known, but
Safko said she herself maintained a mailing list of about 800
people. And the Connecticut Wiccan Resource page lists more than
two dozen covens and other witch groups in addition to the Pagan
Community Church in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had alleged that Patavino used the 14-year-old boy
to celebrate ``The Great Rite,'' an act of ritual sex that is a
central tenet of Wicca, symbolizing the male-female polarity in the
universe. Witches say participation in the rite is always
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   But Debbe, not inclined to automatically approve the behavior of
a fellow witch, noted that since ``children can't give consent,''
voluntary participation by the teen-ager was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you are going to call it the Great Rite or
what you are going to call it,'' she said. ``But religions also
have to work within the guidelines of the law and the guidelines of
the age of reason.''

BACKSTROKE FAVORITE QUALIFIES FOR SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Oleg Krayzelburg had one piece of advice for his
son, Lenny, before the U.S. Olympic trials: ``Break world
records.''
</P>
<P>
   They were an immigrant's expectations. Oleg and Yelena
Krayzelburg brought their two children to Los Angeles from the
former Soviet Union in 1989, seeking harbor from anti-Semitism and
from the possibility that their son would be conscripted into a
protracted war when he turned 18. Lenny Krayzelburg had been an
age-group champion in Odessa in what is now Ukraine. A born
backstroker, his coach had told him. For his father, those words
were as indelible as a stamp on a passport.
</P>
<P>
   ``His expectations are pretty high,'' Lenny said with a laugh
late Friday morning, seven hours before he was to swim the final of
the 100-meter backstroke. ``Sometimes he has higher expectations
than what is possible. But I know how to handle it. As long as I
win, that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night he did just that. Krayzelburg, 24, did not break
his own world record of 53.60 seconds, but he won the 100
backstroke in 53.84. Neil Walker, who missed the 1996 Olympic team
by a hundredth of a second, qualified Friday night in second place
in 53.85. Krayzelburg also holds the world record in the 200-meter
backstroke of 1 minute 55.87 seconds, and with a leg on the medley
relay, he could establish himself as the dominant American swimmer
of the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to send a message to the Australians that we're
ready to go,'' Krayzelburg said.
</P>
<P>
   In other events, the ebullient Barbara ``B.J.'' Bedford, 27, of
Etna, N.H., won the women's 100-meter backstroke in 1:01.85,
qualifying for her first Olympic team at what are her fourth
trials. Extremely nervous before the race, she vomited and then
placed a call to the Olympic training center in Colorado Springs,
Colo., to speak to a sports psychologist. Elated upon winning, she
hugged everyone within reach on the pool deck. Four years ago,
Bedford had shaved her head for what became a disappointing meet.
Friday night she did not even have to shave time from her career
best of 1:01.11 to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am overwhelmed, excited and effervescent,'' Bedford said.
Previously, she said the monkey on her back had become an
orangutan. ``This is an unbelievable feeling. I don't think I'll be
able to describe it for at least three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200-meter freestyle, Josh Davis of San Antonio made
an attempt to break the world record of 1:45.51 held by Australia's
teen sensation, Ian Thorpe. Davis could not hold his early pace,
but he still finished first in 1:47.26, breaking a 12-year-old U.S.
record held by Matt Biondi.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson, who won the women's 100-meter butterfly on
Thursday, withdrew from the 200 freestyle Friday as planned to
concentrate on the 100 freestyle. Dara Torres, who finished second
in the 100 butterfly after a seven-year layoff, dropped out of the
200 freestyle semifinals Friday night after suffering uterine
cramping during the preliminary round Friday morning. She is still
scheduled to compete in the 50 and 100 freestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dara has a history of severe uterine cramping during long
races such as this one,'' Glen Luepnitz, her nutritionist, said in
a statement. ``The cramping can be debilitating. Any type of
intense activity can bring this about. Her blood pressure drops,
she gets the cold shakes. It can come on during the warm-down. We
just keep her very warm until the cramping subsides.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 100-backstroke, Krayzelburg consummated a career
that began when his father urged him to enter an army-sponsored
sports club in Odessa at kindergarten age. By age 9, he and 44
other swimmers were together from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day at a
sports school, being taught in the pool and the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   When his family immigrated to West Hollywood, Calif., on March
14, 1989, it seemed that his promising career might evaporate. At
13, Krayzelburg had little facility for English and no facility for
swimming in his neighborhood. ``I want you to keep swimming,'' his
father told him. But where? The school he attended, Fairfax High
School, did not even have a swim team. For a year, he took a
50-minute bus ride each way to train at Santa Monica City College.
</P>
<P>
   The long commute and lack of proper training left him
disheartened. He wanted to quit, but his father would not let him.
``You put in so many years in Russia,'' Oleg Krayzelburg told his
son. Lenny began training closer to home at the Westside Jewish
Community Center in Los Angeles. The pool was only 25 yards in
length, half the size of an Olympic pool. Still, the center was
close to home and offered him a job working as a lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, he enrolled at Santa Monica City College in
1993 and set a national junior college record in the 200-yard
backstroke. Southern Cal then offered a scholarship, and its coach,
Mark Schubert, told Krayzelburg, ``If you are willing to work, you
can be the best backstroker in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I needed to hear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, who has a finance degree, became an U.S. citizen in
1995, and a year later he finished sixth in the 200-meter
backstroke at the 1996 Olympic trials. He has since become the
world's dominant backstroker. That was particularly evident
Thursday night. Wearing neither a high-tech bodysuit nor even a
swim cap, he cruised through the 100-meter semifinals, coming
within seven hundredths of a second of his record of 53.60.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, in a cap and a hydrodynamic suit that extended to
his knees, Krayzelburg touched the wall in 25.6 seconds after 50
meters, second to Walker, but surged into the lead into the
homestretch. He appeared to be on world-record pace but he seemed
to tire at the end, perhaps under the expectation of a record.
Still, he won. Oleg Krayzelburg, a hospital chef, and Yelena, a
bookkeeper, were in the stands watching. This is why they had come
to the United States, to see their son become a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I never imagined standing here today,''
Lenny Krayzelburg said. ``This is very special. I've been fortunate
to get some opportunities and to take advantage of them with great
people who were willing to help me be successful.''

INFLUENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS STRESS L.A.'S IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eli Broad, the co-chairman of L.A. Convention
2000, and other influential entrepreneurs spoke Friday of the
challenges Los Angeles faces in continuing the current economic
expansion to a host of prominent business and entertainment
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge we face is to make K-12 education more
challenging to our students,'' Broad told an audience at an
economic round table held at the county library. ``Our biggest
challenge and vulnerability is education.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was bolstered by Amgen Corp. Chairman Gordon Binder;
Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills; Henry Cisneros; Sky Dayton,
founder of Earthlink; Alfred E. Mann, chairman of MiniMed; and
Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of Los Angeles in the future is going to depend on
education,'' Riordan said. ``Unless this revolution succeeds in our
schools, Los Angeles is not going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have these great universities, but we have to better
prepare the students moving up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Broad also outlined a number of downtown projects, including the

   ``A vibrant downtown would be a place to bring all our

centers.''
</P>

   Dayton, also co-founder of Santa Monica-based eCompanies,
highlighted technology as an industry that will continue the
region's economic expansion because of the diversity of people and
industries.

said. ``When we started Earthlink, we had people coming out of
entertainment and defense. JPL was a source for engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that could happen anywhere else. Los Angeles is
an amazing crossroads of industry, entertainment, manufacturing and

</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, founder and chairman of American CityVista,
spotlighted why the image of Los Angeles to the rest of the country
doesn't match the reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that happen here are high profile: the Lakers
celebration, fires and the Northridge Earthquake,'' he said.
``Despite whatever negative press that comes out of L.A., people
and businesses are still attracted to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad agreed that Los Angeles faces image problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as many of the old economy companies that have left,
including Douglass Aircraft and Home Savings, they have been
replaced by many companies that aren't as well known,'' he said.
``That's part of the reason for our image problems.''

SISTERS DEVISE LATES FASHION RAGE

<P>
   NORTHRIDGE _ Growing up in Mexico City, Gina Eckstein and Ivette
Helfend started their entrepreneurship early. The sisters, born 11
months apart, persuaded their mother to buy them chocolate, then
promptly sold it - at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Their business acumen has improved. Now they've taken a $2,000
investment and turned it into a business they expect to gross
$200,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linx composable bracelets was born in September 1999, when
Helfend was on a cruise to Italy. There she saw bracelets that
could be assembled from links of stainless steel decorated with
18-karat gold letters, semi-precious stones and various ornaments
and symbols.
</P>
<P>
   She called her sister from Italy and said ``You have to trust
me. You have to go into this with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfend said she spent half her vacation arranging to import and
distribute the bracelet components and nearly missed her boat
several times.
</P>
<P>
   The bracelets can be customized to spell the names or initials
of loved ones, carry a message or just be decorative. They can be
``stacked'' or combined for effect, and because they can have any
number of links and are stretchy, they fit any wrist - from very
large to tiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I think this is so successful is that
people can create their own,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they get the instant gratification of having it done on
the spot,'' Helfend said.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities such as Heather Locklear, Jennie Garth and Tracy
Austin are wearing Linx, the sisters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once one celebrity starts wearing it, it just grows and
grows,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Linx components are sold at retail, mainly by phone order
through their Northridge office, at charity shows and at home
parties. One of the sisters' projects is to create an online order
form for their Web site, linxbracelets.com. For now, the Web site
acts as a showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $30 to $400 for a bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   With five children under the age of 3 between them, Helfend and
Eckstein see Linx as an opportunity for other full-time moms to
make money and socialize at the same time. Some 20 representatives
around the country have come on board.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Bloxberg sells Linx at shows and parties through her home
business, Family Ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was selling `mommy' jewelry, so this tied in perfectly with
my line,'' Bloxberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Moms love anything to do with their children, so they love to
customize bracelets with their children's names or initials, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloxberg said she is happy with the results of home jewelry
parties, and the bracelets have been a big hit at shows.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Bloxberg had a booth at the national Haddasah Jewish
women's convention, attended by about 3,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did tremendous. I believe we were their No. 1 vendor,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein and Helfend arrange their business around the
children's schedules. The sisters work on Linx after they put their
children to bed - sometimes staying up through the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our only quiet time. I think it's worth it because we
like to be productive in a business sense,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it on your own time. It's pleasurable, social,
successful,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have developed a good relationship with their
Italian suppliers, and now they are part of the design team.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have a basketball, because in Italy, they don't play
basketball. Same thing with golf: It's not as hot there,'' Eckstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters also sell premade bracelets, rings and necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   They like to be in business, particularly with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any excuse to be together,'' Helfend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very lucky,'' they said in unison.

CONGRESSWOMAN MOVES EVENT OUT OF PLAYBOY MANSION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yielding to pressure from Vice President Al Gore
and other Democratic Party leaders, Rep. Loretta Sanchez agreed
Friday night to move a Hispanic fund-raising event from the Playboy
Mansion to Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, D-Calif., had been removed from the speaker's list at
the Democratic National Convention and faced further punishment
from the party's leadership after she refused to move the event,
which is to raise money to bring out the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Her speaking engagement and her position as Democratic party
co-chairwoman were secured by her action Friday night, party
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To continue to dwell on where our event is held, and whether
my role as a DNC officer conflicts with my role at a party for a
good cause, frankly makes no sense,'' Sanchez said in a statement.
``The only real party I am interested in is a party that represents
real people, with real needs. That party is the Democratic Party.''

LIEBERMAN COMMITS TO PLAN TO STAY IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Joseph Lieberman, the U.S. senator who on
Monday became Al Gore's vice presidential running mate, has
confirmed his initial preference to continue his Senate re-election
campaign, his spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stay in the Senate race was made carefully,
after discussions with Gore and other Democratic leaders in
Washington and Connecticut, said Dan Gerstein, Lieberman's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Lieberman and our campaign staff canvassed the
Democratic leadership in the state,'' Gerstein said, ``and the
clear message back was that it was not only acceptable but the
appropriate and necessary thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is significant because it means that a
Gore-Lieberman victory in November would allow the Connecticut
governor, John Rowland, a Republican, to appoint someone from his
own party to fill Lieberman's vacated Senate seat. Such a move
would undermine the Democrats' drive to retake control of the
Senate, where they are now a 54-46 minority.
</P>
<P>
   While virtually all Democratic Party leaders have publicly
voiced support for Lieberman's staying in the Senate campaign,
Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac
University in Hamden, said some party members were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to some Democrats who question the decision
insofar that it signals Lieberman isn't fully confident with the
ticket,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, there is still time _ until Oct. 27 _ for
Lieberman to change his mind, drop out of the Senate race and give
another Democrat the opportunity of winning it. Political experts
said any of several other Democrats ready to fill the vacancy would
probably easily beat Lieberman's little-known Republican opponent,
Phil Giordano, the mayor of Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some other Democrats have lamented that if Lieberman leaves,
it would still be easy to win against Phil Giordano,'' McLean said.
``Whoever they went for, they would easily beat Giordano.''
</P>
<P>
   But by committing himself to the Senate, at least for now,
Lieberman, the popular two-term senator, chose the more cautious of
two political paths, and the same one previously taken by two
prominent Texas Democrats. Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1960, and Lloyd
Bentsen, in 1988, also ran simultaneously for vice president and
senator.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman had decided to pull out of the Senate race,
figuring that another Democrat would win it anyway, he would face
the specter of being out of elective office, should he and Gore
lose the presidential election. Staying in the Senate race, where
Lieberman is the overwhelming favorite, virtually guarantees that
this will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, should Gore win the White House, Lieberman
would have to sacrifice his valuable Senate seat to a Republican
chosen by Rowland. That person would serve until 2002, when the
next statewide elections are held.
</P>
<P>
   Edward L. Marcus, Connecticut's Democratic Party chairman, said
Lieberman's choice was in the best interests of the party. Without
Lieberman on the Senate ballot, Marcus said, state Democrats would
have to hastily nominate another candidate at a convention, instead
of taking the time to hold a primary.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's popular attorney general, was
widely regarded as the Democrats' leading prospect to replace
Lieberman. But on Friday he called Lieberman's refusal to abandon
his Senate campaign ``absolutely the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Lieberman has been so extraordinarily effective and
distinguished in the Senate that I would hate to lose him if the
Gore ticket is not successful,'' Blumenthal said Friday. ``There is
no other way to guarantee that he would be there if he's not vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his own ambitions to work in Washington, Blumenthal
said, ``There will be an opportunity in 2002, if not earlier, to be
a candidate for Senate, and I would be very interested in being a
candidate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Monday, when Gore chose Lieberman, the junior senator from
New Haven, to be his running mate, there has been near-constant
debate about whether Lieberman should give up the Senate and put
all his efforts into his vice presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   A public-opinion poll taken of 502 state residents this week by
the University of Connecticut found that 54 percent believed that
Lieberman should not run for both offices, while 37 percent said
they would not mind if he did.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Republicans have begun portraying Lieberman's vow to
stay in the Senate race as proof that Democrats do not believe they
can beat their Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a signal nationally that he believes Gore's chances
of winning are not good,'' Robert Ward, the minority leader in the
state House, told The Associated Press. Gerstein of the Lieberman
campaign denied any hedging on Lieberman's part. ``This is in no
way a sign of a lack of confidence in the Gore ticket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland seemed in no hurry to consider the replacement question.
Dean Pagani, Rowland's press secretary, said Friday that the
governor would not contemplate whom he might appoint to replace
Lieberman until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has said he's not going to spend any time
thinking about that because he's going to be campaigning for
Governor Bush,'' Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lieberman does stay with his Senate campaign to the very
end, no one expects Giordano to be Rowland's appointee, said
Douglas Schwartz, director of polling at Quinnipiac University and
McLean, the Quinnipiac professor.
</P>
<P>
   With no experience at orchestrating a high-profile political
campaign, Giordano, 37, is regarded by many people in both parties
as unpolished and not particularly ready for prime time. He has
already made several faux pas, including this characterization of
Lieberman, quoted in The New Haven Register: ``I think he's a very
moral man,'' Giordano said. ``I think he's very Christian.''
Lieberman is an Orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
   If Rowland is given a chance to appoint a U.S. senator, he may
well choose his lieutenant governor, Jodi Rell, said Schwartz of
Quinnipiac University. ``She's a high-ranking Republican who is
popular and gets along with Democrats,'' Schwartz said.

FAVORITES WINNING BUT WORKING UP A SWEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Lindsay Davenport admits to being in
a funk, Serena Williams said she's winning but not playing well,
and Martina Hingis says she goes through times she can't do
anything right.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a post-Wimbledon funk, the summertime blues or proof
the women's tennis tour is deep, but seeded players aren't having
it easy in the estyle.com Classic.
</P>
<P>
   They're winning, but they have to work for it. This week,
top-seeded Hingis dropped the first set to Chandra Rubin before
recovering. No. 2 Davenport fell apart in a second-set tiebreaker
against Anne-Gaelle Sidot before recovering. No. 5 Williams breezed
against No. 4 Conchita Martinez before falling apart in the second
set. Then she, too, recovered.
</P>
<P>
   So did No. 8 Sandrine Testud against Dominique Van Roost,
although she couldn't overcome Davenport on Friday night. But
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario lost to Amy Frazier, and the world's
top-ranked doubles team of Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs lost
Friday to Lisa Arendt/Manon Bollegraf.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis said the best way to combat a slump is to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep winning, you think it's going to be good for the
next tournament and the next tournament,'' she said. ``Consistency
is what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   And many here are showing just enough to stay alive. It could
make for a very interesting U.S. Open in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Arbitration update: Arbitration for Raymond's bid to be
instated onto the Olympic team will happen the week of Aug. 20-26,
the week before the U.S. Open. Raymond's attorney, Greg Becker,
said the details will be finalized Monday. Raymond, the world's
top-ranked doubles player who filed a grievance with the U.S.
Tennis Association after being left off the Olympic team, competes
in New Haven, Conn., that week.
</P>
<P>
   Becker expressed disappointment the hearing won't be sooner but
said, ``Lisa's looking forward to her day in court. She knows she
has been cheated. She's disappointed and frustrated and she's not
going to roll over.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States Olympic Committee also has filed
for arbitration, since it's the USOC's code of conduct that Becker
alleges the USTA didn't follow when it selected the Olympic team.
Becker said the USOC will remain ``extremely neutral.'' &QL;

HILLARY CLINTON KICKS OFF BUSY CONVENTION WEEK WITH `TONIGHT SHOW'
APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton brought her campaign
for the Senate to the hills of Los Angeles Friday evening, starting
three days of California campaigning with an appearance on ``The
Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno, a way-out-of-town swing that will end
with a prime-time speech to the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 minutes, Leno and Clinton gently bantered,
presented dueling satirical videos, and discussed the unlikely
scene of one of the recurrent targets of Leno's humor sitting at
his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine,'' Clinton agreed, as Leno recalled,
with exaggerated discomfort, how much fun he had had at the expense
of President and Clinton and their marriage. And then, with a wave
of the hand and a broad grin, she said: ``Here I am!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appeared that humor was not at the top of the first
lady's agenda, as she often steered the conversation to more
serious subjects, talking about why she was running for Senate,
offering warm anecdotes of her travels across New York, as she
provided the national audience _ presumably including millions of
New Yorkers _ a refrain of many of the things she has been saying
during her campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, her often purposeful demeanor was a reminder that her
appearance Friday night, like the rest of her busy weekend here,
was directed almost entirely at boosting her campaign across New
York. She headed right for Leno's show after landing at Los Angeles
International Airport, and her schedule over the next three days is
as busy as if she were in the state where she is running for
office: Two fund-raisers on her own behalf; drop-ins at a
half-dozen breakfasts and forums; meetings with celebrities and
supporters; and most important, her aides believe, her Monday night
address at the convention, the same night President Clinton will
speak.
</P>
<P>
   As a number of Democrats have noted in recent days, Clinton has
set up a more high-profile schedule for herself than Al Gore, who
will be, presumably, the focus of attention of the presidential
nominating convention. But the more apt comparison may be to her
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, and what he did _ or rather did not do _
at the Philadelphia convention last week.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent less than a day in Philadelphia. He turned down what
would have been a fleeting speaking appearance, and participated in
no official convention events. Lazio's advisers said that he had
concluded that there was no political gain for him in spending time
in Philadelphia, and it might risk getting his campaign too closely
identified with Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers reached a conclusion almost opposite.
Regardless of her Senate candidacy, Clinton would likely still have
made some sort of convention appearance, even if brief and
relatively low-profile, because this will be her husband's last
convention as a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's visit here is neither brief nor low-profile.
Clinton's appearance Friday on ``The Tonight Show,'' and her speech
on Monday serve as nationally televised bookends to a weekend that
will include visits to Democrats and their supporters, as well as
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides have said that Clinton's identification with a
national convention would only serve to remind voters that she
comes from outside New York and may hold ambitions that go beyond
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's advisers rejected that argument, saying that it
was outweighed by the benefit of having a national audience,
including a large one in New York, for her campaign message _
mostly unfiltered.
</P>
<P>
   This was actually her second stop on the late-night circuit: on
Jan. 12 she appeared on the ``Late Show With David Letterman''
after much prodding by Letterman. Her appearance then won praise as
being funny and relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   And there were some flashes of humor tonight. She prepared her
own version of one of Leno's standing features, called Jay Walking,
in which Leno stops people on the street, shows them pictures of
famous political leaders, like George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential candidate, and asks them to identify the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded with Hillary Walking, which she taped Thursday
night in front of Rockefeller Center. She carried around a
photograph of _ yes, really _ Leno, found that most people could
identify him, and asked for advice on whether she should should go
on and what she should say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he's kind of mean,'' Clinton told one woman she
stopped on the street, adding: ``I wonder what he's going to talk
about after my husband's no longer president?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll talk about you,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Leno noted that Clinton grew up in a Republican household, and
as a teen-ager she announced to her parents that she considered
herself more of a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would happen if Chelsea said, `You know, Mom, those
Republicans have some good ideas,''' Leno asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would miss her a lot,'' Clinton said, as the camera panned
to Chelsea, who was sitting in the audience next to Leno's wife.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Leno seemed a little perplexed by the challenge posed
by his decorous guest. He saw it coming. When he first took the
stage, Leno said: ``I promise to be on my best behavior. No jokes
about the Clinton administration. No jokes at her husband's
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno paused a second. ``Good night everybody!''

METS STAY HOT AS PIAZZA AND ALFONZO BOTH HOMER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Gardner uncorked a fastball that tailed inside
on Mike Piazza, and immediately, Gardner knew. Everyone knew.
Gardner slammed his hand against his right leg, glanced toward left
field and then looked away. But Piazza's massive drive in the
fourth inning stayed in the air so long that Gardner peeked one
more time, watched the two-run homer land in the picnic area and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Piazza was nearing second base and Snap's ``I Got
The Power'' was blaring on a soggy night at Shea Stadium. The New
York Mets definitely had the power Friday night, for Edgardo
Alfonzo also pounded a two-run homer to the almost identical spot
two innings later. Those blasts and helped the Mets rumble to a 4-1
victory over the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets kept on churning. They have won 14 of their last 17
games, they stay hot on the trail of the first-place Atlanta Braves
and they have padded their lead in the wild-card skirmish. On a
night where Glendon Rusch was more gritty than good, the Mets were
satisfied with his five tedious innings as he allowed only one run
and then let the bullpen finish stifling the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Three relievers nabbed the last 12 outs and helped the Mets
begin avenging a four-game sweep against San Francisco from early
May. The Mets are a different team now, an improved team, and they
have not lost more than three in a row since that sweep. Their
starters have been superb, their bullpen has been stable and Piazza
is playing like a most valuable player, which the fans chanted over
and over Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's been most valuable, most spectacular and most
dependable,'' said Manager Bobby Valentine. ``He's been the most of
a lot of things this year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dusty Baker and Valentine shook hands behind the batting cage
before the game, which was just as curious as when Valentine and
President Fred Wilpon did the same. Baker and Valentine are
managers who do not like each other, and Wilpon is one of the men
who has adamantly refused to give Valentine or General Manager
Steve Phillips contract extensions. But Baker had to watch Piazza
and Alfonzo go deep, which made Valentine smile, and Wilpon must
wonder about his decisions and how they might impact the Mets in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Mets are naturally focused on today. Gardner faced
only nine batters through the first three innings and was
incredibly economical, throwing only three balls. Darryl Hamilton,
who was starting a game in left field for the first time since
Sept. 20, 1993, had a leadoff double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After Gardner retired Derek Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo, Piazza
strolled to the plate, and there was a buzz at Shea. Piazza had two
homers in 15 lifetime at bats against Gardner and, when Gardner
tried to sneak a 1-0 fastball in on the hands, Piazza quickly
turned on it and hammered it. Piazza is 8-for-20 with two homers
and 12 runs batted in over the last five games. Before Piazza's
31st homer, the Giants loaded the bases against Rusch in the second
and did not score. The third was even stickier for Rusch. After
Russ Davis' one-out single, Rusch pumped a 1-2 fastball by Barry
Bonds on the inside corner for the second out. Bonds felt the pitch
was too inside to be a strike and he mentioned this to plate umpire
Charlie Williams. But Rusch kept firing inside pitches because
Williams had a wide strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   After Rusch walked Jeff Kent, Ellis Burks hit a broken-bat
roller to third. Robin Ventura charged in, scooped up the ball and
tried in vain to tag Davis as he chugged past him.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was in another bases-loaded bind, but he tossed a 1-2
fastball to Rich Aurilia that sneaked into Williams' expansive
zone. Aurilia was looking to third base for signs when he saw the
animated Williams punching his fist in the air to indicate strike
three.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finally nicked Rusch for a run in the fifth, but
Rusch retired Aurilia with his 103rd pitch to strand his seventh
and eighth runners. Valentine pinch-hit for Rusch in the bottom of
the fifth, removing him before the Giants could do any serious
damage. Then Alfonzo duplicated Piazza with a two-run shot, Gardner
hopped off the mound in distress a second time and the Mets were
glad to be home.

NEW YEAR, SAME WOES AT KICKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ As week one draws to a close, USC's quest for a
kicker is looking remarkably familiar, despite an all-out attempt
over the summer to find a new candidate to revive its dreadful
kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   Junior David Newbury has emerged with a slight lead over senior
David Bell and freshman John Wall of Birmingham High, which is
ironic because there was some discussion of redshirting Newbury
following his disastrous spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newbury probably has a little leg up,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also said he won't hold Newbury's spring against him,
although it was a major reason the Trojans signed Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wiped that out,'' Hackett said. ``All that matters is if the
ball goes through (the goal post).''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has been for Newbury, who has reverted to a kicking
style he used before he came to USC last year. Former special-teams
coach Shawn Slocum made Newbury change his form last season and
Newbury struggled by making only 11 of 20 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But new special-teams coach Dan Ferrigno has allowed Newbury to
use his old style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I never really got comfortable,'' Newbury said. ``I
never got in a routine. Coach Ferrigno gave me some freedom. Now
I'm in a rhythm and my consistency is better. I knew I was going to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury said that although he is being pushed by Bell and Wall,
he should be the favorite to be the Trojans' kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really felt they wanted David (Bell) to start last
year, they just wanted the best man,'' he said. ``And John's going
t great kicker, but he's a little overwhelmed by it all right now.
I know what it was like for me my first year.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury also vowed that special teams will not be USC's downfall
for a second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can promise that special teams will not be the cause for us
losing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kelly improved: Wide receiver Kareem Kelly (strained knee
ligament) felt much better after therapy Friday afternoon and said
he will practice today and participate in the team scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels real good. Hopefully, when I wake up I'll be 100
percent,'' Kelly said. ``For me, it's big (to play today) because
I've been out for so long. I've got to get out here and have my
mind in a game atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rideaux's ahead: In the battle for right cornerback, Darrell
Rideaux holds a slight edge over junior college transfer Chris
Cash, but the position remains wide open. Both will play.
</P>
<P>
   __ Another mover: Junior Faasea Mailo appears no worse than even
with freshman Jacob Rogers for the starting right tackle spot.
Rogers originally won the position in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, freshman wide receiver Keary Colbert made a strong
claim to be the No. 3 wide receiver. Sophomore wide receiver Steve
Stevenson remains out with a sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pad stars: Hackett said strong safety Matt Grootegoed,
linebacker Zeke Moreno, offensive guard Zach Wilson and Mailo have
been among the most impressive players since the Trojans started
practicing in pads Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Minor injuries: Strong safety Troy Polamalu suffered what
might be a mild concussion and did not practice Friday. He also
suffered a concussion last season. Linebacker Markus Steele has
been bothered by a sore hamstring but is expected to play in
today's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   __ Two-sport player: Tight end Gregg Guenther (6-foot-8, 245
pounds) of Taft said he also intends to play basketball. Guenther,
who was projected to grow into a tackle, appears so lean and quick
that he will probably spend his career as a tight end.

JOHNSON NOT CHANGING STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson hears what
most of Los Angeles is saying. He should have bunted in this
scenario, hit-and-run in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson usually turns a deaf ear to such criticism, but he
admits to experiencing a great deal of frustration of late.
Especially in the last two weeks, when the Dodgers went 5-7 against
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   However, even under the intense scrutiny which suggests
Johnson's job is in jeopardy, the man with 14 years of managerial
experience at the major-league level isn't about to turn into
something he's not. The Dodgers are built as a powerful,
run-producing team, and that's how he'll manage them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, to reinvent the wheel isn't going to win you
any more games,'' Johnson said. ``You manage the team that you
have. You don't manage every team the same way. In Cincinnati, we
stole every bag we could steal. We were a running team, we played
good defense and we hacked. If it was 3-0, I had them swinging and
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little more information than the people (those who
are criticizing Johnson) trying to play the game, and a little more
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   And a better winning percentage than any active manager. Johnson
has a .564 winning percentage, has won a World Series, five
division titles and qualified for the playoffs once as a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's strategy late in games has come under fire, the latest
incident occurring Wednesday when he didn't bunt Todd Hundley with
runners on first and second and none out in the ninth in a tie game
the Dodgers eventually lost. Of course, down by a run in the 10th
inning, they had first and third with none out and didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 13 years of managing, I'll tell you this,'' Johnson said.
``With guys that are run-producers, maybe I have bunted once. And
I've won my share of ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being under contract next season and guaranteed $1.5
million, Johnson's tenure as Dodgers manager is tied almost
exclusively to the final 49 games of the season, a stretch which
began with Friday's game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers fail to make the playoffs, Johnson's time with
the team is likely over. Though sources said it would be possible
for Johnson to remain if the Dodgers don't make the playoffs,
several sources said it would be an unlikely scenario and would
only occur under extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   During the All-Star break, general manager Kevin Malone was
critical of the way the Dodgers played, stating they needed to do
more of the little things _ bunt, hit-and-run and move runners
over.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly went to San
Diego in early July to tell Johnson the team needed to play with
more fire, and Daly also said he expected more from a team that,
after trade-deadline acquisitions, has a payroll of $98 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers began their six-game road trip 59-54, three
games over .500 in the second half of the season and 5 games behind
San Francisco in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating when you don't execute,'' Johnson said.
``It's frustrating from a managerial standpoint. Do I have to
change my whole managerial philosophy, change my approach? Do I
have to change things for guys that are in the league six, seven
years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain situations in ballgames, when you have to put the ball
in play, guys are paid to do it. That's why they're making the big
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Daly informed the club he will pay the $71,000
in fines stemming from the May 16 fight at Wrigley Field. Sixteen
players, three coaches and bullpen catcher Travis Barbary were
fined. . . . Right-hander Mike Fetters said the cut on the middle
finger of his pitching hand has healed enough and he's available to
pitch.

HAITIAN-AMERICAN ANGER GROWS AS FUGITIVE REMAINS FREE IN QUEENS  
</HEADLINE>
  By SARAH KERSHAW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Haitian-American leaders, outraged by the
increasingly visible presence in Queens of a man accused of killing
thousands in Haiti, are renewing a call to send the man back there
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five years, Emmanuel Constant, 43, the leader of a
Haitian paramilitary group in the early 1990s, has lived
intermittently with an aunt on a quiet street in southeast Queens
since 1994, popping up at restaurants, coffee shops and nightclubs
in Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   His presence in the city has always angered Haitian exiles and
human rights advocates who have tried to persuade the United States
government to extradite him on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Constant, who is known as Toto, has been more
visible than ever. He has taken a job as a real estate broker,
selling houses in Cambria Heights, the heart of the
Haitian-American neighborhood in Queens. And last week, after
watching a discussion on public access television about a rally
against him planned for on Saturday, he called the station and
asked to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten progressively bolder,'' said Ray Laforest, a labor
organizer and leader of the Haiti Support Network, an advocacy
group. ``He's enjoying the good life, and his victims have memories
they can never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Laforest and other Haitian-American leaders
got wind of Constant's employment at Rigaud Realty, a small agency
in Queens. He has been seen there regularly, and was spotted as
recently as last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the eyes of the community, a criminal like him shouldn't be
around,'' said Jean Etienne, 57, an Haitian immigrant who says he
has often seen Constant.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Rigaud, the owner of the realty business, declined to
discuss Constant's employment there, except to say: ``He has a real
estate license. He used to work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates and Haitian-American leaders organized a
rally and march for Saturday outside Rigaud Realty and the house
where Constant is believed to live.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, Constant emerged in 1993 as the head of a right-wing
paramilitary group, the Front for the Advancement and Progress of
Haiti, which has been accused of torturing and killing thousands of
supporters of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had been ousted in a
coup. Constant eluded Haitian prosecutors and used a valid tourist
visa to flee to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian government, which has repeatedly called for
Constant's extradition, is now moving to prosecute officers who led
the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the outcry over his presence in Queens, Constant was
arrested in 1995 by the Immigration and Naturalization Service at
his aunt's house and detained for a year. A deportation order was
issued while he was in jail, but he was abruptly released in 1996
and has been allowed to stay in the country on the condition that
he report regularly to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said at the time of Constant's release that
his return to Haiti would further destabilize the government there,
and they have since argued that the Haitian justice system is not
equipped to give him a fair trial. But many say they suspect that
Constant, who had been a paid informer for the CIA in Haiti, struck
a deal with the federal government, winning his release in exchange
for his silence about the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Justice Department or immigration officials would
comment Friday on Constant's release or on the status of his case.

SUPPORT FOR SUICIDE THEORY IN EGYPTAIR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes transliteration of Arabic phrase in graf that begins
``The docket released ...'') 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reinforcing suspicions that a suicidal co-pilot was
responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last fall, the
United States' top air-safety investigator said Friday that there
were no safety issues in the crash that would require a public
hearing to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the official, James E. Hall, the
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, released
1,700 pages of documents, including FBI reports showing that the
co-pilot had been accused of a variety of sexual improprieties at a
New York hotel during visits there in the year before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hall drew no conclusion from the reports and said the board had
not yet analyzed the information it had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the crash, which killed 217 people when the
Cairo-bound Boeing 767 went down in the Atlantic Ocean off
Nantucket, Mass., last October, almost immediately became an
international problem for the United States. When some
investigators indicated early in the board's 10-month investigation
that it suspected a co-pilot had deliberately crashed the plane,
Egyptian officials reacted with outrage and demanded a broader
investigation of the airplane's flight-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   They strongly denied suggestions that the co-pilot, Gameel
el-Batouty, grabbed the controls and put the plane into a steep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   That the matter remains sensitive was evident in the fact that
safety-board officials stressed that they still had reached no
final conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly on Friday, Hall said there were ``no unresolved safety
issues'' that would require a formal public hearing, which is
usually held after a major crash. A final report is months away.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall also said, without elaboration, that the board thought
the FBI witness reports were relevant and should be included. The
files show that the co-pilot, Batouty, was the subject of numerous
complaints at the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York, where EgyptAir
crews stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Several women who worked at the hotel told security officers
that Batouty repeatedly propositioned them sexually. In another
incident, two teen-age girls accused Batouty of following them and
exposing himself through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Several people interviewed by the FBI described him as a moody
loner. One said he saw Batouty drunk on several occasions and
thought of him as ``a tragedy waiting to happen.'' One said that
Batouty was ``a religious person who was like a kid in a candy
store when in New York City,'' because he was unaccustomed to
seeing women dressed in relatively revealing clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The files show that EgyptAir was notified of the complaints by
the hotel, and that Batouty consistently denied the accusations,
saying the hotel was harassing him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts representing EgyptAir, including a former chairman
of the Safety Board, said the documents contained extensive
evidence that argued against the crash being a murder-suicide.
Other portions of the FBI files back up the assertion of relatives
and friends who have defended Batouty. Several people interviewed
on the West Coast, where he also traveled for EgyptAir, described
him as pleasant and sociable, considerate of others and looking
forward to retirement so he could spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The docket released Friday also included the transcript of the
cockpit voice recorder from the plane, which, as previously
reported, showed that Batouty had repeatedly uttered a religious
phrase in the moments before the crash. The common Arabic phrase
``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' translated as ``I rely on God,'' could be
heard 11 times in the last minute-and-a-half of the tape.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the board releases only a transcript, not a copy of the
tape itself, but one person who has heard the tape described the
phrase being repeated ``like a mantra'' in an obsessive way.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Adel Fouad, an Egyptian psychiatric
consultant to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, in a letter
submitted to the Safety Board and released Friday with its reports,
said that the phrase reflected an Islamic belief that humans are
supported and controlled by God, and that it ``is used only when
one embarks on a good action and not a bad one.''
</P>
<P>
   The board said in a footnote disclaimer that Fouad's statement
was not developed using board procedures and that his views were
``not necessarily''' those of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the significance of the phrase to the
investigation, a committee of experts analyzed all of the
utterances for their acoustic qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Language and behavior experts say that people under stress talk
faster. The analysis found that the first utterance was the
longest, 1.02 seconds. But the phrases did not become progressively
more panicked as the plane's fatal dive continued, varying from .73
to .87 second each, which the committee called ``relatively
regular.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript catches the crew carping about the airline and
about one another.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty seemed to be in a mood to throw his weight around.
Shortly after takeoff, he used his seniority to oust the junior
co-pilot, Adel Anwar, scheduled to be on duty for that part of the
trip. Anwar, 36, expressed surprise that Batouty was not resting in
the rear, a typical routine for a relief co-pilot early in the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something,'' Batouty said. ``I'm not going to
sleep at all. I might come back and sit for two hours, and then
...'' Anwar indicated that he himself was well rested and happy to
stay in his regular seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean you're not going to get up?'' Batouty said. ``You
will get up ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have told me,'' Anwar protested. ``You should have
told me this, Captain Gameel.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar later complains to the captain about Batouty: ``He does
whatever he pleases. Some days he doesn't work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash was in international waters, and the plane, a Boeing
767, was registered in Egypt, which by treaty would put the
Egyptian government in charge of the investigation. But Egypt
delegated the job to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety Board will not establish a probable cause of the
crash for months, and after that the Egyptian government will have
60 days to review the report before it is made public. But in
another indication of the board's thinking, the crash has resulted
in just one formal recommendation thus far: that video cameras
should be in the cockpits of commercial airliners, joining the
microphones that have been standard for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear again Friday that the Egyptian side was
uncomfortable with the results of the investigation to date.
</P>
<P>
   An Egyptian investigator, Capt. Mohsen el-Missiry, of the
Ministry of Civil Aviation, said pointedly, ``Additional work
remains to be done, particularly in assessing the design of the
Boeing 767 elevator control system.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's position is that it will listen to arguments from
participants about what should happen next, but that, for now at
least, it believes that it has completed all the necessary
investigative work, leaving it ready to turn to analysis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, at one point an Egyptian reporter asked
Hall why the sexual allegations were relevant to the cause of the
crash, and then began discussing President Clinton's sexual
activities in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Hall replied, ``We are very aware of the important
responsibility that we have to the victims'' to perform a thorough,
fair investigation, and added, ``The statements you refer to are a
very small portion of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was clearly being careful. He responded to the question
about why there would be no public hearing on the crash by reading
from a prepared statement. He said the board's staff had
``recommended that a hearing not be held on this crash because they
believe there are no unresolved safety issues that require such a
forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his assertion Friday that the board had made no
conclusions on the crash squared with his statement on Nov. 15 that
the board was considering turning the case over to the FBI because
it might be a crime, he simply referred the questioner to a
statement posted on the Safety Board's Web site. (The statement, on
Nov. 19, said that after consultation with the FBI and the
Egyptians, the board concluded that more work had to be done.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many staff investigators are persuaded that the crash
was a suicide and are eager to move on to other mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials said Friday that they would let the documents
they had released speak for themselves. But those documents formed
a sort of Rorschach test, with experts hired by the Egyptian side
drawing contradictory conclusions from the material, which, like
much evidence in crash reports, was ambiguous in places.
</P>
<P>
   For example, EgyptAir believes Batouty was never alone in the
cockpit; Safety Board investigators believe he was.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve minutes before the end of the recording, the cockpit tape
captures three syllables.
</P>
<P>
   The five Arabic-speaking people who helped prepare the
transcript agree that it was not an Arabic word; four of them
believe they heard words similar to ``control it.'' One
English-speaking member of the committee thought it might be
``hydraulic.'' Five others say it is unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said writing a transcript of a half-hour tape, complete
with analysis of cockpit sounds, usually takes 16 hours, but this
one took 130.
</P>
<P>
   The former Safety Board chairman, Carl Vogt, a lawyer here who
now represents the Egyptians, pointed out that according to data
released Friday, the tail elevators, the devices that change the
plane's pitch, never moved to the maximum extent they are able to,
indicating that the dive was not deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   And, he noted, the flight data recorder captures someone in the
cockpit cutting engine power. ``When the nose of your airplane goes
down, to maintain constant air speed and not accelerate, you always
pull off power,'' said Vogt. ``That to me is compelling evidence
against any intent to do anything but preserve the airplane and fly
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some government investigators, though, say they do not
understand why someone _ presumably Batouty _ turned off both
engines as the plane screamed toward the water, approaching the
speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   But Vogt made another point that other pilots have also raised,
that diving is not the fastest or surest way to crash a plane.
``You'd turn the thing over, and apply power to make it go
faster,'' he said. ``This flight crew maintained wings level.''

DELIGHTFUL OUTCOMES FOR GREENE AND JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ Back on foreign yet familiar ground,
Maurice Greene and Marion Jones continued doing what they have done
for much of the last three seasons: Winning and waving to the
crowd. But the U.S. stars' victories Friday night at the
Weltklasse, the world's most prestigious and lucrative one-day
track-and-field meet, were hardly business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Greene had not raced since straining his hamstring and ruining
his chances for an Olympic sprint double during the 200-meter final
at the U.S. track-and-field trials in Sacramento, Calif., on July
23.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to be a race for the ages between Greene and
Michael Johnson, the world record-holder in the 200, became an
anticlimactic dud when both failed to finish the race because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was my birthday, it was a very sad night,''
said Greene, who turned 26 on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   But while Johnson has yet to return to competition, Greene made
it clear Friday night that he is now healthy and still the favorite
in the 100 at the Sydney Olympics next month. He handled a fine
field with confidence and controlled power to win in a time of 9.94
seconds that was all the more impressive considering that Greene
was running into a slight head wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm baaaaack,'' sang Greene, who said he felt no pain during
the race. ``I wish I could have run a lot faster than I did.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to, but I believe I ran a very good
race tonight. I feel a little sluggish from being off, but this is
the start of coming off my injury and I plan on getting better each
and every race from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones certainly plans to improve on Friday night's sprint
performance, as well. She has not lost a 100-meter race since 1997,
but she came perilously close here. After false-starting, she got
off to a sluggish start and then had to chase down fellow American
Inger Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a two-time world champion in the 100, would end up
winning by one-hundredth of a second in 10.95 seconds, a time that
was mediocre by her high standards and well off the 10.78 she ran
last week in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the false start, I had to sit in the blocks,'' Jones
said. ``But I'm not going to make excuses. Inger ran a very good
race and today was her chance. It doesn't get much worse than that
for me. Technically, it was very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other star sprinters might have headed back to the hotel and
spent the rest of the evening stewing, but Jones, whose ambition is
to win five Olympic gold medals next month, still had another
event. And so she walked off the track and onto the infield and
proceeded to win the long jump, traditionally her weakest event,
over the strongest field yet assembled this season. She won with a
jump of 22 feet 7 inches on her fifth of six attempts.
</P>
<P>
   That was only less than a half-inch farther than Iva Prandzheva
of Bulgaria could fly on this balmy summer evening in Switzerland.
Jones' other victims included Fiona May of Italy, the former
Olympic champion Heike Drechsler of Germany, and the reigning world
champion Niurka Montalvo of Spain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The only major Olympic threat missing from the meet was the
Russian Tatiana Kotova, who won the long jump in the first three
legs of the Golden League against relatively weak fields but was
missing Friday night because of minor injuries that she sustained
in a recent car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Marion to come out and beat this field is good for her
confidence,'' said Jones' coach, Trevor Graham. ``The things I've
been telling her about the long jump are finally sinking in. We had
some problems with the takeoff, and the speed on the runway is not
there yet like we want it. So we've tried to focus on that, and
when she gets the rhythm down on the runway, I think we're going to
be way over 7 meters, and that's the key to get ready for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco certainly looked ready Friday
night. The world's premier men's middle-distance runner recorded
the third-fastest time in history in the 1,500, winning in three
minutes 27.21 seconds. Noah Ngeny of Kenya, considered the only man
with a reasonable chance of beating el-Guerrouj in Sydney, was
second in a Kenyan national record of 3:28.12.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively small margin of victory, el-Guerrouj was
in control of this race down the stretch and now has run all three
of the fastest times in the event, including the world record of
3:26.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela Szabo, the diminutive Romanian with the daunting kick,
was also back in fine form after a rare loss last week in a
1,500-meter race in London. Her winning time in the women's 3,000,
a non-Olympic distance, was the best of the year: 8:26.35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland was second in 8:27.58. Regina
Jacobs, who won both the 5,000 and the 1,500 at the Olympic trials,
finished 14th in 8:50.12, which should make it easier for the
American to decide which race to run in Sydney (the 1,500 would now
seem the logical option).
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included the American champion Angelo Taylor in
the men's 400 hurdles, the American record-holder Gail Devers in
the women's 100 hurdles in a meet record of 12.39 seconds and Danny
Ecker of Germany in the men's pole vault with a leap of 19 feet 2
inches. Sergei Bubka, the world record-holder and six-time world
champion who is attempting to make one more run at an Olympic gold
medal at age 36, cleared 18 feet but failed three times at 18-7.
</P>
<P>
   Haile Gebrselassie, the remarkable Ethiopian distance runner,
did not fail in what could have been his final major race at 5,000
meters. But he did not dominate either, barely holding off a late
charge by Kenya's Paul Tergat to win in 12:57.95. Gebrselassie is
unbeaten outdoors since 1996 and is the world record-holder in the
5,000 and 10,000, but he plans to run only the 10,000 in Sydney
before switching to the marathon and half-marathon. Friday night's
race was his last before the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder and harder to win, but it's normal for an
older runner,'' Gebrselassie said.

   NORTHRIDGE _ Growing up in Mexico City, Gina Eckstein and Ivette
Helfend started their entrepreneurship early. The sisters, born 11
months apart, persuaded their mother to buy them chocolate, then
promptly sold it - at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Their business acumen has improved. Now they've taken a $2,000
investment and turned it into a business they expect to gross
$200,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linx composable bracelets was born in September 1999, when
Helfend was on a cruise to Italy. There she saw bracelets that
could be assembled from links of stainless steel decorated with
18-karat gold letters, semi-precious stones and various ornaments
and symbols.
</P>
<P>
   She called her sister from Italy and said ``You have to trust
me. You have to go into this with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfend said she spent half her vacation arranging to import and
distribute the bracelet components and nearly missed her boat
several times.
</P>
<P>
   The bracelets can be customized to spell the names or initials
of loved ones, carry a message or just be decorative. They can be
``stacked'' or combined for effect, and because they can have any
number of links and are stretchy, they fit any wrist - from very
large to tiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I think this is so successful is that
people can create their own,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they get the instant gratification of having it done on
the spot,'' Helfend said.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities such as Heather Locklear, Jennie Garth and Tracy
Austin are wearing Linx, the sisters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once one celebrity starts wearing it, it just grows and
grows,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Linx components are sold at retail, mainly by phone order
through their Northridge office, at charity shows and at home
parties. One of the sisters' projects is to create an online order
form for their Web site, linxbracelets.com. For now, the Web site
acts as a showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $30 to $400 for a bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   With five children under the age of 3 between them, Helfend and
Eckstein see Linx as an opportunity for other full-time moms to
make money and socialize at the same time. Some 20 representatives
around the country have come on board.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Bloxberg sells Linx at shows and parties through her home
business, Family Ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was selling `mommy' jewelry, so this tied in perfectly with
my line,'' Bloxberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Moms love anything to do with their children, so they love to
customize bracelets with their children's names or initials, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloxberg said she is happy with the results of home jewelry
parties, and the bracelets have been a big hit at shows.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Bloxberg had a booth at the national Haddasah Jewish
women's convention, attended by about 3,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did tremendous. I believe we were their No. 1 vendor,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein and Helfend arrange their business around the
children's schedules. The sisters work on Linx after they put their
children to bed - sometimes staying up through the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our only quiet time. I think it's worth it because we
like to be productive in a business sense,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it on your own time. It's pleasurable, social,
successful,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have developed a good relationship with their
Italian suppliers, and now they are part of the design team.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have a basketball, because in Italy, they don't play
basketball. Same thing with golf: It's not as hot there,'' Eckstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters also sell premade bracelets, rings and necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   They like to be in business, particularly with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any excuse to be together,'' Helfend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very lucky,'' they said in unison.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Buchanan taps woman as VP pick
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOHN C. HENRY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Pat Buchanan won the Reform Party
presidential nomination Friday and named Ezola Foster, a
conservative Los Angeles educator who grew up in Houston, as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Buchanan, a disaffected Republican, was
assured after he handily defeated John Hagelin in a mail-in
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan received 49,529 votes to Hagelin's 28,539 votes in the
primary balloting, according to Reform Party officials. A little
less than 10 percent of the 887,925 ballots mailed out were
returned. Hagelin won only three states, Colorado, North Carolina
and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan nomination was sealed by his supporters late Friday
in a proclamation from the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will decide our party's nominee,'' National Chairman Gerry
Moan told delegates at a convention controlled by Buchanan allies.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of the delegates under Buchanan's control, he
easily won the two-thirds vote needed to override whatever the
primary results might have been.
</P>
<P>
   At a theater nearby, hundreds of longtime Perot loyalists
holding their own parallel, or rump, convention, dismissed the
primary results, voted to disqualify Buchanan and nominated Hagelin
to head their Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept with humility and with pride the mantle of H. Ross
Perot,'' Hagelin said as delegates cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot faction was expected sometime today to formally
nominate a running mate for Hagelin, a physics professor at
Maharishi University. He has not announced his choice for running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   With both the Buchanan and the Hagelin-Perot factions claiming
legitimacy, the Federal Election Commission, and possibly federal
courts, will have to decide who will carry the party banner into
the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which would come within two weeks, would center on
which candidate is to receive $12.6 million in federal campaign
funds. The money is being made available under federal rules to the
Reform Party because Perot finished the 1996 race with almost 9
percent of the vote. Political parties whose candidates receive
more than 5 percent of the popular vote are eligible for federal
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Buchanan introduced Foster as his running
mate, saying she is part of his pitch to reunify the sharply
divided party and to appeal to Republicans and Democrats unhappy
with their parties' presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care what party you came from, where you've been and
who you're running away from,'' Buchanan said. ``Come with us.
You're welcome in our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a political activist opposed to government aid for
illegal immigrants and sex education, was not as welcoming as
Buchanan. ``Well, of course, if you're too leftist, you many not
want to be with us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Described by Buchanan as a ``lifelong Christian'' and first
black woman on a ``major party ticket,'' Foster is a former
Democrat who turned Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, 62, lost twice in campaigns against Maxine Waters, who
at the time was a Democratic member of the California state
assembly. Waters currently is a member of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Foster was a supporter of California's Proposition 187, a ballot
measure in 1994 that sought to deny most forms of state aid to
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Maurice, La., Foster moved to Houston when she was 6 and
grew up in Houston's Third Ward. She graduated from Jack Yates High
School and received her undergraduate degree from Texas Southern
University in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Foster moved to California and taught for 33 years in
south-central Los Angeles. Her activist career began after the
Watts riots in 1965, when she began organizing parents and teachers
to keep an eye on how public money was spent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, she was arrested for trespassing, disturbing the peace
and resisting arrest while passing out flyers criticizing GOP
leaders for ``failure to protect family values'' in favor of
pornographers and homosexuals. The charges were later dropped.

HOTEL KEEPS DOORS OPEN DESPITE YEARS OF VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Ouellette lives in an illegal room in
Manhattan. His cell-like home of 8 feet by 13 feet has no window
for light and air, as required by New York City statute. Two other
rented rooms in the building are also windowless, and he disputes
the legality of three more.
</P>
<P>
   Missing windows are not the only problem. In fact, Ouellette
contends that the whole building is operating outside the law.
There is no certificate of occupancy, a required city document
authorizing the use of a building. And in June, a city buildings
inspector issued a ``hazardous violation'' citing the property as
an illegal single-room-occupancy hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire building is illegal,'' said Ouellette (pronounced
oh-LET), 38, who sells and services computers. ``I want it 100
percent compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a catch-22. The management says that compliance will
force his eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Among New York's 900,000 buildings, this one is not big, famous
or historically notable. It is far from the worst building on the
city's radar screen. But it shows how a troubled building can slip
through the regulatory cracks for decades. Tenant advocates say
that a bewildering morass of city codes, inspection practices and
enforcement policies too often perpetuate problems rather than
solve them.
</P>
<P>
   The building, at 77 East 125th St., has a convoluted history of
continued operation despite uncorrected violations and the lack of
a certificate. It dates to the 1870s, when it was built as a
three-family house. Decades ago _ no one seems to know exactly when
_ it was converted into a rooming house. Its 17 rooms rent for $125
to $150 a week, including utilities.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 36 years, city officials have known about its
improperly subdivided rooms. Inspectors issued a citation in 1964
and ordered the owner to correct the violation and to obtain a
certificate of occupancy. But apparently the city never enforced
the regulations, and a succession of landlords never complied.
</P>
<P>
   The city did close the building in 1995, but for hazardous
violations other than the illegal rooms without windows. At that
time, inspectors cited defective fire sprinklers, no gas, no water,
no heat and no lights in the halls and stairway.
</P>
<P>
   The building was declared ``dangerous to life and detrimental to
the health and safety of the occupants and others and unfit for
human habitation.'' The city issued a ``full vacate order,''
removed the tenants to temporary lodging and gated the entrance.
The owner was forbidden to reopen without a certificate of
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring that order, the manager made repairs and the building
resumed operations in 1997, sans certificate. It has continued ever
since, even after inspectors returned to issue still more
citations.
</P>
<P>
   How could such a situation continue? Critics say that the city
issues myriad citations with little or no follow-up to force
compliance and collect fines. Budget cuts have reduced the
inspection staff by a third in the last decade, and tenant
advocates complain that city enforcement lawyers are also
shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   With limited resources, city lawyers focus on ``comprehensive
cases,'' every year cracking down on a few hundred buildings with
the most flagrant violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it all the time,'' said Peggy Earisman, managing
attorney of the East Side SRO Law Project, a nonprofit group.
``There are violations that are open for years, with 400 violations
on some buildings. Surely if these laws have any meaning, their
purpose is to protect the health and safety of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Allied Building Inspectors Union Local 211,
Joseph M. Corso, said, ``We could have thousands of inspectors, but
if there's no follow-up litigation, it's useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Since reopening, 77 East 125th St. has assumed an upscale name,
the Renaissance Hostel. Advertisements in The Village Voice stress
its location between Madison and Park avenues and its renovated
rooms and international environment. But the ramshackle four-story
structure lacks some features considered common even before the
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the first thing a visitor notices about the
building is the front-entrance doorknob. There isn't one. The
absence of a knob was duly noted by inspectors and cited as a
violation a year ago, so far to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground floor is a storefront padlocked in a police raid
last November. Until June, bright yellow and orange police posters
in the window proclaimed: ``Closed by court order. Criminal sale
and possession of marijuana.'' Now a new sign heralds a
soon-to-open clothes shop.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the entire building was overrun with illicit
drugs and prostitution, according to the current manager, Andrew
Haurylkiewicz (pronounced harry-KEV-ick).
</P>
<P>
   When he took over, Haurylkiewicz arranged major repairs of the
sprinkler, plumbing and heating systems and reopened the building.
But problems persisted, including the lack of a certificate and
other uncorrected violations. Several thousand dollars in past
fines were ignored. Also unpaid was a $61,000 city lien for the
cost of moving the tenants in 1995 and putting them up in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Ouellette, inspectors from the Department of Housing
Preservation and Development returned in recent months. They issued
new citations for the certificate of occupancy, illegal rooms, a
defective sprinkler, rusty fire escapes, loose chimney bricks and
the failure to post an inspection certificate near mailboxes. Not
only was there no posting; there were no mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   The case also drew a fresh Buildings Department review. In June
the department ordered the owner either to restore the original
three-family floor plan or to obtain a permit for a different use
that conforms to code. The windowless rooms would have to be
restored as alcoves to other rooms that have windows. At a hearing
on Aug. 3, the landlord did not show up and was declared in
default.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this? The building's legal status is in
bureaucratic limbo, with the violations, fines and lien still
pending, yet the building continues to rent rooms by the week.
</P>
<P>
   The owner denies responsibility. ``We're hands off,'' said
Sharock Jacoby of Great Neck, president of Ashan Realty. It leases
the property to Haurylkiewicz's firm, Newkirk Realty, under a
contract obliging Newkirk to correct violations.
</P>
<P>
   Haurylkiewicz said he inherited the problems and was doing his
best to remedy them. But he said he was going broke from the
repairs and lawyers' fees, totaling $30,000 to date. He is also
being squeezed by a rent strike led by Ouellette, with 10 tenants
withholding $1,350 a week and the arrears approaching $30,000,
Haurylkiewicz said. ``I'm running out of money,'' he said. ``I'm
drowning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because some city documents listed 18 dwellings in the building,
Haurylkiewicz said he had initially assumed they were legal. Now he
agrees that the windowless rooms violate the housing code, and he
vows to fix them. But he said that the renovations planned by his
architect would require Ouellette's removal so his room could be
opened to the adjoining room, which has a window.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the city housing agency said it was issuing an
order that two windowless rooms in the building, including
Ouellette's, be vacated by Monday for lack of ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette refuses to budge, asserting that since he has been
there longer, his neighbor is the one who should move out. Why does
Ouellette stay in his cramped space? ``My mission is to legalize
the building,'' he said. But Haurylkiewicz said that the real
attraction for Ouellette was living rent-free and avoiding electric
bills for all his computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Management's dispute with Ouellette runs deep. Both sides have
hurled bitter accusations of vandalism, harassment and assault.
There are court orders of protection and a mound of unresolved
litigation over rent, repairs and eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of the charges and outcome of the cases,
government records detail the building's legal woes. There are
unpaid fines for lack of heat last winter and for failing to post
boiler inspection certificates. Other violations over the years
included exposed electrical wires, a defective fire escape ladder,
broken plaster and water and sewage leaks. The rent roll, required
to be submitted annually, was filed only once before 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such problems, the city's housing and buildings agencies
said that conditions at the Renaissance were far from the worst.
(Both agencies inspect structures but for different rules.)
</P>
<P>
   A recent tour found the interior dingy and run-down. The wooden
stairs were uneven and springy. The apartment doors were unfinished
wood. Each floor had one common bathroom. Some had new tiling, but
there were also cracks in the walls. Water dripped from bulging
ceiling plaster and leaked around a toilet; each sink and vanity
teetered; medicine cabinet doors did not close, and sooty black
mold covered one patch of wall. The communal kitchen had no chair.
Plastic sheets covered much of the roof to keep out rain.
</P>
<P>
   Missing mail is a big complaint. ``Anything important I have
sent to my ex-wife's house,'' said one tenant, Murray Pessin.
Another issue is the lack of intercoms and buzzers. ``I can't hear
the doorbell downstairs,'' Pessin said, ``and even if I could, I
wouldn't know who it was for.''
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Brett Faison, said he was hit by a chunk of
plaster. ``I told them two weeks prior it was about to fall, and it
did.'' Like Ouellette, he lives in a windowless room. ``It's a
little inhumane,'' he said.

ON HORSE RACING: BUYERS SETTING RECORDS AT AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ In gauging the health of any industry, one
of the most accurate methods is to follow the money. In horse
racing that means following a buff, combed and yet-to-be-raced
yearling into the Humphrey S. Finney Sales Pavilion. Then, listen
to the auctioneer's sing-song pitch and keep an eye on the tote
board. Sometimes the buyers themselves are surprised at the final
flash of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least John C. Oxley was after the gavel banged on his
winning bid of $1.25 million for a horse labeled Hip No. 13 at the
Fasig-Tipton Saratoga yearling sale on opening night Tuesday. He
had just paid a record price for a New York-bred, a Silver Deputy
filly out of Screened, the multiple stakes producing Alydar mare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price was more than I anticipated, but when you find the
right horses, you've got to go ahead and buy them,'' reasoned
Oxley, an oil and gas exploration magnate who owns last year's
champion mare, Beautiful Pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 months, buyers have been digging deeper for the
right horses and in the process pushing prices to record levels. At
last September's Keeneland yearling sale, buyers paid more than
$233 million for 3,013 yearlings and boosted the average price for
the seventh consecutive year. The $77,357 average price was 30
percent more than the previous record. Last month at Keeneland's
summer select yearling sale, the numbers were even more staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Over three sessions, revenues rose for the sixth consecutive
year and grossed $82,120,000 to reach their highest level since
1990; the average price of a yearling increased to $621,015 from
$581,932. And more records were set here: 137 yearlings were sold
for $41,901,000, a 7.6 percent increase in revenue from the record
$38,957,000 set last year; and the average price of a yearling was
$305,847, up 15.8 percent from the record average set last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what the high end is anymore,'' said Eugene
Melnyk, who paid $1.8 million for a sale-topping Hennessy filly
this week. ``After the first two hours of an auction, it's pretty
clear you have to pay 50 percent more than you intended.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, however, this spending spree has boosted the optimism
of owners and racing officials in an industry that spent the first
half of the 1990s recovering from the bust of its last boom market
and the second half of the decade trying to position itself as an
entertainment option in a crowded sports market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went broke in the 1980s and I can tell you that was crazy
money,'' said Barry Irwin, who heads Team Valor, which syndicates
horses among multiple partners and in the spring took the Santa
Anita Derby winner, The Deputy, to the Kentucky Derby. ``That money
was borrowed, leveraged and invested for tax purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiser money or not, the strategy remains the same for horse
traders. Buy low, sell high and become the next Fusao Sekiguchi. He
is the Japanese entrepreneur who recently sold controlling interest
in the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus to Coolmore Stud. In
1998 he bought the colt for $4 million, won $1.89 million with him
this year, and sold him at a reported value of $60 million to $70
million _ though it was unclear what his take was because 40
percent of the horse belongs to the Yoshida family of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the big home run everyone is after,'' Melnyk said. ``It
pays for the rest of the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most owners, Melnyk, 41, wants to swing for those fences.
But he also is one of the newer breed of owners _ among them are
Mike Pegram, who won the 1998 Kentucky Derby with Real Quiet, and
Jim Scatuorchio, who races More Than Ready _ who came to horse
ownership from the front side, or betting windows. Melnyk's
interest as a horse player at age 14 evolved to his becoming an
every weekend track attendee, to owning claiming horses in the
1980s and, last week, winning the Jim Dandy here with Graeme Hall
just five years after plunging into the top-end horse market. He
owns 138 horses, including stallions, brood mares and 36
2-year-olds that he hopes will make it to the Triple Crown races
next year.
</P>
<P>
   With Churchill Downs Inc. and MI Entertainment Corp., founded by
the industrialist Frank Stronach, rapidly acquiring racetracks,
Melnyk believes he is betting wisely as an owner as well as an
industry handicapper. Churchill Downs and MI Entertainment each own
six tracks, from Florida to California. ``We are in the early
stages of consolidation, which means high-end tracks will offer
more high-end races and purses,'' Melnyk said.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry known for its divisions between owners, racetrack
operators and horseman, the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, now in its third year of existence as a quasi-league
office, may finally be providing some focus. The organization has
increased the hours of race coverage on network and cable
television, delivered clever television commercials and fostered a
spirit of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, for example, a Mystery Mutuel Voucher promotion
boosted attendance at tracks across the country on a day of
national stakes races headlined here by the Whitney. The NTRA
mailed vouchers, redeemable at 32 tracks and off-track betting
outlets, to more than one million people. One Voucher was worth $1
million, and tracks combined to offer $2.7 million in prizes. No
one cashed the $1 million voucher, but an increase in attendance
and handle was significant _ ranging from a 22 percent increase in
attendance at Monmouth Park on Sunday, the day of the Haskell, to a
524 percent increase in attendance at Mountaineer Park in West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is good right now, so the pursuit of fast horses can
be costly. But owners like Melnyk and Irwin believe this
competitive market is in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have people in the game for the right reasons,'' Irwin
said. ``To have fun and make money.''

MISSOURI TO INVESTIGATE OVERNIGHT INCREASE OF GAS PRICES IN KC
AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri's attorney
general said Friday he would launch an investigation into the
``suspicious'' overnight increase in gasoline prices in the Kansas
City area.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Area motorists on Friday found that prices at most gasoline
stations had risen by about 15 cents a gallon, to $1.44 at most
stations. Attorney General Jay Nixon said his investigators would
look at whether area retailers colluded in raising prices. No other
area is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen in this market is not normal market
activity,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which will cover the Missouri side of the
Kansas City area, will include the issuing of subpoenas to the
companies that own area stations. The investigation is expected to
take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It comes just days after the governor's task force on gasoline
prices, which was headed by Nixon, released a report finding that
oil producers and refineries profited from increases in gasoline
prices in May and June but that there was no illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who is running for re-election, said that this week's
sudden and widespread increase by Kansas City area gasoline
stations raised the possibility that they somehow communicated with
one another to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a deep and dire concern about the possibility of
collusion in this market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Area gasoline retailers said Friday that it was too early to
comment about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Debbi Graham, a spokeswoman for QuikTrip, the area's largest
seller of gasoline, said she couldn't comment because the company
was already being sued by the attorney general for allegedly
violating a Missouri law that prevents gasoline from being sold too
cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald J. Leone, executive vice president of the Missouri
Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association, said his
members had little control of prices at their stations and had not
increased profit margins as prices had increased in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my guys making the 300 percent profit,'' he said,
referring to the higher earnings being reported by major oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said his group told the governor's task force that it could
expect continued volatility in gasoline prices because of supply
and demand.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, wholesale prices have increased more than 10 cents a
gallon over the last two weeks. Energy traders say refinery outages
and higher crude-oil prices are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Right, a spokesman for AAA Auto Club of Missouri, said
prices promise to be volatile in the near future. They also have
gone up recently in St. Louis and on Friday were at the same level
as Kansas City prices. On Wednesday, some St. Louis stations raised
prices 10 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said St. Louis retailers wouldn't be included in the
investigation because the increase there wasn't as uniform and
widespread as in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one jumped off the meter,'' he said. ( 30 )

MORE DETAILS EMERGE IN HART LITIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An ``allocation
agreement'' written by lawyers for the family of deceased wrestler
Owen Hart violated rules of professional conduct, say two legal
experts hired by the World Wrestling Federation, a defendant in the
family's wrongful-death lawsuit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hart, 34, fell more than 70 feet to his death at Kemper Arena
last year when a stunt at a professional wrestling match went awry.
His widow, two children and parents are seeking millions of dollars
in damages from the WWF, the city of Kansas City and other
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The allocation agreement called for Hart's 10 siblings to share
in any damage award due Hart's parents if the siblings cooperated
with the plaintiffs. It also provided that siblings who cooperated
with the defendants would not share in any damage award.
</P>
<P>
   In affidavits filed in the case, one of the WWF's experts called
the allocation agreement an ``effort to suborn perjury.'' The other
said the agreement ``appears to offer an inducement to a witness
that is prohibited by law.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts, former University of Missouri-Kansas City law
professor James Jeans Sr. and University of Missouri-Columbia law
professor James R. Devine, were retained to provide opinions on the
ethics of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Their opinions contrast sharply with that of UMKC law professor
Francis M. Hanna, an expert retained by the family, who termed the
agreement ``ethically proper and acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said the document, which he called a ``family settlement
agreement,'' was improperly obtained by the defendants' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, should this document have been in the hands
of opposing counsel as a matter of legal ethics?'' Hanna said in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The allocation agreement is at the core of a dispute between
Gary and Anita Robb, Kansas City lawyers who represent Hart's
widow, children and parents, and attorneys for the WWF and the
other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs asked Hart's siblings to sign the agreement but
rescinded it after the defendants learned of its existence. The
defendants want to question potential witnesses about the document
to determine whether they were promised a financial stake in the
lawsuit's outcome in return for their favorable testimony.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary writ issued last week by the Missouri Court of
Appeals directed the agreement to be kept under seal and prohibited
the defendants' lawyers from asking witnesses about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the Court of Appeals has seen all
these competing affidavits and testimony, and has ruled in our
favor on the preliminary rule in prohibition,'' Gary Robb stated
Friday in written responses to questions from /{The Kansas City
Star./}
</P>
<P>
   /{The Star/} obtained a copy of the agreement last month from an
open court file at the Court of Appeals. At the newspaper's
request, the court this week released most of the remainder of the
file, including the legal experts' affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   Under Missouri's wrongful-death statute, Hart's siblings can't
be parties to the case _ and share in any judgment _ as long as
Hart's spouse, children or parents survive him. Because the
siblings may be witnesses in the case, the defendants say the
agreement was an attempt to buy their favorable testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs have insisted the document was akin to a confidential
client retainer agreement and was a legally supportable effort to
secure unity among members of Hart's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is legal and proper in every jurisdiction for elderly
parents to give their children an interest in their estate, as they
see fit,'' Anita Robb stated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs have said their intent was to prevent the WWF from
exploiting divisions in the extended Hart family _ some have ties
to the WWF _ and from reaching a ``quick and cheap settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs also say the WWF's attorneys improperly obtained the
agreement when a sibling with ties to the WWF faxed them a copy.
The Robbs say the WWF's lawyers were legally bound to return the
agreement and violated rules of professional conduct by failing to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs said they rescinded the agreement because they didn't
want it to become a ``red herring.'' Since then, they have battled
to keep the document under seal and to prevent the defendants from
questioning witnesses about it.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits of Jeans and Devine were filed in late May, just
before trial Judge Douglas Long Jr. ordered the document unsealed
after a May 31 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court writ reversed Long's order, at least until it
heard further arguments on the issue. Additional arguments were
filed by the defendants on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, Jeans called the allocation agreement an
``effort to obstruct justice'' and said it was a ``clear
violation'' of the rule of professional conduct prohibiting a
lawyer from assisting a witness to testify falsely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misstatements of law, the citation of a non-existent
statute, the invitation to exchange a portion of the verdict for
evidence to enhance that verdict, and the mandate to withhold
evidence under the threat of losing out on a piece of the pie
amounts to a pattern of egregious violations of ethical behavior
demanded of trial advocates,'' Jeans wrote of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Devine, in his affidavit, said the agreement ``gives the
appearance of paying the Hart Brothers and Sisters, who would
otherwise receive no portion of the proceeds under the law, a
benefit for keeping quiet or testifying favorably for the
plaintiffs....It appears to offer an inducement to a witness that
is prohibited by law.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine's and Jeans' affidavits differed sharply from the
affidavit of Hanna, who described the agreement as ethically
acceptable and confidential because it dealt with the
attorney-client relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna on Friday said that the WWF's attorneys were obligated,
once they obtained the document, to consult with opposing counsel
or the court on its disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have raised a red flag in any ethically sensitive
lawyer's mind that this agreement was confidential,'' Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs, who signed the agreement, asked the Hart siblings to
sign it after accusing the WWF's counsel in Pittsburgh, Jerry
McDevitt, of going behind their backs and trying to persuade Hart's
parents to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs say one of the Hart siblings stole the agreement from
the parents and sent it to McDevitt. After McDevitt sought to
question Hart's mother about the agreement in a deposition, the
Robbs asked Long, the trial judge, to seal it. Long initially did
so but reconsidered after the May hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Because final briefs aren't due for another 60 days, the appeals
court isn't expected to rule for at least two more months.

BLAMING THE NET IS TOO EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Whatever caused Kansas City's sales tax
revenue shortfall over its last fiscal year, it's not likely the
e-tailers of the Internet contributed significantly the problem.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although most Internet transactions don't involve a sales tax,
the volume of Web-based retail sales hasn't reached anywhere near
the critical mass needed to drain substantial revenues from local
coffers. Those who track e-commerce closely estimate Internet
retail sales at 1 percent or less of total spending in the
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting retail number was put out a couple of years
ago by an economist for the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, who noted that 70 percent of all retail sales were
generated by 30 percent of the population. Thus, it could be that
Kansas City isn't doing enough business with those hard-core
consumers who generate most of the retail sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever state and local government leaders gather these days, a
foremost topic of conversation is the need for legislation to
ensure that e-tailers are required to collect sales taxes just like
the retailers on Main Street, USA. It's not fair, most say, for
Internet merchants to get a free ride and thereby gain an unfair
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Without getting into the merits of this argument, what
grass-roots politicians should be probing are ways to finance
government without relying so heavily on sales taxes. The
record-breaking U.S. expansion of the '90s has created enough
prosperity to ameliorate a lot of natural resistance to rising
sales taxes. In the process, it's safe to say, local officials have
gotten spoiled, which is why sales tax increases seem to have
become the revenue enhancer of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Considered in this context, perhaps Kansas City's sales tax
revenue weakness is a matter of the law of diminishing returns
taking effect. Or perhaps it's a matter of Kansas City losing its
luster as a consumer destination. Or perhaps it's a combination of
both.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's metropolitan area is, after all, a highly
competitive consumer arena. Kansas City officials concerned about a
decline in sales tax revenue should compare their figures with
other jurisdictions. Overland Park is, of course, the standard by
which all others must be measured, because it's the acknowledged
shopping mecca.
</P>
<P>
   First, if overall areawide sales tax take is stable to up, that
would be the first sign of problems that can't be explained away by
Internet competition. If some jurisdictions are experiencing
healthy gains while others are stable to down, this would be a sign
of declining competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive decline might occur for many reasons, but the first
thing a jurisdiction with problems should check is how its sales
tax rate compares with similar tariffs of other governments.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problem, many local governments probably have gone
about as far they can go using sales tax increases as the primary
answer to revenue enhancement needs. At some point consumer
resistance will mount to the point that more means less when it
comes to sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   This will be especially so if the Internet continues to be a
mostly tax-free zone. ( 30 )

FAMILY CARRIES ON MAN'S DREAM OF PEACH ORCHARD CROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A breeze doesn't blow
in a peach orchard.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trees seal off the wind like a long, green oven door.
Inside, leaves don't move. Peaches hang still. Sweat rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Wall picks until a half-bushel box is full, then reaches
for another. Her 12-year-old son and another boy pick other trees.
</P>
<P>
   It's midafternoon in this orchard southeast of Kansas City.
They've been at it since early morning. Horseflies buzz around
them. Grasshoppers fly past their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Wall stops, takes off her glasses and uses her shirt to
wipe sweat from her face. She doesn't dare look down the row. For
there waits her husband's dream.
</P>
<P>
   This is the summer his peaches came.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 trees, peaches thick as ornaments on Christmas
trees at Macy's. Prettier even. Red and gold, like balls of sunset.
</P>
<P>
   And Cheryl Wall, 45, is determined to pick them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part,'' she said, ``is knowing he will never see
any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Wall died unexpectedly April 1 at age 55, leaving his
wife and son to tend the orchard. All told: 3,200 peach, apple,
pear, cherry and plum trees. And some grape vines.
</P>
<P>
   They could have moved back to the city. Cheryl Wall sure didn't
know how to run an orchard. Curtis, her son, was only a
sixth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   But they're learning. Picking, pruning and mowing. Twelve hours
most days. Carrying boxes, fighting bugs and wiping sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl does it for her husband, a man she described as being
hardworking, giving and with a laugh that came from his toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel him when I'm out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while many 12-year-olds spend summer days at the pool or
watching MTV, Curtis works alongside his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make this orchard work...for my dad.'' Nurturing a
dream
</P>
<P>
   They came from Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Wall worked construction there. Cheryl was a surgical
scrub nurse.
</P>
<P>
   But after 20 years of life in the city, they had a calling for
the country. During a 1994 visit to relatives in Missouri, they
happened upon a farm for sale, east of Garden City just across the
Cass County line into Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   They fixed up the place and started raising cattle. Later, came
the idea for the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it had always been his dream,'' Cheryl said.
</P>
<P>
   Marion kept his old job, commuting to Oklahoma City and
returning home on weekends to catch up with farm work.
</P>
<P>
   He was a spontaneous sort. One day, when he and Cheryl decided
the fireplace made the house too dark and a large window would be
better, Marion grabbed a 20-pound sledge and started pounding away.
</P>
<P>
   Life was good. The farm was beautiful. The trees were growing.
Marion and Cheryl had morning coffee in the gazebo that sits in the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Shandra, was married in that gazebo. Neighbors
came to the wedding in everything from overalls to suits. Marion
smoked ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came April 1 this year, a Saturday. Marion and Cheryl ran
errands that morning. They went to the feed store. Later, in what
would seem a quirk of fate, friends started dropping by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everybody he knew was coming to visit,'' Cheryl
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Marion was burning a brush pile. He came to the
house and coughed a cough Cheryl had never heard the likes of. He
said he didn't feel good. He was ashen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm hurts,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in the truck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The white Ford pickup flew down gravel roads and blacktops
toward the hospital in Harrisonville. As always, he gave her
pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful now, you know that cow's always in the road along
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't talk,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch for that cop that sits up there,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you just relax?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles farther, she looked over and knew he was gone. She
pulled into a driveway and yelled for help. Folks came out and
helped Cheryl pull Marion out of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack had killed her husband of 18 years, a man who had
never shown a sign of heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just worked himself to death,'' Cheryl says now.
``Driving back and forth to Oklahoma, cramming in all the work he
did here on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't grieve long. There wasn't time. Marion's peaches were
coming, and they would have to be her income. She had spraying to
do and trees to prune.
</P>
<P>
   But first, she had to learn how. She went to a longtime peach
grower and told him of her plans to run the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you want to do this?'' Bill Baxter, 73, asked.
</P>
<P>
   He knew how much work an orchard was _ and he had only 350
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Marion's dream,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is it your dream?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   She just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, who runs a retail stand along Missouri 7 in Cass County,
gave her a crash course. He told her what sprays to use and when to
use them, how to prune and how to tell when the peaches were ready
to pick.
</P>
<P>
   Friends came to help in the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, she said. In a big city where you live on a crowded
block, you don't have that many close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``But out here, where nobody lives within a mile of you, friends
come from all over to help,'' Cheryl said.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, she hopes to go to the house where her husband died and
thank the people who tried to help her that day. But she can't _
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will tell me when it's time.'' `The mominator'
</P>
<P>
   ``Duck!'' Curtis yells.
</P>
<P>
   And they all duck just as the branch whips above their heads. A
little six-wheeler truck is zipping between rows of peach trees.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, riding in the back, frowns and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta start prunin','' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His 13-year-old friend, Josh Hastings, rides beside him _
helping, as always, without pay. Booker, an Australian shepherd,
runs alongside. Cheryl, whom the boys call the ``mominator,'' is
driving the six-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   It's early afternoon. The boys haven't had lunch yet, but a
truck is coming at 3:30 p.m. to pick up 27 boxes of peaches. Later,
she will need to deliver 24 boxes to Bill Baxter's stand.
</P>
<P>
   Just another day in the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl is up around daybreak and not back into the house 'til 9
p.m. Then there's cooking and cleaning and laundry to do.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Scott, a wholesaler who buys from Cheryl, calls her the
workingest woman he's ever seen in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most wives in her place would have sold this place and moved
to town in a minute,'' Scott said. ``There ain't no quit in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl puts it this way: ``It doesn't get done if you just think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't hire help. Not until she learns what she's doing.
Anyway, she feels a need to do it herself this summer.
</P>
<P>
   They started harvest July 8 and are now more than halfway done.
</P>
<P>
   The days are long for Curtis, but he knows what's at stake. He
was 6 when he helped his father plant the trees, ``shoveling dirt
and sweatin' like a pack mule.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, it seems that just about the time they get the
orchard mowed and the trees tended, it's time to do both again.
</P>
<P>
   But he still finds time to fish and hunt, and not just for
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mom the more wild game I bring back, the less we
have to go the grocery store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl calls this her learning year. Next year will be easier.
She plans on turning her barn into a retail stand.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend, Pam Huff, thinks Cheryl is holding up, though
maybe the work is a way of putting off the grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lives in that orchard...the peaches are what keeps her
going,'' Huff said.
</P>
<P>
   And, to fulfill her husband's dream, Cheryl Wall has been going
as hard as she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a peach falls to the ground, it may just have to lay there
because I've done the best I can do,'' she said this week as she
filled her pickup with boxes overflowing with Biscos and Summer
Pearls.
</P>
<P>
   It is a great summer for peaches.
</P>
<P>
   It is the summer Marion Wall had waited for.

VIETNAMESE IN AMERICA GATHER AT CARTHAGE FOR MARIAN DAYS
CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   CARTHAGE, Mo. _ Dien Nguyen could not
find peace in Vietnam, even after the war ended, even after his
family's meals were no longer interrupted by explosions and dashes
for shelter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The victorious Communists made it impossible for Nguyen to
profess his Catholic faith without fear of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Raytown man and his countrymen find such joy in
Marian Days, a four-day celebration that has brought about 50,000
Vietnamese Catholics from around the world to this small Ozarks
town. Marian Days began Thursday and will wrap up on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our faith is something we carry in here,'' Nguyen said,
pointing to his heart. ``We feel fortunate to be able to express
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the war ended, Vietnamese Catholics
continue to thrive in this unlikely haven. Their seminary, the
Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix, has organized Marian Days
since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   At Marian Days, lively pop music blares from tents _ most of the
visitors will camp on the 30-acre seminary grounds. Teen-agers whiz
by on skateboards while families share tea with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   A choir's songs echo on the main square. Several dozen priests
hear confessions in a park dotted with trees. In the chapel,
worshipers solemnly light candles to honor loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Frivolity and faith emanate from every corner of this sprawling
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants say adversity has strengthened that faith,
since the days when it seemed bombs were all the heavens had to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the main plaza, the congregation erected a massive statue of
the Virgin Mary as patron of refugees. The baby Jesus rests on her
shoulder. A Vietnamese child reaches for her waist. Mary draws him
in with her hand. Fleeing to new land
</P>
<P>
   ``The church in Vietnam wrote her history with her own blood,''
reads a caption at a campus center that honors Vietnamese martyrs.
The Co-Redemptrix community shared that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   When Saigon fell, about 185 community members piled into boats
and sailed east. An American cargo ship picked them up and, after a
time, authorities took them to Fort Chafee, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop of the Springfield-Cape Girardeau diocese heard of
their plight and gave them an unused seminary in Carthage. After
faltering initially, the congregation has rebounded to more than
200 priests and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Father Anthony McGuire of the National Catholic Bishops'
Conference, who oversees pastoral care for migrants and refugees,
compares the community to the Poles, who suffered under Nazi and
Communist oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tends to draw people together. You see that in
Carthage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Thomas Dien puts it this way: ``These are people who
lived a hard life. They need something to lean on. They may have
come with no job, no money. So they lean on their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation started Marian Days to thank Mary for her
protection. About 1,700 attended the inaugural event. Early
accounts describe picketing and taunts from local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Dien says some neighbors have moved, in part, to avoid the
hubbub of the festival. Several complain of traffic. Some
homeowners blanket their front yards with bright red ``Keep Out''
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Unease grew in 1995 when a Louisiana teen-ager was arrested in
Joplin for the gang-related shooting of another event participant.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the event has become part of the
town's heritage, like the Civil War battlefield nearby. Carthage
has created a citywide holiday, Vietnamese Day, even though the
number of Vietnamese residents still is relatively small.
Townspeople visit to sample the gantlet of food tents. Several
neighbors even open their front yards for camping.
</P>
<P>
   As jobs in poultry plants and agriculture bring a stream of
immigrants from Mexico and southeast Asia, some say Carthage could
be a preview of the changing face of southwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 to 1997, the Vietnamese population in America
quadrupled to more than 1 million. The numbers also are growing in
Missouri _ the 1990 census estimated 3,870 Vietnamese statewide,
25th highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lesson to be learned from Carthage,'' McGuire said.
``If you're open to it, these people are a gift. The changes are
something that enrich your life, rather than hold you back.''
Family rifts
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ozarks and Vietnam are worlds apart, participants
say the event also addresses rifts within the Vietnamese community.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vietnam is a country of contrasts, a crossroads of
ancient traditions and modern influences. Many Vietnamese still are
divided by ideology, geography or religion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 80 million residents are Buddhist, with Catholics
comprising only about 10 percent of the population. Some, including
the government, consider Catholicism a religion of
``superstitions.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in the United States, Marian Days has become a
unifying cultural force.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors create small bazaars to sell CDs, religious icons and
imported knicknacks. Churches sell sandwiches, entrees and
pastries. Musicians play traditional and modern tunes.
</P>
<P>
   An Le of Joplin said only about a third of the 250 event
participants from his hometown are Catholic. The rest are Buddhist
or of other religions. He said the event highlights their
similarities, not their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have the same struggles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And organizers are amazed at how Marian Days bridges the gap
between first-generation Vietnamese and their U.S.-born children.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is clear. A middle-aged woman in a traditional gown
shares sidewalk space with a tattooed teen wearing a Kobe Bryant
basketball jersey. She converses in Vietnamese, he in English
slang.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers tailor events to specific groups: the elderly,
families and youth. A poster with teen idol Christina Aguilera
advertised Friday night's ``holy rave,'' a dance party starting at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's usually a generation gap in Vietnamese families,''
Dien said. ``This gives them some family time, camping together,
praying together. They can get away from the TV, the jobs and all
the distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   The bilingual Masses are at the event's core.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening ceremony, Bishop John Leibrecht of the
Springfield-Cape Girardeau diocese told worshipers of how God
helped Moses and his people survive the grueling desert journey to
the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is always with us,'' Leibrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen already knows that. The Raytown man vividly recalls his
own perilous six-day journey on a shrimp boat with 50 other
refugees crossing the South China Sea from Vietnam to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we knew is that we were the bait of the sharks. We only
had one place to turn,'' he said. ``That's why people are here
today, to give thanks to God. It's our faith that got us through
all of this.'' ( 30 )

   MARIANDAYS -- A look at the Marian Days event in Carthage, Mo.,

   PEACH -- Cheryl and Marion Wall always dreamed of owning an
orchard. So they left the big city and moved to some land just
beyond Cass County and planted 2,500 peach trees. This year, those
trees are finally bearing fruit, but Marion isn't there to help
with the harvest. He dropped dead April 1 of a heart attack at age
55. Now his 45-year-old wife and their 12-year-old son Curtis and a
13-year-old friend are harvesting all those peaches by themselves,
sweating a lot and learning as they go. They'll do it again when
apple season arrives. By Donald Bradley. Story will move in the

NEWS CORP. SAID TO AGREE TO BUY CHRIS-CRAFT TV
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Calif., Ore., Minn., Ariz., Fla., Utah, Texas,
Md.)  (ADDS 5 grafs at end with details) 
By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   News Corp., which owns the Fox television network, has agreed to
acquire Chris-Craft Industries, the TV-station company, for $3.5
billion, a person close to the discussions said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft, which is controlled by Herbert J. Siegel, 72, owns
10 television stations, while the News Corp., controlled by Rupert
Murdoch, owns 22 stations.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. is expected to pay $85 a share, a 21 percent
premium to the price of Chris-Craft stock this week.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom abruptly announced Friday that merger talks with
Chris-Craft had broken down, sending shares of Chris-Craft
plummeting to $62, down $8. Then, after the market closed,
Chris-Craft said it was in talks with another major media company.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to acquire television-station companies has been
intense. Viacom, which owns television stations and is also
part-owner of UPN, has been negotiating on and off for several
years to acquire the Chris-Craft stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the assets, but only at a price,'' Sumner Redstone,
the chairman of Viacom, said Friday night. ``The price wasn't
right, and we decided to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a merger would put tremendous control of television
stations into Murdoch's hands. For one thing, the News Corp.,
already owns WNYW, Channel 5, in New York. The purchase of
Chris-Craft would bring him WWOR-TV, Channel 9, a UPN affiliate.
That raises the issue of whether Murdoch would shut UPN out of the
New York market. The News Corp. would also own two stations in Los
Angeles, as well as in Phoenix and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the Federal Communications Commission did not
permit the ownership of two stations in a single market. The FCC
still limits station groups to ownership of stations that cover no
more than 35 percent of the nation's households.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules adopted in August 1999, the FCC allows dual
ownership in cities where there are a sufficient number of ``media
voices,'' which include all radio and television stations, large
daily newspapers and cable systems. Specifically, a city must have
at least eight independently owned television stations for a single
company to own two. And a company cannot own more than one of the
four top-rated stations in any market.
</P>
<P>
   Should the deal go through, it would also give the News Corp.
control of BHC Communications, of which Chris-Craft owns 80
percent. BHC operates very-high-frequency and ultra-high-frequency
TV stations. It has a market value of $3.18 billion. There are 4.5
million shares outstanding. BHC in turn owns 58 percent of United
Television.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chris-Craft tried to sell Viacom all its stations and
its half-interest in UPN. But Viacom thought the price was too
high. Viacom walked away from the deal and told Chris-Craft that it
would exercise a clause that allowed it either to buy Chris-Craft's
half-interest in UPN or sell its own half-interest to Chris-Craft.
Chris-Craft was then forced to sell its half-interest to Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, there was a second round of negotiations on the
stations, and Viacom walked away again, thinking the price too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft owns 10 stations: WWOR in Secaucus, N.J.; KCOP, Los
Angeles; KPTV, Portland, Ore.; KBHK, San Francisco; KMSP,
Minneapolis-St. Paul; KUTP, Phoenix; WRBW, Orlando, Fla.; WUTB,
Baltimore; KTVX, Salt Lake City, and KMOL, San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   There have long been reports that Siegel would sell the company,
but no deal materialized. And some people in the entertainment
industry said they felt he was reluctant to let it go because both
his sons, Bill and John, work at Chris-Craft.
</P>
<P>
   But if Siegel seemed conflicted about a sale, he was also
conflicted about expanding his company, see- ing all acquisitions
and many invest- ments as too expensive. ``To take the money and
buy something that does not earn as much as government bonds do is
not a smart move,'' Siegel said in 1997. Mr. Siegel de- clined to
comment  &UR;  &LR; Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp is paying about 17 times cash flow, a relatively
large multiple by industry stand- ards, said Scott Davis, who
follows Chris-Craft for First Union Securi- ties. However, the
company may feel that there is room to improve profit- ability, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With operating margins of about 30 percent, the stations
generally un-H derperform the industry, where mar- gins tend to be
in the 40 percent range,'' he said, adding that the News Corp gets
about $1.5 billion that is on the balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp was al- ready the largest station owner in the
country. Now that it will exceed the legal limits of the television
reach, the question is whether the company will have to sell some
sta- tions or push the FCC to expand ownership limitations. &QL;

CHENEY'S DALLAS COMPANY GIVING HIM $20 MILLION RETIREMENT PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y., Ga.)   (SUBS 8th graf with details)  
 (Exclusive)  
 The following article is based on reporting by Lowell Bergman,
Floyd Norris and Diana B. Henriques and was written by
Henriques.   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The energy services company that Dick Cheney served for much of
the last five years as chairman and chief executive has agreed to
give Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, a
retirement package worth an estimated $20 million, according to
people who have reviewed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the Halliburton Co., which is based in Dallas,
approved the arrangements on July 20, five days before Gov. George
W. Bush announced his selection of Cheney as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote allowed Cheney to avoid a potentially costly
aspect of his employment contract, which said he would forfeit some
of his compensation if he retired before age 62 without the board's
permission. This provision, known as golden handcuffs, is routinely
included in executives' contracts to give them incentives to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who spent much of his life as a public official and
federal employee, became a wealthy man in his years with
Halliburton. He has been paid at least $12.5 million by Halliburton
since he joined the company in 1995 and has received stock and
options worth nearly $39 million at its current stock price.
</P>
<P>
   By permitting Cheney, 59, to treat his departure as early
retirement, the directors allowed him to keep $10 million worth of
stock and options he would have forfeited had he simply resigned,
the company's public filings show. It was not clear whether the $10
million was part of the retirement package or in addition to it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those briefed on the company's plan said the board was
told the package totaled about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   While not extraordinarily large by current corporate standards,
Cheney's retirement package solidifies and expands his personal
stake in the oil industry in general, and Halliburton in
particular, while he is on the campaign trail confronting energy
policy issues that will affect Halliburton's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Vande Beek, Cheney's campaign spokesman, and a spokes-
woman for Halliburton both refused yesterday to confirm any details
about the retirement arrangement. Vande Beek said details were
being worked out. &UR;  &LR; Cheney, he said, will remain an employee of
Halliburton until Aug. 16 with the title ``chairman in
transition.''The price of Halliburton stock is substantially higher
than it was when Cheney took over, but his tenure was not an
unqualified success. The Halliburton board annually sets financial
goals for the company with the understanding that executive bonuses
will be withheld if the targets are not met. The company failed to
meet those targets in both 1998 and 1999, although the board
decided to pay Cheney and other executives bonuses anyway in 1998
because they had engineered a major merger with Dresser Industries,
another oil services company.
</P>
<P>
   That Cheney bonus came to $1.15 million, nearly as much as his
$1.18 million salary for the year. In 1999, however, the bonus was
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said in interviews that he will sell off his
Halliburton stock if the Republican ticket prevails in the fall. It
is not yet clear how Cheney might handle his stock options, a major
part of his wealth, which, if retained, would give him a stake in
the company's performance for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The options give him the right to buy shares at a set price for
up to 10 years. Some of Cheney's options, however, cannot be
exercised before next January, unless the board waives restrictions
on them. Other options give Cheney the chance to buy Halliburton
stock at more than its current market price of $51 a share,
worthless now but potentially valuable if he can hold them until
the company's stock rises.
</P>
<P>
   A company representative, Wendy Hall, declined to discuss
Cheney's retirement. Hall said the company allowed some executives
to retire with full benefits after age 55 and that details of
Cheney's arrangement would be made public next week.
</P>
<P>
   According to one board member, the package approved for Cheney
was not discounted to reflect either his age or his short tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the contract calls for'' is what was approved for
Cheney, said W.R. Howell, a Halliburton director and former
chairman and chief executive of J.C. Penney Co. ``He's entitled to
full retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell added, ``There was nothing done at the board level of an
exceptional nature for Dick Cheney. The press release indicated
that Dick Cheney is retiring, and that's what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Cheney is covered by two retirement plans at
Halliburton, a profit-sharing plan and a second plan, intended to
provide a minimum pension if the profit-sharing funds are
inadequate. The company has not disclosed how much Cheney stands to
receive from those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's financial statements do not describe its early
retirement program, but such arrangements typically involve a
substantial reduction in the pension benefits the employee
receives.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a number of corporate boards have granted
departing chief executives pension benefits for which they did not
qualify under strict terms of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney joined the company's board on Aug. 10, 1995, and became
chief executive on Oct. 1, 1995. While details of the retirement
plans affecting Cheney are not clear from the company's public
filings, many such plans require an employee to have at least five
years of service to receive any benefits, a milestone Cheney did
not pass until Aug. 10 at the earliest, assuming his board service
is counted.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the company has won two important
international contracts, one with Petroleos Brasileiros, or
Petrobras, the Brazilian oil giant, the other a Defense Department
contract for the reconstruction of war-damaged Kosovo. Also on his
watch, to save money, the company laid off thousands of employees
and reduced retirees' medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's decision not to sell his stock until after the election
drew some criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a built-in conflict of interest throughout the
campaign,'' said Chuck Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, rejected that
view. ``America is best served when good people from the private
sector are willing to return to the public sector,'' Fleischer
said.

</P>
<P>
   ``There are many good people like former Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin who have done so. Surely we want to encourage their
return,'' Fleischer added.
</P>
<P>
   The Halliburton board was well within its legal powers in
granting Cheney full retirement benefits earlier than the date
specified in his contract, said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities
law professor at Columbia Law School and an expert on corporate
governance practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of such `golden handcuffs' is to keep an
attractive executive from taking a competitive job in business,''
Coffee said. ``I don't think you need to extend that concept to
keep someone from becoming pope, vice president or chief justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is certainly a significant one for Cheney's own
financial security, since his tenure at Halliburton came after he
had spent most of his career in government service as a congressman
from Wyoming and as secretary of defense _ without amassing
significant wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he is wealthy. He exercised options on 100,000
shares and sold the stock at the end of May, earning a profit of $3
million. The other options and restricted stock he was given are
worth $35.7 million at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   History offers few examples of how other candidates in Cheney's
circumstances handled the effect of a campaign on their personal
financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates on a presidential ticket, even those with
business experience, actually entered the race from state or local
political office, said Judge Leslie H. Southwick, author of the
book ``Presidential Also-Rans and Running Mates, 1788-1980.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far less common for a full-time corporate manager to step
directly from the executive suite onto the campaign trail, where
campaign issues can affect his personal fortune.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions, of course. For example, Wendell
Willkie was president of Commonwealth and Southern, a large utility
holding company, when he made his bid for the presidency in 1940 at
a time when utilities were vehemently opposing New Deal projects
like the Tennessee Valley Authority, Southwick noted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Ross Perot sought the presidency on the Reform Party
ticket while overseeing Perot Systems, a computer systems company.
But the company was not publicly traded then. Jimmy Carter
campaigned for the White House in 1976 while helping run his
family's struggling peanut business in Georgia.
