PACK OF FRIENDS EXPECTED FOR WOLF'S START
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Randy Wolf makes his first start at Dodger Stadium
as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies today, but the second-year
pitcher has a history with the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf pitched his final high school game at Dodger Stadium in
1994, when he threw a complete game in the L.A. City championship
game for El Camino Real of Woodland Hills. Wolf, who also pitched
at Pepperdine for three seasons, expects to have a cheering section
in the stands today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's about 30 people on the pass list, and I'm sure
a few more will show up,'' said Wolf, who was drafted by the
Dodgers out of high school but didn't sign. ``I got to go home
(Friday) night and see a bunch of friends, and it's really pretty
special to play in your hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone to all the stadiums, and they're all cool, but to
come here and sit in the dugout and hear the organ, when you grew
up sitting in the stands, that's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf missed playing in Dodger Stadium last year by one game - he
started the last game of a series in San Diego - and said he feels
more comfortable this year after losing eight consecutive starts in
1999. Wolf is 3-3 with a 4.26 ERA this year and has won two of his
past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience is just so important,'' Wolf said. ``It doesn't
matter if it's good or bad, what's important is just to learn. Even
when things are bad, it teaches you how to handle the tough times,
and it makes you stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling fine: Todd Hundley hit two home runs in Friday's victory
over the Phillies, and the Dodgers catcher has a lot to celebrate
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything feels good,'' Hundley said. ``The elbow feels good,
the arm feels good, the leg feels good. I'm really pleased right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hit safely in 20 of the past 26 games and homered in
eight of the past 13 going into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His 13 home runs are tied for second best on the team with Eric
Karros, one behind Gary Sheffield, but Hundley, who hit a
career-high 41 home runs in 1996, can't pinpoint a specific reason
for his power resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just about solid hitting, seeing the ball well and
getting a good swing,'' Hundley said. ``There's nothing special
about it, it's just a matter of getting solid contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's confidence has reached a high point. Last season was
filled with questions about his surgically repaired elbow and his
inability to throw out runners. But now that his throwing has
improved, just about the only question is whether he will return to
the Dodgers after he becomes an unrestricted free agent this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about that right now,'' Hundley said.
``I just want to play well, win some games, and the contract will
take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a game for me now, the way it should be,
especially compared to last year. Last year it was work, and it
wasn't a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   What a welcome: It's been quite a first week for Dodgers
reliever Trever Miller, who joined the team Monday, two days before
the mass suspensions were handed down in the Wrigley Field
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made his Dodgers debut that night, retired just one of
the five batters he faced and was charged with two runs in a 10-3
loss to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just eager to get back out there,'' Miller said. ``I threw
in the bullpen (Friday) and felt good, so I'm looking forward to
the next chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's new team faced his old team Saturday, but the pitcher
said it didn't seem strange to watch the Phillies from the opposing
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't there long enough for it to feel weird,'' said
Miller, who spent just two months with Philadelphia after three
seasons in Houston. ``It was weird when we opened the new park in
Houston, because I was there for a lot longer.''

<P>
   HALTOM CITY, Texas _ When Hispanic Television Network needed
money last fall, it decided to sell 10 million shares for $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   For that sum, investors got a piece of a company with the
financial track record of an Internet start-up, including the
obligatory red ink that flows when expenses dwarf revenues. Looking
at it another way, investors had a chance to pay $1 for shares that
traded for as little as 16 cents as recently as Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the deal, the company gave its backers a warrant. A
warrant is the right to buy another share of the company for $2. It
could be worth some real money, assuming the stock price went up.
</P>
<P>
   Good assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Television Network, less than a year old and still
putting together a network of local stations, has seen its shares
climb as high as $20 this year. Working out of a modest building in
Haltom City, the fledgling broadcaster has hired a number of
experienced managers, announced a deal to buy 12 television
stations and is pursuing more.
</P>
<P>
   HTVN has two low-power UHF stations in Phoenix, but only one of
them, Channel 28, is on the air. The network plans to begin
broadcasting on Channel 30 in about a month, said Rod Rodriguez,
sales director for HTVN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that two lower-power stations would give us the
same amount of coverage as two full-power stations,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The network plans to open an office at 30th Avenue and Thomas
Road, and hopes to launch some local programing next fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   HTVN also has purchased stations in Tucson and Globe, but
neither has begun broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   HTVN will challenge two existing Spanish-language networks _
Telemundo, controlled by Sony, and Univision, whose publicly traded
stock has been soaring _ for the growing Hispanic audience in the
United States. There are an estimated 32 million U.S. Hispanics _
more than the population of Canada. And their numbers are growing
about five times as fast as the general U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our intention to be an international media company,''
said Jim Ryffel, chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Ryffel runs Woodcrest Enterprises, a Fort Worth real estate
company, and previously backed FlashNet Communications, which is
being acquired by Prodigy Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Television Network might plan to go international, but
it will do it by staying closer to home. Mexico, specifically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Univision's lineup, few are Mexican,'' HTVN
President Marco Camacho says. ``They're Cuban, or from Puerto Rico
or Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Telemundo executive sees Mexico as HTVN's niche,
because most Hispanics living in Texas, Southern California, even
Chicago, came from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the plan: Air more Mexican-focused programs, and if
they're not available, produce them. &QL;

PAST CHAMPIONS HAVE EDGE ON CURRENT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers are six wins away from
``fulfilling their destiny'' as NBA Champions, a phrase that
carries the dead weight of expectations. Imagine James Earl Jones
saying it, as he did as Darth Vader, to get a true feel for its
density.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, the Lakers won't
have it easy winning those last six games, two more from the game
Portland Trail Blazers and then four more from either Indiana or
New York.
</P>
<P>
   And this team, by any measure, doesn't stack up very well with
the six L.A. Laker teams that won titles, or any of the other teams
that won titles in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't said as a rip on Shaquille O'Neal or any of his
teammates, or at architect Jerry West or construction chief Phil
Jackson. It's just a fact: The NBA at the dawn of a new century
mitigates against the development of great teams, like those Magic
Johnson-led Lakers and Larry Bird-led Celtics teams that fought
each other to the death and took home eight of ten titles in the
1980s, or the oppressive Celtics of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the biggest cultural change in the league's history.
Thanks to expansion to 29 teams, the blanding of the draft, the
salary cap and the raiding of college programs for immature talent,
it is increasingly difficult to mold a great team.
</P>
<P>
   The '00 Lakers have MVP O'Neal and a fast-maturing Bryant, but
this team didn't grow up together. O'Neal is an import, the biggest
free agent signing in the team's history, and Jerry West bamboozled
Charlotte into trading Bryant to the Lakers on draft day.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team are role players, three of whom were new to
the team this season -- Ron Harper, redux A.C. Green and Brian
Shaw. Glen Rice hasn't been the third star of the Laker
constellation nearly as much as anyone expected, and Harper and
Green are 36-year-old dinosaurs around for one last dance.
</P>
<P>
   The case can be made, in fact, that the Lakers had better
personnel 15 months ago, before the Eddie Jones-Glen Rice trade,
than they do now.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the late '70s, a time of too-rapid expansion and
off-court ailments that saw the title change hands annually between
teams with maybe one star player -- from Rick Barry's Warriors, to
Dave Cowens' Celts, to Bill Walton's Trail Blazers, to Elvin Hayes'
Bullets, to Gus Williams' SuperSonics -- the league's calling card
has always been its great teams.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Celtic epoch of the late '50s and '60s, when they won
11 titles between 1957 and 1969. The 1959-60-61 Celtics roster
featured seven future basketball Hall of Famers -- Bob Cousy, Tom
Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Frank Ramsey, Bill Russell and
Bill Sharman -- as well as Hall of Fame coach Red Auerbach.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that alternated titles in the early '70s were pretty
sensational, too. The 1970 and 1973 Knicks had Walt Frazier, Willis
Reed, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere, Dick Barnett and Jackson. In
1973, it added Earl Monroe and Jerry Lucas to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 Milwaukee Bucks featured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar
Robertson, and the 1972 Lakers had West, Wilt Chamberlain and Gail
Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem and Magic were the constants of the Lakers' five titles
in the '80s, but they had considerable help. Jamaal Wilkes was the
outside shooter in 1980 and 1982, Byron Scott in 1985-87-88. James
Worthy has as much to do with the three latter titles as anyone,
and there were always plenty of solid-to-superb forwards to help --
Bob McAdoo (1982, 1985), Kurt Rambis, Mitch Kupchak, A.C. Green,
Mychal Thompson. They also had defensive specialist Michael Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   If those Laker starting fives weren't the best since Russell's
Celtics, then it was Bird's Celtics of the same era. Two titles
were won with Bird, Dennis Johnson, and inside forces Robert Parish
and Kevin McHale. The 1981 team had Tiny Archibald and Cedric
Maxwell instead of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to lose the 1989 and 1990 Detroit Pistons between the
Celtics, Lakers and Bulls, but those two teams were also great,
with Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars outside and a lineup of
heavyweights inside, Bill Laimbeer, James Edwards, Rodman and Rick
Mahorn.
</P>
<P>
   And as dominant a figure as Jordan was, he wasn't playing by
himself during the '90s. The second Bulls title trilogy starred
Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Toni Kukoc at the three, a younger Harper
and Dennis Rodman before his self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bulls trilogy had more muscle inside with Horace
Grant, Bill Cartwright and Scott Williams. By today's standard of
centers, Cartwright now looks pretty studly, and Jackson always had
a handful of gunners available in B.J. Armstrong, John Paxson and
Craig Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   If the league is to overcome the retirement of Jordan and stop
the bleeding in the TV ratings and box office, it is going to have
to develop teams with dynasty-like qualities. Contrary to the
expansion nature of sports, success and interest comes when there's
something shiny to watch at its center -- the Yankees, the Lakers
and Celtics, the 49ers and Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq and Kobe have first crack at it. But the truth may be that
they'll need more help than they have right now if it's going to
happen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999-2000 LOS ANGELES LAKERS
</P>
<P>
   Regular season record: 67-15. Playoff record (to date): 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, center: One vote shy of becoming the NBA's
first unanimous MVP. Averages of 29.8 (points) and 16.7 (rebounds)
and an all-defense honoree.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, guard: Fulfilling all phases of his promise as an
impact player, who can make the 20-footer at the buzzer as well as
a clean block of a shot by 7-3 Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper, guard: A 36-year-old 14-year veteran who Phil
Jackson hired for his knowledge of the Triangle offense and work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green, forward: Lakers never expected the 36-year-old to
play as much as he has.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, forward: Hasn't come close to being the consistent
outside threat the Lakers expected when they traded Eddie Jones.
Spotty on defense, too.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Forward Robert Horry, who won two titles in Houston, is
having his best playoff series since becoming a Laker. Rick Fox,
Derek Fisher and Brian Shaw play at the whim of the coach. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1995-96 CHICAGO BULLS
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, guard: Averaged 30.4 enroute to ring number four
(of six).
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper, guard: Stats belie his contributions to the success
of the Triangle Offense.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen, forward: Averages of 19.4 points and 5.8
rebounds as Jordan's second in command.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc, forward: Filled important outside shooting role
(13.1 points per) that separates the second Bulls' trilogy from the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman, center: Averaged a stunning 14.8 rebounds a game
before becoming increasingly insufferable.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Luc Longley, James Edwards and Bill Wennington added
inside depth, and Steve Kerr the outside gun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1986-87 LOS ANGELES LAKERS
</P>
<P>
   Regular season record: 65-17. Playoff record: 15-4.

   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, center: Hall of Famer. Averaged 17.5 points
and 6.7 rebounds as hub of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson, guard: Hall of Famer. A great season with 23.9
points, 6.3 rebounds and 12.2 assists a game.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Scott, guard: Shooter extraordinaire who filled his role
beautifully. Averaged 17.0 points a game.

averaged 19.4 and 5.6.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green, forward: Worker bee in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Mychal Thompson and Kurt Rambis gave the Lakers great
inside depth. Michael Cooper was the league's best defender. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1985-86 BOSTON CELTICS
</P>
<P>
   Regular season record: 67-15. Playoff record: 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird, forward: Hall of Famer. Averaged 25.8 season, a
career high, to go with 9.8 boards per.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parish, center: A quiet, efficient inside killer, he
averaged 16.1 points and 9.5 rebounds a night.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McHale, forward: Mad man inside who gave no ground. Swears
he never committed a foul in his career. Averages of 21.3 and 8.1.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Johnson, guard: Still underrated. Boston's version of
James Worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Ainge, guard: Pest.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Playing on two bad feet, Hall of Famer Bill Walton gave
the Celtics 7.6 points and 6.8 rebounds a game. Scott Wedman and
Jerry Sichting also contributed. &QL;

but he averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds and 9.5 assists a game.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaal Wilkes, forward: Lakers sharpshooter from early years,
averaging 21.1 points per.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Nixon, guard: We've all kind of forgotten how good Nixon
was. Averaged 17.6 points and 7.9 assists a game.
</P>
<P>
   Bob McAdoo, forward: Hall of Famer. Day before Christmas trade
gave Lakers the inside force they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Mitch Kupchak and Rambis lent muscle inside. &QL;

SHAQ, KOBE ANSWER THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. - This could not have happened in Salt Lake City
in 1997. Could not have been done in the conference finals of 1998.
Not in San Antonio in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A Lakers comeback? On the road? In the most crucial game of the
playoffs? To turn the corner on a series? Are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers at last came of age Friday night - and there is an
undeniable feeling that they did - it was because for the first
time in the era of Shaq and Kobe, they found leadership from their
superstars when they needed it most. From beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   And because Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were able to move
their teammates - with their determination, with their aggression,
with their attitude and their poise (not to mention their 51
points) - they were able to pull the Lakers past the Portland Trail
Blazers for the dramatic 93-91 Game 3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Lakers, up 2-1, can take command of the Western
Conference finals with a victory today at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was real important to this team that they found
that niche, that they could operate - cooperate - together in a way
that lifted the spirits of this team,'' coach Phil Jackson said
Saturday. ``We had a lot of guys that helped out in other
situations .... So I think the confidence that they had or brought
to the team was what boosted the spirits of the rest of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Lakers always hoped O'Neal and Bryant could. This
is, after all, what any franchise expects from its stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing that all year,'' O'Neal said. ``And the
reserves came in and did a great job, too. (Derek) Fisher did an
excellent job. (Brian) Shaw, Robert Horry. If we can get play like
that from most of the team, then me and Kobe will take of the rest
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers' duo, in battling through their own growing
pains, tensions with one another and the inevitable maturing
process that accompanies failure, have only recently shown this
kind of on-court command.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, they didn't have the poise it took to fight
back from a 2-1 deficit to the Utah Jazz, and they fell 4-1 in the
conference semifinals. Two years ago, down 2-0 in the conference
finals to the Jazz, they lacked the heart to survive and fell 4-0.
It was an ugly repeat last year, when they fell 2-0 to the San
Antonio Spurs in the conference semis and were swept again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, having suffered an embarrassing 29-point rout at
Staples Center in Game 2, the Lakers let this series become a 1-1
tie. A loss Friday night, a 2-1 deficit, and the pattern would have
begun to materialize once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since we've been together, that we've
really had to lead a team together in the playoffs,'' Bryant said.
``And we were up to the challenge. We're not gonna let our
teammates down, we're not gonna let the fans down. We're gonna give
it our best. That's all we can expect for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what Bryant and O'Neal's teammates have come to rely on
this season. Veteran role players Robert Horry, Ron Harper and
Brian Shaw have made their contributions, and Glen Rice has
occasionally relieved some of the burden. But more often than not,
it's now Bryant and O'Neal doing what NBA legends do - making the
big plays at the biggest moments.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant did it explicitly, saying he ``wanted to send a message''
and delivering 14 points in the first quarter. O'Neal scored 18 in
the second half, and blocked two big shots in the fourth. Bryant,
of course, then blocked the potential game-tying attempt at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the way Kobe and Shaquille played at key
points in the game, they proved themselves able to step to another
level,'' said Rick Fox. ``And we'll need them to even go to another
place, whether it's Game 4, 5 or 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said winning games like this will only help O'Neal's
confidence after a long history of seeing his teams in Orlando and
L.A. get swept out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he really broke through a barrier,'' Jackson said.
``He had a weight on his shoulders, and he really came through.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson's mind, the Lakers have taken a major step toward
becoming championship material.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the road we hadn't shown that kind of muster, to bring it
back from a 10-point deficit. We'd done it (in the regular season),
but that's just not playoff basketball quite. In playoffs, it's a
little bit different, and we hadn't shown that. So that was a big
game and a big step for this team. I learned something, and they
learned something about themselves, and that's what I think is
really important.''

Astros make empty threat, bow to Braves
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Perhaps there were some among the Astros' fan base who missed the
point at the beginning of this homestand when Jeff Bagwell made the
astute assessment that it is not easy to lose games the way he and
his teammates have this season.
</P>
<P>
   We offer Saturday's 6-5 loss to the Atlanta Braves as exhibit
No. well, pick a number.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by a run in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Astros
loaded the bases against Braves closer John Rocker with nobody out.
Further tipping the scales in the Astros' favor, Daryle Ward was at
the plate against Kerry Ligtenberg with an extremely advantageous
3-0 count.
</P>
<P>
   In golf, this would be the equivalent of a gimmie putt. Somehow,
the Astros turned it into a triple-bogey, stranding all three
runners to lose for the 13th time in 14 one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough one to stomach,'' Astros third baseman Ken
Caminiti said. ``That's obviously a great situation to be in when
you're trying to pick up a run, but unfortunately, we weren't able
to get it done. It's just one of those things. We're battling right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Astros' biggest battle might have been with
themselves. Shane Reynolds had his worst outing of the season,
losing for the first time since Sept. 1, and the Astros didn't play
one of their better defensive games behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Astros banged out 10 hits, but they also
stranded 10 runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a really poor game,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``Our own mistakes cost us the game. If you make too many
mistakes against a team like the Braves, you're not going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing before the largest crowd (42,632) to watch at game at
Enron Field and for the first time during the regular season with
the retractable roof closed, the Astros failed in their fifth
attempt at extending a winning streak beyond two games. They have
lost nine of their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good feeling,'' Astros shortstop Bill Spiers said.
``We put two wins together, have the bases loaded with no outs in
the ninth, and we don't win. It's frustrating. I really thought we
were going to win this game. Unfortunately, things aren't going our
way. It's definitely not for a lack of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiers was the subject of the most talked-about play of the
game. He was on third base in the ninth when Ward scorched a line
drive, which was caught by Braves center fielder Andruw Jones.
Instead of staying on the bag and preparing to tag up, Spiers
cautiously made his way down the third-base line. By the time he
retreated to the bag, it was too late to attempt to score.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions differed regarding whether Spiers could have scored had
he remained on the bag until the ball was caught, but considering
the shallow depth at which Jones plays _ not to mention the
strength and accuracy of his arm _ the potential tying run was
hardly a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been close,'' Spiers said. ``I would have tried
if I had done the right thing and stayed on the bag. Daryle hit a
rocket, and I assumed it was going to fall in (for a hit). The
cardinal rule is that you can't ever assume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake, and it cost us. If the ball has any air
under it all, you have to go back to the base. It was a bad read on
my part, and I feel bad about. (Third base coach Mike) Cubbage said
he would have sent me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker thought the ball was deep enough to allow Spiers to
score had he stayed on the bag, but the former big-league pitcher
also added: ``It's hard for me to criticize baserunning. I didn't
do a lot of it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves opened the scoring in the first on Chipper Jones'
sacrifice fly, which brought home leadoff man Quilvio Veras, who
reached on a double.
</P>
<P>
   The run might have been prevented if Astros outfielder Moises
Alou had been able to hold Veras to a single, but Alou injured his
left quadriceps muscle on the play and wasn't able to get to the
ball quickly enough. He left the game in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them a run in the first,'' Dierker said. ``They held
Billy (Spiers) to a single on that same ball in the (bottom of the)
first. I'm not saying it's a play that should have been made, but
it was a play that could have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took a 3-0 lead on Andruw Jones' two-run homer in the
third, but the Astros narrowed the lead, scoring two in the bottom
of the third on Richard Hidalgo's single up the middle and a
fielder's-choice grounder by Lance Berkman. Hidalgo, who was
2-for-5, leads the club with 16 multi-hit games, and he's hitting
.500 (10-for-20) on the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan's sixth-inning solo homer increased the Braves'
lead to 4-2, and Chipper Jones' two-run shot ended Reynolds' outing
with one out in the eighth inning _ the deepest Reynolds has
pitched into a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do my job as far as keeping the game close,'' said
Reynolds, who allowed three homers Saturday after giving up just
one in his first 20 innings at Enron Field. ``The offense had to do
a lot every inning just to get us back in the game. It was just one
of those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter John Burkett, who is 4-0 with a 3.50 earned run
average over his last four starts, held the Astros to two runs in
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros pulled within a run on Caminiti's solo homer in the
seventh and a two-run shot in the eighth by Berkman, who tied a
career high with three RBIs. The Astros have hit at least one home
run in 14 consecutive games, tying a club record established last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman's homer would be the Astros' last hit despite their
ninth-inning rally, which consisted of three walks issued by
Rocker, including an intentional pass to Caminiti. After Ligtenberg
got Ward to line out to center, he coaxed a game-ending double-play
ball to third from Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for a fastball,'' Hidalgo said. ``I just hit it
right at somebody.''

Stars hold off Avalanche
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By SCOTT KAISER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ Before the start of the NHL Western Conference finals,
Dallas Stars goaltender Eddie Belfour said he was ``as good, if not
better'' than Avalanche counterpart Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   If the last two years mean anything, Belfour's right.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for a second straight year in the conference finals,
Belfour outdueled Roy by turning away 31 shots as the Stars
dominated early and then held on for a 3-2 win in Game 7 on
Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 17,001 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, Belfour and the Stars earned a chance to defend
their Stanley Cup championship against New Jersey in the finals,
which begin Tuesday in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think about the next series,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   A second straight championship would allow Belfour to match Roy
in Stanley Cup rings, which Roy won previously in Montreal (1993)
and Colorado (1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick's a great goaltender and I always love competing
against him,'' Belfour said. ``I'm not a cocky guy, but I'm
confident in my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Avalanche rallied with a pair of third-period goals,
the game wasn't decided until a shot by Ray Bourque from the point
deflected off Adam Deadmarsh's arm and bounced off the right post
with 12 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a little lucky at the end, but fortunately we were able
to hang on,'' Stars right wing Brett Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   The teams came into Game 7 having scored 11 goals apiece, but
the Stars' special teams basically won the game in the first 20
minutes. They scored two power-play goals and killed off two while
not allowing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cost us the game,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said.
``It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zubov made it 1-0 at 6:36 when he one-timed a pass from
Mike Modano through a crowd just past Roy's left skate. Then, after
the Stars twice neutralized the Avalanche's power play, Modano
scored with 5.5 seconds left. Modano had a great look at an open
net off a pass from Richard Matvichuk, but his weak shot off the
heel of his stick somehow slipped past Roy and barely got inside
the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck deflected off a D's stick (on the pass), but I still
tried to keep my eye on it,'' Modano said. ``At that point it seems
like it's all going in slow motion, but it somehow got by Roy's
shoulder. It was a little bit lucky, but it gave us a big boost
going into the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   For the series, the Stars' penalty-killing unit held the
Avalanche scoreless the final 17 times and allowed only three goals
in 33 opportunities. The two power-play goals in Game 7 gave them
six in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our special teams really got us going, especially tonight,''
Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who outshot the Avalanche 18-6 in the opening period,
kept the pressure on to open the second and scored again at 5:31.
This one was a bit of a gift as Derian Hatcher's wrist shot from
the point bounced off the back of Mike Keane and then off the leg
of a fallen Roman Lyashenko past Roy to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along that both teams were evenly matched and that
breaks would decide the series,'' Hartley said. ``We couldn't buy a
break tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche outshot the Stars 15-2 the remainder of the
period, but Belfour robbed Deadmarsh on a short-handed breakaway,
then came up big three times while the Stars were short-handed late
in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 30 minutes we were pretty dominant, but then we
started looking at the clock and hoping it would go by quicker,''
Modano said. ``When you do that, you start turning over the puck
and getting caught more in your zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg scored a short-handed goal at 5:25 and Milan
Hejduk followed with a deflection goal at 8:26 to give the
Avalanche new life, but Colorado could not finish off the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't start behind three goals,'' Deadmarsh said. ``We made
a game out of it, but it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock credited his team's playoff experience over the past
five years for pulling the Stars through this Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our passion and enthusiasm to compete tonight was the
difference,'' Hitchcock said. ``We weren't afraid to lose and we
beat a hell of hockey team.''

Sprewell lifts Knicks to win
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ Lost and found.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the New York Knicks in Game 3 of the
Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks not only had lost the first two games in the
best-of-seven series, but they also had lost starting center
Patrick Ewing to injury.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it looked like another loss was inevitable,
Latrell Sprewell found his long-lost fourth-quarter touch and as a
result, the Knicks again find themselves in this series after a
98-95 victory before 19,763 at Madison Square Garden. The win pulls
the Knicks to within 2-1 in the best-of-seven series that resumes
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And they can thank Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Just one game removed from what he called the worst playoff game
of his career, Sprewell scored nine of his 32 points in the fourth
quarter to lead the Knicks to the much-needed win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to keep attacking them,'' Sprewell said. ``I had to
stay confident because I knew how big this game was. We didn't want
to go down 3-0 to them (the Pacers). The big thing was that Larry
(Johnson), Allan (Houston) and I stepped up and made the plays
today when we needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   And did the Knicks ever need them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Ewing find himself sitting on the sidelines, unable
to play in this important game, but the Knicks also lost backup
center Marcus Camby with just under nine minutes left in the first
half after he sprained his right knee. An MRI revealed no ligament
tears, and the Knicks hope Camby and Ewing will be available for
Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing suffered the injury in the first quarter of Game 2 and has
not played since that game-starting seven-minute stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But just as they did last year, the Knicks took advantage by
opening up the offense, using Sprewell and Houston (28 points) to
slash to the basket or post up the Indiana guards.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward took advantage of the shifting Pacers defense,
finishing with 14 points and nine assists, outplaying Indiana's
Mark Jackson (three points, six assists and three turnovers).
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe our team has exceptional pride. I do,'' said New
York coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``We could have, subconsciously anyway,
had a little give-in after halftime (when the Pacers were up by a
point), but I thought we hung in there very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Pacers coach Larry Bird was frustrated by his
team's inability to put away a short-handed opponent. Frustrated,
but not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Pacers' lack of focus in key games) has worried me for
the last 2{ years, to tell you the truth,'' Bird said. ``I have
seen it happen before. I have seen them focus, come in and beat a
team when they have to, but this is a strange team. When their
backs are to the wall they seem to play better. They never make it
easy on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Indiana center Rik Smits, who was a huge
waste _ literally and figuratively _ in the second half. Minus
Ewing and Camby to deal with, The 7-4 center dominated in the first
half, scoring 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting, staking the Pacers to
a 42-41 lead. But he barely touched the ball in the second half,
getting only five shots to finish with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we should have went to him, especially at the start of
the third quarter,'' Reggie Miller said. ``I don't think we did a
good job of that, especially in the first six or seven minutes. We
should have rode him to the end, but we kind of went away from
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smits was hardly the only topic of postgame discussion in
the Pacers' locker room. Perhaps just as baffling was Bird benching
Dale Davis (16 rebounds Saturday, 48 in the series) and Miller down
the stretch. The benching of Davis (for the final 9:03) might have
been understandable given the Pacers needed outside shooting to
come back, but Miller has been known to knock down an outside shot
or two, especially in the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Reggie was a little bit too involved with (talking
to) the referees,'' said Bird of his decision to bench Miller for
the final 1:49. ``One time I thought he was going to get a
(technical foul), and I didn't want to end up with him getting
thrown out of the game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who finished with 19 points, was as abrupt when asked
about the benching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coach's call,'' he said. ``I'm not going to check
myself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he done that it would have amounted to perhaps the best
decision the Pacers made in the second half. In addition to
ignoring Smits, the Pacers turned the ball over nine times in the
second half, including a stretch of five turnovers in seven
possessions, allowing the Knicks to open a 71-64 lead.
</P>
<P>
   While it might seem the Pacers mounted a comeback, that was
hardly the case. Jalen Rose scored 22 of his 26 points in the final
period, but only because the Knicks were playing token defense on
him while swarming Miller and Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sprewell and Houston (eight fourth-quarter points)
were keeping the Knicks out of trouble _ and out of a 3-0 hole in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we really shouldn't have been in that position (down
2-0), but we were,'' Houston said. ``We dug ourselves a hole, and
the only way to get out of it was to win a game. You can't worry
about who's out. You have to do whatever you can to win the game.''

<P>
   &QL; 
Fifteen years ago, I was bucking for a better job and figured one
way to get it was to write about some kids whose dad was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The dead man was Robert James Lugiewicz, about whom I knew
nothing. I hadn't seen news reports about his death and didn't read
articles describing his killer's trial until just before the
sentencing _ after I'd decided one way to get a better job was to
write about a murdered man's kids.
</P>
<P>
   Lugiewicz was shot to death by William Norman Zingsheim, a
former police officer. Lugiewicz had been dating Zingsheim's
ex-wife, Lisa Steiner. On Feb. 4, 1985, Zingsheim broke into
Steiner's apartment and shot Steiner and Lugiewicz. She lived and
testified against her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the murder, Robert Lugiewicz had been divorced
from wife Sandi for three years.
</P>
<P>
   He was a good father, though, and had remained close to his
family. Sandi gave him a key to her home, and he spent a lot of
time there with their children _ Mike, Robert and Sabrina.
</P>
<P>
   I showed up one evening not long after Zingsheim, who was then
40, had been sentenced to 30 years in prison. Sandi thought it
would be good for her children to have their say with the press.
</P>
<P>
   The kids were 10, 11 and 12 at the time. Sabrina was the oldest.
She held a letter she'd written to the judge. Because she was
nervous and sad, her hands trembled. She couldn't stop them. The
paper shook in her hands like the mythical butterfly flapping its
wings in South America, sending a shudder in the air that
eventually becomes a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man has not only killed my dad,'' Sabrina read,
haltingly, ``but some of my future and a lot of my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   I was an idiot looking for a story who'd stumbled into a
tragedy. Waves from that quivering piece of paper have resonated in
me ever since.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Zingsheim (who changed his last name to
Johnson) managed to get his case reopened. Rather than go through
another trial, Sandi and her children agreed to a plea bargain that
reduced his sentence to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after all this time, Sandi Lugiewicz received a form letter
from the state Department of Corrections asking if she would like
to prevent Zingsheim/Johnson from writing to her at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to put it behind us,'' she says. ``But you can't.
Something always comes up. Some terrible reminder. I told the state
the only letter I want to receive about him is one saying he's
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, chances are the next official letter she receives, in
roughly four years, will inform her the killer is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine it,'' she says. ``Just the other day Sabrina
(who's getting married) talked about how she wished her dad were
around. That'll never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a long time to be in prison _ 20 years. Maybe it
is, if you're the one behind bars. But to the family of the victim,
it flies by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because the pain never leaves,'' Sandi says. ``The
reminders are constant. The wounds never heal.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't. Not for me. Not for Sandi.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the children of Robert James Lugiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   When the guy who killed their father walks out of prison a free
man, all three of them will be in their 30s, the age their dad was
when he was shot to death. &QL;

the only letter I want to receive about him is one saying he's
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, chances are the next official letter she receives, in
roughly four years, will inform her the killer is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine it,'' she says. ``Just the other day Sabrina
(who's getting married) talked about how she wished her dad were
around. That'll never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a long time to be in prison _ 20 years. Maybe it
is, if you're the one behind bars. But to the family of the victim,
it flies by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because the pain never leaves,'' Sandi says. ``The
reminders are constant. The wounds never heal.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't. Not for me. Not for Sandi.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the children of Robert James Lugiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   When the guy who killed their father walks out of prison a free
man, all three of them will be in their 30s, the age their dad was
when he was shot to death. &QL;

What's gone wrong with the Astros?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a three-year run of success unparalleled in the brief
history of the National League Central Division and a wondrous
collection of glory days that suddenly seem as distant a memory as
bell bottoms and eight-track tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the good-old days of 1997, 1998 and 1999 have given way
to these troubled times when the Astros find themselves trying to
shake the reality that they are among the worst teams in Major
League Baseball's 30-member fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   How did the Astros go from the euphoria of hanging division
banners year after year to the increasingly difficult exercise of
hanging onto their sanity night after night?
</P>
<P>
   A total collapse of a baseball team _ and yes, that is what has
happened to the Astros _ does not begin with a particular player or
a specific area of the team. It starts at the top, just as winning
does, filtering its way down the chain and ultimately manifesting
itself on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an attack on the Astros' braintrust of owner Drayton
McLane Jr., president Tal Smith, general manager Gerry Hunsicker
and manager Larry Dierker. Lest we forget, these are the same men
who helped transform the Astros from a mediocre team to one of the
elite franchises in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But management has to bear its share of responsibility for what
this team has become. While the Astros have never been among the
biggest spenders in baseball, they have managed to be successful in
an era when dollars often translate into victories.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps a drop-off was to be expected when the Astros trimmed
their payroll in the offseason. McLane and Co. aren't stupid; they
had to know the 2000 Astros were not as talented as the clubs they
have put on the field over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the hope was that they could remain competitive while
reducing payroll and that Hunsicker _ the 1998 Major League
Executive of the Year _ could catch lightning in a bottle with a
few of his acquisitions, as he has done so many times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that hasn't happened, leading many to wonder if the
Astros would have been better off keeping free-agents-to-be Mike
Hampton, Carl Everett and Derek Bell, all of whom were traded
during the offseason because the Astros didn't want to risk the
possibility of losing them without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   However, keeping the 1999 club intact would have cost at least
$65 million, which is out of the question for a club that still
considers itself a mid-market franchise, even with a new
revenue-producing park.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are no guarantees in the go-for-it approach.
Remember, the Astros tried that in 1998 when they traded three
quality prospects to Seattle for ace pitcher Randy Johnson and
still didn't get past the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Carlos Guillen look good
in the Astros' new brick, black and sand colors?
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros might still be struggling had they not decided
to begin their transition period this season, it's doubtful they
would have sunk this low. Hampton was their best pitcher in 1999.
Everett was arguably the best overall player on the team, and while
last season was a down year for Bell, he always has been a
dangerous hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss those guys big-time,'' Astros righthander Jose Lima
said. ``Those guys were a big part of this team and a big reason we
won the division for three years in a row. You can't help but miss
them. But we still have enough talent on this team to be doing
better than we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another factor in the collapse. The Astros
have been fortunate to have key players have career years, from
Darryl Kile winning 19 games in 1997 to Moises Alou having a Most
Valuable Player-caliber season in 1998 to Lima winning a
career-high 21 games in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of the key players are on pace for career-worst years.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have guessed that Lima, who won 37 games in 1998 and
1999, would drop seven of his first eight decisions in 2000? Or how
about Billy Wagner blowing six of his first 10 save opportunities
after converting 39 of 42 chances in 1999 en route to the NL
Fireman of the Year award?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of crazy,'' Lima said. ``I can't explain what's
going on with this ballclub. Last year, when I pitched well, we
won. I'm not saying the team is struggling because I'm not pitching
well, but it's a big difference. I have to do better, and we have
to do better as a team. I believe we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how realistic that expectation is remains a subject of
debate. Three of the Astros' five starting pitchers entered the
season with less than two full seasons in the majors. Two of three
starting outfielders had less than two years' experience as
every-day players, and the primary shortstop and catcher became
every-day players for the first time in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with players such as Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Moises
Alou, Ken Caminiti and Shane Reynolds, the Astros didn't foresee
the hard times that awaited them in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past being disappointed,'' Hunsicker said. ``I'm angry.
I'm puzzled more than anything else, because this is a good
baseball team. Yeah, we've got some weaknesses. But we've got a
good team, and for whatever reason, these guys haven't clicked
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros could benefit from another proven starting pitcher _
someone along the lines of Mike Mussina or Brad Radke, although
neither is likely to be available in a deal until the July 31
trading deadline nears.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen also is in need of at least one more arm, but the
alternatives at Class AAA New Orleans don't figure to be an
improvement over what the Astros already have.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop is a question mark, and the outfield defense has left
something to be desired. While the offense has been better lately,
it still tends to run hot-and-cold, and that's an inconsistency
this team can ill afford. But for now, what you see is what you
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you have multiple leaks, it's a bigger
challenge,'' Hunsicker said. ``It's not just one area, it's the
entire club. We just need to start playing up to our capabilities,
and the rest of it will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club does not need a major overhaul. A lot of these
players are the same players who have won championships the last
three years. There are a lot of reasons for why we are where we
are, but it's not because we don't have talent. We just need to go
out and play our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the only measure of improvement that matters is
victories, and if they don't start to occur with more frequency,
then what? Although the season is only two months old, it's not
totally premature to consider the possibility of breaking up the
team.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros are still struggling when the trading deadline
approaches, there will be many contending teams inquiring about the
availability of their playoff-tested veterans.
</P>
<P>
   One of those players almost certainly would be Bagwell, who is
under contract through 2001 and will be the Astros' top priority
this offseason, assuming he's still on the club.
</P>
<P>
   It may become crucial that the Astros determine their intentions
regarding Bagwell between now and the trading deadline. If they
believe they will be able to re-sign him, perhaps it's in the
club's best interest to trade Daryle Ward.
</P>
<P>
   If they come to the conclusion they can't sign Bagwell, the
Astros might be best served to trade the four-time All-Star and
begin to rebuild around their young nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all speculation,'' Bagwell said. ``I'm sure that's not
going to happen real soon, but if it does, that's the
organization's decision. I'm almost 100 percent positive that's not
on their agenda at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play a lot better. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best sign of how poorly the Astros have played is
their 1-13 record in one-run games. Simply put, good teams find a
way to win the close ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could very easily be 14-0 in those one-run games, and no
one would be saying a thing about anything,'' shortstop Tim Bogar
said. ``I don't know if there's an answer to it. You can't just
look at one aspect of a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of talent in this clubhouse. If you look at this
team, we shouldn't be losing. I don't know if there's an answer.
Losing is just as contagious as winning. When you're losing and
going through a funk, it's easy to say, `What's going to happen
next?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think that's what we have here. I think guys are
playing their hearts out. Everyone here knows we're a good team.
It's just a matter of getting some confidence, and the only way you
get confidence is to start winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning has a way of masking problems, just as losing has a way
of shining a magnifying glass on things. There is a certain amount
of tension in every big-league clubhouse, and the Astros' is no
different.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems have been low-keyed over the past few years
because the team was busy winning division titles. If the losing
continues, it will be interesting to see if the Astros remain a
harmonious bunch, from the manager to the coaches to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stick together, it's going to be fine,'' Lima said.
``But I hope we don't hate each other by the end of the year,
because it's getting to a point where it's kind of scary. It can't
get worse. The good thing is that we're not 20 games out. We're not
out of this thing, but if we keep losing, we're in trouble.''

Victory by de Ferran gives Penske No. 100
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NAZARETH, Pa. _ Three years without a victory and nine months of
tragedy and change are all behind Roger Penske now.
</P>
<P>
   The long elusive 100th victory for the winningest team owner in
CART history came at his home track Saturday when Gil de Ferran won
the Bosch Grand Prix at the Nazareth Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first oval-track victory for de Ferran, who joined
Marlboro Team Penske this season, replacing Al Unser Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea how happy I am,'' said de Ferran, who was
choking back tears in Victory Lane. ``It has so much meaning to me
that it's hard to put into words. This is a great day in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Gugelmin was second in the Nextel Mercedes/Reynard,
.815 seconds behind de Ferran in the Marlboro Honda/Reynard. Kenny
Brack, the 1999 Indianapolis 500 winner, finished third in the
Shell Ford/Reynard.
</P>
<P>
   But the day belonged to the Penske team, which finally got to
pull out and wear the caps that had ``100'' on the front. The team
was ecstatic with the win after going through so much
disappointment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important win for us,'' Penske said. ``There
have been a lot of great victories, but this is the greatest one at
the moment. It's great to see that we can be competitive again and
get back in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the first victory for Penske since May 24, 1997,
when Paul Tracy took the checkered flag at Gateway International
Raceway outside of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 season was a disaster for the Marlboro cars. The
team was hopelessly noncompetitive and it was obvious that Unser
and Penske's long relationship was ending.
</P>
<P>
   But two deaths also marred the 1999 season for the team. Rookie
driver Gonzalo Rodriguez was killed in an accident in practice at
Monterey, Calif. in September.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Moore, who signed with Penske along with de Ferran last
July as the new drivers for 2000, was killed in California in the
final race of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a year I want to forget,'' Penske said. ``I knew
what I had to do. It was time to level the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Penske hired Helio Castroneves to replace Moore, but Penske also
knew it would take major changes to the cars if his team was going
to regain it's past glory.
</P>
<P>
   The team switched from its own chassis to a Reynard chassis,
switched engines from Mercedes to Honda, and changed from Goodyear
to Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our ups and downs,'' Penske said. ``But we've been
able to put the right combination together.''
</P>
<P>
   De Ferran, 32, has been the key component. The Brazilian had
three top-10 finishes this season before his victory Saturday, and
he also put his car on the pole at Miami and Long Beach. The Bosch
Grand Prix was the fourth victory of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing with Roger was very big deal for me,'' said de Ferran,
who received a three-year deal worth $10 million. ``That was the
first step and today we took another one. A lot of great drivers
have worn the same overalls I have on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser, Bobby Unser, Mario Andretti, Rick Mears, Danny
Sullivan, Emerson Fittipaldi and Mark Donohue are some of the
winning drivers who have been with Penske over the years. The first
victory came in 1971 at Pocono, Pa., by Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 victories include a record 10 wins at the Indy 500, a
place where Marlboro Team Penske has not competed since the split
with the Indy Racing League in 1996.

Indianapolis 500 field bolstered with CART additions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Everyone who should be here isn't here, which is
the way it has been for the last five years at the Indianapolis
500.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most important people in racing have put the
feuding behind them and are back to compete in the historic event
for the first time in half a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr., whose family accomplishments of nine victories at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is part of racing lore, is back to
continue a storied tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Walker, one of the most respected team owners in
Indy-car racing, has returned with a splash _ a 19-year-old driver
named Sarah Fisher, who has the talent to be winner.
</P>
<P>
   With Lyn St. James also in the field, the starting grid will
have two women for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   And the pride organization of the Championship Auto Racing Teams
circuit _ the league that has boycotted the Brickyard in a bitter
civil war with the Indy Racing League _ has returned.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Ganassi and Team Target, with the last four CART
championships in tow, are back at Indy with drivers Juan Montoya
and Jimmy Vasser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being here has been a bit of an absence in my racing
life,'' said Vasser, who competed in four Indy 500s before the
split. ``This is still the biggest race in the world and I'm happy
to be back. This race is the reason I wanted to become a race
driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi has spent close to $2 million to purchase the cars, the
engines and the crew he needed to take part in the 84th running of
the race.
</P>
<P>
   With the rescheduled CART race at Nazareth, Pa., Saturday coming
on the heels of a race in Japan last week, it turned out to be even
more of an undertaking than the Target team expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put a lot of effort into this and we've asked a lot of
our people,'' Ganassi said. ``I really appreciate their hard work.
I don't think anybody can imagine the logistics of racing in Japan,
then back here, over to Pennsylvania and back to Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people on opposite sides of the CART-IRL squabble will view
this race as a chance to compare the best drivers of the two
open-wheel leagues. But Ganassi and his drivers have refused to get
into that type of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy and I aren't here to show whether CART is better,''
Montoya said. ``We just came here to have fun and try to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, the defending CART champion, is a rookie at Indy, but
he will start on the front row today, right next to defending IRL
champion and pole-winner Greg Ray.
</P>
<P>
   That will add even more drama to the start of the race, but
Vasser said all the differences won't matter once the green flag
drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just racing,'' Vasser said. ``CART opened a window on the
schedule this year and Chip asked us if we wanted to run Indy. We
all said yes. We had the resources to do it and we wanted to race.
It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as flying any CART flags or making a political
statement, it's not like that for me. I don't feel like I'm
representing the CART guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the split are long and complex, but the divide
started in 1996 when Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony
George founded the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   George believed costs needed to be controlled, oval-track racing
needed to be emphasized and something needed to be done to give
up-and-coming drivers a chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Worthy goals, but George infuriated CART owners in 1996 when he
insisted that the first 25 spots on the Indy 500 grid would be
guaranteed to IRL drivers. That rule has long since been abolished,
but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   The two leagues, which now use different chassis and engines,
came close to a reconciliation last fall, but George broke off the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Any type of merger seems unlikely now, but the hope is that both
leagues eventually will run together at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be back because there's magic in this place,''
Walker said. ``But it doesn't seem quite as dramatic as it once
was. The atmosphere is not quite as intense.''

HEAT, EARLY PACE COMBINE TO PRODUCE OLYMPIC HEARTBREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The day was hot. The stakes were cherished.
</P>
<P>
   The early pace, as America's best triathlete came to realize,
was enough to break a woman's heart.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Barb Lindquist of Jackson Hole, Wyo., was
supposed to race to the finish line yesterday with her spot on the
U.S. Olympic team secured and her head held high. The latest world
rankings listed Lindquist as fifth _ first among the U.S. female
triathletes.
</P>
<P>
   At the most recent world championships in Perth, Australia, the
30-year-old Lindquist had finished a highly respectable fourth.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone was expected to be on the victory stand at the U.S.
Olympic triathlon trials, it was Lindquist _ the national champion
and one-time almost-Olympian swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the long minutes after yesterday's race, Lindquist
remained on her back in the event's first-aid tent, while medics
pumped fluids into her limp, exhausted body.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the race, which determined the remaining two women's
triathlon spots on the U.S. Olympic team, Lindquist sat quietly and
tried to reflect on what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hot and also humid,'' she began. ``It became
kind of hard to breathe. I wasn't feeling stellar or anything
today.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed surprised, though, when Lindquist and eventual
winner Sheila Taormina emerged from the opening event, the
1,500-meter (nine-tenths of a mile) swim, with nearly a full
minute's lead. Lindquist, a Stanford teammate of Janet Evans, had
reached the finals in three events at the 1988 U.S. Olympic
swimming trials.
</P>
<P>
   But in yesterday's 40-kilometer (24.8 miles) bike ride,
Lindquist and Taormina had boldly stretched their lead, expanding
the anxiety behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The margin became three minutes _ and growing _ and former SMU
swimmer Laura Reback recalled, ``We were saying, `So, guys, are we
just going to give this race to those two girls? What on earth is
this _ three minutes?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lindquist explained later, ``I've been in plenty of races where
I've gone out as hard, so I know I didn't work the bike too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have done anything differently. That's way I race.
I work from the front.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Lindquist concluded the first of three laps of the
10-kilometer (6.2 miles) run course, it was clear that something
was wrong. The temperature was rising. Lindquist had dramatically
fallen 50 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lap became a blur. ``I knew my body just wasn't
there,'' she said. ``My core was too hot. My legs got the
wobbles.''
</P>
<P>
   On the steep downhill at Goodson Drive, Joanna Zeiger passed an
obviously struggling Lindquist and moved into second place.
Lindquist mumbled a few words of encouragement _ she doesn't
remember _ to Zeiger, ran a few more steps and heard her husband
Loren shout, ``It's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a race like this,'' she said, ``third is last.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the leaders ran on in this first-ever U.S. Olympic
triathlon trials for women. For Taormina, it would be a stunning
affirmation of her decision to take up the sport after winning a
swimming relay gold medal at the 1996 Olympics. On a whim, she had
first tried a triathlon in her native Michigan in the summer of
1998. The race director, Lew Kidder, saw her obvious talent and
offered to be her personal coach.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of '99, she overcame a crippling bout with
rhabdomyolysis, a rare muscle disorder that can affect the liver.
Taormina doesn't know how she got it. Emergency room personnel more
commonly see the condition in burn victims and people who've been
crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiger's story, on the other hand, was her quest. Three times
previously she had tried to make a U.S. Olympic team. She had come
up short at both the 1988 and 1992 swimming trials, and at the
Olympic marathon trials this past February, she had finished 30th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whole life everybody talks about the Olympics,'' her
mother, Karen, said, fighting back tears. ``It seems like such an
unrealistic dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wondering, `How many Olympic trials can you go to and
not make it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Down the final stretch, Taormina smiled and slapped hands with
spectators that lined O'Connor Road. The only thing that broke her
smile later was when someone mentioned her partner for most of the
day, Lindquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything makes me cry, that will,'' Taormina said through
moistening eyes. ``It's because I almost feel like I don't deserve
to make this. I just hope her and Karen Smyers know how admired
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet room of the event's headquarters hotel, Lindquist,
too, tried to search for the day's consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that I have a strong faith,'' she said.
``Otherwise, I'd be extremely devastated now. I have trust that he
has a bigger plan for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Barb Lindquist said, she has no plans yet to try for the
2004 Olympics.

FORCE-COIL BOND IS TITLE-RUN TOUGH IN NHRA FUNNY CARS

<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ John Force admits there are few things that he
can teach Austin Coil.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing Force can teach his crew chief of 15 years has
nothing to do with racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told him he made it big time when I saw the big house
with the swimming pool and saw matching Dobermans sitting there at
the pool,'' Force said. ``I said `Coil, let's go swimming.' That is
when he told me he couldn't swim. I said, `You are the smartest man
on the face of the earth and you can't swim.' It might be the only
thing in the world I could ever teach you.''
</P>
<P>
   Coil, 54, may not know how to swim, but when it comes to setting
up Funny Cars for Force, there is no better. And the numbers prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   Coil, always with a toothpick in his mouth, has been with Force
through all nine of his National Hot Rod Association Funny Car
championships and 84 national event victories.
</P>
<P>
   Force, who drives the Castrol GTX Ford Mustang, can tie Bob
Glidden's record for national event victories with a victory during
today's final eliminations at the Castrol Nationals at the Texas
Motorplex.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as though Coil has given Force a good chance. Force
earned the No. 1 qualifying position for the 95th time in his
career, with a time of 4.872 seconds for a top speed of 319.71 mph
on the all-concrete quarter-mile drag strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Force's electric personality and success continues to draw
media attention and more fans, Coil continues to ply his trade as
co-crew chief for drag racing's top star in relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to be all right with Coil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been one to stand up and smile, and I guess what
I work for is the respect of my peers,'' said Coil, who is a native
of Chicago but lives in California. ``I think I have gotten that,
and it makes me feel good. The old saying is I'm as famous as I
want to be, now I just want to be rich.''
</P>
<P>
   When Force called Coil in 1985 to offer him a job, Coil already
had winning credentials and more than 20 years in the drag-racing
business. He was part of the ``Chi-Town Huster'' Funny Car team
driven by Frank Hawley that won NHRA Funny Car titles in 1982 and
1983.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of 1984, the major sponsor on the team left and
Hawley went on to start his drag-racing school. That is when Force
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say he made me a deal I couldn't refuse,''
Coil said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some lean times in the early years at John Force
Racing, both admit. But once things started rolling, they did not
seem to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Force won his first Funny Car title in 1990, and 1992 is the
only year in the '90s that he did not win a title. Coil said
winning is just as much fun today as it was when Force won his
first national event in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Force and Coil have seen John Force Racing grow into a company
of more than 30 employees, along with Force's hiring Bernie
Fedderly and John Medlen to help with tuning duties on Force's car
and Tony Pedregon's machine.
</P>
<P>
   Force said there have been some arguments between the two
through the years, but they've always been resolved. Force talks
with reverence about Coil's intelligence and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to use a word I don't use often ... the man is
brilliant,'' Force said. ``As good as he is, he always listens and
comes to us and says `I'm in trouble. Help me.' That takes a lot. A
lot of guys would stay lost and would not let anybody know they are
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Coil has seen Force win races and survive crunching wrecks, and
he wonders how Force continues to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Like in 1992 at Memphis, when Force's car hit the wall and
disintegrated and Force said he saw ``Elvis at 1,000 feet.'' After
that wreck, Coil was wondering if he would be working next week on
the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took John to the hospital, and I thought this is getting
out of hand here and I would not blame him if he came back and said
we can't try this hard because I don't want to die,'' Coil said.
``Instead, he said I will find the money to build more cars. I'll
wear two fire suits if I need to. It's been pretty good ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   The two will probably be together as long as Force continues to
thrill crowds with his trademark long burnouts and his ability to
win races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten into such a ritual that we don't have to talk a
lot,'' Force said. ``He was the turning point, along with Castrol's
money. I've always said when Coil's had enough, I've had enough. In
the heat of battle, who is your life about? Your crew chief and
your money. I could not have what I have without \RCoil\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Force can repay him with that long-awaited swimming
lesson.

RANGERS' COOL-DOWN CONTINUES IN LOSS TO TWINS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ An impressive streak came to an end for the
Rangers last night. For the first time in May, the Rangers are
going to lose a series.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins assured the Rangers of that when they
pounded Mark Clark for seven runs in 4 1/3 innings and went on to a
10-5 victory at the Metrodome last night. Ruben Mateo's two-run
homer in the third had given the Rangers a 4-1 lead before the
Twins scored four in the fourth and two in the fifth off Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the second consecutive for the Twins in the
three-game series, which ends this afternoon. The Rangers had won
six consecutive three-game series and split a four-game series with
the Anaheim Angels since losing two of three to the Baltimore
Orioles on April 28-30.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, at 16-8, still have the best record in baseball for
the month of May, but they have lost three of four since their
seven-game winning streak and, more curiously, they've lost four of
five to the Twins this season. The Rangers were 12-0 against the
Twins last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at how we've played lately, it's disappointing,''
Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton said. ``But as hot as we were,
sometimes you hit a cool spell. If we win tomorrow, though, we can
get back to our winning ways, then go to Detroit and still salvage
a pretty good road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the Rangers' sometimes fifth starter, is trying to
salvage his spot in the rotation but admitted last night's
performance didn't help much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying too hard,'' said Clark after making his first
start since May 16. ``I want to be perfect and get back in the
rotation, but I've got to throw better than I did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark did nothing to change manager Johnny Oates' mind about
using Thursday's day off to skip him in his next start. The Rangers
don't need a fifth starter until June 5 against the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Oates said Clark is still likely to make that start, but
he didn't rule out other options, such as trying Matt Perisho or
bringing back Doug Davis from the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to visit with a couple of people in the next few
days,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clark, Oates said, ``I just wish he'd get deeper in the
ballgame. He has his good innings, but it just seems like he runs
into trouble in the fourth or fifth inning for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was fine through three innings, allowing only a
second-inning home run to Midre Cummings. But he fell apart in the
fourth, and much of it was his own doing.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer started the inning with a single to left, then Clark
proceeded to load the bases by walking Cummings and Butch Huskey.
That didn't thrill the manager, especially considering Clark was
ahead 1-2 on Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make him swing the bat, in my mind,'' Oates
said. ``You've got to make him hit the ball. We pitched ourselves
in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie followed with a three-run triple to right-center,
and Matt LeCroy singled to left, giving the Twins a 5-4 lead. Clark
got out of that inning without further damage, but Huskey ended his
night with a two-run double with one out in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from the first two innings where I throwing the ball
good and everything was working to struggling to throw the ball
down the middle,'' Clark said. ``I started trying to make pitches
they couldn't hit instead of keeping the ball down and let them hit
ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Twins pitcher Joe Mays hung around for 62/3 innings to get the
victory, but he was fortunate he didn't get knocked out faster than
Clark. He escaped a one-out bases loaded jam in the first by
allowing just one run and kept the Rangers from scoring in the
second after giving up a leadoff triple to Clayton.

SORE-ARMED GATORS PITCHER HELPS SENDS BAYLOR TO EARLY EXIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In the seventh inning, Florida coach Andy Lopez
began the trip out to the mound to retrieve his pitcher, Jeff
Cardozo. The Gators had the lead, and Cardozo had a sore arm. Time
for a little relief, Lopez figured.
</P>
<P>
   He was met by a team revolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the position players gathered around Jeff, and told me to
let him finish it,'' Lopez said. ``I was kind of outvoted. When I
got back to the dugout, the guys on the bench told me the same
thing. So I guess it was 25-1.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, with a No. 5 national ranking, Baylor's season ended at
the hands of a young man who has pitched the season with the
knowledge that he probably has a torn rotator cuff. Cardozo (6-2)
threw 138 pitches, finishing the game and the top-seeded Bears
(45-17), who were eliminated from the NCAA regional tournament in a
10-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination game between Florida and Southwest Texas,
scheduled for last night, was postponed after a 2-hour, 35-minute
rain delay. The Gators and Bobcats are scheduled to play at 1 p.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest disappointment,'' said Baylor coach Steve Smith,
``is that I know we're a better club than we've shown here. And I
know our players wish they could have gone out leaving their best
game on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Smith expressed satisfaction with a season in
which the Bears won a Big 12 title despite having to replace the
``heart and soul'' of last year's 50-win team, including national
player of the year Jason Jennings. Of this season's 25-man team, 17
are freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have performed a miracle this year,'' Smith said. ``But
pitching and defense got us here, not hitting, and we didn't have
it today. They got a gutty performance from their pitcher, who has
had arm problems, and you just have to say, hats off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators (42-22-1) also recovered their hitting stroke,
driving Baylor's Kyle Evans (11-2) from the mound in the seventh
and finishing it with four runs against reliever Kyle Edens. First
baseman Kurt Keene had a two-run homer, and catcher Tony Socarras
hit his 19th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the big lift came from Cardozo, who came to Lopez with an
offer after the team lost its closer and top two starters to Tommy
John surgery early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shoulder was hurt, but he said, `I can pitch for you every
Saturday, but I can't do bullpen or anything in between,''' Lopez
said. ``His shoulder was aching, but he wanted to help the team. So
he pitches on the weekends and doesn't pick up a ball in between.
I've never had anyone like him, not even on the national
championship team (1992) at Pepperdine.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his injury, Cardozo said, ``It's in my shoulder and
I'm pretty sure it's torn ... but I don't understand all the
technical stuff. It hurts the most when I'm warming up, then it
doesn't bother me for a while. It comes back about the fifth or
sixth inning \Rwhich is usually when he goes out\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always there, and it's something I have to deal with ...
but it doesn't hurt on every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Bears, who were shut out Friday by Blake Williams of
Southwest Texas State and managed only one run off Cardozo
yesterday, this was a tournament in which every pitch hurt.

BRUCE ALLEN BARELY MAKES FIELD IN PRO STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen felt as though he
and his Reher-Morrison team were behind for most of this weekend at
the NHRA Castrol Nationals at the Texas Motorplex.
</P>
<P>
   But despite feeling as though they were behind, Allen's run of
7.049 seconds in yesterday's first qualifying session was enough to
get him into the 16-car Pro Stock field at the National Hot Rod
Association event.
</P>
<P>
   His time dropped from No. 13 to No. 16 by the end of yesterday's
final session, but the time withstood several challenges and was
good enough to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, of Arlington, will face No. 1 qualifier Kurt Johnson in
the first round of today's final eliminations in his Reher-Morrison
Pontiac Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   The final day of the four-day event at the all-concrete
quarter-mile drag strip concludes today, with eliminations
scheduled to start at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out of the groove a little bit \Ron the last run of the
day\S, and we just knew we did not make a very good run,'' Allen
said. ``We were just lucky to stay in. The time we had \Rin the
first session yesterday\S was pretty good _ it was just slow _ and
we were in the process of trying to do some things to make it go
faster \Rin the second run\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the team got behind when he was not able to complete
his first qualifying run Friday. He said he noticed a miss in the
engine and was forced to shut it down, and the team was not able to
receive any data.
Important spot Gary Scelzi made one clean run during two rounds of
qualifying for this weekend's event, and that came Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But his time of 4.577 seconds and a top speed of 322.81 mph
stood through two qualifying sessions yesterday, even though Scelzi
lost traction in both runs. The two-time Top Fuel champion said
that conditions during the second qualifying session yesterday
could be similar to today's final eliminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tricky,'' said Scelzi, who drives the Winston
Dragster tuned by Alan Johnson. ``The first round starts at 10
a.m., and that may be the best the track is going to be all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi's first-round matchup with Dallas resident Don Lampus
could be his most important run of the day. If he wins, he will
earn 60 points, 20 for advancing past the first round and 40 for
receiving the bye into the semifinals. Quick field Today's 16-car
Funny Car field is the quickest in NHRA history. John Force had the
quickest elapsed time of 4.872, with No. 16 qualifier Al Hofmann
running a 5.050 to barely get in the field. The longtime rivals
will square off in today's first round.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Bazemore also ran a 4.872 in yesterday's first session, but
Force's speed of 319.71 mph was close to 9 mph faster than
Bazemore's run of 310.34. Hammonds misses Tom Hammonds, a power
forward for the Minnesota Timberwolves, did not qualify for today's
Pro Stock final eliminations. Hammonds improved on each of his
qualifying runs, coming up with a time of 7.094 seconds, his best
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But to get into the field, Hammonds would have had to run 7.060
or better to get in.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second race of the season for Hammonds, who
attempted to qualify for last weekend's event in his
Winnebago/Itasca Camaro Z28. He will run in 13 NHRA national events
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds has run in the NHRA Pro Stock class for 41/2 years and
said when he retires he plans to run the series full time.

SEVENTH WONDER: STARS OUTLAST AVALANCHE FOR CUP BERTH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DALLAS _ Fear swept through Stars captain Derian Hatcher's body.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe 20 seconds separated the Stars from a second consecutive
trip to the Stanley Cup Finals and a chance to defend last season's
championship. Only Colorado wouldn't go away. The Avalanche kept
coming and coming while Dallas clung to a one-goal lead with 12
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado defenseman Ray Bourque attempted to erase 59 minutes
and 48 seconds of Dallas dominance with a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was a shot coming from the point so I tried to
position my body,'' Stars goalie Ed Belfour said. ``I think it hit
me in the hip and ricocheted to the post. It was like slow motion
watching it go toward the post.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot dinged off the post and into the corner, preserving the
Stars' 3-2 victory in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals. The
victory sends the Stars to New Jersey, needing to beat the Devils
for back-to-back Cups. They need four more victories and get their
first chance in Game 1 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say the Stars don't know how close they came to
not having the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' Hatcher said of the final 80 seconds. ``You
don't want to be in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars nearly coughed up a 3-0 lead. The Avs had pulled their
goalie. The desperation was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with this season's Stars, you wouldn't expect
anything less than a down-to-the-last-second affair. Certainly not
between these teams. For the second consecutive season, the Avs and
Stars required seven games to decide on a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the best team in the league for beer sales,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We make you stay right to the end. We
are unbelievable. Our season has been about surviving and about
finding a way, maneuvering to wins.''
</P>
<P>
   After Avs forward Milan Hejduk scored at 8:26 of the third
period to slice Dallas' lead to 3-2, the game became maneuvering
like mad. The final 11 minutes and 34 seconds of Game 7 were one
really long penalty kill for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was ever going to end,'' said Stars
defenseman Richard Matvichuk, who played despite suffering a mild
concussion in Game 6. ``I looked at the clock, there was 11 minutes
left, and what is it now, 3 a.m. I think? That's how it felt. I
didn't think it was ever going to end. Unfortunately, all playoffs
and all regular season we've had to make it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting? The game looked like it was going to be a
suspenseless, put-it-in-the-books affair after the first period.
The Stars didn't just beat the Avs in the first 20 minutes. They
embarrassed them.
</P>
<P>
   They buried them with offense, including a 18-6 shot
differential. When the opening 20 minutes were complete, the Stars
had a 2-0 lead with both goals coming on power plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our special teams tonight really got us going,'' Stars center
Mike Modano said. ``It was a big goal by Zubie, and, our second
goal, I think really settled us into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov simply finished what had been a
better-than-anything-they-could've-hoped-for first power play. The
Stars had six shots, the last by Zubov beating Avs goalie Patrick
Roy at 6:36 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The second shot Modano spoke of was his own, a power-play blast
with 5.5 seconds remaining in the first period that bounced off
Roy's glove, hit the post and gave the Stars a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also smothered them defensively. Not only couldn't the
Avs generate anything five-on-five, they struggled with a man
advantage, too. They not only didn't score on either of their
first-period power plays, they didn't get a shot on either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to leave the game out there,'' Hatcher said.
``Game 6 was left out there, and they got the win. We didn't want
that to happen. We wanted to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy everybody in Dallas wanted suspended for his Game 6
elbow that left Matvichuk and what turned out to be winning goal,
hit his stick.
</P>
<P>
   The shot had an even-more-indirect path than one that went off
Avs forward Chris Drury's knee to win Game 6. Hatcher took a shot
from the point that hit Andreychuk's stick, bounced off Mike
Keane's butt onto Roman Lyashenko's calf and finally over Roy's
shoulder at 5:31 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went of my butt and then Roman's butt, I believe,'' Keane
said. ``I don't think it gets any more uglier unless it goes off
his face.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal gave the Stars a 3-0 lead which they held until 5:25 of
the third period. The Avs had finally started to generate some
offense, but their first goal came as they were killing a penalty.
With his goal, Avs forward Peter Forsberg seemed to be saying
``we're not going down easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When two teams are evenly matched, it's never easy,'' Stars
general manager Bob Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   From 8:26 of the third period on, there certainly was nothing
easy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who outshot the Avs for most of the game, were caught
and subsequently passed in the third period. The difference once
again was Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't mean to antagonize Roy with his statement that
he was ``as good as Patrick or better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Patrick is a great goaltender, and I always enjoy
playing against him,'' Belfour said. ``I'm not a cocky guy, but I'm
confident in my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are, too. He stopped 31 of 33 Colorado shots and 191
of 204 in this seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   His Game 7 performance was simply the icing on the cake. He's
4-0 now when a series goes to a seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience in Game 7 really showed,'' Hitchcock said. ``We
lost to Edmonton \Rin 1997\S, and we learned some lessons. We were
nervous, and we played afraid to lose. We vowed as a team and an
organization if we ever got in those things again we would just
throw everything we could, passion and emotion and everything, at
it to win, and if we got beat we got beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was playing with not afraid to win and that's what we
played tonight. We weren't afraid to win.''
</P>
<P>
   No, exactly what they did. The West has been won. The Cup
awaits. The Stars say they aren't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more important than winning the Cup for this
team,'' Keane said. ``If we didn't get here, the whole year would
be a washout. ... You want to win the Cup. They want to win it. We
don't want to give it up.''

HOCKEY'S GODS WINKED AT STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The puck hit the post, and the Cup doesn't hit the
road. Not yet anyway. Maybe not ever.
</P>
<P>
   To see was to believe last night. Believe that the Stars' 3-2,
Game 7 survival against Colorado had to be a sign from the hockey
gods that the Stanley Cup is extending its local lease for another
year, if not beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Those final frantic seconds at Reunion Arena left no doubt that,
as advertised, almost nothing separated the two combatants in the
NHL's Western Conference Finals. But in the end, there was
something.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nothing became the post that stands on the right side of
Eddie Belfour. Quick, before the New Jersey Devils get to town _
somebody better bronze that thing. Better yet, get Tom Hicks to
spring for a gold-plating.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fun Game 7 for a while. The ``Ed-die's Better'' chant
aimed at Patty Roy was a nice twist. The Reunion house can be
excused for celebrating prematurely as the Stars did indeed appear
to be traveling Easy Street to the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But just as everyone was absolutely certain the Avalanche could
never recover from a 3-0, third-period burial, this series suddenly
reverted to form and substance. Game 7, like the rest of the
series, became too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The ``wall of noise'' created by 17,001 throats never lost
velocity, but in the final 30 seconds of uncertainty, lungs were
drained of air and hearts tumbled into stomachs. About that time,
Ray Bourque took his shot from the point. This one will be
remembered for a while in both Denver and North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There were strange goals scored in the series _ the game-winner
for the Avs in Game 6 off Chris Drury's knee. What turned out to be
the game-winner in this Game 7 was a deflection off the butt of
Mike Keane to the leg of Roman Lyashenko to the back of the net
behind a stunned Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's shot, with 12 seconds to play, found a body part of
Adam Deadmarsh (he thought it was his arm), who was trying to hold
his ice in that battleground known as the slot. The puck shot off
Deadmarsh, headed toward net, except it caught Belfour's hip, then
took an agonizing turn toward the corner of the Avs' promised land.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour could do nothing except watch. Watching was the hard
part. ``Everything became slow motion,'' he said. ``I knew it was
gonna be tight. And then it hit the post.''
</P>
<P>
   And from there, the puck took a crazy Stars' bounce, and was
cleared, allowing a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, where
beating the Devils will be expected by everyone, including Las
Vegas. Hockey-wise, the Stars will be heavily favored to repeat as
champions and build the foundation of a dynasty in the
Chicken-fried Kingdom. And not even the emotional drain of this
series with the Avalanche will be allowed as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you lucky?'' came a media interview question aimed at Ken
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as hard as we work,'' shot back Hitch, not appreciating
the question. ``We've been lucky for three years \Rthree Western
Conference Finals appearances\S and we've got rings to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, in the end last night, luck was involved. The puck hitting
the post is the same as a smile and a wink from the hockey gods.
But no matter which team won this series, it would take luck. The
Avs had it in Game 6 with that puck off Drury's knee.
</P>
<P>
   Luck is not a factor, however, in the Avalanche never scoring
more than two goals in any of the seven games. That's all about
Belfour, all about supreme penalty killing, all about the defensive
commitment Hitchcock beats daily into his players. They cuss him
for it, sometimes out loud. But they win with it, and they survived
this series with it.
</P>
<P>
   And that was not luck in the first period last night, when as
Colorado coach Bob Hartley, stating the obvious, said, ``the game
was won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored twice on power plays. The Avs didn't come close
to scoring on two power plays of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also an emotional fury from the Stars in that
first period like nothing ever witnessed, hockey-wise, in these
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the best since I've been here,'' Hitchcock said.
``We've never played a period like that. We wanted to create a
sense of urgency and passion _ we wanted to throw so much at them,
they couldn't handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars did. The Avs couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   And then Hitchcock added something else. The coach, and his
staff, deserved no credit for it. ``What was seen in the first
period, that came from our team leaders, and we have nine players
who form the leadership for us,'' Hitchcock said. ``The coaches
asked those nine players to make this pre-game point to the entire
team. What was seen was the team's response to the team leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such an impressive opening display, the Avs would not go
away without a pride-surge of their own. A puck hitting the post
had to finally decide Game 7. And maybe decide that the Cup stays
put.

DEFENSEMEN LEAD STARS BACK TO FINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk was feeling a little
dizzy last night. It had nothing to do with the concussion he had
in Game 6. It had everything to do with a return to the Stanley Cup
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights after seeing stars, Matvichuk had helped the Stars
win the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The headaches were there, but it's a Game 7, and I wasn't
going to miss it,'' said Matvichuk, who had an assist in the Stars'
3-2 victory. ``You'd have to take out my heart and cut off one of
my legs for me to miss that.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year, everybody's bumped up and injured. You
see one guy on either side of the ice that doesn't have an ice bag
on, there's something wrong. That's playoff hockey. It's the
healthiest survive, and defense wins championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk was knocked out on a hit by Dave Andreychuk in the
first period Thursday, and the Avalanche scored two goals after
that for a 2-1 victory. Matvichuk showed up for Game 7, and the
Avalanche disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series began, Matvichuk and his defensive partner,
Derian Hatcher, had talked about containing Peter Forsberg.
Instead, they stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg had two goals, three assists and 24 shots in the
series. Second-line center Joe Sakic had even less impact, with no
goals, three assists and 24 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a key to our success this series,'' Matvichuk said.
``... Peter and Joe are probably two of the best players in the
league, and they're playing with guys like Adam Deadmarsh and
\RMilan\S Hejduk and guys like that who are very skilled. We know
where they want to go, which is the front of our net. Fortunately,
we did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' defensemen have Dallas playing for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk, Hatcher, Darryl Sydor, Dave Manson, Sergei Zubov and
Sylvain Cote were the Stars' sixth sense. Besides helping limit the
Avs to 13 goals on 204 shots in the series, the defensemen had the
Stars' special teams make a special delivery: the Campbell Bowl for
winning the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were 6-for-29 on the power play in the series,
including 2-for-4 last night.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov scored a power-play goal and had an assist on center Mike
Modano's power-play goal. Sydor had an assist, and Hatcher had an
assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play really came through when we needed it,'' Sydor
said. ``We had two big goals. We just wanted to get pucks to the
net and some traffic, and they went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' penalty killers held the Avs to 3-for-33 on the power
play for the series, including 0-for-3 with only four shots last
night. Colorado did not score on the power play in its last 18
chances. (The Avs did score a short-handed goal last night.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our special teams did a great job,'' Hatcher said. ``Our power
play outdid their power play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' defensemen outdid the Avalanche defensemen, which is
why Matvichuk, despite a headache and stitches above his left eye,
was feeling pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a lot,'' Matvichuk said. ``This is something guys
always dream about.''

DISAPPOINTED BOURQUE HOPES FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For the past 21 years, Ray Bourque has seen only
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Colorado looking for a chance to win his first
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   With seconds remaining in last night's Western Conference Final,
he had his chance.
</P>
<P>
   With about 12 seconds remaining, Bourque sent a shot from the
point that teammate Adam Deadmarsh deflected. The puck slipped past
Eddie Belfour and rebounded off the post.
</P>
<P>
   The team was different. The frustration the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it. But I heard it hit the post,'' Bourque said.
``I was trying to get closer to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Bourque's chance was gone for another year.
</P>
<P>
   But his night was not all frustrating. The veteran assisted on
Chris Drury's goal in the third period that pulled the Avs to
within striking distance, at 3-2. He posted just two shots, but
both were good scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an opportunity to play in seven games in the
semifinals,'' Bourque said. ``It was a great experience, a great
ride. We had a good run but we came out short of what we wanted to
accomplish. Anything less than the Cup is not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointment, Bourque said he plans to play again
next year and continue his quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed Denver and I am definitely interested in coming
back,'' he said. ``I'm pretty sure I am coming back somewhere next
year. It was a joy to play in Denver, so we'll wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's missed chance may have hurt his teammates even more,
especially Dave Andreychuk, who came to Colorado with Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real bad for \RRay\S, but he'll get another chance,''
Andreychuk said. ``We all know him, and he deserves better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointment, Bourque said he loved the experience
of playing with the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do over, I'd do it in a heartbeat,'' Bourque said.
``I am very happy with the decision I made. When I got traded I
wanted to make the playoffs. I really thought we had a good enough
team to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Bourque will have to look for his next chance.

STARS, DEVILS LOOKING TO ERASE `BORING' TAG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The purists will go to their graves swearing both teams
long ago sold their souls to hockey's devil: Neutral zone traps,
smothering defenses, grinding, mucking, grabbing, clutching.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL instituted the mandatory helmet rule two decades ago in
anticipation for the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals between the Stars and
the New Jersey Devils, two of the toughest, hardest hitting teams
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jersey is a lot similar to our hockey team,'' said Stars
winger Kirk Muller, who spent seven seasons with the Devils. ``They
are going to plug along and grind it out. It's going to be two
similar teams plugging along and waiting for an opportunity. We
have to play well defensively again, and it's going to be a tough
series.''
</P>
<P>
   The puck drops Tuesday night at Continental Arena in East
Rutherford, N.J., where the Devils are 5-3 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, be wary of the experts and pundits who will surely
label the styles of both teams and the ensuing series as boring or
tedious or as much of an eyesore as watching the NBA's New York
Knicks battle the Miami Heat series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they told us last year, too, that Dallas and
Buffalo was a boring series,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk
said. ``We played in it, and you can ask us, ask our fans, ask
Buffalo and their fans. If that's boring, I'd hate to see
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils and Stars do play the similar, tight-checking style.
They do clog the neutral zone. They do put a premium on defense
first, scoring second. It is a battle of big, bad defensemen.
Richard Matvichuk and Derian Hatcher patrol the Stars' zone.
Hard-nosed Devils defenseman Scott Stevens, as Eric Lindros found
out Friday night, will attack and do it with unforgiving force from
anywhere on the rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what it is,'' Matvichuk said. ``You don't want
to be coming down the middle with your head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams also feature two of the league's top goaltenders.
Eddie Belfour dispatched Colorado's Patrick Roy for a second
consecutive season. Now, he faces New Jersey's Martin Brodeur, who
owns the playoffs' best goals-against average of 1.77 and held the
Flyers to one goal in Games 5, 6 and 7 as the Devils rallied from a
3-1 deficit. Belfour is right behind at 1.80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's solid, and he gets better and better as it goes on
here,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``He's a real focused
goalie right now. He has another tough challenge ahead of him in
Brodeur, so it will be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this series gets bogged down as an ugly defensive series,
a few offensive facts are pertinent. Entering the series, the
Devils and Stars have combined for 89 playoff goals in 17 games.
The Devils have scored more goals in the playoffs than anyone with
46. The Stars have scored 43 and lead all playoff teams with 16
different players contributing goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars roll out Mike Modano and Brett Hull on their top line.
The Devils match with 24-year-old sensation Patrick Elias, who had
two goals in their Game 7 victory against Philadelphia, and Jason
Arnott. The Stars have playmakers like Nieuwendyk and Jamie
Langenbrunner. The Devils have Petr Sykora and Claude Lemieux. The
Stars have rookie Brenden Morrow. The Devils have
rookie-of-the-year Scott Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks New Jersey has a real tight defensive team,
but they have an awful lot of skill up front, too, and they can zip
that puck around,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``They are a very good team.''

   DALLAS_ Reunion Arena crowds don't often agree on cheers for
anything other than goals or dot races.
</P>
<P>
   But when a few fans began chanting ``Eddie's Better,'' the the
rest of the 17,001 fans quickly agreed and thunderously roared in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I definitely could hear that,'' Stars goalie Ed Belfour
said. ``It might be better until they wait till the last minute,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, especially after Ray Bourque's shot bounced off Adam
Deadmarsh and hit the post with 12 seconds remaining, ensuring the
Stars' 3-2 Game 7 victory in the Western Conference Finals at
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Close shots aside, for the second consecutive season Belfour
proved that he is as good, if not better, than Colorado goalie
Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was far from Eddie to come off sounding cocky,'' Stars
winger Mike Keane said. ``He just wanted the same status as
Patrick. Patrick is a world-class goalie. For Eddie to be not in
the same breath as Patrick ... maybe people might start talking
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little choice now.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who improved his record in Game 7s to 4-0, outplayed
his celebrated counterpart during the game and throughout the
series. By defeating Roy for the second consecutive season, Belfour
also evened his personal playoff record against Roy to 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Patrick is a great goaltender, and I always enjoy
playing against him,'' Belfour said. ``I think we're both great
goaltenders. I am not a cocky guy, but I am confident in my
ability.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Belfour stopped 31 of 33 shots. Roy stopped 26 of 29
attempts. For the series, however, Belfour stopped 191 of 204 shots
and Roy stopped 156 of 170 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie made great saves one after the other and allowed us to
be in every single game,'' Stars center Mike Modano said.
``Everyone talked about him and Roy coming into this series, and it
was going to be who played better was going to be the team that was
going to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, Eddie was the better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite allowing two third-period goals in a span of 3 minutes
and 1 second, including Milan Hejduk's redirect shot that bounced
through his legs, Belfour's play last night encapsulated his effort
in the series: dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were putting it in, and he was putting it right back out
and killing the momentum,'' Colorado forward Dave Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour killed Colorado's momentum all series. He never allowed
more than two goals in any of the seven games and hasn't in eight
consecutive games dating back to Game 4 of the series against San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   In his past 31 postseason games, Belfour has allowed three or
more goals six times.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Avs, Belfour was 3-1 in one-goal games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series, there is no seventh game without Eddie Belfour,''
ESPN analyst Bill Clement said. ``Two times, maybe three, Dallas
doesn't win without Belfour.''
</P>
<P>
   So, this finally proves that Belfour is as good as, if not
better, than Roy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Clement said, ``if the Stars win the Stanley
Cup. If he does, it puts an exclamation point on it.''

ANGELS LOSE IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- It's not often a left fielder and a first
baseman converge on the same pop fly in foul territory, but that's
what happened Saturday night in the game between the Angels and
Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   It also happened to be the final play of the game, as the
Royals' Carlos Beltran tagged from third and scored when Angels
first baseman Mo Vaughn caught Joe Randa's popup near the
photographers' well just beyond the first-base dugout. Beltran's
run gave the Royals a 6-5, 10-inning win before 30,024 Kauffman
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hesitated before throwing home, allowing Beltran to score
without a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to wheel and make a bad throw if he wasn't
going,'' Vaughn explained. ``I was going toward the stands and
because of the angle I couldn't get in good position to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in America knew the play was at home. But the only
reason I didn't come up firing was I couldn't see the catcher
clearly and didn't want to overthrow it. It happens like that
sometimes, like you're in no-man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad was brought in from left field to be a fifth
infielder when the Royals loaded the bases with nobody out. He
played on the shortstop's side of second base when Jorge Fabregas
grounded into a force play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been a double play, but pitcher Eric Weaver's
throw home was high, forcing catcher Bengie Molina to making a
leaping catch and giving him time only to record the out at home.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad then moved to the second baseman's side of second when
Randa hit the popup. Erstad sprinted toward the stands and was in a
position to make a play and might have had a better angle for a
throw home. But Vaughn beat him to it, and it was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking if Mo Vaughn caught the ball I would go home,''
Beltran said. ``If Erstad caught the ball I was staying, because he
might be more aware of what's going on. I think I surprised Vaughn.
He caught the ball and was off-balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said he never even saw Vaughn until he made the catch, so
he didn't think about calling Vaughn off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played second base too much,'' Erstad said. ``I'll
put that one in the bank. ... You see a different play every day,
don't you? Holy cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could have avoided the wild 10th inning had closer
Troy Percival been able to save the 5-3 lead they took into the
bottom of the ninth. Scott Pose led off the inning with a single to
left and Dave McCarty followed with a pinch-hit, two-run homer to
tie the game at 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best I've felt all year,'' said Percival, who
leads the league with 14 saves but has two blown saves in the past
four games. ``I missed on the pitch (to McCarty) pretty bad. I was
trying to go down and away and went right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals have won in their final at-bat 12 times this season,
matching last season's total. But Angels manager Mike Scioscia
wouldn't blame the loss on the final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some breakdowns tonight,'' he said. ``The play to
Weaver, he makes nine times out of 10. That's a double-play ball.
When you don't execute that, you open the door for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was routine,'' Weaver said. ``I could go out there and do
it again nine more times and I hit (Molina) in the chest. I had all
the time in the world and didn't make the throw. There are no
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Bottenfield gave up only three runs and four
hits, but tired quickly and lasted only five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's two-run homer (No. 8) in the second gave the Angels a
2-0 lead. The Royals took a 3-2 lead in the third, but the Angels
scored three times in the eighth inning, the final two runs scoring
on Molina's two-out single for a 5-3 lead. Molina had three of the
Angels' nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left some runners on base early in the game,'' Scioscia
said. ``It came back to haunt us. It's a shame we couldn't finish
this one off.''

GALAXY SETTLES FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- With more than a third of the season gone, and more
than a third of its original starters sent elsewhere, the dominant
Galaxy team that left preseason camp and cruised through March and
April with a 5-0-2 mark -- is looking more and more average each
passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Against San Jose, the second worst team in the MLS, the Galaxy
could only manage a 1-1 draw in front of 17,831 at the Rose Bowl on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's record moved to 6-1-6, but they are 1-1-4 in their
last six matches. San Jose is now 2-6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid warned this could happen, and has
mentioned countless times that the Galaxy may as well start the
season over again with so many recent changes.
</P>
<P>
   With the allocation of newly acquired Mexican striker Luis
Hernandez, the Galaxy is feeling the loss of departed starters
Clint Mathis, Roy Myers and Joey Franchino -- all lost in the
Hernandez fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are spread:
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Rookie central defender Danny Califf is getting
baptized while Robin Fraser recovers from a strained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Striker Cobi Jones hasn't scored since April 1, and the
Galaxy has only six goals in their last six games after scoring 15
goals in their first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Hernandez, touted as MLS' franchise player, is without
a goal in two games and may need two or three more weeks untill he
is finally in sync with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   What else, or does there need to be anything else? Oh, the U.S.
Cup begins next week. The Galaxy loses Fraser, Jones and Greg
Vanney to the U.S. team while Hernandez joins Mexico for the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At least Schmid has until September to sort this out.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy struck first.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the penalty arc, Simon Elliott picked up an errant
clear by San Jose defender Mauricio Solis. Elliott didn't waste any
time, firing a return shot to the upper-right netting to give the
Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the 22nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   The play started down the left-side as Vanney sent a pass across
the field for Jones. Jones picked the ball out of the air, cutting
inside to lose Earthquakes defender Wade Barrett. Jones attempted a
cross in the middle, but Solis cleared it away straight to Elliott,
who notched his second goal of the season from 20-yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, thin in the back with the loss of Fraser and Ezra
Hendrickson (yellow-card accumulation), looked confused on a
set-play that evened the match, 1-1, in the 30th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Off an innocent looking pass from the right side, Iranian
striker Khodadad Azizi sent a looping cross over the middle for
Ronald Cerritos -- with no Galaxy defender in sight. Cerritos had
his choice of spots, finishing with a header to the right of
Hartman for his fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Elliott bursted down the left-side, sending a cross to
Hernandez, who was sneaking near the back post. Hernandez timed his
shot, but his one-touch shot off a bounce sailed high over the goal
in the 11th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthquakes nearly scored on an ensuing counter. Cerritos
took a through pass from Azizi. He was all alone to the right of
the goal, but Hartman protected the near post as Cerritos' shot
sailed off Hartman's leg and out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   (Notes) The Galaxy signed midfield Ivan Polic, a native of
Kraljevo, Yugoslavia, as a discovery player.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old midfielder trained with the Galaxy during
preseason. After losing Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino and Roy Myers
to acquire Hernandez, the Galaxy had a roster spot available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited to add Ivan because he is a player that already
has experience overseas and is technically a very confident
player,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``With the number of
players we lost in the Hernandez acquisition, one of our needs is
another central midfielder and that's something Ivan can rectify
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Polic was naturalized in 1995, meaning he does not count as a
foreign player. He last played for Radnicki Nis of the Yugoslavian
first division and was a four-year letterman at Southern Methodist.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just minutes after developer Steve Ellman announced that hockey
superstar Wayne Gretzky would join the new Phoenix Coyotes
ownership team, the phone started ringing with $1 million offers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen investors, local and out of state, called late
Friday night and expressed interest in a possible financial share
in the franchise, Ellman told The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night calls came after Ellman corralled Gretzky with an
all-day sales pitch at Gretzky's Southern California home. If
Gretzky had turned down Ellman's eleventh-hour overture, the
Phoenix Coyotes likely would be taking their sticks and pucks to
Portland where Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was waiting with his
billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, all we were focused on was keeping
hockey in Arizona,'' said Ellman, who would not disclose names of
the potential investors. ``That's what it came down to. Truly, I
have slept less than 24 hours in the last seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cox Communications spokesman said Gretzky's involvement could
spark renewed interest from Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we're very excited that the Coyotes will be
staying in Phoenix,'' Cox spokesman Alex Horwitz said. ``Cox has
always had a solid relationship with the Coyotes. We hope to
continue that relationship down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Gretzky, Ellman would not have put down a
non-refundable, $10 million payment as the crucial first
installment of an $87 million purchase of the Coyotes. Ellman
enticed Gretzky to help save hockey in the Valley, outwitting a
half-dozen other teams who were trying to woo the hockey legend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ellman secured a deal with the NHL that will give him
more time to raise cash and complete the purchase. Ellman will have
to pay $6.5 million instead of $17 million to former Coyotes owner
Richard Burke by June 30. The NHL will give Ellman until Dec. 31 to
pay off Burke and complete his $100 million fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And Ellman is banking on his business savvy and financial acumen
to whittle down operating losses at America West Arena while he
builds an 18,000-seat arena at Los Arcos Mall in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   By raising $100 million, Ellman says, he can wipe out Burke's
interest payments on a $60 million loan, limit red ink and save
money. Ellman is predicting that his cost-cutting measures will
limit annual losses to $8 million a year. The team now loses about
$13 million to $15 million a year because 23 percent of the seats
at America West Arena have obstructed views for hockey, Burke has
said.
</P>
<P>
   The future of professional hockey in the Valley was hanging by a
thread Friday. Recurring rumors swarmed talk radio with word of the
Coyotes' exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman didn't hear the blather. On Friday, he hopped an early
flight to Los Angeles. Then, he spent all day at Gretzky's Thousand
Oaks home before he persuaded him to come to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne and I have believed all along that keeping hockey in the
Valley was the right thing to do for Arizona, our community and our
children,'' Ellman told The Republic. ``This is a pledge to
Scottsdale voters that we're go ing to build Los Arcos and com mit
to the revitalization plan for south Scottsdale.'' &QL;

RAY OF HOPE EXTINGUISHED

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ray Bourque followed his heart, left Boston on a quest,
and Saturday &UR;  &LR; night his lifelong passion sifted ever lower in the
hourglass.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars, taking advantage of a lackluster early effort
by Colorado, rolled up a 3-0 lead by the second period and hung on,
surviving a Bourque shot that rang off the left post with 12
seconds to go, for a 3-2 victory in Game 7 of the Western Confernce
finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, defending NHL champs, will face the New Jersey Devils
in the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals, which begin Tuesday night
in East Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought we had a good enough team to get there,''
said Bourque, after his 21st NHL season ended like all the others,
without his name etched into hockey's holy chalice. ``It was a
great experience, a great ride. I only wish it had turned out
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Bourque, who will take advantage of unrestricted
free agency for the first time in his career July 1, reiterated his
desire to play at least one more season. He said, as he has for
weeks, that Denver would be high on the list of clubs he would like
to play for, but he's wise enough to know handicapping contract
negotiations is pure folly.
</P>
<P>
   All he knew when he left Reunion Arena Saturday &UR;  &LR; night was that
he wants to play again, somewhere, and that he was happy for the
11-week odyssey that led him from a dying vine in Boston to a vista
of endless possibilities in the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do it again, in a heartbeat,'' said Bourque, swapped to
the Avalanche at the March trading deadline, a deal he prompted by
asking Boston management to send him to a potential Cup winner.
``I'm happy with the decision,'' he said. ``I was looking for an
opportunity _ to make the playoffs, to have a good run. We had that
here, but it just wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Bourque's steady hand behind their blue line, the
Avalanche couldn't suppress the stronger, faster Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado was down by three goals when Peter Forsberg, set up by
Chris Drury, finally broke Ed Belfour's shutout bid with 5:25 gone
in the third. Just over three minutes later, Drury sent a pass up
to Bourque at the blue line and the former Bruins captain belted a
slapper that was deflected in by Milan Hejduk to cut the deficit to
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was a game, a microcosm of that last chance Bourque
was seeking when he bolted Boston. The Avalanche were within a goal
with 11:34 remaining in regulation, plenty of time to get even and
perhaps use overtime as a springboard to a date with the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't to be. Time whittled away. With 1:20 to go, the
Avalanche pulled Patrick Roy for an extra man. Over the course of
four faceoffs in the final 80 seconds, the Avalanche generated two
great chances to tie it, both delivered by Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   First, with 21.2 seconds to go, Bourque fired in a 45-footer
from the high slot. The shot was deflected on the way in, and the
puck was still live when the referees blew it down. Nine seconds
after the draw, with 12 seconds to go, Bourque's long-range wrister
was deflected in the slot by Adam Deadmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it,'' said Belfour, a top candidate for playoff MVP.
``It was all happening in slow motion. It got by me and hit the
post.''
</P>
<P>
   It hit the left post, about a foot above the ice, and caromed
out. The building went into a frenzy. The Stars were on their way
to the finals, a round that Bourque has reached only twice (1988
and '90).
</P>
<P>
   The lasting image for the Avalanche had to be their poor start.
They gave up a pair of power-play goals in the first period, to
Sergei Zubov and Mike Modano, the latter with six seconds to go.
Former Bruin Dave Andreychuk cost his team dearly by taking a dumb
penalty with 16 seconds left in the period with an elbow to Darryl
Sydor's head. It took the Stars but 10 seconds to knock one in for
the 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche were still flat when they came out for the second.
Only 5:31 in, Roman Lyashenko got the last deflection of a Derian
Hatcher shot from up high. It was 3-0. All but over.
</P>
<P>
   One more time. The seasons come. The seasons go. And Ray Bourque
goes on, a constant. He dared himself to leave, to try something
new, and he said it was all worth it. No matter how it ended.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just minutes after developer Steve Ellman announced that hockey
superstar Wayne Gretzky would join the new Phoenix Coyotes
ownership team, the phone started ringing with $1 million offers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen investors, local and out of state, called late
Friday night and expressed interest in a possible financial share
in the franchise, Ellman told The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night calls came after Ellman corralled Gretzky with an
all-day sales pitch at Gretzky's Southern California home. If
Gretzky had turned down Ellman's eleventh-hour overture, the
Phoenix Coyotes likely would be taking their sticks and pucks to
Portland where Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was waiting with his
billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, all we were focused on was keeping
hockey in Arizona,'' said Ellman, who would not disclose names of
the potential investors. ``That's what it came down to. Truly, I
have slept less than 24 hours in the last seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cox Communications spokesman said Gretzky's involvement could
spark renewed interest from Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we're very excited that the Coyotes will be
staying in Phoenix,'' Cox spokesman Alex Horwitz said. ``Cox has
always had a solid relationship with the Coyotes. We hope to
continue that relationship down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Gretzky, Ellman would not have put down a
non-refundable, $10 million payment as the crucial first
installment of an $87 million purchase of the Coyotes. Ellman
enticed Gretzky to help save hockey in the Valley, outwitting a
half-dozen other teams who were trying to woo the hockey legend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ellman secured a deal with the NHL that will give him
more time to raise cash and complete the purchase. Ellman will have
to pay $6.5 million instead of $17 million to former Coyotes owner
Richard Burke by June 30. The NHL will give Ellman until Dec. 31 to
pay off Burke and complete his $100 million fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And Ellman is banking on his business savvy and financial acumen
to whittle down operating losses at America West Arena while he
builds an 18,000-seat arena at Los Arcos Mall in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   By raising $100 million, Ellman says, he can wipe out Burke's
interest payments on a $60 million loan, limit red ink and save
money. Ellman is predicting that his cost-cutting measures will
limit annual losses to $8 million a year. The team now loses about
$13 million to $15 million a year because 23 percent of the seats
at America West Arena have obstructed views for hockey, Burke has
said.
</P>
<P>
   The future of professional hockey in the Valley was hanging by a
thread Friday. Recurring rumors swarmed talk radio with word of the
Coyotes' exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman didn't hear the blather. On Friday, he hopped an early
flight to Los Angeles. Then, he spent all day at Gretzky's Thousand
Oaks home before he persuaded him to come to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne and I have believed all along that keeping hockey in the
Valley was the right thing to do for Arizona, our community and our
children,'' Ellman told The Republic. ``This is a pledge to
Scottsdale voters that we're going to build Los Arcos and commit to
the revitalization plan for south Scottsdale.'' &QL;

DREIFORT CAN'T STOP PHILLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been two steps forward, one step back for
Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort for much of this young season, and
Saturday night brought another halt to what had been Dreifort's
steady progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies, led by light-hitting shortstop Desi
Relaford, blasted Dreifort for six runs in three innings and
overcame a pair of two-run doubles by Eric Karros to beat the
Dodgers 7-6 in front of 33,967 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss hurt the Dodgers on two levels. Third baseman Adrian
Beltre strained his right hamstring running out a ground ball in
the sixth inning. Beltre will be evaluated again today.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (3-2), just three starts removed from a two-hit shutout
May 12 against St. Louis, offered few positives against the
Phillies, one of baseball's weakest-hitting teams.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford, the Phillies' No. 8 hitter who entered the game with
12 RBI in 37 games, hit a three-run home run in the second and a
two-run single in the third. Dreifort struck out five but left the
game after the third having allowed six runs on six hits and three
walks.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was all the more disappointing considering
Dreifort has displayed flashes of dominance this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed two runs in eight innings in a no-decision
Monday against Cincinnati and had not lost since his first start of
the season, when he walked eight in a 2-1 loss to the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander had control problems again Saturday, and he
frequently fell behind batters. Relaford's home run came on a 3-2
pitch that was left over the middle of the plate, but by that point
Dreifort was already in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit a two-run double off the top of the left-field wall
in the first for a short-lived 2-0 Dodgers lead against
Philadelphia starter Robert Person (5-2).
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell led off the second with a home run. Rob Ducey walked
on five pitches and Kevin Jordan blooped a single into right field
to set up Relaford's blast to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort struck out Person and Bobby Abreu to help end the
inning but was finished off in the third, when Burrell walked,
Ducey singled and Relaford lined the first pitch he faced up the
middle to score both runners.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges relieved Dreifort to begin the fourth and fared
better, although not without some anxious moments. Herges threw
three shutout innings but allowed six baserunners (two hits, three
walks, one error).
</P>
<P>
   Herges had runners on second and third with one out n the sixth,
but Mike Lieberthal struck out, and a strong pickoff throw to
second by Todd Hundley allowed the Dodgers to tag out Doug
Glanville in a rundown between third base and home.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers started strong and seemed as though they might
maintain the torrid offensive output of Friday's 11-4 victory. Mark
Grudzielanek singled in the first inning, and with two outs Shawn
Green hit a ground-round double tor right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Karros lined a 2-2 pitch to left field, and for the second
consecutive night Karros was a few inches from a home run. This
ball didn't go off the top of the fence, as Friday night's appeared
to, but hit the padding just below. Grudzielanek and Green scored
easily for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got back in the game in the fifth inning as Karros
struck again. Todd Hollandsworth led off with a single and Gary
Sheffield walked. The runners advanced on a wild pitch and scored
when Karros doubled to the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pulled to 6-5 on Hundley's two-out, bases-loaded
infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Person left after the fifth and threw 110 pitches. He allowed
six hits, struck out eight, walked three and stranded six Dodger
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1:05 p.m., at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net 2; 1150-AM, KWKW-AM (1330 Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Carlos Perez (4-2, 5.74 ERA) must be feeling more
secure about his spot in the Dodgers' starting rotation, not just
because Orel Hershiser was sent to the minors Friday but also
because Perez has won four of his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is 7-3 with a 2.55 in 10 career starts against the
Phillies. Randy Wolf (3-3, 4.26 ERA), an El Camino Real High and
Pepperdine product, allowed six runs in three innings in his last
start (Tuesday vs. Houston) but had won in his two previous
outings.

USC'S OFFENSE COMES TO LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULLERTON - USC got to the winner's bracket of the NCAA baseball
regionals with pitching and defense, the team's strengths
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans are one win away from a berth in the Super
Regionals because of offense. Eighteen hits and 13 runs worth.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone in the lineup contributed in top-seeded
USC's 13-5 win over Loyola Marymount at Cal State Fullerton on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (40-18) would have to lose twice today to be
deprived of winning the four-team regional. LMU and Cal State
Fullerton met in an elimination game late Saturday night to
determine USC's opponent in the 1 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans aren't offensively challenged, hitting .302 as a
team and hitting 82 home runs entering Saturday's game. But coach
Mike Gillespie's concern has been fielding a quality batting order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough outs 1-through-9 that have been an issue,''
Gillespie said. ``If you look at our team's stats, we have four
guys with pretty good numbers, some guys with horrible numbers and
some in between.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 7-8-9 batters in the USC order _ Alberto Concepcion,
Brian Barre and Abel Montanez _ went a combined 7 for 10 with two
RBI and eight runs scored. Only Montanez was hitting more than .300
and that was in 29 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Montanez, a senior left fielder, was cut from the team three
years ago, served as team manager and rarely played until the final
three weeks of the season. But he went 3 for 3 with three runs
scored and an RBI from the ninth spot.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went right for the Trojans. Barre had one of the
game's biggest hits, an RBI triple in the eighth that broke a 5-5
tie. But it happened against Gillespie's orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually pretty funny because skip gave me the take
(sign) and I missed it,'' Barre said. ``And (LMU pitcher Michael
Schultz) ended up throwing a fastball down the middle, I hit it
good and the rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie's reaction to the sign: ``I was just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of giddy attitude a coach can have when his team
gets that kind of contribution from everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, USC's most consistent hitters in the middle of the
lineup were held down. Justin Gemoll, Beau Craig, Anthony Lunetta
and Josh Persell managed just three hits between them.
</P>
<P>
   But leadoff batter Seth Davidson went 5 for 6 and Rob Garibaldi
was 3 for 5 with four RBI in the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to step up tonight was really key because it helps out
the whole rest of our lineup,'' Davidson said. ``We're on base for
our top hitters, so I think just in general that's really key.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz (9-6), who attended Cleveland High of Reseda, has been
the big-game pitcher for the Lions (40-18). But the 6-foot-8 junior
right-hander allowed 15 hits and seven earned runs in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans led 8-5 entering the ninth and sealed it with five
more runs, four off Chaminade High of West Hills graduate Chris
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Prior (9-6) earned the win for the Trojans, giving up five
earned runs on eight hits in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   USC freshman Anthony Reyes (5-6, 4.29 ERA) will start today's
championship round game against either LMU or Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Fullerton 8, Virginia Tech 6: Chris Beck, a senior
who's been bothered by wrist and back injuries all season, went 4
for 5 and hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the top of the ninth
to keep the host Titans (37-20) alive.
</P>
<P>
   Beck hit .408 with 75 RBI as a junior but was limited to just
117 at-bats and 17 RBI this season. His homer eliminated the
fourth- seeded Hokies (34-25-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any more pain in my wrist or my back,'' Beck
said. ``The (home run) pitch was slow ... I reached out and didn't
think I got all of it.''

GALAXY SETTLES FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- With more than a third of the season gone, and more
than a third of their original starters sent elsewhere, the
dominant Galaxy squad that left preseason camp and cruised through
March and April with a 5-0-2 mark -- is looking more and more
average each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Against San Jose, the second worst team in the MLS, the Galaxy
could only manage a 1-1 draw in front of 17,831 Saturday night at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's record moved to 6-1-6, but they are 1-1-4 in their
last six matches. San Jose is now 2-6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid warned this could happen, and has
mentioned countless times that the Galaxy may as well start the
season over again with so many recent changes.
</P>
<P>
   With the allocation of newly acquired Mexican striker Luis
Hernandez, the Galaxy is feeling the loss of departed starters
Clint Mathis, Roy Myers and Joey Franchino -- all lost in the
Hernandez fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played well,'' said Schmid. ``Our
coordination up front isn't good. Our timing of things is just not
there right now. I'm sort of glad our friendly Monday with
Persepolis (Iran) was cancelled because this gives us a couple days
of rest and a week of training.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's problems are spread:
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Rookie central defender Danny Califf is getting
baptized while Robin Fraser recovers from a strained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Striker Cobi Jones hasn't scored since April 1, and the
Galaxy has only six goals in their last six games after scoring 15
goals in their first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Hernandez, touted as MLS' franchise player, is without
a goal in two games and may need two or three more weeks untill he
is finally in sync with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   What else, or does there need to be anything else? Oh, the U.S.
Cup begins next week. The Galaxy loses Fraser, Jones and Greg
Vanney to the U.S. team while Hernandez could join Mexico. The
Mexican national team announces their roster for the U.S. Cup on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Schmid has until September to sort this
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like preseason now,'' said Schmid. ``We have to decide
what's the best system for us to play based upon the personnel we
have because it's so much different.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has only trained once in three weeks since his
season with Tigres ended in Mexico, is struggling with his timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hernandez is a great player but I don't think he's playing
great yet,'' said Schmid. ``He's coming off three weeks of vacation
so he's not sharp. He's got to get sharp, and we need to understand
him. There were some great one-touch layoffs that he did in the
first half that guys didn't read, but right now we look like a real
tired team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was happier with the team I had (prior to Hernandez)
because they knew and understood each other and now we're starting
over. Over the last six games we haven't played the same lineup
twice. It's going to take some time.'' The Galaxy did most of their
attacking in the first 20 minutes, getting an early strike from
Simon Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the penalty arc, Elliott picked up an errant clear
by San Jose defender Mauricio Solis. Elliott didn't waste any time,
firing a return shot to the upper-right netting to give the Galaxy
a 1-0 lead in the 22nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   The play started down the left-side as Vanney sent a pass across
the field for Jones. Jones picked the ball out of the air, cutting
inside to lose Earthquakes defender Wade Barrett. Jones attempted a
cross in the middle, but Solis cleared it away straight to Elliott,
who notched his second goal of the season from 20-yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, thin in the back with the loss of Fraser and Ezra
Hendrickson (yellow-card accumulation), looked confused on a
set-play that evened the match, 1-1, in the 30th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Off an innocent looking pass from the right side, Iranian
striker Khodadad Azizi sent a looping cross over the middle for
Ronald Cerritos -- with no Galaxy defender in sight. Cerritos had
his choice of spots, finishing with a header to the right of
Hartman for his fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   (Notes) The Galaxy signed midfield Ivan Polic, a native of
Kraljevo, Yugoslavia, as a discovery player.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old midfielder trained with the Galaxy during
preseason. After losing Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino and Roy Myers
to acquire Hernandez, the Galaxy had a roster spot available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited to add Ivan because he is a player that already
has experience overseas and is technically a very confident
player,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``With the number of
players we lost in the Hernandez acquisition, one of our needs is
another central midfielder and that's something Ivan can rectify
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Polic was naturalized in 1995, meaning he does not count as a
foreign player. He last played for Radnicki Nis of the Yugoslavian
first division and was a four-year letterman at Southern Methodist.

DREIFORT CAN'T STOP PHILLIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been two steps forward, one step back for
Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort for much of this young season, and
Saturday night brought another halt to what had been Dreifort's
steady progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies, led by light-hitting shortstop Desi
Relaford, blasted Dreifort for six runs in three innings and
survived a late rally to beat the Dodgers 7-6 in front of 33,967 at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss hurt the Dodgers on multiple levels. They lost third
baseman Adrian Beltre, who strained his right hamstring running out
a ground ball in the sixth and will be evaluated again today.
</P>
<P>
   There were also plenty of missed opportunities in the late
innings. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh but scored
just once to cut the lead to 6-5. Kevin Elster singled to lead off
the eighth and reached third with two outs, but Philadelphia right
fielder Bobby Abreu made a sliding, snow-cone catch on a Mark
Grudzielanek liner to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' Mike Lieberthal and the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield
exchanged home runs in the ninth, and with Shawn Green on second
with one out, Phillies closer Jeff Brantley struck out Todd Hundley
and pinch-hitter Geronimo Berroa to earn the save.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most painful part of the game, however, was the
performance of Dreifort (3-2), just three starts removed from a
two-hit shutout May 12 against St. Louis. Dreifort offered few
positives against the Phillies, one of baseball's weakest-hitting
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford, the Phillies' No. 8 hitter who entered the game with
12 RBI in 37 games, hit a three-run home run in the second and a
two-run single in the third. Dreifort struck out five but left the
game after the third, having allowed six runs on six hits and three
walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort just didn't have it; he struggled pretty much from
the get-go,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was all the more disappointing considering
Dreifort has displayed flashes of dominance this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed two runs in eight innings in a no-decision
Monday against Cincinnati and had not lost since his first start of
the season, when he walked eight in a 2-1 loss to the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander had control problems again Saturday and
frequently fell behind batters. Relaford's home run came on a 3-2
pitch that was left over the middle of the plate, but by that point
Dreifort was already in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros hit a two-run double off the top of the left-field
wall in the first for a short-lived 2-0 Dodgers lead against
Philadelphia starter Robert Person (5-2). It was the second
consecutive night Karros hit a ball off the wall, after Friday's
disputed call.
</P>
<P>
   Karros would hit another two-run double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell led off the second with a home run. Rob Ducey walked
on five pitches and Kevin Jordan blooped a single into right field
to set up Relaford's blast to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was finished off in the third, when Relaford, with two
outs, lined the first pitch he faced up the middle to score Burrell
and Ducey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you beat the devil, sometimes you don't,'' Dreifort
said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges relieved Dreifort to begin the fourth and fared
better, although not without some anxious moments. Herges threw
three shutout innings but allowed six baserunners (two hits, three
walks, one error) and twice needed double plays to escape jams.

 &HT;    Aesthetics or athletics: Teams tread carefully in ads
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami Sol forward Yolanda Moore was driving home from the mall a
few months ago, heading south on Interstate 95 in Miami-Dade
County, when she passed a yellow billboard featuring someone she
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   It was her _ wearing baggy athletic clothes, holding a
basketball on her hip and staring unsmiling at the South Florida
landscape. The sign read ``I will sacrifice my body to preserve my
Sol,'' and it was promoting the WNBA team that begins its first
season Thursday at AmericanAirlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got off at the next exit and drove back around to see it
again and make sure it really was me,'' Moore said, laughing. ``I
was just creeping. I probably could have gotten a ticket for going
so slow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an overwhelming experience for Moore, who was a single
mother when she joined the WNBA three years ago as a free agent.
Moore struggled with knee problems this pre-season, had surgery on
both knees Saturday and was waived.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sol's pre-season campaign featuring her was a sign of
the times for women _ a 14-by-48-foot sign that they can be
promoted as athletes who will run, sweat, throw themselves on the
ground and still get fans to buy tickets and passionately cheer
them on.
</P>
<P>
   It's a recent change, however. Although girls have joined boys
on athletic fields regularly for 20 years, Madison Avenue spent
most of that time selling women athletes primarily for their
perkiness (Mary Lou Retton), looks (tennis player Chris Evert) or
glamour (golfer Laura Baugh). That they played sports was a small
part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the ice skaters: Dorothy Hamill with her haircut
and Peggy Fleming,'' said 35-year-old Dawn Riley, a member of the
Women's Sports Foundation's board of trustees. ``The first images I
remember are, 'Wow. They're pretty.' That they were athletes too
was kind of secondary. I think that's definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   WTA has `Glamour Calendar'
</P>
<P>
   But how much?
</P>
<P>
   In tennis, the WTA Web site teases a link to the 2001 ``Glamour
Calendar'' with this line: ``Keep up with your busy schedule while
keeping up with this beautiful tour calendar.'' The calendar has
been published for years and players seem to enjoy showing how they
look off the court, vice president for communications Chris De
Maria said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that's a really great way for the fans to see the
players in another way, to show them for their glamour,'' De Maria
said. ``In some of the pictures, you know who it is, but it's
amazing how different they can look when you take off the tennis
whites and you dress the way you want to and get photographed by a
professional photographer.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar is just part of one of the broadest marketing
campaigns in women's sports. The WTA wants its athletes seen in as
many media outlets as make sense _ and even some that don't, De
Maria said. Examples include Serena Williams' recent visit to MTV's
House of Style and Monica Seles' trip to meet CART racers during
the Ericsson Open.
</P>
<P>
   But that approach means the WTA rarely discourages players from
anything _ even if it means 15th-ranked Anna Kournikova, who hasn't
won a tournament, earns millions more in endorsements than
second-ranked Lindsay Davenport, who has won three Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-ranked veteran Nathalie Tauziat recently published a
book criticizing the tour for letting glamour overshadow
performance, but she doesn't expect anything to change until the
world marketplace changes. And she knows that's a long time away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think it's very important for the fans to know what
these players do besides tennis,'' De Maria said. ``Sex appeal
certainly is part of it, but mostly we're looking at each player
individually and saying, 'Where can we go with her?'''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer becomes `babe city'
</P>
<P>
   WNBA, Women's World Cup soccer and LGPA officials all stated
similar marketing goals: showing the public their best stories and
athletes so fans have good images of their sports and want to watch
them. Soccer, more than basketball and golf, admits sex appeal is
just part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The Late Show host David Letterman, for example, nicknamed the
Women's World Cup team ``babe city'' last year and few but the
staunchest feminists got upset.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain stirred controversy by ripping off her shirt
after scoring the game-winning goal in last year's final. She
earlier had done the same by posing nude in Gear magazine. But if
fans remember one name besides Mia Hamm, it's Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a bit uncomfortable with Brandi's deal,'' teammate
Michelle Akers said. ``Everybody has to make their own decisions on
how they want to be portrayed. Regardless of that, it has a
reflection on us as a team and women's sports as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Messing, president of the 1999 Women's World Cup
organizing committee, doesn't think the Gear photograph reflected
badly on the team, although it wasn't a function of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cornerstone in almost everything we did was first and
foremost, they have to be great athletes,'' Messing said. ``Whether
they're mothers or beautiful or funny or whatever, there are a lot
of other women out there that are all those things. What makes
these women different is that they are great athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Durkin, vice president of marketing for the LPGA,
considers the job of selling women's golf more difficult because it
has little national television exposure and an older, slightly more
male audience.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA has only recently started selling its players on and
off the course, but it doesn't have the money for its own large
television media campaign so it instead relies largely on sponsors
using its athletes and on its own public service announcements,
which run during tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Juli Inkster is featured in a new PSA, Durkin
said, that lists her many golf credentials but shows another side
of her by poking fun at her unique ``celebratory dance maneuvers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence is Juli certainly can play golf, but she sure
can't dance,'' Durkin said. ``It captures Juli's sense of humor and
who she is and isn't just Juli Inkster as a golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the days of the LPGA's Fairway magazine glamour
shots, one of which showed Jan Stephenson in a Marilyn Monroe pose,
and cashing in on Baugh's individual promotion as the
``Ultra-Brite'' girl are over. Durkin thinks that's a good thing,
for golf and the rest of women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is anything particular to the LGPA,'' she
said. ``It's just a different time. Women's sports had a different
place in corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers change approach
</P>
<P>
   That can't be denied. Opportunities for women to play sports and
earn endorsements and make money from the industry have grown
exponentially, particularly since the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think marketers are realizing that there's an audience,''
said Sue Rodin, owner of Stars &AMP; Stripes, an agency representing
primarily female athletes. ``They're seeing that lots of women and
girls and soccer moms follow these sports and have fun playing
them. It's not, 'Oh, let's get Joe Montana' automatically
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rodin said one of her clients, World Cup soccer's
Julie Foudy, is close to signing a deal to become a national
spokeswoman for Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're her favorite food, and so (the company) thought, 'Why
not affiliate with women's soccer in this way?' Think of all the
moms who bring Munchkins to soccer games.''
</P>
<P>
   Moms have started earning a greater presence in sports recently,
too. They're fans, mothers of fans, mothers of athletes and even
athletes themselves. The Sol were one of a few WNBA teams promoting
that they have players with kids.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who has two daughters, is pictured on one billboard
reading ``Mother of Two. Queen of the Three.'' Another shows her
holding a 2-year-old girl on her hip beside the words ``Hoops.
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The intended messages are different, said Michael McCullough,
Sol executive vice president and chief marketing officer. The first
simply is that Moore is a mom and a professional athlete, something
most Americans recognize as a difficult task. The second ad shows a
woman who plays professional basketball and a girl who can dream
about doing that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a mom who's playing professional sports,'' McCullough
said. ``We definitely wanted to play up that angle when we could.''
</P>
<P>
   A touchy issue
</P>
<P>
   But that offends a few and makes some, including veteran
basketball player Ann Meyers, wary, because promoting women
athletes as moms could be seen as demeaning their athletic
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, it's a positive,'' said Meyers, a WNBA commentator
for NBC. ``But we cannot overextend that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough said he has received only positive feedback to the
billboards and feels he's promoting women as both mothers and
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few players who are moms in the WNBA. We have
one of them,'' McCullough said Thursday. ``To be a mom and primary
caregiver and knowing the toll on the body just to have children, I
think most women really appreciate that. We're not going to
overstate that point, but to ignore it would have been a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Sol players agree _ both about marketing Moore as a mom
and about how that extends to using a little sex appeal when
appropriate. WNBA President Val Ackerman has tried to promote her
players first ``as basketball players and as professionals,'' she
said. That means tasteful, but the league tries to set as few rules
as possible and what players do individually isn't the WNBA's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Debbie Black wouldn't mind seeing a harder push from
the WNBA _ regardless of taste.
</P>
<P>
   She howled, for example, at Chastain's post-World Cup Nike ad in
which Chastain plays foosball with NBA star Kevin Garnett and
friends. She scores a goal, then notices Garnett staring intently
at her _ apparently hoping for another World Cup stripping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Black said. ``I know it's sexist but I thought it
was cute. Maybe I'm old school, but it's exposure and we need
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants people to truly consider women athletes to be athletes
and thinks anything could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they realize we actually do the same kind of
pounding in the gym that a guy does,'' she said. ``I say promote us
and market us and any exposure we can get _ as long as we're not in
jail and beating someone up _ anything else is terrific. Get them
here and they'll see what kind of athletes we are.''

<P>
   NKOREA-REFUGEES (Yanji, China) _ The Chinese police have
dramatically increased their efforts to expel North Koreans living
undercover in China in recent months, creating a potentially
explosive international refugee crisis. The Chinese government has
also stepped up raids on the hundreds of tiny shelters and
factories where the illegal migrants live and work, generally run

   ETHIOPIA-ERITREA (Asmara, Eritrea) _ On Monday, senior officials
from Ethiopia and Eritrea are to meet in Algeria, to talk about
ending a two-year war that has killed tens of thousands of young
men and, here in Eritrea, women serving as soldiers too. But this
war has become only more complex in recent days. Despite Eritrea's
retreat, Ethiopia shows no signs of stopping the fight. By Ian
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA-CIVIL-RIGHTS (Sydney, Australia) _ More than 200,000
people, a crowd larger than any expected at the Olympics here in
September, marched Sunday to support campaigns for social justice
for Australia's black minority. By John Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   EXPO-2000 (Hanover, Germany) _ Something is afoot in Hanover.
This country has built itself a 400-foot-long glass structure,
called it ``Germany: Workshop of Ideas,'' and adorned it with 47
giant busts of great Germans that include one Jurgen Sparwasser, a
soccer player, but not Goethe. The structure in question is
Germany's pavillion at Expo 2000, the World's Fair that opens on
June 1. The absence of Goethe, eased out by the likes of Marlene
Dietrich, is suggestive of an insistent national quest: to get
people to think differently about Germany. By Roger Cohen.

   CRIME-DROP-REACT (Chicago) _ With the historic drop in violent
crime beginning to take hold in even the most blighted urban areas,
cities across the country are being transformed as neighborhoods
that had become frightening wastelands are showing glimmers of
renaissance. New homes are being built, stores are opening and, for
the first time in years, people are sitting on their front porches.
By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-OIL-FALLOUT (Midland, Texas) _ For nearly a century, the
compact between ranchers and oilmen created the huge wealth that
built modern Texas. The ranchers owned the land, the wildcatters
found the oil, and everyone got rich together. But oil is no longer
king in Texas, and the state is grappling with a less glamorous
legacy of the high-flying days. Tens of thousands of oil wells
could be leaking and threatening underground aquifers at a time
when drought has made water the state's most precious natural
resource. Now, the ranchers and the oil producers are fighting over
cleaning up the mess. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT-TECHNO (Detroit) _ Carl Craig is an international music
star. Every weekend he is somewhere in the world performing before
sold-out crowds. But here in his hometown, the place that spawned
the sound known around the world as Detroit techno, Craig remains
an unknown. For nearly two decades the city that set the '60s to
music with the Motown sound, has largely closed its ears to its
other musical offspring, the techno sound. By Nichole M. Christian.

   COMMENCEMENT-ADDRESSES (Undated) _ Every spring, they parade to
the podiums of colleges and universities across the country,
offering sage words of advice _ or at least a few one-liners. Poets
and politicians. Athletes and artists. Diplomats and do-gooders.
(Features excerpts from 19 commencement addresses from across the
country.) By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING-WILLS (Undated) _ Although millions of Americans have
signed living wills and power-of-attorney forms, thinking the
documents would help them avoid unwanted treatment and prolonged
deaths, in many cases those measures turn out to be useless. First
of two articles. A special report. By Denise Grady.

   IMMIG-BIRTH-CERTIFICATES (Washington) _ After making it safely

millions of illegal immigrants have faced over the years. He had to
convince employers, government agencies, and others that he was
here legally. It was not long before Bieri discovered a little
secret: In some states, it is possible to adopt the identity of an

REAL ESTATE: A WESTCHESTER BUILDER EXPANDS INTO CONNECTICUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.Y.)  By ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ginsburg Development Corp., a 36-year-old home builder known
for the quality of its houses and condominiums in Westchester
County, has opened its first project in Connecticut, a condominium
community of detached single-family homes in the Georgetown section
of Redding.
</P>
<P>
   Called Redding Woods, the Victorian cottage-style development at
62 Redding Road (Route 107) sits on a wooded knoll with views of
forested hills receding into the distance. Of the 23 homes to be
built by the end of the year, six have been sold since sales began
a month ago. The four models, with square footage of 2,500 to
3,600, are priced from $489,000 to $589,000.
</P>
<P>
   Condos are the exception, not the rule in Redding, and
Georgetown is the only section where they are allowed. Only one
other condominium complex exists, with four apartments in a single
building.
</P>
<P>
   The Ginsburg company, which has filed plans for almost 400 homes
in two projects elsewhere in Fairfield County, in Danbury and
Newtown, has been known in Westchester for its focus on the
high-end town-house niche, often on challenging sites.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Novella Jr., the president of Ginsburg Development CT
in Danbury, the new Connecticut division set up by the company,
said, ``Our charge is to become the premier multifamily community
developer in Connecticut: to deliver what there is a dire lack of _
a variety of luxury town homes for empty nesters, aging baby
boomers, singles, people who may not have children, people in
nontraditional family situations, and do it at a reasonable
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shew, the village manager of Ossining, N.Y., spoke highly
of the Ginsburg company. ``GDC did a substantial project here known
as Mystic Pointe _ high-end condos up to the $600,000 range,'' he
said. ``Our building department was impressed with the fact that
everything was done according to the book. No corners cut. The
development is regarded as one of our better ones _ attractive,
well built, exceptionally marketable.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Feiner, the supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh, N.Y.,
where the Ginsburg company has built three projects, has a fourth
under construction and is planning a fifth, owns a Ginsburg home.
``Five years ago when my wife and I were looking for a house, the
only three we liked were Ginsburg's. We bought one in Boulder Ridge
from the original owner, and we love it. Ginsburg buys property
nobody would think is buildable _ on a steep slope, or covered with
rocks and boulders, and builds on it. The projects are very
pleasing aesthetically and very well built.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gissen, Ginsburg's director of development, described its
business philosophy like this: ``We have tried to develop a niche
in the very upscale town home or clustered single-family home
development, with heavy investment in architectural detail and
landscaping. We look closely at the site, and the character of the
local community. We don't try to jam a square peg into a round
hole. Redding, for example, is very dissimilar from Yonkers. We try
to work within that.''
</P>
<P>
   By making Redding the site of its first foray into Connecticut,
the company is moving into an active market. Amy Pardee, the
Redding's zoning enforcement officer, said: ``We're having a little
building boom here. We're the next town up from lower Fairfield
County, ripe for development, so we might as well brace
ourselves.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Incorporated in 1764, Redding has preserved much of its early
rural atmosphere. It contains two districts listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. Its large village green is the site of
summer concerts, and its library, founded in 1908 by Mark Twain
with a collection from his own library, holds one of the largest
book sales in the state each August. Twain moved to Redding in 1908
and died there in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9,000 people inhabit Redding's 32.3 square miles, almost
all of it zoned for two-acre, single-family lots. More than 4,000
acres are protected in permanent open space. Georgetown is the only
section of Redding with municipal sewers and water. Other parts of
Georgetown belong to Ridgefield, Weston and Wilton.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Ginsburg, the president and chief operating officer of
the development company, and his brother, Sam, the other principal,
are both architects, and their developments are known for their
architectural integrity. Since 1964 the company, which is based in
Hawthorne, N.Y., has built more than 1,650 houses and condominiums
and 2,300 rental apartments in 20 projects along the East Coast,
from Florida to Westchester. The brothers made a decision two years
ago, Martin Ginsburg said, ``to go into new territories,''
specifically Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months ago, the Ginsburgs bought the 10-acre Redding
tract for $1.5 million from Adam Lebarski, owner of the Georgetown
Saloon on Main Street, and began reworking Lebarski's previously
approved subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   William Delsner, the designer of the Redding Woods homes, was
brought into the project by Novella, whose family-owned
construction company, the Novella Development Corp. in Danbury,
merged with Ginsburg two years ago. Delsner, the Ginsburgs and Jane
Didona, a landscape architect, scrapped the subdivision's original
cookie-cutter layout and the identical designs for the houses, but
the footprints of the houses could not be changed without going
through a new approval process.
</P>
<P>
   Delsner's designs incorporate a contemporary reinterpretation of
turn-of-the-century details like bay windows, covered porches and
trellises. The roof lines have several levels, the lower levels of
the houses have stone facing, and the garage doors, with their
arches and crisscrossed moldings, are reminiscent of carriage
houses. Rather than being positioned in a straight line going up
the hill, the houses are scattered informally along a single
dead-end road.
</P>
<P>
   Delsner is not a licensed architect, but a structural engineer
on his staff and an architect sign off on the blueprints. On this
project he worked closely with Didona to make the new houses look
as if they had been there for years. Period street lights further
that effect.
</P>
<P>
   The site posed some challenges: one side drops to the road below
at a 30-degree angle. ``Very often you get much more interesting
results with a difficult site,'' Martin Ginsburg said. ``We've been
dealing with difficult sites in Westchester for a long time, so
we've developed a lot of expertise over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The land was too steep for lawns, and the designers rejected a
covering of loosely laid stone. Their solution? Huge sheets of
green fabric installed against the hill, impregnated with
wildflower seeds. With luck, each spring there will be little
bluestem, switch grass, partridge pea, nodding bur marigold, showy
tick trefoil and green-headed coneflower growing through the
fabric, securing the soil, blooming and dying back naturally in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four models of houses, three have three bedrooms and one
has two. All have two and a half baths, two-car garages, nine-foot
first-floor ceilings (eight feet upstairs) and solid-core interior
doors. A large attic loft can be finished in one model for use as
another bedroom or office. The space above the garage in another
model can be finished as an all-purpose room with a pyramid ceiling
18 feet high at its point.
</P>
<P>
   Basements will be finished, waterproofed and carpeted. Some will
be completed as guest suites with living rooms, bedrooms and full
baths. Basements in the houses with the steep backyards open onto
patios.
</P>
<P>
   The Ginsburg company has proposed two other developments that
are now going through the approval process in Connecticut: 280 town
homes in Danbury and 110 condominiums for people 55 and older in
Newtown.
</P>
<P>
   Gissen, Ginsburg's director of development, said, ``We are
hoping for another `active adult' community of 70 luxury units in
Farmington, 150 town homes in a lower Litchfield County town that I
am not at liberty to name, and we are looking at properties in the
New London and New Haven areas.''
</P>
<P>
   When about two-thirds of the homes at Redding Woods are sold, a
homeowners' association will be formed to maintain the road, lawns,
landscaping and the exteriors of the houses. Common charges are
expected to run about $2,000 a year. Property taxes, which will be
set in July, may range from $5,500 to $6,500, said Diane Eppoliti,
the sales agent for Redding Woods at Raveis Real Estate in
Georgetown.

   CENTENARIAN-WRITER (Undated) _ In the annals of publishing, few
people have had to wait as long as George Dawson to see their names
on a book jacket. Dawson is 102. But then he didn't begin to read
until he was 98. This year, Dawson, who now reads at about a
fourth-grade level, and Richard Glaubman, a 50-year-old elementary
schoolteacher from Washington state, published ``Life Is So Good''
(Random House), based on Dawson's account of life growing up in
East Texas among relatives who had been slaves. Both are listed as

Glaubman. By Dinitia Smith.

   NEWMUSIC-CRI (New York) _ Increasingly, as the major classical
record labels undergo seismic reorganizations, followers of new
music are finding that independent boutique labels like CRI, New
World Records, and Bridge are becoming the only companies willing
to record new works. But in the last decade it is CRI especially
that has been a vital home for both traditionalists and listeners
with eclectic tastes, thanks to the efforts of Joseph Dalton, the

   AFTER REDESIGN, SALON DISCOVERS ONLINE READERS ARE OPPOSED TO
CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Internet users are accustomed to, and typically embrace,
rapid-fire change. But some types of change can make Internet users
downright grumpy, as the online magazine Salon recently learned.
</P>
<P>
   Salon introduced a redesigned site (www.salon.com) last Monday.
It did not take long before critiques started pouring in by e-mail
from hundreds of readers: The site had technical bugs; it was too
cluttered; its new, smaller type font was too hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's editor, David Talbot, responded on Wednesday with a ``We
feel your pain'' letter to the site's readers. The note said Salon
was tinkering with the site to fix the bugs and to address concerns
about the font size.
</P>
<P>
   But Salon's readers are not the only audience that matters.
Talbot said in an interview that one reason for the redesign was to
give more prominent placement to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers pay the freight here,'' he said, adding that
readers need to understand that the advertising revenue makes it
unnecessary to charge subscription fees for the site. ``We have to
make more room for sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   A second business reality, Talbot said, is that the new design
will make it easier to find room for continuous breaking news. He
said Salon was moving away from a magazine format and into that of
a ``continuously published newspaper,'' including the use of news
agency reports.
</P>
<P>
   That vision may initially meet resistance from some of Salon's 3
million monthly visitors, Talbot acknowledged. But he said that in
the long run, Web publications that survive must take advantage of
the speed and immediacy of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said he was not overly concerned about last week's reader
complaints, noting that readers also protested last year when the
site had a less ambitious revamping.
</P>
<P>
   Readers are now arguing to keep some of the same features they
vehemently objected to when they were added last year. ``I'm
actually flattered by how passionately and seriously people regard
Salon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ MATT RICHTEL
</P>
<P>
   As Web Expands, Search Engines Puff to Keep Up
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Two Dartmouth College computer researchers have measured how
quickly the World Wide Web is expanding, and their findings are not
good news for the companies that are trying to index the hundreds
of millions of documents that are linked by the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To keep reasonably current, say within a week, a search engine _
or Web-searching service _ now needs a communications pipeline
capable of carrying 50 million bits of data a second. That is the
conclusion of George Cybenko, a Dartmouth computer scientist and
the co-author of a study of the changing Web. He said such a fast
communications pipe is required if a search engine's so-called
spider software is going to scurry about the Web with sufficient
swiftness as it looks for new documents and any other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to determine that one in five Web pages is 12
days old or younger,'' said Brian E. Brewington, the co-author of
the paper with Cybenko.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers sampled more than 2 million of the estimated 800
million Web pages over seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting picture is of an increasingly dynamic Web of
documents that will become increasingly difficult for search engine
companies to keep track of _ particularly as new software formats
like XML, or Extensible Markup Language, alter the now relatively
static world of Web documents.
</P>
<P>
   Brewington and Cybenko said their study might have already
struck a raw nerve in the world of search engines. When they
presented their comparative findings showing how up to date various
search engines were at a recent Internet conference, he raised
hackles among some search engine executives whose sites appeared
not to be as current as others.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason Brewington said he was not willing to make his
data public, acknowledging that any rankings would shift, depending
on when the survey took place. He said that most people do not
expect search engines to be absolutely up to date and that a fair
criterion might be having a search service that is within a month
of being current.
</P>
<P>
   For all the changes, the researchers noted that many parts of
the Web are quite static. One in four Web pages is more than a year
old, they found.

PUBLIC OFFERINGS FROM '99 FALTER IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the list of 1999's best initial public offerings, Ditech
Communications and FreeMarkets Inc. came close to being bookends.
Both were among the best performers of last year, with Ditech's
stock ending the year up 611 percent from its offering price and
FreeMarkets' ending with a gain of 750 percent. Each could show
rapidly growing sales over the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. So far in 2000, their fates
have diverged as much as any two stocks could. Ditech's share price
is up nearly 90 percent this year, while FreeMarkets' is down by
nearly the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the companies and their stories were never very
similar. Ditech, a maker of echo cancellation equipment for
telephone companies, was profitable but uninteresting to many
investors when it went public last June. It got off to a dull
start, rising 14 percent the first day it traded, and even that
modest lift was possible only because the company placed its shares
at the bottom of the price range it mentioned when it filed to go
public.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMarkets, on the other hand, was a phenomenon. A
business-to-business Internet auction company, it went public in
December at the height of Internet speculation, when its losses did
not faze investors. It sold shares for three times as much as it
had sought when it first filed to go public, and found that even
this was not nearly enough to meet the demand. The shares leaped
483 percent the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened since the beginning of this year? Ditech
has grown faster than anyone expected, and is in a business that
has not worn out its welcome on Wall Street. Its share price is up
88 percent this year. It did, however, drop 5 percent on Friday,
closing at $87.8125, despite posting quarterly results that were
well in excess of published forecasts. That could be an indication
that investors are beginning to look around for technology stocks
where there are still profits to be taken, and taking them.
</P>
<P>
   As for FreeMarkets, it has reported growing sales, but the bloom
is off the rose when it comes to money-losing Internet companies.
Its stock price is down 89 percent in 2000, closing Friday at
$37.25. Those who got in at the offering price in December, and
held on, have seen a massive paper profit completely evaporate, and
have lost 22 percent of their money. Anyone who bought on the first
day is down 87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, FreeMarkets is more representative of what has
happened to last year's hot new offerings than is Ditech. Of the 50
best-performing new offerings of 1999, as calculated by CommScan,
46 have declined in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That performance is a testimony to just how far stocks can fall
when market sentiment changes. A few of the companies have plunged
because their operations have not lived up to expectations. But the
decline of many of the companies cannot be explained by their
business performance _ any more than the original soaring prices
could be explained.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of those stocks in 1999, from initial offering
price through the end of the year, ranged from a gain of 2,723
percent for Internet Capital Group, the best performing offering,
to 540 percent for Software.com, which ranked 50th. That so many
new offerings went up so far was a testimony to just how hot the
market was.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the market has cooled, and the air has come out of many of
the stocks long before their results have shown whether or not last
year's optimism was justified. The average performance of those 50
stocks is a loss of 52 percent. Since March 10, when the Nasdaq
stock market peaked, the Nasdaq composite is down 37 percent, while
the average performance of the once-hot 50 is a drop of 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are plenty of profits that have been made in the
stocks. All but 15 of the stocks are trading higher than they did
the day they went public, and only two _ FreeMarkets and Bluestone
Software, a maker of software for Internet companies _ are trading
below their original offering prices. A third, Ventro, trades for
its original offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Ventro, which went public last July as Chemdex, an Internet
seller of chemical equipment, renamed itself in March as it
announced plans to broaden into other areas of business-to-business
Internet service. It is down 92 percent since March 10, the worst
performer over that period.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital, No. 1 in 1999, is down 85 percent so far in
2000, as the attraction of a company that owns stakes in many other
Internet companies has faded. Even so, it is still trading at twice
the price at which it ended the first day of trading, and for more
than four times its original offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital doubled the first day of trading, a performance
that once would have seemed extraordinary, yet for much of last
year was almost routine.
</P>
<P>
   But the stocks that had the biggest first-day gains have, in
general, proved to be disappointments thereafter. Seven of the 50
stocks quadrupled on the first day of trading. Six of those seven
are trading below where they ended that first day, with the only
exception being Sycamore Networks, which markets optical networking
products. It is still up 24 percent since that first day, but it is
trading for less than half its peak price reached in early March.
</P>
<P>
   The other big movers the first day, all of which are trading for
less than they fetched that day, are Ask Jeeves, an Internet search
service; Akamai Technologies, an Internet content delivery service;
Foundry Networks, an Internet switching service; Chinadotcom, an
Internet company that provides Asian news and services to other
Internet companies; VA Linux Systems, a distributor of software and
computers using the Linux operating system, and FreeMarkets.
</P>
<P>
   There is one final measure of just how far some of the hottest
issues have fallen. Brocade Communications is now up 2,111 percent
from its offering price, making it the best performing of 1999's
initial offerings to date. But it has plenty of unhappy
shareholders. It is down 43 percent from its peak in March.

PATENTS: DASHBOARD MICROWAVE; FAST-FOOD CHOICES; CEREAL WITH ITS
OWN MILK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone planning a road trip this summer might be interested in
recent inventions for eating on the go. A long trip with children
in the car, for example, could be eased by a video monitor attached
to the back of the driver's seat _ or perhaps a dashboard
microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Perlman and Jane Katims, both of Arlington, Mass., have
won a patent for a microwave oven built into the area now used for
glove compartments in most cars. It is big enough to hold a coffee
cup or a fast-food container. A hinged door opens downward like
traditional glove-compartment doors, creating a shelf for holding
containers or serving food. An additional cup holder slides into
the oven to prevent beverages placed inside from tipping and
spilling.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say they decided to replace the glove compartment
with a microwave because ``many items which were formerly stored in
the dashboard area, in particular, the dashboard glove compartment,
are now stored in new, more accessible door pockets, seat pockets
and a centrally located storage console located between the two
front seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The microwave would draw power from the car's battery or
alternator, and the inventors write in their patent application
that ``a high voltage transformer and the power inverter can be
placed behind the engine firewall.''
</P>
<P>
   People who still need the glove compartment for gloves, maps and
other papers could store them in a container designed to fit inside
the microwave. When someone wanted to use the microwave, the
container and the objects it held could be removed. The microwave
would work only when the insert was pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors suggest several other safety features, such as
blocking the oven from working at all when the car is in motion;
allowing it to operate but preventing the door from opening until
the car is stopped; and keeping the oven from operating during
acceleration, braking or sharp turns. When the oven door is opened,
the patent application says, an alarm warns the driver ``to avoid
any sudden start-up acceleration of the vehicle which could result
in a food spill.''
</P>
<P>
   The inventors added recessed areas to the inside of the
microwave and its door, so any spilled liquid or food would collect
there. Controls for the microwave, including a timer, power setting
and on-off switch, would be placed on the dashboard within reach of
a driver or a front-seat passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors received patent 6,060,700.
</P>
<P>
   New Choices for Fast Food
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who prefer fast-food restaurants could soon face new
choices at the cash register. Jay Walker, the founder of
Priceline.com, and two other inventors, Andrew Van Luchene and
Joshua Rogers, have won a patent for a system of offering fast-food
diners a choice of fresh food or food that is a few minutes old.
The aim is to reduce waste in restaurants where food is prepared in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   With the patented system, restaurants would use a microprocessor
to record the time when foods like hamburgers and french fries are
prepared, and to track how long the food sits in food warmers
before being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when a customer orders a plain hamburger, for example, the
system would know what similar foods are available that were
prepared earlier than the burger. If cheeseburgers or chicken
sandwiches were prepared before the hamburgers, the system would
indicate that those foods were already close to the end of their
shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   It would offer to substitute one of them, either at no
additional charge or for a discounted price. The customer might be
offered a cheeseburger instead of the hamburger, for example, or a
double cheeseburger instead of a regular one. Thus, the restaurant
would sell a double cheeseburger at a reduced price that it
otherwise might eventually have to throw away, and the customer
would get a deal on his meal.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors believe that as the burgers under the heat lamps
age, their value decreases and they can be substituted for cheaper
menu items. For example, the customer's original order for a plain
hamburger might be replaced with a cheeseburger that is six or
seven minutes old, or with a double cheeseburger that is 10 or 12
minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food restaurants do not regularly announce that they
prepare some food minutes before it is sold, and this system would
draw more attention to that practice.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions for replacement orders would be drawn from
categories set up in a database that tracks the turnover of food.
Any food ordered from one category, such as chicken, might be
replaced with another item from that same category, the inventors
say. The offer of such substitutions could either appear on a
monitor at the cash register or be explained to the customer by a
cashier.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, Van Luchene and Rogers won patent 6,052,667.
</P>
<P>
   Cereal With Its Own Milk
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast on the road, at a camp site or in a hotel room often
means breakfast far from a refrigerator. Those who still want a
bowl of cereal might soon choose a brand that comes with its own
milk. Many breakfast cereals are coated with sweeteners, flavorings
and colorings, but two inventors say none has thought to coat
cereal with powdered milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, Arthur A. Krause and Walter K. Lim, men of great
genius apt to invent and discover ingenious things, come now with
an invention they have discovered,'' the two men from California
write in their own patent application. ``By applying a special
coating onto the surface of cereal pieces, a food product is
created where one may just add water to the product and the result
is a delicious cereal and milk combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonfat dry milk powder is bound to cereal by slightly
rehydrating the dried milk so it becomes sticky, by misting the
cereal so the powdered milk sticks to the surface, or by coating
the cereal first with sugar or a sugar substitute. Later, a hungry
traveler has only to add water and watch as ``the milk coating
dissolves and separates from the cereal and combines with the added
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say cereal coated with dry milk can be packaged
and transported without any special storage measures. They received
patent 6,051,262.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

FIONA APPLE: SEARCHING FOR EMOTION DORMANT UNDER LAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Good pop stars specialize in the clutching and
releasing of control. Fiona Apple is a good pop star. It took her a
couple of songs to get around to it, but on Friday night at the
Beacon Theater she had a quip between songs to excuse her
show-stopping, onstage meltdown last February at Roseland. (That
concert was halted midway because she couldn't hear herself within
the sound system. Tickets from that night were honored at Friday's
show.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all just a misunderstanding,'' she lamented. ``You said
you wanted me to be self-confessional; I thought you said selfish
and unprofessional!''
</P>
<P>
   She had several other less-rehearsed mea culpas: She formally
excused that fateful evening's sound man, vowed that she would
never do such a thing again, blamed herself for everything and
thanked her audience for coming back to see her again. And she was
at her most agreeable.
</P>
<P>
   But hers was still an apology with an edge, as if the thrill of
unveiling her own faults outweighed her desire to reconcile. It's
exhausting trying to find the emotional core of Apple's gestures;
still in her early 20s, she has used volatility to create a
well-defined aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Her music, stocked with the passing chords and dramatic
harmonies of Tin Pan Alley, ripples with the theme of worlds hidden
beneath the surface: There are songs within songs, speaking of
feelings within feelings; she's given herself the freedom of
contradicting herself in lyrics and building episodic, slightly
disjointed songs.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true with the music on ``When the Pawn ...''
(Epic), her second album, which made up most of her set. It has
range: As she performed close facsimiles of its songs on Friday,
there were mid-song changes of tempo, key and instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention a number of songs remarkable for their imagery
about penetrating a human being's outer layers. ``I'm as full as a
tick/and I'm scratching at the surface,'' she sang on Friday in ``A
Mistake''; ``You can use my skin/to bury secrets in,'' in ``I
Know''; ``You feed the beast I have within me,'' in ``Limp''; ``If
you catch me trying to find my way/into your heart from under your
skin/fast as you can, baby scratch me out,'' in ``Fast as You
Can.''
</P>
<P>
   Female singer-songwriters on the subject of love used to radiate
empathy: In their lyrics they tried to understand lovers who didn't
understand themselves. Apple, the sum of a quarter-century of punk
attitude and a great American song-book record collection, heaves
out a tangle of animal instincts, ready for a fight as she sifts
fascinatedly through her own worst qualities.
</P>
<P>
   She was working hard on Friday, obviously trying to honor the
expectations of frustrated fans. It was the last show of a world
tour, but she often sang so vehemently that her voice went hoarse.
On lines like ``I don't know what I'm doing, don't know should I
change my mind, I can't decide, there's too many variations to
consider,'' she was presenting confusion as a willed option _
something actually exciting _ rather than a sluggish impasse.
</P>
<P>
   When she came out from behind her piano, Apple had the stage
presence of someone singing along to a record in her bedroom,
unself-consciously caught up in the music. To collect herself, she
performed serpentine swivels of hips and arms, but more often she
was thrashing around, letting her hair fall in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It was all at odds with the fixed control in her voice, and in
the structure of her music: Her six-piece band used a vibraphone,
and a lead guitarist whose solos were finely tooled pieces of
rock-radio crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   Returning for an encore, she sang the standard ``Just One of
Those Things'' to a taped big-band backing, a nice, sincere touch
that brought her down to the level of a striver, a mere fan. The
Cole Porter song, writing off attraction as inexplicable, fits her
repertory. She sang it with great enthusiasm; she's not quite
relaxed enough a singer to make it swing, but she riddled it with
detail, buzzing words with vibrato and making notes snap suddenly
into true pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And surrounded by revolving colored lights, she was testing the
waters for a new iconic posture as cabaret singer, one that
complemented her other, more chaotic persona rather well.

MEN'S MAGAZINES BATTLE FOR BIGGER SHARE OF AD DOLLARS

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, advertisers and agencies seeking to reach the elusive
male consumer had an inside joke: The only magazine most men read
regularly was TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were many publications aimed at men _ among them,
Esquire, GQ and Playboy. But Madison Avenue considered television,
particularly sports programming, the more efficient way to peddle
products like cars, beer, fast food and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Men, especially in the category of free-spenders ages 18 to 34,
were perceived to have a predilection for video over print. And the
fabled limited male attention span was deemed ill suited to
magazine advertising, which takes more time to accumulate those
all-important ``impressions,'' compared with the immediacy of TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace didn't indicate a broad interest in men's
magazines,'' said Ellen Oppenheim, media director at the New York
office of FCB Worldwide, an agency owned by True North
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the sheer size of the male audience watching televised
coverage of golf, tennis and professional team sports made it
simpler to reach men by buying commercial time on those shows. For
instance, the average male viewership of one ``Monday Night
Football'' game on ABC last season was about 12.8 million. That is
only 400,000 less than the combined circulations of nine leading
magazines with predominantly male readerships, including Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, magazine publishers are battling back. They are
aggressively trying to entice the agency executives who decide
where to spend billions of advertising dollars to divert more money
to print from television, or to at least earmark additional dollars
for magazine ads.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from major sporting events, ``you don't see a lot of men
at home sitting in front of the tube,'' said Valerie Salembier,
vice president and publisher at Esquire in New York, part of Hearst
Magazines. ``I asked a 26-year-old if he watches `The Practice,'''
she added, ``and he said, `When is it on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers like Salembier are trying to persuade Madison Avenue
that men's magazines offer real alternatives to programs aimed at
men on broadcast and cable television _ particularly as the cost of
TV commercials climbs to record levels for the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With television, there's more demand than supply, so you go to
them,'' said Steve Sturm, vice president for marketing at the
Toyota division of Toyota Motor Sales USA in Torrance, Calif.
``With print, we can choose from 300 publications, so they come to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the newer choices are magazines like FHM and Maxim, with
the personalities of fraternity brothers; Gear and Stuff, offering
advice on buying gizmos and gadgets; Cigar Aficionado, Dads and
Men's Health, with lifestyle focuses; and ESPN, Maximum Golf and
Men's Journal, for men who are armchair (or actual) athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see men embracing magazines more,'' said Melissa Pordy,
senior vice president and print services director at Zenith Media
in New York, a joint venture of the Cordiant Communications Group
and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi that buys ad space and commercial time for
major marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants TV because of its reach,'' Pordy said. ``But
print has a strong story to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   That story is amplified when the newcomers are considered
alongside established magazines with large male readerships. Among
those are special-interest publications covering subjects like
business, cars, fishing, hunting, music and sports; the mainstays
like Esquire, GQ, Outside, Penthouse and Playboy; and even
magazines read by gay men like The Advocate, Genre and Out.
</P>
<P>
   Also of potential appeal to advertisers is a spate of magazines
intended for teen-age boys, a coveted demographic group because
they are typically still forming their brand preferences. The
magazines are meant to provide articles on lifestyle,
entertainment, fashion and service topics the same way that
Seventeen and YM do for teen-age girls. One, already introduced, is
Transworld Stance, a joint venture of Transworld Media, the
publisher of Skateboarding, and Times Mirror Magazines. A second,
due in September from Rodale, the publisher of Men's Health, is
called MH-18.
</P>
<P>
   With all those options, magazines seem to be mounting a battle
against television bellicose enough for that male TV favorite,
``WWF Smackdown.'' But in competing for ad dollars, print still
faces a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not give up wrestling so fast,'' Alan Jurmain said with
a chuckle. Jurmain is executive vice president and managing
director for U.S. media services at Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners
Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   He and his media decision-making counterparts at other agencies
described some doubts that magazines must overcome to turn the tide
against TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to question how broad an interest men's fashion
is,'' Jurmain said, noting the subject that predominates among the
articles in many men's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, he added, are worries about the ``environment''
of some popular publications. He was using a shorthand term for
editorial formulas that deliver large doses of articles celebrating
hedonistic behavior and photographs of scantily clad women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one client who has been uncomfortable with at least
one men's magazine'' because of problematic content, said Dan
Binder, vice president and director for print investment at Starcom
Worldwide in Chicago, a media services agency owned by the B Com3
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we've taken special steps with the publication to ensure
our ads are as far away from certain types of editorial as they can
be,'' Binder said, ``with the option to move out of issues if
there's no way to separate us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even those precautions are not sufficient. Fragrance
brands carrying the Ralph Lauren name, for instance, are not being
advertised in Maxim or Playboy magazines, said Jack Wiswall, senior
vice president and general manager for the designer fragrance
division of Cosmair in New York, the unit of L'Oreal responsible
for those scents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't get settled on that particular pictorial,''
Wiswall said. ``It's not a venue we choose.'' Maxim is, however, on
the media schedule for two of his other fragrance brands, Acqua di
Gio and Emporio Armani for Him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lance Ford, group publisher for Maxim and Stuff magazines at
Dennis Maxim Inc. in New York, concedes that some advertisers
remain reluctant. ``I think we can carry the bulk of categories
that advertise in men's lifestyle magazines, but some will take
longer than others to come in,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was resistance in the beginning, no doubt about it,'' he
added, particularly among marketers of products aimed at more
affluent men, ``and I would think there is still some work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Content, of course, is also an issue when agencies buy
commercial time on TV. But the widespread availability of sports
programming ameliorates those difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for magazines is the mortality rate among
newer publications that were promoted to advertisers as guaranteed
to attract younger male consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to proceed with some caution,'' said Bobbi Silten,
president for the Dockers and Slates U.S. unit of Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co. in San Francisco. ``Not every magazine being launched will be a
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a lengthening list of titles being closed.
Among them are Bikini, Blaze, Icon and P.O.V. And in March, Advance
Publications suddenly stopped publishing Details, which is to
return in October after a revamping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about a new magazine that advertisers find
exciting,'' said Roberta Garfinkle, senior vice president and print
media director at McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New
York. ``But you want the magazine to last for more than the
launch.'' Her agency is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group
unit of the Interpublic Group.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be some shakeout,'' predicted Thomas A.
Florio, vice president and publisher of a venerable men's magazine,
GQ, part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance. ``I liken
it to the Nasdaq,'' he added, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning serious, Florio continued: ``Think about how
successful the Internet is with men. They're getting information
and entertainment by reading. That's good for men's magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to Sturm of Toyota, pitting magazines and
television against each other is so 20th-century _ such an
old-media way to look at things.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These days, Toyota spends about a quarter of its print ad budget
on magazines read by men and about a third of its TV ad budget on
programs watched by men. But online media have also become an
increasingly important factor. ``You actually have a bridge now
between television and print: the Internet,'' Sturm said. ``Fifty
percent of my interactive plan is targeted to men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web,'' he said, ``you can get the two-dimensional
detail of print and the three-dimensional feel of television
without having to spend three-dimensional dollars.''

STARMEDIA FACES NEW CHALLENGES IN LATIN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ When rumors circulated last month that the
American company StarMedia Network might be acquired by Terra
Networks, the Internet industry found the story plausible.
</P>
<P>
   After all, StarMedia, based in New York, had one of last year's
hot Internet stock offerings but had seen its shares fall from the
firmament. And its Web portal, which since 1996 had been the
premier gateway to material on the Internet in Spanish and
Portuguese, was facing increased competition in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure has come from both local and international
multimedia giants _ like Terra, which is owned by Spain's largest
telecommunications company, Telefonica. Terra, in fact, had already
bought up a handful of Internet service providers in Latin America
to challenge StarMedia as the region's biggest player.
</P>
<P>
   But Terra was weak on content _ the news, information and
entertainment that is StarMedia's specialty. So on the face of it,
a deal made sense even if StarMedia continued to insist that it was
holding no talks with Terra.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, StarMedia's denials were genuine. Two weeks
ago, Terra did make a content play _ a $12.5 billion deal to buy
Lycos, an American Web portal with international reach. So now,
rather than having a partner, StarMedia must contemplate an even
bigger, more powerful rival in the Latin American Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia's charismatic 33-year-old founder and chief executive,
Fernando J. Espuelas, is not one to voice anxiety, though. In Sao
Paulo recently for the introduction of the company's redesigned
portal, StarMedia 6.0, he brushed off worries of growing
competition in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our leadership to lose, and we are not going to lose
it,'' said Espuelas, a native of Uruguay who speaks English like an
unusually articulate American. ``Not because we are preordained to
win, because nobody is. But we move very fast. We know this
business very well. It is the only thing that we do, and we did our
homework. We built a brand when those companies didn't believe in
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite its early leadership in the Latin American market,
the uncertainties are mounting for StarMedia. In the last year,
huge international players like Terra and America Online have made
Latin America's growing Internet market a major priority. And many
of the region's dominant media and telecommunication companies are
also devoting huge resources to building up Internet businesses.
Some analysts say StarMedia no longer has what it takes to compete
alone in the new highly competitive Latin American Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What looks on the basis of 1999 numbers as a commanding lead,
will, on 2000 numbers, look like StarMedia is one of many rather
than a clear leader,'' said Lars Schonander, a media analyst for
the investment bank ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   And investors are hardly sanguine about StarMedia's stance.
After Espuelas announced in March that the company would confront
its growing competition by increasing its marketing spending by $12
million in the first half of the year, the stock plummeted 33
percent in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that announcement, StarMedia was well off its high
of $70, reached last July, six weeks after its public offering.
Recently, with the oscillations in the Nasdaq market, the stock has
fallen even more, closing at $15.0625 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, StarMedia had seemed to lead a charmed
existence. Espuelas met the company's co-founder, Jack Chen, in the
sixth grade. Both of their families had recently immigrated to
Greenwich, Conn.; Espuelas' was from Uruguay, and Chen's was from
China. As children, they took English classes together. As
teen-agers, they jointly won a high school debate championship.
</P>
<P>
   While still in his 20s, Espuelas took a vacation in the Nepalese
Himalayas. It was there that he visualized what would become the
underlying goal of StarMedia: to knock down cultural barriers in
Latin America through universal Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole cliche about why would an Argentine care about a
Chilean is just not true,'' he said. ``It is part of the same type
of propaganda that has been fed to us for 200 years about why there
should be separate countries. Now, we are faced with a generation
in Latin America in which 60 or 65 percent of the people are
younger than 24 years of age. This is truly the Internet generation
and this generation will grow with a completely different set of
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Espuelas quit his job as managing director for
marketing for AT&AMP;T's Latin American operations. Along with Chen,
who was by then a Wall Street investment banker, he moved back to
Connecticut to start StarMedia out of the Chen family's house.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the success of Yahoo in the United States, the two men
designed StarMedia as a so-called content aggregator. StarMedia
would build a gateway to various Spanish- and Portuguese-language
Web sites rather than go through the costly process of creating its
own sites. At the time, Latin America was barely on the Internet
radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia used a storm of local television commercials to make
itself a household name in the region. And while Latin America's
nascent Internet service providers struggled to build the network
capacity to meet the budding demand for Internet access, StarMedia
was busy gathering Spanish- and Portuguese-language content sites
to give the new Web surfers places to surf.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational advertisers gravitated toward StarMedia on the
strength of its brand and the conviction of its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Espuelas' leadership is considered one of the driving forces
behind the company's early success, and a reason why its stock was
initially so popular with investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you meet Fernando, it is kind of love at first sight,''
said Susan Segal, general partner at Chase Capital Partners, who,
along with Fred Wilson, managing partner at Flatiron Partners, put
up the initial $3.5 million in seed financing for StarMedia in
1997. ``He and Jack are a very charismatic management team.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, StarMedia captured $80 million in its third
round of financing, the largest equity investment in a private
Internet company up to that time. The celebrity from that
investment, in turn, helped the company raise $110 million in its
May 1999 initial public offering. All told, StarMedia has raised
almost half a billion dollars in the public and private markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has put some of the money to use by buying Brazil's
leading Internet search services, Zeek and Cade, and a handful of
other Internet properties around the region to add to StarMedia's
basic chat rooms and free e-mail service. New wireless and
broadband-network units have been started to enable StarMedia to
expand its audience to users of cell phones and high-speed cable
modems.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's hefty marketing budget has helped it to become
the Latin American leader in Internet advertising revenue _ $10
million in this year's first quarter. That outpaced Terra and the
region's other publicly traded Web company, El Sitio.
</P>
<P>
   But StarMedia's first-starter advantages are quickly fading. In
Mexico, StarMedia's strongest market, local competition is heating
up. Telefonos de Mexico, the country's largest telecommunications
company, has teamed up with Microsoft to start a portal and
Internet access service called T1MSN.com. And two big Mexican media
companies, Grupo Televisa (EsMas.com) and Televisa Azteca
(todito.com), have also recently started Web portals.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, StarMedia has preferred to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 200 strategic relationships with content providers
across the globe, which we think adds infinitely more value that
having one big-name relationship,'' Espuelas said. ``I think that
is something that is not really understood in Latin America, which
has such an historic bias toward these big media monopolies.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts expect Latin America to mirror Internet
development in Europe, where big telecommunications and media
companies dominate the Web scene.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia's experience in Brazil, Latin America's most promising
Internet market, provides a telling example of the challenges it
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where fewer than 7 million people out of a population of
165 million are online, and forecasts call for perhaps an
additional 2 million people to get Internet access this year,
StarMedia had a weak start. The company's underlying concept of a
borderless pan-Latin community did not play well with the
Portuguese-speaking Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with StarMedia is that it always tried to head the
Latin American market, but Brazilians don't think that they are
Latin,'' said Alvaro de Castro, new business director at the
Internet consulting company Visualcom and author of books on
e-commerce and e-marketing in Brazil. ``When Brazilians entered the
StarMedia.com Web site and were asked to select what country they
were from off of a list, they would say: What are we doing among
all those other countries?''
</P>
<P>
   While StarMedia was busy rethinking its Brazilian strategy,
local companies were making inroads into the market. Universo
Online, or UOL, a joint venture of two Sao Paulo newspaper and
magazine publishing giants, the Folha Group and Editora Abril,
began providing Internet access and set up a comprehensive portal
with content supplied by its parent companies. More important, UOL
mounted a formidable advertising campaign using its parents' own
media outlets, which include Sao Paulo's leading newspaper, Folha
de Sao Paulo, and Brazil's leading weekly news magazine, Veja.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's first quarter, UOL said it logged 2.9 billion
page views. Compared with StarMedia's 2.1 billion views, that would
place UOL firmly in the lead among the region's Internet companies.
But StarMedia contends that UOL's figures, which are audited by
Ernst &AMP; Young in Sao Paulo, would not hold up under the scrutiny of
the Internet traffic auditor ABC Interactive, an American company
that StarMedia says is the measurement standard.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, StarMedia had some success in giving its Brazilian
site a more authentically local feel. The redesigned portal,
StarMedia 6.0, takes Brazilian Web surfers directly to local news
and issues. The company also introduced a new television and print
advertising campaign that featured a local soap opera star.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the first mover, StarMedia still occupies a lot of space in
the market,'' said Marcos Moraes, founder of Zip.net in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, where a dozen portals vie for a limited audience,
consolidation is soon expected to reduce the number of players to
perhaps three or four. In competing to be one of the survivors,
StarMedia's main rivals will be UOL, the Brazilian media power
Globo, Terra/Lycos, Zip.net/PT Multimedia and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressures, a group of Internet access providers
shocked the market last December by offering free dial-up service
in Brazil. Independent service providers, which used to feed
traffic to StarMedia because they lacked content of their own, may
now be forced to join with portals to compensate for their lost
revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the portals has any idea what will be at the end of
this race,'' said Jack London, a Brazilian who founded Booknet, an
online bookseller, and other Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   But Espuelas contends that the strength of StarMedia's content
will draw new users to its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explosion of free ISPs in Brazil is a wonderful thing,''
Espuelas said, referring to Internet service providers. ``It is
lowering costs, bringing more people online. We want to create the
same dynamic in all of the major markets by essentially demolishing
the paid ISP model.''

PAIRING THE PAST AND THE FUTURE IN MODERN DANCE

 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No poet, no artist of any art has his meaning alone,'' T.S.
Eliot declared in his celebrated essay ``Tradition and the
Individual Talent.'' It was his manifesto on how those artists who
want to shape the future must absorb the past. Each artist must
write with the history of European art in his bones, Eliot said,
citing Homer, Shakespeare and anonymous Paleolithic draftsmen, and
he must do the same with the art of his own country.
</P>
<P>
   We can dispense with those masculine pronouns, turn to the
performing arts and focus on the United States, the country of
Eliot's birth, which went unnamed in that essay. We can say that
American artists should take the stage with all the performing
traditions of North America (and any other continent they choose)
in their bones. And with the 1900s behind us, the artists of
Eliot's generation, those modernists who turned every art form on
its head, do matter as much as Homer and Shakespeare. They are our
classics now, too, and they are what keep phrases like ``the
classical tradition'' alive and on the move.
</P>
<P>
   That relatively new term postmodernism (how quickly it's
becoming deadly) has its own prescriptions for how artists should
work with the past: They should appropriate, parody, fracture and
collage it. Fine. But why should there be just one proper (read
ironic and hip) way? Seeing two dance companies in the last few
weeks reminded me that artists can still meet the past with all-out
passion as well as with critical intelligence. They can encounter
it, inhabit it, partner and be partnered by it.
</P>
<P>
   Take the fierce genius of modern dance, Martha Graham. Like
Eliot or Louis Armstrong, Graham invented a language that molded _
some would even say branded _ generations of artists. Over the
years some of her dancers left to choreograph and form their own
companies. The best known, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor, had to
throw off her technique to find their own.
</P>
<P>
   The young company Buglisi/Foreman Dance (this is its fifth
season) renews the Graham technique in all its full-bodied glory.
And not a moment too soon, since financial difficulties have just
made the Graham Company suspend operations indefinitely. Everything
is here: those potent torsos, contracting, releasing, spiraling;
legs, arms and heads alert to every surge of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not because they are in the first flush of
discovering Graham. The choreographers, Jacqulyn Buglisi and Donlin
Foreman, and their co-founders, Terese Capucilli and Christine
Dakin (magnificent dancers both), are all longtime Graham company
members. But no one here is shadowed by Graham's overwhelming
temperament, by that ruthless glory-driven _ as she used to say,
doom-eager _ embrace of suffering, struggle and self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   They have inherited her theatrical mastery of lighting, costumes
and stage space, her way of making us feel that each dance is an
encounter with destiny. It's the Buglisi/Foreman sense of destiny _
or of our many destinies _ that's new. Buglisi and Foreman are
drawn to the expressive nuances, the everyday emotions that bind
and separate us even when desire or grief is most acute. They
explore quiet (call it the action of contemplation) and the give
and take between couples or groups. I'd call them both wise
romantics.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman's suite of dances, ``Arms Around Me,'' is an elegy
filled with the mood changes that are part of dying or of watching
someone die. There are images of slow decline and debilitation (it
is dedicated to friends ``lost to AIDS and time''), and there are
also moments of yearning, valor and a kind of sweet acceptance.
There is a lovely openness throughout the piece, technically and
emotionally, as when Foreman performs a solo improvisation while a
cellist and violinist (Crispin Campbell and Daniel Roumain)
improvise to the Miles Davis composition ``In a Silent Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham created tragic or solitary heroines (Clytemnestra, Medea,
Jocasta) who tested the boundaries of the most primal emotions. The
heroines of Buglisi's luminous ``Suspended Women'' move, float
really, in a dream space where those primal emotions _
renunciation, sexuality, chastity and ecstasy _ seem in no way at
odds. Graham made a great dance about Emily Dickinson based on the
lines ``This is my letter to the world/That never wrote to me.''
Buglisi's inspiration is Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, a worldly and
beautiful young woman in 17th-century Mexico, who left her family
and court life to become a nun, a poet and a scholar. (The last a
vocation she defended in a bold letter to her disapproving bishop.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful sight, these women in long full gowns, rising,
falling, losing and finding themselves. They move to the music of
Ravel and to the musical interpolations of Roumain, who cherishes
Ravel's voluptuous rigor. It's a beautiful dance. I can't pretend
to analyze it fully, any more than one can fully analyze what a
poem leaves you with after its structure has been analyzed. That's
the point, I think. This is a dance about the soul's intimate
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Trisha Brown was one of the young experimental choreographers
inspired by Merce Cunningham rather than by Martha Graham. Starting
in the early 1960s she and her colleagues in the Judson Dance
Theater took dance back _ and forward _ to the basics of movement:
walking, skipping, climbing, isolating body parts and working (or
playing ) with them in repeated patterns. They explored the
relation of bodies to silence and to common settings or objects
like walls, chairs, lofts instead of big stages.
</P>
<P>
   Some experimenters keep doing what they know best, and some keep
on experimenting. Brown made her way into more complicated dances
and then into music. First it was contemporary music (Alvin Curran,
Laurie Anderson), then classical from the 17th to the early 20th
century (Bach, Webern and a fine, at times ravishing production of
Monteverdi's opera ``Orfeo,'' which she directed and
choreographed).
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Rapture to Leon James,'' she has drawn her own
choreographic map of 1930s African-American jazz dance. James was
one of the great dancers at Harlem's famous Savoy Ballroom, a
leader in that ecstatic yet controlled form known as swing dance.
You've seen it. The torso, with its pelvic angles and shoulder
thrusts, the witty quick feet and the mobile arms, which are
pressed into the body with fingers snapping and raised just above
the head to clap out a few beats, strong enough to push a partner
through one's legs and then flip her _ or him _ into the air.
</P>
<P>
   And here, in her most recent season, were nine of Brown's
terrific dancers, calling and responding to this form, nurtured and
urged on by the Dave Douglas Quartet. They have wavy torsos,
easygoing limbs and flexible joints. Their quiet but intense focus
makes ``Rapture'' as much meditation as celebration. But why do
meditation and celebration have to be so different? Brown is always
described as a cerebral choreographer, but her work is full of
single-minded passion. Black jazz and vernacular dancers from
Josephine Baker to the Nicholas Brothers and Lindy Hoppers, like
James, are praised for their instinct and freewheeling abandon. But
one finds just as many games, structures and complex brain-body
rhythms in their work.
</P>
<P>
   Brown understands and adores all this, which makes ``Rapture to
Leon James'' an ideal pairing of the past and the future. Leon
James and Trisha Brown remain themselves, and yet, together, they
become something marvelous and new.

   A Plot Twist for Two Giuliani Biographies
</P>
<P>
   At first, the furor over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's personal life
might have seemed like the ultimate publicity blitz for two New
York journalists rushing to complete biographies of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Both books were scheduled for publication by late summer, just
as the mayor's Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton would
be gathering steam. But now that Giuliani has announced his
withdrawal from the race, publishing experts wonder if the books
have lost their urgency and are doomed to being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The writers are two New York journalists who have covered the
mayor for years, Wayne Barrett, an investigative reporter for The
Village Voice, and Andrew Kirtzman, a political reporter for New
York One, a local cable TV news station.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman said that he was working on the final chapters of his
book, ``Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City,'' the day Giuliani
announced his withdrawal from the Senate race. Upon hearing the
news, he immediately called the publishers, William Morrow Press,
an imprint of the News Corp.'s HarperCollins unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were mesmerized by the events at City Hall,'' he said.
``If anything, they were even more excited about the book. National
awareness and curiosity about Giuliani has been enhanced by his
operatic departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman said he would revise his introduction, and in his final
chapter track the mayor as he agonized over his final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Leonard, a spokeswoman for Morrow, said the company had
not yet decided how many copies of the book would be printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're disappointed he dropped out of the race, but
he is still a national news figure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said he has added chapters to include this month's
roller coaster ride for his biography, ``Rudy: Gotham's Goliath,''
for Basic Books, an imprint of the Perseus Books Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy certainly has a much larger national profile now than
when I originally signed the book, much larger even than a month
ago,'' he said. ``But he's no longer running against the first
lady, and that's got to have some effect on the interest in the
book in other parts of the country.''

   CBS Braces for Complaints on `Early Show'
</P>
<P>
   This week, the managers of the more than 200 television stations
that are affiliated with CBS will attend their annual meeting with
the network's top executives. It is to take place at the luxurious
Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, but for the top CBS executives, this
will be no holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Many CBS station managers are becoming impatient with the
network's new morning program, ``Early Show,'' with Bryant Gumbel.
At last year's meeting, they were told the program would prove to
be a great ratings boon for them.
</P>
<P>
   But the show has actually done worse than the show that it
replaced, ``This Morning,'' which was widely considered to be a
half-hearted effort and did not have a star of Gumbel's caliber.
``Early Show,'' which is watched in an average 1.9 million homes,
is down 22 percent from its predecessor's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   That has made for some unhappy CBS station managers, who will
make their feelings known when the meeting begins on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high level of disenchantment among stations with
the progress of the program,'' said Robert G. Lee, president and
general manager of WDBJ, the CBS affiliate in Roanoke, Va., who is
also the treasury secretary of the affiliates advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fair to say that patience is becoming thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that he is so unhappy with the show's performance, he
would like to replace it with a local news program. But, he said,
he is contractually obliged to continue carrying ``Early Show''
until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other station managers, while also displeased, were more
temperate.
</P>
<P>
   Alan M. Bell, president of Freedom Broadcasting, which owns five
CBS affiliated stations, said that while he has no plans to pull
the show, he thinks the network has to do something, before viewers
completely tune it out. ``What we have to do is get the show to
work,'' he said. ``They know it and we know it: It doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, even executives at CBS admit that they would not force a
station to hold onto the show if it is absolutely hurting its
business. They say, however, that no one has formally discussed
dropping the show.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is something that they want to avoid. So they
are preparing to work hard at the conference to persuade the
station managers to stand by ``Early Show'' and give it more time.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said they would argue that the program, which
features Jane Clayson and Gumbel, is at least far better,
qualitatively, than the one that it replaced and that its audience
is bound to grow eventually. They also plan to announce some minor
initiatives that they say will help it catch on with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   They said that they know there will probably be some serious
hecklers in the crowd. That, however, is to be expected. As one TV
executive who has spent plenty of time at affiliate conferences put
it, ``At these events, it's like being tied to a tree and having
the vulture come and pluck at your liver _ and that's in the best
of times.''

   Fox Hopes to Turn Lurid TV into Web Gold
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives are hoping that the Internet can do for junk TV
what eBay did for junk: make it a hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the network disavowed programs like ``When Good
Pets Go Bad and ``World's Scariest Police Chases'' after the mother
of the genre, ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' became a
considerable embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   But reality programming will again emerge under the Fox banner
this fall, when the network begins TooHotForFox.com, a Web site
displaying clips from the specials now banned from the TV network.
</P>
<P>
   They will be listed under different subject headings, like
``Pets Gone Bad'' and ``Police Chases,'' said Jon Richmond,
president of Fox's digital media division. The site will also
include some newly produced segments.
</P>
<P>
   TooHotForFox will represent one of the bolder uses of the
Internet by a major broadcast network. Ever since cable became
nearly ubiquitous, broadcast executives have complained that they
are at a disadvantage because they are so heavily scrutinized and,
thus, restricted in what they can show.
</P>
<P>
   With the Web site, Fox, is in essence creating a new kind of
channel where its popular reality programming can live beyond the
scrutiny reserved for the networks, lost in the clutter of lurid
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized it would be a great testing ground for things like
viewer choice, where you can program your own reality experience,''
Richmond said. ``We felt TooHotForFox would be a great test tube
for what the future of narrowband and broadband content might look
like.''

THERE IS SOMETHING SO FAMILIAR ABOUT SUMMER MOVIE WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Matthew Mirapaul writes the arts(at)large column, published
each Thursday in CyberTimes on The New York Times on the Web.) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film industry loves the familiarity of sequels, so it won't
spoil the ending of this column to reveal that the Web sites for
this year's roster of potential summer box-office blockbusters are
mostly formulaic rehashes of past sites.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the site for ``The Blair Witch Project'' seemed to
signal a turning point. By supplementing the movie's
faux-documentary footage with additional online ``evidence,'' the
filmmakers simultaneously built an audience for their low-budget
flick and showed Hollywood's new-media mavens that a successful
site didn't have to be a bland bouillabaisse of canned production
notes, fuzzy video clips and simple games.
</P>
<P>
   But a tour of the promotional sites for some recently released
or soon-to-open movies often felt like ``Nightmare on HTML Street
5'' _ it might have been horrifying if we hadn't seen it all
before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if memory serves, the sites for ``Mission: Impossible
2'' (www.missionimpossible.com) and ``Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps'' (www.nuttyprofessor.com) are remarkably similar to _ and
just as routine as _ the ones developed for their cinematic
antecedents in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Producers who say their budgets are ``all on the screen'' don't
mean the computer monitor. Given that Hollywood spends millions of
dollars on spectacular computer-generated special effects to
attract summer crowds, some of that digital creativity might be
expected to trickle down to the Internet. But except for the
widespread use of animated pages requiring the Flash software
plug-in, the multimedia possibilities of the Internet seem to be
lost on the industry's high-technology wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Only one site, for ``The Cell'' (www.thecell.com), a movie set
for release in August, provides a compelling online experience.
Instead of relying on film stills and video clips, the site conveys
the grim thriller's sick but stylish sensibility through a series
of elaborate, effectively creepy animations. These are augmented by
a database of information on serial killers and an interactive
psychology test that seeks to draw visitors into the film's story _
the tale of a psychologically disturbed killer who drowns his
female victims before mutilating the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere among movie sites, this kind of immersed content is
hard to find. In the past, sites for films like ``Twister'' and
``Contact'' supplied all sorts of topical information and
scientific background designed to support their cinematic version
of reality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few current sites that take such pains is the one for
``The Perfect Storm,'' (www.perfectstorm.com) which provides enough
context that it might actually encourage online visitors to shut
off their computers and head for the movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   The site is easy to navigate and overflowing with multimedia
features, including home video clips of the northeaster that
walloped Gloucester, Mass., in 1991 and supplies the drama for the
film's story. There also is a 14-minute documentary on residents
who survived the real storm, as well as a series of video clips
about the film's special effects.
</P>
<P>
   So the site for Disney's ``Dinosaur''
(http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/dinosaur) should be swamped
with Mesozoic material, right? Strangely, no. The skimpy site
highlights the digital cartoon's scaly characters and supplies a
few rudimentary examples of animation, but it stomps on an
opportunity to educate young visitors about the pleasures of
paleontology.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for ``The Patriot'' (www.thepatriot.com) is all too
typical of the genre, with biographies of the cast and crew, a copy
of the trailer and a bunch of photos and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   A Revolutionary War chronology is short on historical detail and
pointlessly interactive. And the loopiest element is a discussion
area that implies that Internet taxation might be a revolutionary
cause, though it is unlikely that people will start tossing their
personal computers into Boston Harbor anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even more meandering is the ``Gladiator''
(http://gladiator-thefilm.com) site. Its circular interface _ meant
no doubt to resemble the Coliseum in Rome _ was a constant battle
to navigate. And to access special areas of the site, visitors must
first traverse it and collect 40 different ``virtues,'' including
``changability'' and ``deceipt'' (but not ``spelling'').
</P>
<P>
   One final note: The ``Mission: Impossible 2'' site requires
visitors to submit e-mail addresses to enter certain areas, but
registrants then receive unsolicited promotional messages. Perhaps
the plot of ``Mission: Impossible 3'' will be about the worldwide
effort to end spam.

DIGITAL DARWINISM THINS THE SPECIES OF ONLINE TOY AND CRAFT
STORES 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Mass.)  By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Lord seemed in remarkably good spirits last Tuesday _
considering that a day earlier, Lord, chief executive of the online
toy retailer Toysmart.com, had announced he was closing the company
and laying off its 170 employees. ``We all knew there'd be a
shakeout this quarter,'' Lord said, then laughed. ``We just didn't
think it would include us.''
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, a unit of Walt Disney based in Waltham, Mass., was one
of three Internet retailers to cry uncle last week. CraftShop.com,
one of the earliest online craft stores, filed for bankruptcy
protection last Monday, having ceased operations earlier this
month. And Brandwise.com, a joint venture between Hearst and
Whirlpool, ceased operations last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week, Boo.com, an Internet sportswear merchant in
London with a global sales operation and about $135 million in
financing, announced that it was liquidating.
</P>
<P>
   Although other e-tailers have quietly suspended operations this
year _ Viacom's online toy store, RedRocket.com, and Cybershop.com,
a gift shop, are but two examples _ the recent shutdowns have been
the most visible e-commerce casualties to date.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus within the Internet industry is that more closings
will follow quickly, as investors continue to turn a cold shoulder
to Web merchants that burned through the venture financing they
received last year. But analysts disagree about the meaning of the
recent closings.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the shakeout represents a healthy dose of
digital Darwinism _ the market's acknowledgment that it does not
need dozens of online toy sites or craft stores, when just a few
will do. But other analysts suggest that as investors continue
their wholesale rejection of consumer e-commerce companies, they
may be condemning some companies that deserve a better fate.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the chief executives of Boo, Toysmart and
CraftShop said they, too, deserved better. But they also
acknowledged committing crucial mistakes that led to their demise _
mistakes they said they were determined not to repeat in their next
e-commerce endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Lord said one of the first e-mail messages he received after
announcing his company's shutdown came from a venture capitalist.
``It was one of those I-told-you-sos; I knew it was coming,'' Lord
said, declining to identify the note's sender. ``He offered me $25
million last year, and I turned him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord said he had rejected the deal because he believed at the
time that he had a better offer on the table _ an investment of
roughly $45 million from Disney, which included $20 million in cash
and the rest in advertising across Disney's media properties.
</P>
<P>
   In that deal, which was announced in August, Disney secured a
controlling interest in Toysmart. In turn, Toysmart got an
enthusiastic supporter in Chuck Davis, who was then the president
of e-commerce for the Buena Vista Internet Group, the unit that
oversees Disney's Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Lord said, the Disney alignment caused
Toysmart's demise. ``They're a great company,'' he said. ``It just
operates on a different timetable. And when time is running out,
you don't want to operate on a slow timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically speaking, time ran out on Toysmart at the end of
last year, when the stock market began to flee Internet retailers
en masse, before Lord could take Toysmart public. Toysmart had
spent $20 million on holiday marketing, and with the capital
markets closed, the company's prospects dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Disney works more slowly than venture capitalists, Lord
said, ``the deal cost us four months.'' And with that time, he
said, the company might have been able to go public before the
window for stock offerings in e-tailers slammed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's initial ardor for Toysmart had faded after Davis left
Buena Vista late last year for another Internet company,
Bizrate.com, which rates online retailers. Then, two months ago,
Disney announced that its Internet focus had shifted from commerce
to entertainment and leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly knew it wasn't good for us,'' Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If corporations call me now to come lead their dot-com, I'll
think about what would happen if, two years down the road, the
strategy changed,'' he said. ``Or if it takes six months to fund
instead of three. It's all about time. Time, time, time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Boo, time was one of many enemies. The European fashion
e-tailer had ambitious plans to sell luxury sportswear brands in 18
nations through one of the most technologically sophisticated Web
sites available in e-commerce. And it raised about $135 million for
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Boo.com site opened in November, five months behind
schedule, the company had already spent tens of millions of dollars
on marketing in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The late start hurt in several ways, according to Ernst
Malmsten, Boo's chief executive. Because the marketing had created
huge expectations, particularly in Britain and on the Continent,
the company was unable to test the site with a quiet rollout, in
which traffic builds gradually and kinks can be worked out before
visitors start showing up in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Boo.com had a decidedly noisy introduction, which led
to a chorus of journalists complaining that features like 3-D
photography and a talking saleswoman left those Internet users who
have slow modem connections _ the majority of users, in other words
_ waiting endlessly for pages to load. The company added a
low-bandwidth feature in February, to make the site work faster for
the modemed masses. But by that time many of the consumers Boo had
reached with its advertising campaign had visited, and sworn off,
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Boo's staff, meanwhile, had grown to about 400 people, who
worked feverishly to support a complex sales-fulfillment operation
that allowed users to see only the items that Boo's distributors
had in stock, in their preferred language, with prices in their
nation's currency. One Boo executive estimated that the
nonmarketing costs associated with building its global operation
were $50 million to $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Malmsten said that aside from coordinating the site's rollout
with its marketing _ and perhaps waiting until shoppers were more
comfortable buying apparel online _ he should have tried to
restrain the expectations raised by the company. ``But we all make
lots of mistakes all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie of CraftShop had more modest goals for his site _ and
more modest financing to go with it. He said he had raised $3
million to $5 million for the site, which went online in January.
But he, too, was a victim of bad timing and less-than-perfect
execution. The company originally sought to open the site before
Christmas but failed because the technology was not ready; nor were
there photographs of the 40,000 or so craft products the site sold.
</P>
<P>
   When the site did get up and running, Mackie said, it was not
even close to meeting its sales goals, in part because it converted
less than 1 percent of its visitors into buyers. ``We didn't have
our merchandising department fleshed out,'' he said, ``so we didn't
do a very good job of merchandising.''
</P>
<P>
   Because CraftShop's investors, including the venture firm CMGI,
tied their financing to performance, the company did not receive
the bulk of a $15 million pledge earlier this year. By that time,
other venture capitalists were far too leery of e-tailing to come
to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   One final lesson for CraftShop, which may hold some truth for
the broader e-commerce market, was that the investors' timetable
may not coincide with the demands of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when we got our early angel financing in March '99 that
we were probably too late,'' Mackie said. ``People were already
beginning to ask the hard questions about performance. But if we'd
been earlier, the craft shoppers wouldn't have been ready, willing
and able. The marketplace is just now warming up to this.'' &QL;

FRANCE TELECOM REPORTED SET TO ACQUIRE ORANGE FROM VODAFONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   France Telecom is planning to announce Tuesday that it has
agreed to acquire Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest wireless
phone operator, from Vodafone AirTouch for more than $37 billion,
executives close to the negotiations said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would conclude one of the most highly anticipated deals
in Europe, which was supposed to attract bidders from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann AG, the
German industrial and telecommunications conglomerate, in early
February, Vodafone was required to sell Orange to appease
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies in Europe and even some in the
United States seeking to establish a foothold in Britain's
lucrative wireless market expressed interest in Orange, but the
expected auction never came.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, France Telecom, which had been talking to Vodafone even
before its acquisition of Mannesmann was completed, fired the
first, final and only shot for Orange before its rivals could get
to the table with an offer.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the talks, France Telecom will
pay about 40 billion euros in cash and stock, or $37.4 billion. It
will also assume about 10 billion euros, or $9.4 billion, in debt.
Vodafone, which will announce its 1999 earnings Sunday, will hold
about a 10 percent stake of nonvoting shares in the French company,
though it may eventually have to dispose of its new stake to
placate regulators.
</P>
<P>
   For France Telecom, the acquisition of Orange vaults it into the
upper echelon of European telecommunications competitors, giving it
substantial reach beyond its own borders. Orange has 6 million
customers in Britain plus alliances and other licensing
arrangements across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of Orange, France Telecom would obtain a
``universal mobile telecommunications system'' license to offer
fast Internet access on cellular phones. In April, a British
subsidiary of NTL of New York, backed by France Telecom, withdrew
from the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would put France Telecom in direct competition in
Britain with Vodafone, the largest wireless operator in the world;
British Telecommunications, which operates BT Cellnet; Deutsche
Telekom, which owns One2One; and TIW UMTS Ltd., which is owned in
part by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, another
recent winner of a so-called third-generation wireless license.
Hutchison Whampoa had owned a majority stake in Orange before it
was acquired by Mannesmann in October, which set off this entire
series of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom plans to merge Orange with its own wireless unit,
which includes Itineris, the largest wireless company in France,
with more than 10 million subscribers and operations in Denmark,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. It will
then spin off the combined company within a year, executives close
to the negotiations said, adding that Hans Snook, chief executive
of Orange, would run the new company. Snook had initially been
opposed to selling the company directly to a competitor but has
since become amenable to the deal, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's sale of Orange directly to a rival is a reversal of
its original plan to spin off Orange and sell shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the sale comes as a result of the recent spate of
high-revenue auctions across Europe for the third-generation
wireless licenses _ for mobile phones that may include Web browsing
and video conferences. Vodafone recently paid $9.42 billion for a
license in Britain and is competing for similar licenses across the
Continent. The higher-than-expected license fees have forced
Vodafone to try to raise cash. And amid plunging telecommunications
share prices generally, the company's stock has sharply fallen
since its acquisition of Mannesmann, to 2.8125 pounds at Friday's
close from 3.855 pounds at the time of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Vodafone said it would sell its entire stake in
Cegetel, a French phone company, to its partner Vivendi. Vodafone
had earlier said it would sell 7.5 percent of Mannesmann's stake in
Cegetel, but it decided to sell the whole stake _ 15 percent _ to
raise more cash. Vodafone also sold Mannesmann's engineering and
automotive unit, Atecs, for 9.6 billion euros to the German
companies Siemens and Robert Bosch in April.
</P>
<P>
   To support its acquisition of Orange, France Telecom is also
going on a selling spree to raise cash. It said on Friday that it
would sell most of its stake in Telefonos de Mexico to raise $1.9
billion. Telmex said it planned to buy the remaining stake for $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is being advised on the deal by Goldman, Sachs;
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette; Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, and UBS
Warburg. France Telecom is being advised by Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, Credit Suisse First Boston and N.M. Rothschild.

AT 102, A FIRST AUTHOR RECALLS SLAVE RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Wash., Texas)  By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the annals of publishing, few people have had to wait as long
as George Dawson to see their name on a book jacket. Dawson is 102.
But then he didn't begin to read until he was 98.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Dawson, who now reads at about a fourth-grade level,
and Richard Glaubman, a 50-year-old elementary schoolteacher from
Washington state, published ``Life Is So Good'' (Random House),
based on Dawson's account of growing up in East Texas among
relatives who had been slaves. Both Dawson and Glaubman are listed
as authors. The story is told partly in Dawson's words as recorded
by Glaubman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is So Good'' is an unusual history of a segment of black
American life in the '20s and '30s, propelled by Dawson's acute
powers of observation. It is about a dangerous era when the Klan
was on the rise, lynchings were common and it was unsafe even for a
black baseball team to beat a white team.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago Dawson visited New York City for the first time
from Dallas where he lives, accompanied by his 65-year-old son,
George Jr., a retired civilian communications employee of the Army,
and Glaubman. There was a party at the Century Club. There was a
book signing at a Barnes &AMP; Noble branch, a ride on the Staten
Island ferry and the rare experience of room service at the hotel,
with Dawson signing his name for it.
</P>
<P>
   He moved through it all at a good pace; people don't have to
slow their stride for him. Dawson hasn't lost any hair to baldness,
doesn't have false teeth, wears reading glasses only sometimes. And
although he has some hearing loss from working with heavy machinery
in a dairy, he gets by without a hearing aid. He has never spent a
night in a hospital. These days he sits rather quietly, politely
answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived right. Ate right, whatever I wanted to. Never
smoked,'' Dawson said over breakfast of toast with jam. And the
last time he had a drink, he said ``was in 1928.'' He went on: ``I
didn't love it. I just did it because the boys I was with were
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as interesting as longevity is, ``Life Is So Good'' presents
perhaps a more interesting story, one fashioned from on-the-ground
insight into the strategies that many black people devised to
survive the perils of life in the South at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his life, because he could not read or write, Dawson
didn't live by the written calendar, so dates are sparse.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in a log cabin in Marshall, Texas. His parents were
farmers; unlike many blacks of the rural South who were
sharecroppers, they owned their own hardscrabble piece of land. At
age 10, Dawson witnessed the lynching of a 17-year-old friend,
Pete, who was accused of raping a white girl.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the lynching his father gave him a piece of advice
that endured. ``His suffering is over, son,'' he said, according to
the book. ``Some of those white folks was mean and nasty. Some are
just scared. It doesn't matter. You have no right to judge another
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dawson has wasted no time with bitterness, he said.
According to the book, the girl's baby was born white, but, as
Dawson remembered it, ``No one said nothing.'' He states in the
book: ``I guess by then most folks, white folks anyway, had all
forgotten. I didn't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson didn't go to school because he worked from the age of 4
alongside his paternal grandmother and great-grandmother, combing
cotton and pressing sugar cane. They taught him slave songs, which
he can still sing, and told him stories. His grandmother, Charity,
recounted the day when she was young and her master, ``Mr.
Lester,'' told his slaves they were free. Some were afraid to
leave, others remained as sharecroppers. But, as Dawson relates,
they were enslaved again, accumulating debt at the plantation store
because they couldn't count. Eventually Charity's family enlisted
the help of a field hand, Tom, who knew numbers. The family worked
off its debt, and Tom married Charity.
</P>
<P>
   When Dawson was 12, his father, Harrison, had to hire him out to
a white farmer for $1.50 a month, he wrote. As a young man he built
levees for 50 cents a day, worked in a sawmill and laid railroad
tracks. He often worked hungry.
</P>
<P>
   The book spins out his continuing adventures. He rode the rails,
landing in Mexico in 1923, astounded to discover that a black man
could be served alongside whites. He pitched on a Negro baseball
team. In 1926, while breaking wild horses on a farm in the Texas
Panhandle, he encountered a 16-year-old girl, Elzenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rough boy,'' he said. ``I was just clowning, that's
all. That bought her.'' Elzenia became his wife. She died about 15
years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Dawson said, he pretended he could read. He signed
his name with an x. He would make his seven children read their
homework aloud to him. His son George said he never knew his father
could not read or write until he was in the Navy in Korea and
Vietnam and did not get letters from him. And because Dawson could
not write, he was unable to file for promotion in his job at the
dairy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, all his children attended college. Two are now
deceased. Surviving, besides George, are Amelia Parks, 72, who
worked in a medical library until she retired; Dorothy Jiles, 64, a
kindergarten worker; Cecelia Ervin, 60, a homemaker; and Darrel,
51, a manager for the United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   After Elzenia died, Dawson married three more times, all women
he met in church and all of whom have died. ``I had four good
wives,'' he said. ``I didn't fuss with them. We sit down and agree
with each other.'' One reason that he hasn't saved money, he said,
is that he wanted to give each a dignified burial.
</P>
<P>
   After Dawson retired from his dairy job in the late '60s, he
continued working, mostly as a gardener. In the book he describes
the day the woman he was working for brought him lunch on the back
porch with her dogs. He was hungry, he said, but he refused to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a human being,'' he told her, according to the book.
Quiet refusal could be said to be Dawson's modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 90, he retired for good. He received $520 a month in
Social Security. His house was dilapidated and leaked, but he
continued to care for himself. His house was so ridden with mice
they invaded his groceries. He solved the problem by putting a
potato on the floor for them to eat, which stopped their bothering
him.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 98 he heard about the adult literacy class at the
Lincoln Instructional Center, in his old neighborhood high school,
and signed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to read my ABC's in two days _ I was in a hurry,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His teacher was Carl Henry, who came out of retirement from the
school system to work at the center. ``It took him about six months
to learn how to read simple words,'' Henry said. Dawson now reads
his Bible every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to teach him to print,'' Henry remembered. But Dawson
insisted on learning cursive, which was harder.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Larry Bingham, a columnist for The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, wrote an article about Dawson. It was syndicated in
The Seattle Times, and Glaubman spotted it. ``I thought, `How does
he have so much courage to start?''' Glaubman said. It could make
an inspirational story for his students, he thought. Glaubman had
lost his father the year before, he said in the book, and felt an
emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   Glaubman decided to visit Dawson, and Dawson agreed to let him
write a book. While he was researching and writing, he often stayed
at Dawson's house. The two alternated cooking and in the evenings
played dominoes and watched ``Jeopardy.'' At first Glaubman wrote a
children's book. But he realized he had more to say, so he began an
adult version.
</P>
<P>
   As Glaubman wrote, he was conscious of Dawson's mortality. ``You
think, `You've got to finish before he dies,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaubman's children's book was turned down uniformly by
publishers. But an editor put him in touch with an agent, Harriet
Wasserman. Wasserman read the adult version and quickly sold it to
Random House. Glaubman would not reveal the advance but described
it as quite decent. The initial printing was 100,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Dawson wanted to use his half of the advance to
renovate his house. But the house was in such disrepair that it has
been torn down. He is building a new one and has moved in with
George Jr. temporarily .
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dawson's routine has been unvaried. Up at 5 a.m., he
has a cup of hot chocolate, two pieces of bread and a glass of hot
water. When Dawson was living in his own house, Henry would pick
him up each morning and drive him to literacy class.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the question of mortality lingers in the air. But
Dawson said he was not afraid of death. ``I want to rest,'' he
said. ``I have no fear, no worry.'' When death finally comes, he
added, he knows that he will finally be in a place that he calls
``Gloryland.''

`BIOGRAPHY OF A GERM': LYME DISEASE MICROBE HAS ITS OWN STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gaia'' is a term invented around 1950 by an English theorist,
James Lovelock, suggesting a kind of ultimate ecological
connectedness, the idea that living things are so interlocked in
function that all of them, from microbes to elephants, are part of
a single immense organism.
</P>
<P>
   In his informative and clever little book, ``Biography of a
Germ,'' Arno Karlen, a psychoanalyst who has written other books on
biology and medical history, rejects the more fuzzily spiritual
concepts of gaia. He does not see the entire biosphere as ``one big
pulsating organism.''
</P>
<P>
   Still his description of the life of a single microscopic
organism does bring into focus the interrelatedness of living
things, in this instance of white mice, deer, ticks, the microbe
Borrelia burgdorferi and the man-made condition of various flora.
</P>
<P>
   The germ in question, which is at the center of Karlen's book,
causes Lyme disease, and that has made it an object of considerable
interest in the last couple of decades. Borrelia burgdorferi, known
as Bb, was discovered only in 1982, not long after Lyme disease was
identified, but it has been on the planet, living in nonhuman
organisms, since before there were human organisms, and it will
probably still be here after the humans are gone.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason, Karlen says, that this germ is a good
subject for a ``biography,'' as good in its way as a conventional
biography of some influential human figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life stories of animals and insects, like biographies of
people, have a purpose,'' Karlen writes. ``They illuminate the
community of life, showing what makes species different and what
unites them. They show that by knowing any creature, one better
understands the living web in which it, and we, are threads.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlen almost overdoes this point, prefacing his plunge into the
germ itself with a good deal of throat-clearing, edging over from
the clever to the adorable here and there and straining a bit too
much for both literary effect and ecological enlightenment. The
interrelatedness of things has been drummed into us enough these
days, and Karlen's reiteration belabors the principle.
</P>
<P>
   But when he gets to Bb itself, Karlen's book becomes informative
and entertaining at the same time, a fine piece of popular-science
writing that covers the biological basics for those who do not know
them but covers them stylishly enough for the more informed to gain
insight, too.
</P>
<P>
   The stress is on the biological diversity of microbes _ such
that ``Bb and the bacilli in sour milk differ from each other more
than hummingbirds and eagles do'' _ and the slyness of genetic
adaptation. Along the way Karlen summarizes matters like the
Linnaean system of classification, the 17th-century discovery of
microbes, and the various types and sizes of microscopic creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Bb is a spirochete, one of the three main shapes of bacteria; it
is a long, slender spiral similar in some ways to the organism that
causes syphilis. It takes what Karlen calls a fantastic voyage to
get into the human bloodstream, a voyage that provokes a fair
degree of wonderment about the complexity of things and about their
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Karlen clearly enjoys the irony that Bb in recent years invaded
human beings, not as the result of our doing ``bad'' things like
despoiling the environment or pushing other species into extinction
but because we did such ``good'' things as protecting the natural
world.
</P>
<P>
   The peregrinations of Bb take it from ticks to white-footed
mice, which are warm-blooded, and back into the gut of a tick,
which is, as Karlen graphically puts it, like being cast ``in one
moment from a hot tub to a meat locker.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains succinctly how the microbe manages to survive this
shock and also to survive the intense invisible battle that all
microbes must fight with the varied arsenals of their hosts' immune
systems, the attacks of white blood cells, T cells and antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Bb fights this battle continuously as it moves from its second
tick to another warm-blooded animal, possibly a raccoon or a
rabbit, and back to a tick, which then must pass a critical stage
of its life cycle on a deer before infecting a human being.
</P>
<P>
   As he recounts Bb's life history, Karlen along the way addresses
interesting questions like whether ticks themselves get sick from
Bb, and if not, why not. He gives a brief history of the emergence
of Lyme disease in Lyme, Conn., in the late 1970s, which is itself
a fascinating story, and then the discovery of Bb by a Swiss
biologist named Willy Burgdorfer, working in a lab in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   A critical part of the story was the long-term transformation of
the landscape of the American Northeast, from forest to farm, and
then in furtherance of the conservation movement, back to
semiforest again. The invasion of human beings by Bb, which
depended on the reintroduction of deer to the habitat without the
introduction of the deer's erstwhile natural enemies, was the
unintended consequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyme disease could not have become epidemic until a changing
ecosystem revived Bb and its hosts, and suburbanization thrust
people into their midst,'' Karlen writes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He adds that the case of Lyme disease is not the only one in
which humans have unwittingly placed themselves at the intersection
of microbes and other animals. He provides the additional example
of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, which became epidemic when
insecticides ingested by lizards ended up killing the cats (which
ate the lizards) that were the only natural enemy of the mice that
bore the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Karlen closes with some facts and questions concerning Lyme
disease itself, reassuring us that most people's immune systems
take care of Bb's invasion without outside intervention, which is
most commonly antibiotics. Indeed, there is a sharp debate among
specialists about the usefulness of antibiotics, which some doctors
feel are unnecessary and are likely to lead to more resistant Bb
strains.
</P>
<P>
   Karlen handles his subject with wit and comprehensiveness. His
book will help you know where you are going the next time you take
a little walk in some pleasant meadow.

DON'T EXPECT RAPID CONVERGENCE OF INTERNET, PHONE, VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ For all of the buzzwords in the technology
industry, perhaps none is invoked as blindly, reflexively and
totemically as ``convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to a senior technology executive these days and you will
probably hear about how television, the telephone system and the
Internet are converging to create an interactive world of
information and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, convergence is not really happening, at least not
yet. And when it does, it will probably take forms much different
than those generally envisioned today.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a conclusion a visitor might have expected to bring
away from the annual Vortex conference that ended on Friday here on
the Pacific Coast. Vortex is about convergence, and it may be North
America's most concentrated gathering of top communications
investors and executives. But according to an automated polling
service at the conference, Vortex attendees gave convergence an
overall letter grade of D-plus for now.
</P>
<P>
   They recognize that even though billions of dollars are being
spent on convergence, immense obstacles remain. And in the end,
convergence will be far less than universal.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Vortex conference two years ago, the mood about
convergence was positively giddy. ``Two years ago here I remember
people looking at the new carriers, the Qwests and Level 3's, and
thinking that they were just going to make convergence happen,''
said a senior technical executive for a regional communications
carrier. ``I think what's impressing me this year is a new sense of
maturity _ sobriety even.''
</P>
<P>
   A 21-percent drop in the Nasdaq will sober up just about anyone
in the technology business. And it has. But beyond the financial
picture, the emerging sense of realism about convergence seems
based on a simple and renewed appreciation of the mundane technical
obstacles that stand in its way, and on some newly creative
thinking about what sorts of services will best embody it.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, convergence is the last mile. That sounds obvious,
but the last few years, at least some technology pundits,
executives and investors have drooled over the exponential
increases in bandwidth capacity in the nation's long-distance fiber
optic networks and mistaken that for convergence.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the leaps in long-haul capacity, no more than 2
percent of the nation's 100 million or so homes currently log on
the Internet with anything more powerful than an analog modem. The
last mile of the nation's communications networks _ or the first
mile, depending on who's holding the mouse _ is the part that
actually touches homes. But this crucial link has not kept pace
with the rest of the network.
</P>
<P>
   The digital subscriber line technology that local phone
companies want to use to deliver torrents of Internet data over
traditional copper phone lines has had a particularly tough time
living up to expectations. DSL is far more difficult to put in
place than was originally thought. And the bandwidth, or speed, it
delivers is far less than was first contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, when many of the nation's leading computer,
software and local communications companies formed an alliance to
support DSL, they thought it would generally deliver 1.5 million
digital bits per second to consumers' homes. Today, it is unlikely
that more than a quarter of the few hundred thousand residences
with working DSL are consistently receiving more than a million
bits, or a megabit, per second. Industry experts say that most DSL
users probably receive only about 500,000 bits per second, at best.
Cable modems, the main alternative to DSL, more frequently deliver
megabit-plus speeds, but in some ways those communications pathways
are less reliable than DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even 500,000 bits per second is still an order of
magnitude faster than the 53,000 or so bits per second that can be
delivered by today's fastest analog modems. But consider that a
single channel of TV-quality video, using compression technology,
requires at least 2 million bits per second and often requires more
than 5 million bits per second; it becomes quite clear that for the
majority of consumers, television as they know it is not going to
be converging with the Internet soon.
</P>
<P>
   But then, merging TV with the Internet is probably the wrong
goal, anyway. Television is a one-way, centrally created and
distributed medium. It is not the killer application for the
Internet because the Internet does not operate like TV.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, most demonstrations of converged applications that
include video, including those at Vortex, are essentially
television with some interactive buttons, like ``buy now,'' or
``chat about this program,'' tacked on the side of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trap is when people think about this new media strictly in
the context of the old,'' said Michael O'Dell, chief scientist for
Worldcom's Uunet division, the No. 1 Internet carrier. ``I have a
problem believing that the future of the Internet is a bad version
of cable TV.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Pushpendra Mohta, until recently one of
AT&AMP;T's top Internet engineers and now entrepreneur-in-residence at
the venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, shared an analogy he
picked up at a conference on wireless data services: ``If you are
used to shipping stuff by boat and all of a sudden you get access
to an airplane,'' he said, ``you don't put the boat on the airplane
and fly the boat to your destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than take the form of merely repackaged traditional
media, the most successful converged services will probably be cut
wholly from new cloth to take advantage of the specific
characteristics of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, the service that allows users to swap digital music
files, is a perfect example. And some technology experts believe
that Napster is already consuming more of the Internet's bandwidth
than the leading Web portal, Yahoo! Rather than simply selling
compact discs online or streaming radio stations _ the audio
equivalent of adding a ``chat now'' button to a TV program _ the
nature of Napster's service emerged from the Internet. In fact,
Vinod Khosla, the venture capitalist from Kleiner Perkins Caufield
&AMP; Byers, said trying to repackage traditional media online was
actually hindering the deployment of broadband communications and
converged services in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to migrate old services to a new medium,
the barriers are high and the payoffs aren't that great,'' Khosla
said. ``But when you have a new service, maybe the barrier is high
but I'll climb over it because the payoff is higher.''

CITY BALLET CELEBRATES BALANCHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Ballet honored its founding
choreographer on Friday night with a program at the New York State
Theater that celebrated George Balanchine's extraordinary creative
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   There were many exhilarating moments. Nevertheless the evening
was dominated by ``Robert Schumann's `Davidsbuendlertaenze,'''
Balanchine's melancholy masterpiece of 1980. The title, which
refers to the accompanying piano score and its composer, reveals no
hint of the work's emotional content. As a result the changing
choreographic moods come as surprises.
</P>
<P>
   At first the ballet seems to be a suite for some ardent young
people dancing in an unaccountably gloomy ballroom designed by
Rouben Ter-Arutunian. The dancers on this occasion were Helene
Alexopoulos, Maria Kowroski, Kyra Nichols, Wendy Whelan, Charles
Askegard, Nikolaj Hubbe, Nilas Martins and Jock Soto, and all but
Nichols and Hubbe were making debuts in their roles.
</P>
<P>
   At times the dancers looked blithely innocent, and at other
times passionate. But it soon became apparent that Nichols and
Askegard were an unusual couple, for he appeared to be wandering
off into a dream world all his own while Nichols tried to steady
him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years some balletgoers have interpreted the character
Askegard portrayed as a symbol of Schumann himself, who had mental
illness. But this role could represent any emotionally disturbed or
physically ill person who finds himself divorced from reality and
unable to cope with life.
</P>
<P>
   As the entire cast's dancing grew increasingly intense, as if in
response to the troubles of Askegard and the ever solicitous
Nichols, one could understand the reason for the gloomy scenery,
and the sense of drama was enhanced by Richard Moredock's
introspective performance of Schumann's score.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine turned courtly and convivial in ``Le Tombeau de
Couperin.'' In this intricately patterned work to Ravel, two groups
of dancers move as if they were mirror images of each other, and on
Friday they moved with considerable charm.
</P>
<P>
   Charm was also one of the virtues of ``Tchaikovsky Pas de
Deux.'' This virtuosic duet can be danced with extroverted flair.
But Margaret Tracey and Robert Tewsley, a guest artist from the
Stuttgart Ballet, emphasized the choreography's graciousness, and
Tewsley's control, ease and sense of quiet joy were especially
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The program, conducted by Maurice Kaplow, also included a repeat
performance of ``Symphony in Three Movements,'' an exciting ballet
to Stravinsky in which Balanchine appears to be trying to turn
dancers into lightning bolts.

THE CHALLENGE FOR MICROSOFT IS IN MIDDLEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government's antitrust suit against Microsoft has provided
plenty of surprises the last two years. But surely one of its most
remarkable byproducts is that a nerdish bit of computer plumbing
called middleware has emerged as the star of the case and a focus
of public-policy debate in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   In his legal ruling last month, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had no doubts about what so frightened Microsoft that it repeatedly
violated the nation's antitrust laws. ``Middleware,'' he wrote,
``threatened to demolish Microsoft's coveted monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Justice Department and states suing Microsoft
called earlier this month for the company to be split in two, the
rationale for such a harsh remedy was largely to make the world
safe for middleware _ a layer of software that acts as a technology
translator between the basic computer operating system and the
various applications programs that people use to carry out tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft,'' the government declared, ``has repeatedly, and in
a variety of ways, used the monopoly power of its operating systems
to prevent the development, distribution and success of middleware
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may well issue his remedies order later this week _
probably approving the government's call for a breakup, antitrust
experts say. Anticipating that, Microsoft on Friday postponed a
gathering of news media and industry analysts that had been
scheduled for this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the event, rescheduled for June 22, the company was to detail
its technology plans for the next few years, including an
initiative called ``Next Generation Windows Services.'' To its
critics, the Microsoft effort appears to be intended to fold more
Internet software into its industry-standard Windows operating
system. And such a move, they say, would be a rerun of the tactics
the government cited in asking for a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft,'' the government said, ``has combined the software
code of separate middleware products with the code of its monopoly
operating system _ again with the purpose and effect of foreclosing
customer choice and excluding competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Microsoft, the middleware declarations of Judge Jackson
and the government reflect a puzzling inability of those in
Washington to comprehend the software business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government,'' Microsoft wrote in reply, ``seeks to
regulate Microsoft's inclusion of any `middleware' in Windows _ a
term the government defines so broadly as to include virtually
 &UR; any &LR;  feature Microsoft might add to its operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is' all the fuss about anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Middleware, a layer of software residing above the operating
system that applications can run on, has been around since the
mainframe days. But it has taken on a far more significant role in
recent years because of the Internet and the rise of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike desktop computing, which Microsoft dominates through its
Windows operating system, Internet computing is based on open
communications standards that are not owned or controlled by any
single software maker.
</P>
<P>
   As electronic commerce spreads, more and more companies are
writing Internet applications _ for sharing data, handling
transactions and so on _ that are written to run on top of a layer
of middleware. Because middleware runs on a variety of operating
systems, programmers can write a single version of an application,
rather than having to write various versions for different
operating systems, like Windows and Unix.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a diverse, global network, and middleware can
serve as the translator that enables the different dialects of
computing to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these distributed Internet applications increase, so does
the use of middleware,'' said Dan Kusnetzky, an analyst at the
International Data Corp., a research firm. ``And that makes
operating systems less and less important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Raduchel, the chief technology officer of America Online,
observed, ``Almost all the new applications in computing are being
written above the operating system. The challenge in software now
is to write for the middleware.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet middleware business is growing fast, but still in
its infancy. There are perhaps 200 suppliers. International Data
estimated middleware sales at $2.77 billion last year, up 66
percent from two years earlier. Both growth and consolidation are
predicted for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big battle of this decade is going to be in middleware,
not operating systems,'' said John Swainson, a general manager in
IBM's software group.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, not surprisingly, views things quite differently.
``We focus on the platform _ the set of technologies and services
that software developers need to write programs,'' said Tod
Nielsen, vice president of Microsoft's platform group. ``Drawing a
distinction between the operating system and middleware isn't
something we necessarily do.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's platform group is creating the so-called Next
Generation Windows Services. Many of the details are not known, but
generally it is an effort to have software developers write the new
wave of Internet applications to run on Microsoft's layer of
software instead of on middleware provided by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   One Microsoft executive explained, ``Think of these new Windows
services as API's for the Internet.'' API's, or application program
interfaces, are the software hooks to which programmers must tailor
their applications if they are to run smoothly. In the government's
antitrust suit, the Windows API's were portrayed as a key
instrument of the company's control of the industry _ enabling
Microsoft to withhold or delay rivals' access to that technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet middleware could allow software developers to write
for the middleware API's instead of Windows API's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's monopoly is particularly threatened by the
development of `cross-platform middleware' _ software that exposes
API's that are not controlled by Microsoft and that could be
accessed using a wide range of operating systems,'' Rebecca
Henderson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management, wrote in a brief on behalf
of the government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft views its Internet initiative as repeating its past
behavior, but in a very different light than its critics. Just as
Windows took care of the innards of personal computing, Microsoft
executives say they want to perform a similar role with Internet
software. ``Software developers want a solid foundation, so they
can write value-added products, not plumbing,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft, the Next Generation Windows Services program could
supply that ``solid foundation'' for the Internet. And the project,
Microsoft protested in a court filing last week, ``will be doomed
to failure at the outset if Microsoft is split along the arbitrary
lines proposed by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the more closed environment of the personal computer
business, of course, no company benefited as much as Microsoft,
since it owned the industry-standard technology. With the open
technology standards of the Internet, however, Microsoft will face
a very different business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Generation Windows Services is part of the
repositioning of the company to compete in this evolving Internet
world,'' said Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc.
``But it's not the PC model. No one can own the standards, and
Microsoft knows that. If they're not open, they're toast.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE REAL ROCKET, THE ONLY ROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other athletes are known today as The Rocket, notably pitcher
Roger Clemens, the tennis legend Rod Laver and wide receiver Raghib
Ismael, but they plagiarized the nickname. To anyone who saw
Maurice Richard play hockey, he was not only the original Rocket,
he also deserved to be remembered as the real Rocket, the only
Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Babe defined George Herman Ruth, Rocket defined the
Montreal Canadiens' folk hero who set all the National Hockey
League goal-scoring records that Gordie Howe and Wayne Gretzky
eventually shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Richard scored in the hockey cathedral that was the
Montreal Forum, hats, programs, galoshes and newspapers were tossed
onto the ice in celebration as the public-address announcer boomed
formally, first in French and then in English, ``Goal by Maur-eees
Reee-chard.''
</P>
<P>
   But his coach and former linemate at left wing, Hector (Toe)
Blake, usually referred to him as ``Rocket.'' So did his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat beside Rocket in the dressing room for the seven years I
played with him,'' the center Jean Beliveau once said. ``He was an
inspiration and the idol of my generation. On the team we all knew
he was kind of an introvert and not the greatest talker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in his own way, he was a leader and, as players and as a
team, we followed him because we were inspired by his desire to
win. When we lost, Rocket did not need to say anything to show how
hard he accepted defeat. You could see it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those blazing eyes, which finally closed Saturday when he
died at 78 after a two-year struggle with abdominal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When he had the puck and swooped toward them, goaltenders
compared those eyes to headlights and searchlights. Chuck Rayner,
once a Rangers goaltender, said that Rocket's hand-eye coordination
as a right wing with a lefthanded shot put every puck ``an inch
inside'' the goal post. He made the No. 9 on his bleu-blanc-rouge
uniform hockey's most fashionable number, worn later by Gordie
Howe, Bobby Hull and Andy Bathgate among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are better hockey players,'' Richard once said, ``but
they don't work as hard. I like to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 seasons, the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup eight
times, including a record five in a row when he was their captain.
He still holds the career record for most overtime playoff goals,
six, including three in 1951, and shares the record for most goals
in a playoff game, five.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 82 goals in 133 playoff games, 18 were game-winners.
Gretzky is the record-holder with 24, in 221 games. The Devils'
Claude Lemieux is next with 19 in 215 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocket always enjoyed scoring goals,'' Beliveau added. ``I'll
always remember that he scored four goals in the scrimmage that
morning in the fall of 1960, then announced his retirement. He was
39 and had had a couple of injuries, including a torn Achilles'
tendon.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard once spent a day helping to move furniture into a new
home for his wife, Lucille, then scored five goals that night. He
set 17 records, such as 544 regular-season goals and 50 goals in
the 50-game season of 1944-45 during the final months of World War
II, prompting some observers to wonder if he was merely a wartime
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   But when many quality players returned to the NHL from military
service, Richard was even more dynamic, more famous. Of all his
contemporaries, only the younger Howe would eventually be rated
better all-around in that six-team league, long before Gretzky and
Mario Lemieux thrived in an NHL diluted by expansion.
</P>
<P>
   With his slick black hair and sturdy 5-foot-10{-inch frame,
Richard was an eight-time first-team All-Star, the sociological
pride of the French-speaking province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Richard was not only the best of the French-Canadian players
that stocked the Montreal team in those years long before the
integration of the American and European players, he was also the
best of all the players from the other Canadian provinces where
English is the primary language.
</P>
<P>
   Often fined for flareups, his internal flame sometimes exploded.
When cut by Hal Laycoe's stick late in the 1954-55 season at the
Boston Garden, he attacked the Bruins defenseman with his stick.
When linesman Cliff Thompson tried to stop the assault, Richard
punched him twice in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Campbell, then the NHL president, suspended Richard for
the three remaining games of the season and the entire playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   When Campbell, whose office was in Montreal, took his seat at
the Forum for the Canadiens' next game, he was pelted with trash
and someone threw a tear-gas cannister on the ice. The fumes sent a
sellout crowd hurrying onto Ste. Catherine Street, where store
windows were broken and merchandise looted in what was called ``the
Richard Riot.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Richard was persuaded to go on the radio to calm
the city, but the Montreal fans never forgave Campbell for the
suspension that cost him the NHL scoring title (which he never won)
as well as the Canadiens' bid that year for the Stanley Cup, which
they lost to Detroit in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Campbell appreciated Richard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' Campbell once said, ``have I met a man with such
singleness of purpose and so completely dedicated to his
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL created a new award a year ago, the Maurice Richard
trophy for the regular-season's goal-scoring leader. And as well as
his youngest brother by 15 years, Henri, naturally nicknamed the
Pocket Rocket, played as a member of a record 11 Stanley Cup
champions in Montreal, Maurice remains the original Rocket, the
only Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still tell me,'' Henri has often said in recent years,
``that I'm Maurice's little brother.'' &QL;

   IN A TALE OF TWO OFFERINGS, BEST OF TIMES ENDS FOR ONE
</P>
<P>
   On the list of 1999's best initial public offerings, Ditech
Communications and FreeMarkets were among the best performers, with
Ditech's stock ending the year up 611 percent from its offering
price and FreeMarkets' ending with a gain of 750 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. So far in 2000, their fates
have diverged as much as any two stocks' could. Ditech's share
price is up nearly 90 percent this year, while FreeMarkets' is down
by nearly the same amount. Unfortunately, FreeMarkets is more
representative of what has happened to last year's hot new
offerings than is Ditech, showing how far stocks can fall when
market sentiment shifts.

<P>
   `CONVERGENCE' STILL A BLANK SLATE
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the buzzwords in the technology industry, perhaps none
is invoked as reflexively as ``convergence,'' the melding of
television, the telephone system and the Internet into an
interactive world of information and entertainment. But convergence
is not really happening, at least not yet. And when it does, it
will probably take forms very different from those generally
envisioned today.
</P>
<P>
   E-DARWINISM MAY NOT SPARE FITTEST
</P>
<P>
   The recent closings of Toysmart, CraftShop.com, Brandwise.com
and Boo.com have been the most visible e-commerce casualties to
date, and the consensus within the Internet industry is that more
closings will follow quickly. But analysts disagree about the
meaning of the recent closings. Some say the shakeout represents a
healthy dose of digital Darwinism. But others suggest that as
investors continue their wholesale rejection of consumer e-commerce
companies, they may be condemning some companies that deserve a
better fate.
</P>
<P>
   FILM WEB SITES BREAKING OLD GROUND
</P>
<P>
   The film industry loves the familiarity of sequels, so it comes
as no surprise that the Web sites for this year's roster of
potential summer box-office blockbusters are mostly formulaic
rehashes of past sites.
</P>
<P>
   SALON CHANGES PROMPT COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Salon introduced a redesigned site last week, and it did not
take long before critiques started pouring in by e-mail: The site
had technical bugs; it was too cluttered; its new, smaller type
font was too hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's editor, David Talbot, said Salon was tinkering with the
site to fix the bugs and to address concerns about the font size.
But Salon's readers are not the only audience that matters. Talbot
also said that the redesign gave more prominent placement to
advertisers and made it easier to find room for continuous breaking
news.
</P>
<P>
   PLOT TWIST FOR GIULIANI BIOGRAPHIES
</P>
<P>
   At first, the furor over the personal life of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York might have seemed like the ultimate publicity
blitz for two New York journalists _ Wayne Barrett, an
investigative reporter for The Village Voice, and Andrew Kirtzman,
a political reporter for New York One, the cable TV news station _
who are rushing to complete biographies of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Giuliani has withdrawn from the Senate race,
publishing experts wonder whether the books have lost their
urgency. Kirtzman said he would revise his introduction, and in his
final chapter would track the mayor as he agonized over his final
decision. Barrett said he had added chapters to include this
month's roller-coaster ride for his book.
</P>
<P>
   INQUIRIES BEGUN INTO AIRLINE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of New York and Pennsylvania have begun
inquiries into the effect that the proposed United Airlines
acquisition of US Airways would have on competition.

<P>
   U.S. MARKETS CLOSED FOR HOLIDAY
</P>
<P>
   U.S. financial markets, banks and government offices are closed
Monday in observance of Memorial Day. In addition, markets,
government offices and most businesses are closed in Britain for
the spring bank holiday. Markets in most other countries are open.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Inclement conditions will linger in the southern Middle Atlantic
States as weakening low pressure moves off the Carolina coast. The
heaviest showers will be in southeastern Virginia and northeastern
North Carolina as cooler air arrives on northeasterly winds. Clouds
and lighter showers will linger near the southern and central
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, sunshine will be mixed with clouds. Clouds will
thicken over the mountains of northern New York and New England,
where a few afternoon sprinkles will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually hot weather for late May will cover a large area from
the southwestern states to the central Plains. Late Monday, strong
thunderstorms will develop across Nebraska and Iowa as a cold front
lifts the increasingly humid air mass. Meanwhile, the Northwest
will be seasonably cool with a few mountain showers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WHEN SUMMER BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of summer can be defined in many ways. The
Memorial Day weekend is the traditional start of the summer season.
Nevertheless, for ease of record keeping, climatologists consider
summer to be the months of June, July and August. However, the
warmest 90-day period in most of the contiguous United States
begins around June 6. The season will begin officially on June 20,
when the summer solstice occurs. The solstice, an astronomical
event, is when the noontime sun is directly overhead at the Tropic
of Cancer, 23.5 degrees of latitude north of the equator.

   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ ``Brother Buck'' believes the Vietnam
Syndrome _ that is, the reluctance of American leaders to send U.S.
soldiers to far-away trouble spots of the world _ has just about
run its course in the making of this country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, and with the passing of nearly three decades, ``Brother
Buck'' still views issues of war and peace through the prism of his
experience in Vietnam _ a habit that is unlikely to change if he is
elected president of the United States this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother Buck'' is Vice President Al Gore. And as the
Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee, Gore is closer
to becoming the nation's commander-in-chief than any other veteran
of America's longest war and one of the most divisive wars.
</P>
<P>
   It is instructive, then, to measure the degree to which Gore's
military experience has shaped his policy views, especially as
America's national security interests and military planning begin
to shift away from Europe and the Cold War toward Asia as the most
likely arena for future military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Gore discussed those views during an interview with Cox
Newspapers on the campus of the U.S. Military Academy following his
commencement address to the graduating cadets Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think about Vietnam when considering issues of war
and peace,'' Gore said. ``Certainly, it was on my mind when I voted
for the Gulf War, or understood the necessity of sending NATO
troops to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted in the private study of Lt. Gen.
Daniel William Christman, the West Point superintendent,
overlooking the parade ground from which came the likes of Lee,
Grant, MacArthur, Eisenhower and Patton.
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules for the interview were simple _ no discussion
of his presidential campaign or his Republican rival, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush. ``Not here at West Point,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But the contrast between Gore and Bush in terms of military
experience is inevitable. While Bush rarely mentions his stateside
service in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War,
Gore rarely misses an opportunity to remind his audiences of his
service in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, during the interview, acknowledged that military
experience is not a prerequisite for policymakers, not even
presidents. And he suggested that it is time to stop judging ``baby
boomers'' who did not serve in the military during Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some distinguished leaders in the past have not had military
experience, so you can't say it's essential,'' Gore said. ``But I
can only speak to my own experience in life. I would find it hard
to relate to these cadets today or to the soldiers I meet on duty
in the same way that I do if I had not had the experience of
serving in uniform and serving my country overseas myself. It gives
an extra dimension about what you think and feel when you're
talking about the issues that face them.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans of Gore's generation made the decision he did _ to
enlist in the military rather than avoid the draft. He did so as
his father, Al Gore Sr., an opponent of the war in the U.S. Senate,
was facing a tough re-election campaign. The senior Gore lost, and
shortly thereafter, on Dec. 26, 1970, his father's birthday, the
younger Gore was shipped off to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not pass judgement on anyone who made a decision
different from mine in the 1960s or '70s about military service,''
Gore said. ``Everybody faced a different personal situation. The
country made a big mistake in its policy. A lot of time has passed
and as far as I'm concerned, we just ought to cut everybody some
slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over his own experience, Gore said, ``The
consequences of peace fading into war are not abstract for me.
Anyone who has been part of an expeditionary force of Americans
sent to another country to defend our interests has seen firsthand
what it means for tens of thousands of young soldiers to travel
from here half-way around the world to deploy in war zones and what
it means to their families and what it means to their home towns
and to the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not theory,'' he added. ``That's not just words. That's
something that I lived. And that has an impact on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The trauma of Vietnam affected not only those who served there,
but also policymakers and military planners. For nearly three
decades, military analysts have spoken of a Vietnam Syndrome, a
psychological barrier to initiate military action for fear of heavy
casualties of an open-ended commitment of troops.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, when asked if this barrier exists today, replied, ``I
actually think that what we used to talk about all the time as the
Vietnam Syndrome has pretty much run its course.''
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. military actions, beginning with Grenada, the
Persian Gulf War and, most recently, the conflicts in Yugoslavia _
Bosnia and Kosovo _ have demonstrated that ``our military is
well-trained and the lessons of Vietnam so well integrated to our
strategy and tactics that the specific fears that Vietnam aroused
have dissipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``there is an enduring isolationist streak in the
way many Americans think about foreign policy _ and a natural and
healthy reluctance to get involved overseas,'' he added. ``That
existed before Vietnam and it exists after the Vietnam Syndrome, as
a specific phenomenon, as faded.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Other Vietnam veterans have run for president, most notably,
Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a former Navy S.E.A.L. who was awarded
the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration. But
none have been as politically successful as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not a ``grunt'' in Vietnam, a foot soldier who sloshed
through rice paddies in pursuit of elusive Viet Cong. He was an
``information specialist,'' essentially, an Army journalist,
writing for the Castle Courier, the newspaper of the 20th Engineer
Brigade, based at Bien Hoa, a large Army and Air Force base about
40 miles north of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore experienced the military conflict in the jungles of
Indochina in ways few Americans of his generation did, especially
those, like him, of America's privileged class.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of only two graduates of his Harvard class who
enlisted in the military and chose to go to Vietnam. And during his
five months ``in country,'' he ``never tried to get out of
anything,'' said Michael O'Hara, a sportswriter for the Detroit
News who served with Gore in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   That included guard duty at Ben Hoa and helicopter trips around
the country to report on the various projects of the engineering
brigade _ sometimes south to the Mekong Delta, sometimes north to
the DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone that theoretically separated North
and South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara is the one who tagged Gore with the nickname, ``Brother
Buck.'' Its origin is forgotten by both men. ``It may have had
something to do with Tennessee or Davy Crockett or some nonsense
like that, I just don't remember,'' said O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara recalled how the two of them once spent a couple of days
in a deserted foxhole in Khe Sanh where the engineers were building
an airstrip to support the incursion into Laos in 1971. Gore kept
piling large pieces of abandoned sheet metal over the foxhole _
just in case. ``I needled him with `I thought you were building a
high-rise','' O''Hara said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's experiences in Vietnam have colored every foreign policy
decision of his political career, from his early years in Congress
trying to understand the threat of nuclear proliferation to, most
dramatically, his vote in the Senate, against political party
pressures, to support ``Operation Desert Storm'' against Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is very much a part of his campaign for president as
well. Some of the campaign television ads prepared for his
``reintroduction'' to the American voters this summer feature
photos of the young Gore in Vietnam jungle fatigues, carrying an
M-16 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidential campaign, Gore has paraded his
Vietnam experience, often sprinkling references to his military
services throughout a speech, sometimes in a grave manner,
sometimes jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   This Memorial Day weekend, for example, in his speech to the
graduating cadets at West Point, Gore got the soon-to-be second
lieutenants to laugh heartily when he mockingly bragged of ``rising
all the way to the rank of Spec-Five,'' the rank equivalent of a
buck sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a luncheon in the garden of the academy
superintendent's home, Christman, Gore recovered from a military
protocol mistake _ he called the officers to attention for an
awards ceremony _ with another joke: ``Did I mention that I was a
Spec-Five?''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a deadly serious decision for Gore to enlist in the
military _ one that many friends at Harvard and in Washington urged
him not to do. But his draft board was in the Gore family's
hometown of Carthage, Tenn., and he reasoned that if he didn't go,
somebody else would, possibly a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``And ... if, a few years later that young man was killed over
there, and I was walking down the sidewalk through the heart of
Carthage and his family was walking on the sidewalk in the opposite
direction, what in the hell would I do? Hang my head?,'' Gore said.
``I wasn't about to test that proposition. I didn't want anyone to
go in my place.''

   NEW YORK _ David Auburn's ``Proof'' at the Manhattan Theater
Club is a family play of ideas. With intricate twists and turns, it
takes a dramatic and comic ride through the lives of a brilliant,
deranged mathematician and his two daughters, one of whom has
devoted herself to taking care of her father.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is not Auburn's first play, it is his first major
production and it has been a heady experience for the 30-year-old
playwright. ``Proof'' opened last week starring Mary-Louise Parker
and directed by Daniel Sullivan. For the author, the sequence of
events was quick and stunning: from page to stage in less than two
years, and then surrounded by praise from critics and theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extended interview, Auburn spoke modestly about his
accomplishment. He said that he had written the first draft of the
play very quickly and, accepting suggestions from his agent and
friends, he painstakingly revised it. Then he submitted it to the
Manhattan Theater Club. Last April the company had a reading with
Parker playing the central role.
</P>
<P>
   ``She nailed it,'' he said. ``With no prompting and no
direction, she surpassed all my expectations and was unafraid to be
scary'' and to stress the critical edginess of her character.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately the play was scheduled for this season. With
a year to wait _ a year in which his play was still his secret _
Auburn took a job writing scripts for television documentaries and
wrote a new play. He also got married: He and his wife, who is a
historian, live in Brooklyn. Before ``Proof'' opened, he won a
Guggenheim Foundation fellowship and a Helen Merrill Playwriting
Award.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the genesis of the play, he said he began with two
ideas: ``One was to write about two sisters who are quarreling over
the legacy of something left behind by their father. The other was
about someone who knew that her parent had had problems of mental
illness,'' and when she reached the age of the onset of his
madness, was beginning to worry that ``she might be going through
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many possibilities for that legacy, or, as he said,
``any number of Maguffins.'' He decided to use mathematics, and,
for plot, the question of the authorship of a brilliant
mathematical proof. Explaining that choice, he said: ``The great
thing about math is that it's a kind of scientific activity that's
still done in a solitary way. Most science is now with big teams on
big projects. In math, someone could have done something major
working alone in an attic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the play is filled with mathematical references and
amusing asides about scholarship and rivalry in the field, it is
not, he said, a play about math. More important, it deals with the
family under stress, especially with the daughter ``and her desire
to follow in her father's footsteps and also her fear of doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn is not a math scholar, but he studied calculus at the
University of Chicago and has a great interest in popular science.
``I knew a lot of science and math guys in school,'' he said.
``You'd go to the gym and you'd hear them talking pure math talk,
locker room talk, University of Chicago style.''
</P>
<P>
   For research, he read many books, beginning with ``A
Mathematician's Apology'' by G.H. Hardy: ``It's a classic work
about doing math and science and their aesthetic appeal. It
communicates the passion and excitement'' _ as does the play.
</P>
<P>
   When Auburn began the play, Sylvia Nasar's book ``A Beautiful
Mind'' had not been published; but he was aware of the subject,
John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who had
paranoid schizophrenia. In some ways, Nash could have been a model
for the father in the play (played by Larry Bryggman). Along the
way the playwright talked to mathematicians, partly to decide on
his use of language. He was told that some of it was so arcane that
even those in the field did not always understand it.
</P>
<P>
   One major decision was how much technical information to
include. In contrast to Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen,'' he chose
``to err on the side of less information.'' It is not until the
closing minutes that theatergoers have more than an inkling of the
nature of the proof. The title came early, and intentionally has
metaphorical intimations.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The academic context of the play comes from the playwright's own
experience. He was born in Chicago and grew up in Arkansas, where
his father was an English professor (he is now a college dean), an
expert on Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The first play his son saw was
``The School for Scandal,'' eventually many times in many
productions.
</P>
<P>
   His days at the University of Chicago were transforming. He
joined a theater troupe called Off Off Campus and acted and wrote
comedy sketches, very much in the Chicago tradition of Second City.
Writing sketches, he said, ``you develop a rough toolbox of
techniques,'' and with that as a base he moved to one-acts.
</P>
<P>
   As a critic on his university newspaper, he immersed himself in
Chicago theater, seeing a diversity of plays at Steppenwolf,
Goodman and other theaters. He especially liked Steppenwolf, where
he was excited by ``that immediate roughhouse style.'' Although
Auburn has great admiration for David Mamet, Tom Stoppard would
seem to be more of an influence, for his ``playfulness and the
rigor of his construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Following up an interest in political science, he had an offer
to work for then-Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois during the summer of
his sophomore year but turned it down to join his theater company
at the Edinburgh Festival. After a Stephen Spielberg fellowship
writing screenplays in Los Angeles, he came to New York to continue
his writing.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted into the Juilliard School's playwriting program, he was
in the first class taught by Marsha Norman and Christopher Durang.
His classmates included Stephen Belber, Kira Obolensky and Julia
Jordan, all promising playwrights. He wrote plays as well as
monologues, several of which were later published in Middlebury
College's New England Review. One of the plays was ``Skyscraper,''
a free-flowing comedy about urban architecture and couples
uncoupling in Chicago. It had a brief run Off Broadway in 1997 and
was, he said, a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Juilliard he worked in book publishing and for a
documentary film company, quitting to join his wife-to-be in
London, where she was doing research for her Ph.D. Living abroad,
he began writing ``Proof,'' approaching the play in a more
realistic, less absurd style than his previous work.
</P>
<P>
   For background, he reflected on his university days in Chicago,
remembering the eccentric people in the Hyde Park section around
the university (the setting of the play). He recalled one professor
who taught chemistry all day and ``then would spend his free time
marching around his neighborhood with a broomstick chanting the
song from `The Bridge on the River Kwai' at the top of his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some connection between extremely prodigious
mathematical ability and craziness,'' he said. ``I don't think that
math drives people crazy, but those with edgy or slightly
irrational personalities are drawn to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the character played by Parker was based on anyone,
perhaps his wife, he said, ``No,'' and added emphatically, ``My
wife is a very intelligent and beautiful woman. You can put that
in: intelligent and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Again he emphasized that the family was at the center of his
play. ``I think everyone thinks about their relationship to their
parents, what they're getting from that relationship, what they're
not getting, what they will give back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the play opened, he was upset by a line in a magazine
suggesting that it was about ``your fear of being like your
parents.'' After that appeared in print, he telephoned his parents
in Ohio to make sure they knew the fear was that of the character
and not the fear of their son. Several weeks ago, the Auburns saw
``Proof'' at a preview. ``Mom says thumbs up and Dad does too,'' he
said. ``I hope they'll be quoted in the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his gift for dialogue and characterization, he has a
strong sense of narrative. ``Proof'' has a series of dramatic
surprises, including a first-act curtain that audiences greet with
an audible sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he watched the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese on
television saying he was thinking of writing a play because then he
would not have to worry about plot and ``could just have people
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just people talking!'' said Auburn in disbelief. ``I
practically threw my shoe at the television.''

THE NEW FACE OF GERMANY IS ON DISPLAY AT EXPO 2000

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany _ Something is afoot in Hanover. This country
has built itself a 400-foot-long glass structure, called it
``Germany: Workshop of Ideas,'' and adorned it with 47 giant busts
of great Germans that include one Juergen Sparwasser, a soccer
player, but not Goethe.
</P>
<P>
   The structure in question is Germany's pavilion at Expo 2000,
the world's fair that opens on June 1. The absence of Goethe, eased
out by the likes of Marlene Dietrich, is suggestive of an insistent
national quest: to get people to think differently about Germany.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Berlin Love Parade (whose instigator, Dr. Motte, earns
a bust) and a half-century of peace have already dented German
stereotypes. But Nicholas Batten, an Expo spokesman, insisted: ``It
is very important that we keep presenting a different face. We want
to show we are not the bad Germans any more. We want to be
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictions certainly look hazardous at the 370-acre Expo site
on the southern outskirts of this modest city in the north of
Germany. With little time remaining until the opening, an air of
disorder prevails. Distinctly unGerman _ and perhaps that is the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 170 national pavilions seem little more
than half-finished and minor fiascos keep occurring, as when the
sand recently air-freighted to Hanover in a Jumbo jet by the United
Arab Emirates was mistaken for garbage and removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Expo grounds look chaotic at the moment,'' Wiebke Bruhns,
an Expo official, conceded. ``But I am confident that 98 percent
will be finished by the time we open. Even if that is not the case,
it will not be a catastrophe. The Germans have a reputation for
being perfectly ordered, but maybe that is not always true.''
</P>
<P>
   So, a freewheeling, free-spirited, good-luck-to-Goethe sort of
Germany is preparing to greet millions of visitors _ 40 million, it
hopes _ to the country's first World Fair since these gatherings
started in 1851. The timing is awkward: Many think the Internet has
rendered the whole idea obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   For such online debunkers of Expo, the organizers have a line:
These critics have embraced a globalizing technology at the expense
of humanity. You can't eat the Internet, they say. You can't smell
it; you can't drink it. And a world's fair should be ``a party, a
feast, a great big easygoing get-together,'' in the words of
Bruhns.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not impressed. Indeed so underwhelmed is
the world's superpower that _ with minimal tact _ it is snubbing
the party in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's hometown. On the site
long planned for an elaborate American ``Main Street'' exhibit, a
Romanian pavilion is being hastily erected and a Big Wheel is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly tried and I personally put some time into trying
to get something to happen,'' said John Kornblum, the American
ambassador to Germany. ``But in the end, globalization did us in.''
</P>
<P>
   After what was widely viewed as the debacle of the Seville Expo
in 1992, Congress passed a law saying no government money could be
used for world's fairs. So William D. Rollnick, a New York
businessman chosen as the U.S. commissioner for the Hanover fair,
spent more than two years trying to raise money in the private
sector for an American pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   His attempts ended in failure a few weeks ago _ much to the
annoyance of German officials who saw it as a further sign of the
United States turning its back on the world since the Cold War's
end.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for the decision is that many American
corporations now see themselves as ``global players''; they do not
wish to be associated with a national pavilion. So in the age of
globalization, the country that has held world's fairs in New York,
San Francisco and Chicago, among other cities, views an American
pavilion as a waste of time, even potentially counterproductive for
global movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a short-sighted, embarrassing and deeply disappointing
attitude from the United States,'' said Friedbert Pfluger, a local
politician who lobbied hard for an American presence. ``What
message is being sent here to the rest of the world?''
</P>
<P>
   America will, however, be represented by some of its ``global
players,'' including McDonald's, IBM and Coca-Cola, corporations
that have earned the title of ``Product Partners'' by contributing
about $5 million each. The food and drinks and equipment of these
companies will be much in evidence, with advertising tied to the
Expo logo, but not under an American flag or roof.
</P>
<P>
   A brochure produced for the Expo and designed to attract
corporate support says: ``For companies, the park offers a
wonderful and credible instrument for public marketing that will
offer new ways to reach clients.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this just another theme park? It has the longest cable car
in northern Europe, the biggest mosaic in the world (6 million
pieces), the largest wooden roof over a building, and, in a partial
revenge for Goethe, promises the longest-ever performance of an
unabridged ``Faust'' I and II _ a mere 21 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the organizers insist bigness is not all. They point to the
fact that this is the first Expo with a specific theme _
``Humankind-Nature-Technology'' _ and that the common thread is
precisely the need to find new balances between onrushing
technology and human needs, soaring consumption and dwindling
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the responses are remarkable, including Japan's pavilion
built almost entirely of recycled paper, Hungary's flower-like
structure of wood, and a Dutch pavilion that superimposes different
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Finland best catches the tensions between _ but also the
complementary nature of _ technology and nature. It has produced a
handsome ``wind-nest'' combining ecology-friendly energy sources
and a high-tech display where Nokia cell phones serve as the bodies
of birds and provide their ersatz ``birdsong.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, too, an Expo will have a series of pavilions
that are not national but dedicated to issues. Rajeev Sethi of
India is orchestrating a ``Basic Needs'' pavillion. He has
assembled a wide array of exhibits from artisans throughout the
world, as well as an intriguing creation by a British artist called
``From Muck to Gold'' that illustrates the potential uses of human
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask questions. What is need, and what greed? What is
livelihood?'' Sethi said. ``I feel America is disconnected from
such issues. It is a land of excess. We are always crying over
whales and tigers, but basic human skills are also a dwindling
resource. Technology, yes, OK, but let's not throw out the baby
with the bathwater.''
</P>
<P>
   On such debates, at Hanover at least, the United States has
turned its back. As for Germany, well, anything goes.

<HEADLINE>
AT THE FRENCH OPEN, AGASSI DEALS WITH CHANGES IN HIMSELF AND
STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Sunday was, as usual, a dress rehearsal for the French
Open: a day when the matches are best-of-one and the pressure
almost none; a day when the gate receipts refreshingly go to
charity instead of to agents, money managers or the players
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But for Andre Agassi, Sunday was more a day for remembering and
reflecting the last French Open than looking forward to the next.
He returned to the center court where he had experienced the
biggest rush of his long career and heard the cheers from an
excitable French crowd that had helped lift him to last year's
title. That experience _ rallying from two sets down against Andrei
Medvedev in the final _ set in motion events that would alter more
than his ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I mean, how to put into words is difficult,'' said
Agassi, for whom words usually come easily. ``This was such a
marking point in so many respects. Changed my career last year, and
my life hasn't been the same on or off the court. I just hope my
life doesn't ever change this much again in a 12-month period
because it can only be not good if it changes that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Roland Garros last year, he had gone through a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know a year later, it's like it's a lifetime ago,'' Agassi
said.
</P>
<P>
   The center court has evolved, too, although not quite so clearly
for the better. Two of the four grandstands have been demolished
and refurbished. And even though the Art Deco elements have been
carefully re-created, the stadium feels slightly different now.
Because the stands rise higher in a hurry on two sides, the court
seems more closely surrounded, the atmosphere within it more
intimate, less aloof and, in that sense, somewhat less Parisian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even to a beautiful arena like this, Agassi said, ``it's
always a little sad to see things change a little bit,'' Agassi
said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the opponent in front of him in Sunday's charity match
was only a pleasant reminder of the past. Arnaud Clement was 2
points away from beating Agassi in the second round last year
before the American rallied to eliminate the Frenchman in five
sets. Although it didn't count this time, Agassi beat him again
Sunday before scribbling a few autographs and then facing the
press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have lost to Clement last year, that certainly
would have changed everything, but I think the match that did
change everything for me last year was against Carlos Moya in the
Round of 16,'' he said. ``Because that's when I was really down,
and when I really started to hit out on my shots and when I
realized that if I play aggressive and bring my game to the table,
that gets it done.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been getting it done with remarkable regularity since
then, compiling a 27-1 record in the last four Grand Slam events.
Considering that the one loss came in the Wimbledon final against
its six-time champion, Pete Sampras, he should have no regrets. And
even though he has not reached another final since January and the
Australian Open _ playing sporadically in recent weeks because of
minor ailments _ he said he has no regrets about that either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Zimbabwe, played there, then Scottsdale, Palm
Springs and Key Biscayne and then kind of quickly realized that you
can't be at your best every week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it for a year, a year and a half, where you just
commit to giving it 150 percent every time. The results can happen
for a certain period of time, but then it quickly becomes about,
where do you want to be at your best? I just kind of made the
decision to downshift and really get myself in position for those
things that I value the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Those would be Davis Cup, the Grand Slam events and the
Olympics, in which Agassi will defend his 1996 gold-medal title in
Sydney in September. Whether he can defend his French Open title _
as always at the world's most unpredictable major tournament _ is
an open question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some respects, having no expectations from the
public and yourself coming in here last year was certainly part of
why the story was so incredible,'' Agassi said. ``But now it's
about really me just trying to be at my best out of appreciation
and respect for so much of what this place has given to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more prepared this year than I was last year,'' he
added. ``But I wish I wasn't prepared if it means I'm going to win
again. Things happen out there that you need to get through. Last
year I had three different matches that technically I should not
have won. It has little to do with how well you play starting a
tournament as much as with how well you play at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   On clay, with its emphasis on long, exhausting rallies, it also
has much to do with fitness, and Agassi said he took no days off
when he returned home to Las Vegas after losing to Dominik Hrbaty
in Rome 17 days ago in one of his precious few clay-court matches
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contend that to win here, you have to be physically at your
best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such pronouncements cannot be of much comfort to compatriot
Lindsay Davenport, second-seeded in the women's draw. Like Agassi,
she won the Australian Open and then, unlike Agassi, went on to
dominate much of the hardcourt season until a foot injury _ linked
to arthritis in her foot _ knocked her out of action for six weeks.
The good news was that her layoff allowed her to spend more time in
California with her new boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to have something else going on in your life,'' she
said. ``You look more realistically at your career. You even look
past your career.''
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Davenport returned to tournament play at the
Italian Open earlier this month, she wrenched her back during
practice. After a week of intensive therapy in Paris with her
coach, Robert Van't Hof, she is now able to serve again and is no
longer considering a withdrawal. But she has never considered
herself the player to beat, even though she, like top-seeded
Martina Hingis, has now won all the Grand Slam events but this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels weird,'' she said. ``We always joke about it, Robert
and I: who would have thought I'd be in position to win all four?
But his whole point with me the last four months is you have to try
to enjoy this challenge being put in front of you here: `Don't take
it as pressure because at the end of the day if you don't
accomplish it, it doesn't matter.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hingis, Davenport did not grow up playing on clay and
view a victory at Roland Garros as a sort of birthright.
Nonetheless, Davenport has lost to the eventual champion the last
three years in tough matches, pushing Graf in the quarterfinals
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been working on my slide, but I'm actually just
paranoid about going over on my ankles: so paranoid about it that I
can't get over that,'' Davenport said. ``But I remember talking to
Monica Seles, and she said. `I never slide and I still won the
French, so don't worry about it.' And, you know, Andre doesn't
slide either.'' &QL;

   CRIME-DROP-REACT (Chicago) _ With the historic drop in violent
crime beginning to take hold in even the most blighted urban areas,
cities across the country are being transformed as neighborhoods
that had become frightening wastelands are showing glimmers of
renaissance. New homes are being built, stores are opening and, for
the first time in years, people are sitting on their front porches.
By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-ELECTION (Lima, Peru) _ In a vote long on protests but
short on drama, President Alberto Fujimori swept to an apparent
re-election victory Sunday against an opponent who had urged his
supporters to abstain from voting as a protest to charges of fraud
and an array of campaign irregularities. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING-WILLS (Undated) _ Although millions of Americans have
signed living wills and power-of-attorney forms, thinking the
documents would help them avoid unwanted treatment and prolonged
deaths, in many cases those measures turn out to be useless. First
of two articles. A special report. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-OIL-FALLOUT (Midland, Texas) _ For nearly a century, the
compact between ranchers and oilmen created the huge wealth that
built modern Texas. The ranchers owned the land, the wildcatters
found the oil, and everyone got rich together. But oil is no longer
king in Texas, and the state is grappling with a less glamorous
legacy of the high-flying days. Tens of thousands of oil wells
could be leaking and threatening underground aquifers at a time
when drought has made water the state's most precious natural
resource. Now, the ranchers and the oil producers are fighting over
cleaning up the mess. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   NY-CENTRAL-PARK (New York) _ Central Park is gorgeous right now.
Especially breathtaking are the thick, deep green lawns that cost
millions of dollars to restore and now look as luxurious as
Aubaussan carpets. No wonder the number of visitors is up to 20
million this year. No wonder many of them want to treat it like a
vastly superior extension of a backyard. In other words, littering,
making noise and trampling the exquisite grass. Before, when it was
considered dangerous and rundown, it was not such a big deal that
soccer players tore up the grass with their cleats or dog owners
did not always clean up. But now, the city is getting fussy about
the park. By Barbara Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   SKIMPY-BOOKS (New York) _ In a growing number of instances
involving both trade publishers and prominent academic publishers,
bibliographies _ the traditional structural support system for an
author's work _ have been severed from books and moved to digital
outposts. There, publishers say, they are available to anyone who
wants to read them. The advantage, the publishers say, is a
smaller, cheaper, more accessible book. Some authors support the
change, while others have fiercely opposed it. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-INTERNET (Hong Kong) _ Old-line Asian companies are now
devising ambitious strategies. From Taiwan to Thailand, the
region's most powerful families have started a blizzard of online
ventures. In the process, the Internet is transforming the way
business is done here and elsewhere in East Asia. Decisions, which
used to be made by the patriarch behind a veil of secrecy, are
being pushed down the ranks as Asian companies embrace Silicon
Valley-style management. By Mark Landler.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Texas _ For nearly a century, the compact between
ranchers and oilmen created the huge wealth that built modern
Texas. The ranchers owned the land, the wildcatters found the oil,
and everyone got rich together. Oil money built universities and
football stadiums, gaudy hotels and world-class art museums.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, an estimated 1 million people in Texas receive some
sort of oil or gas royalty check.
</P>
<P>
   But oil is no longer king in Texas, and as the economy has
changed, the state is grappling with a less glamorous legacy of the
high-flying days. There are 25,000 abandoned oil wells in Texas;
another 15,000 are sitting idle, and tens of thousands of others
could be leaking and threatening underground aquifers at a time
when drought has made water the state's most precious natural
resource.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ranchers and the oil producers, the mythic figures of
modern Texas, are fighting over cleaning up the mess. A growing
number of prominent ranchers, including former Gov. Dolph Briscoe
and the caretakers of the fabled King Ranch, are organizing against
the oil industry, seeking changes in environmental and royalty laws
and portraying state regulators as toothless.
</P>
<P>
   Oil producers, on the other hand, say the landowners are just
grabbing for money as the industry is only now recovering from its
latest downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys are out here biting the hand that fed
them,'' said John Bell, an independent oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas of old, what was good for Big Oil was considered
good for Texas. But attitudes are gradually changing as industries
like high technology and health care lead the state's thriving
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, citizens' groups in central Texas have fought
plans to reopen a 700-mile underground gas pipeline, fearing that a
leak could pollute the region's water source. In Houston, a new
generation of business leaders, alarmed by the city's smog problem,
is calling for solutions that include sharp reductions in pollution
from nearby refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the harsh mesquite desert of West Texas, where the
underground sea of crude oil known as the Permian Basin once made
Midland a boom town, the bravado of the bygone era is not yet gone.
Thousands of oil pumps still bob slowly up and down in the
surrounding flat terrain, where the average summer temperatures
exceed 100 degrees. Hotels still decorate rooms with paintings of
oil wells.
</P>
<P>
   A huge white Cadillac rumbling down Big Spring Street summarized
the enduring local sentiment with a bumper sticker: ``Wake Up
America: For Our Security We Need American Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside his office at the Permian Basin Petroleum Association,
the executive director, Morris Burns, brightened at the memory of
the region's past influence. ``This was what won World War II,''
Burns said, recalling that the Permian Basin produced 25 percent of
the world's oil to keep the U.S. war machine going.
</P>
<P>
   But production peaked in 1972, the oil bust came in the 1980s,
and in the 1990s oil production in Texas dropped by a third. The
recent spike in oil prices has helped producers recover from the
disastrously low prices of 1998, but the overall trend is the slow
decline of what analysts describe as a ``mature'' industry.
</P>
<P>
   For over a decade, the major oil companies have been pulling out
of West Texas, and this week Burns wearily absorbed another
defection, as ARCO announced it would close its local office of 165
employees. What would happen to the workers?
</P>
<P>
   The new-found public advocacy of the ranchers is only the latest
blow. Like so many in the oil industry, Burns says he suspects that
trial lawyers in search of a new source of fees may account for
part of it. He acknowledged that a small number of ``bad actors''
in the oil industry had behaved irresponsibly, but he said many of
them had left the business over the past decade as regulations
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers have become much more environmentally aware in the
last 15 years,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an hour's drive west of Midland, past tiny oil towns like
Goldsmith and the aptly named Notrees, the environmental legacy is
evident on the 174,000-acre Frying Pan Ranch. The property's owner,
D.K. Boyd, bought it four years ago, adding it to his five other
ranches in West Texas and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In all, his properties contain more than 2,000 oil wells. But
when Boyd hired a San Antonio environmental consulting company to
audit his properties, it found about 1,000 contaminated sites, with
environmental damage estimated at over $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   There is heated disagreement about who is responsible for the
mess, and Boyd is tied up in fiercely contested litigation with
several of the oil producers who lease mineral rights on his
property.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of blame, a short tour of the Frying Pan reveals
obvious examples of the problems that ranchers say exist across
Texas. A tank where crude oil is separated from salt water has
spilled into the surrounding soil. A pipeline that burst a few
weeks ago has left a brown stain across a 50-yard section. Boyd's
ranch foreman, Bill Warbois, said some oil companies did little
more than dump dirt to cover up the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wet oil,'' Warbois said, pinching some of the brown
sand between his fingers. ``You can smell it. You can pick that
dirt up and literally squeeze the oil out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, who ran his own independent oil company for 20 years, said
the city of Midland had approached him about water rights in recent
weeks for an aquifer that extends more than 20,000 acres beneath
the Frying Pan. He said that he had not thoroughly tested the water
source but that a handful of test wells had shown some evidence of
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is more valuable than oil and gas and becoming more so
every day,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Matthews, director for the Center for Energy and Economic
Development at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin in
Midland, said many of the wells on ranches like the Frying Pan had
been drilled by the major oil companies over 50 years ago and were
now inevitably showing signs of deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said smaller independent oil companies eagerly bought
the properties with the exodus of the major concerns, but they did
so as federal regulation tightened and environmental awareness
started to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large oil companies saw this coming,'' Matthews said.
``They said: `We don't need this. We can go to plenty of places
around the world, find bigger reserves, and we don't have to put up
with this litigious society.'''

<P>
   Environmental complaints have grown steadily in the past decade.
Richard Lowerre, an environmental lawyer in Austin, said lawsuits
over the contamination of ground water had become more common,
particularly in West Texas. Oil companies often settle cases with
an agreement requiring landowners not to disclose the terms,
Lowerre said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil
industry, reported 77 cases of ground-water contamination from oil
and natural-gas activities, the majority of them in the Permian
Basin, the most drought-stricken section of the state. In 1998, the
commission received 976 complaints of oil-field pollution from
landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a number of prominent ranchers and large
landowners founded the Texas Land &AMP; Mineral Owners Association. The
approximately 500 members, who control millions of acres, include
many from the ranching families that helped found Texas, like the
Kings and the Suggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never happened before in Texas,'' said Doug
Beveridge, who manages land and oil leases for the King Ranch in
South Texas. ``You have never had landowners come together like
this, exclusively. It should have happened 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Property rights are a passionate political issue in Texas, and
in broad terms, the landowners are concerned primarily with
pollution cleanup and royalties and their belief that the
regulatory and legal landscape favors the oil and natural-gas
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, unlike in many states, land ownership is severed
between the surface and the minerals below. As a result, a
landowner may or may not control the rights to any oil or natural
gas below the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies sign leases with mineral owners, which grant
them rights to drill wells and build pipelines. The mineral owners
are paid royalties on any oil or gas production, while the
landowners usually receive only a one-time payment of several
thousand dollars for the use of their land.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, including that of Boyd, landowners also hold most
of the mineral rights on their property. Usually a company will
sign a surface-damage agreement with a landowner that stipulates
cleanup responsibilities. But many landowners say there are
companies that disregard the agreements or refuse to sign them.
</P>
<P>
   The state requires that oil companies seal a well with cement
plugs once production has stopped, in order to prevent contaminants
from escaping. The cost of plugging a well usually runs as much as
$4,500. But some companies have abandoned wells without plugging
them, particularly since 1998, when low prices drove many smaller
independent companies to bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The landowners association is lobbying for new laws addressing
concerns about royalties and the legal rights of landowners in
disputes over property damage, Beveridge said. The group is also
proposing a bill to block oil and natural-gas companies from
abandoning wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has sporadically addressed the problem of
abandoned wells, including a past law that imposed a fee on oil and
natural-gas production to pay for plugging abandoned wells. Last
year, the state plugged about 1,600 wells. But declining production
has meant fewer dollars coming into the cleanup fund.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies also benefit from a state program that allows them
to pay $100 for annual extensions on plugging wells. In some cases,
companies have used these extensions to delay plugging wells for
years. Officials estimate that 15,000 wells remain idle and
unplugged because of this program.
</P>
<P>
   Public attention to the problems was heightened last September
when The San Antonio Express-News published a series of articles
detailing the full scope of the problem. The Express-News series
also explored the historically friendly relationship between the
railroad commission and the oil industry. The commission's three
members are elected and often receive large contributions from oil
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, there has been a great deal of cynicism and
people have characterized the railroad commission as a captive
agency,'' said Tony Garza, a Republican member of the commission
since 1998. ``From time to time, their concerns have been extremely
borne out.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Garza has pushed the commission to be more
aggressive in addressing abandoned wells and met with resistance.
At last month's commission meeting, Garza's proposal to curtail the
$100 program was never brought to a vote. In the coming days, the
commission's chairman, Michael Williams, is expected to make a
recommendation on the fee program based on the findings of a
special commission he appointed to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the oil industry is declining, so are many cattle
ranches across Texas. Jan Wheelis, whose family has owned the
McFaddin Ranch in Victoria County in south Texas since 1840, said
she must find every way imaginable for her land to make money. She
is considering harvesting mesquite trees, and she has leased
hunting rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make more money off hunting than oil in this place,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelis still keeps 250 head of cattle but has found that the
drought makes this increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And so, she said, does the legacy of oil. Many of the 57 wells
on her land are abandoned. Last month, she filed a lawsuit against
two companies, claiming that their failure to mend broken pipelines
and other problems had created an environmental mess. In all,
Wheelis said, she had lost 40 of her 2,664 acres to contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Driving toward a lake of old cypress trees recently, Wheelis
stopped her truck and listened to a metallic sound coming from a
neighboring property.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're drilling another well,'' she said and drove away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ One of the dead young men, on a southern
Eritrean slope of shattered stones and soldiers' bodies, left
behind the start of a journal. He was born on Oct. 5, 1980. His
father died when he was young, so he moved in with an uncle. They
did not get along. His grades were good.
</P>
<P>
   He learned something about life working in a market near Nazret,
Ethiopia, where he grew up, he wrote in English, one of the
languages used in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many kinds of man,'' he wrote in a notebook with
a cover picture of Leonardo DiCaprio on the Titanic. ``For example,
the person who is a thief.'' Cattle traders and laborers are
better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote nothing about the war that killed him, but then again
he only got two pages through his life. He was one of at least 24
dead Ethiopians near the town of Adi Keshi in southern Eritrea, cut
down in battle six days ago. There were said to be many more
bodies, but it was too dangerous around a jagged bend, and who had
the stomach to look anyway.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, senior officials from Ethiopia and Eritrea are to
meet in Algeria, to talk about ending a two-year war that has
killed tens of thousands of young men like this one and, here in
Eritrea, women serving as soldiers, too. After a two-week offensive
by Ethiopia, Eritrea agreed last week to pull back from the border
territory both countries claim _ paving the way, in theory, for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   But this war, which has perplexed the outside world with the
ferocity of the fight between brother nations on the Horn of
Africa, has become only more complex in recent days. Despite
Eritrea's retreat, Ethiopia shows no signs of stopping the fight,
continuing its push into southern Eritrea. Only Sunday morning, an
Ethiopian warplane reportedly bombed what officials said was a new
power plant near the Eritrean port city of Massawa, far from the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian officials say they will not end the war until a final
peace accord is signed and they themselves have verified that
Eritrea has left the last of the land that Ethiopia claims.
Ethiopia maintains that it was invaded two years ago and has made
no secret of its desire to punish Eritrea for that.
</P>
<P>
   Eritreans say they do not know what else to give up but vow to
keep fighting until Ethiopians leave the territory they have
captured in the last two weeks, indisputably Eritrea's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight to the last, and still we are fighting,'' said
Mehari Gebrehiwet, 39, a teacher in the southern Eritrean town of
Mendefera, surrounded on three sides by fighting. Still, he
despaired: ``It's a meaningless war. Meaningless loss of lives. It
diminishes the economies of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``War,'' he added, ``cannot be a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of finding peace at the talks in Algeria this
week seems remote _ especially since the two nations had already
agreed on all but the fine print of a peace deal brokered by the
Organization of African Unity, but still went on with this latest
round of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be an optimist here,'' said one Western diplomat
here, who did not sound very optimistic. His conversation Sunday
was interrupted twice in several minutes with phone calls about the
Ethiopian bombing near Massawa.
</P>
<P>
   The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea began in May 1998, after
months of skirmishes along a 620-mile border that was never
officially marked off. Since then, the war has taken on
significance greater than a mere border spat. These are two proud
nations: Eritrea, born only in 1993 after a 30-year struggle
against two regimes in Ethiopia, and Ethiopia, with a strong sense
of its 3,000-year history of repelling invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea is tiny _ with 3.5 million people to Ethiopia's 63
million _ but its long struggle has defined it as a nation of
fighters. And during the two years of war, it has held its own.
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea has had the worst of it since Ethiopia began its new
offensive on May 12, saying it wanted a quick end to the war that
has cost so much money and so many lives. First, Ethiopia captured
large areas of Eritrean territory to the west. Then on Thursday,
Eritrea pulled back from the central front, south of Asmara, and
even said it would pull out of two towns on Ethiopia's specific
request.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of what appears to be military defeat along the
border, Eritreans seem glum but say they still support their
president, Isaias Afwerki, viewed as the father of the Eritrean
nation. He has portrayed the withdrawal as a ``tactical'' retreat
that saves lives, in a nation with far fewer to spare than
Ethiopia. And some military analysts say the Eritrean Army is far
from destroyed _ though that appears to have been a prime goal of
Ethiopians in this latest offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil here, though, is tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, as Ethiopians have continued to push
north, towns and villages, some less than 30 miles south of the
capital here, are emptying out _ adding to the several hundred
thousand people already displaced by fighting in the west.
Roadsides are jammed with people, some carrying a bag or two of
clothes, but many empty-handed, as they flee from the towns of Adi
Keyh, Adi Quala, Mendefera, Maimine and Areza.
</P>
<P>
   Adi Quala, 44 miles by road from Asmara, is now deserted except
for perhaps two dozen people, most of them women and children. They
are living under a concrete bridge, in case of shelling. ``Where
else can we go?'' said Roma Gebrekidan, a woman in her 60s who was
scrunched under the bridge, waving away swarms of flies with a
eucalyptus branch.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two days, the Eritrean government has been moving
many refugees by bus and truck to the grounds of a secondary school
in Dbarwa, about 12 miles north on the road toward Asmara. By
Sunday, relief officials said at least 18,000 people were there,
and busloads more were still arriving in early evening. Many had
slept in the open. Latrines were dug in V-shapes in front of the
school buildings but so close to the crowds that people seemed too
embarrassed to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Embaye, an official with the Eritrean Relief and Refugee
Commission, who had to leave his own home, said that for the
moment, officials have enough cornmeal, oil and sugar to feed the
crowds who were there already. But he said the amount was ``just
enough for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have shelter, blankets, clothing, utensils for
cooking,'' he said. ``It all came as a surprise that we have
thousands of displaced people. These people came from their homes
only with the clothes on their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the fighting, the Eritrean army seems eager to show that
it has pulled back from the areas claimed by Ethiopia but that it
is still intact and will fight where it suits Eritrea. On Saturday,
government officials escorted reporters to Adi Keshi, just south of
Adi Quala, where the young man with the journal died, apparently to
demonstrate they can hold their own.
</P>
<P>
   For three days, ending on May 24, soldiers said they repelled an
advance of Ethiopian troops across a plain and up a steep slope _
well inside Eritrean territory. They said the combat was heavy, in
battles through the day and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attempt was to eat breakfast here,'' said the local
commander, Lt. Col. Tibabo Sium. ``It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was possible they would continue to pull back,
deeper inside Eritrea if the Ethiopians continued to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight on our own terms,'' he said. ``If need be, we will
pull back in some areas. But we will make sure they pay a heavy
price.''

THREE-TIME CHAMPION COMETS ARE PRIMED TO BE THE YANKEES OF THE
WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Van Chancellor always found it difficult to root for the
Yankees. Not because he grew up in Mississippi, but because they
spoiled the fun. ``I always pulled against them because they won so
much,'' Chancellor said frankly in his Southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chancellor can understand the trappings of such a dynasty,
the predicament of privilege. If his Houston Comets are not the
Yankees, they are the Chicago Bulls and the Dallas Cowboys of the
Women's National Basketball Association. In its three years of
existence, the WNBA has only known one champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for the league,'' Chancellor said. ``Comets
basketball has brought notoriety to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston won when there were only eight teams in the league's
inaugural season. And then when there were 10. And last year, the
Comets were the best of 12.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the WNBA has expanded to 16 teams, a significant
burst that could dilute the talent pool yet by the end of the
season simply prove the theory of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Cynthia Cooper, the league's two-time most valuable
player, the all-star forward Sheryl Swoopes and center Tina
Thompson form an unbendable triangle. Chancellor, the three-time
WNBA coach of the year, is the elixir for the team's potent, but
potentially unstable, chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those four, the Comets are once again favored to
capture the championship, a quest that begins Monday when they tip
off the WNBA season in Houston against the Liberty, the team the
Comets defeated for titles 1 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, doing his best Joe Torre imitation, said: ``Everyone
always asks me if there is a lot of pressure. We don't think about
four-peating _ we try to give our best.''
</P>
<P>
   The other teams have no choice but to credit Houston, for now.
``I personally don't mind it _ they are setting the standard,''
said Brian Agler, the Minnesota Lynx coach and general manager, who
coached the only champion of the short-lived American Basketball
League, the Columbus Quest, to two titles. ``It makes everybody
better when we have someone to shoot for. We have to find a way to
catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the WNBA's strategic burst onto the summer sports scene,
Houston has won 81 games, lost 22. The Comets are the poster
children for consistency, the best tonic for a league that, as a
result of last year's sticky labor negotiations with the players'
union, might be expanding too soon, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when four new franchises _ Portland, Seattle, Indiana
and Miami _ join the league, executives are hoping to establish
some brand recognition. For the first time, the WNBA did not coin a
new catch-phrase like ``We Got Next'' or ``Join In,'' deciding
instead to recycle ``We Got Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build a little of equity, creating something longer
lasting than every season,'' said Val Ackerman, the WNBA president.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance last season was down slightly (by about 100 per game)
from the second season, averaging 10,704. But, as league officials
are quick to point out, attendance had far exceeded projections
(albeit deliberately set low) the first season. Success, however,
has increased expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas last season the league drew a total of 1,959,733 in 32
regular-season games, Ackerman said that this season the WNBA is
hoping to draw 2.5 million fans from the 16 teams in a 32-game
season. She projects 3 million in the fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   The three networks NBC, ESPN and Lifetime are in the fourth year
of a five-year deal. And the WNBA is in the process of re-signing
major sponsors, most of whom began with three-year packages.
Television ratings held steady at NBC last season and increased
marginally on cable.
</P>
<P>
   The average minimum salaries have increased slightly, though the
average base salary for the league is still just below $36,000 for
the three-month season. ``I tell our players we look at long-term
viability,'' Ackerman said. ``With that in mind, we have tried very
hard to manage our costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA is not yet turning a profit, Ackerman insisted, but it
could be close within the next two years. ``Right now we are ahead
of schedule,'' she said, ``with the early success and the surge of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lieberman-Cline, the Women's Sports Foundation president
who is also the Detroit Shock's coach and general manager, takes a
long-term view as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the league is so bright,'' Lieberman-Cline said.
``If in 10 years we haven't had a quantum leap, I would be
surprised. Look where the men's game was 50 years ago. We should be
entitled to a growth period, not just one or two years.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a league ideal, ``We Got Game'' could simply be the
plea from the other would-be champions, a group of franchises that
is expanding, especially in the Western Conference, and gunning for
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has never been strong at point guard, still coping with
the death of Kim Perot last August and then losing Sonja Henning in
the expansion draft. The center position is also a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still the team to beat, but I think we're capable,''
said Sacramento Monarchs Coach Sonny Allen, whose team is
considered the most likely to dethrone the Comets. Sacramento,
meanwhile, has no visible weakness. The Monarchs return five core
players from a team that finished 19-12 in 1999 and which boasted
the league's most valuable player, forward Yolanda Griffith.
Griffith, a former MVP with ABL, was second in the league in
scoring last season, averaging 18 points and 11.3 rebounds.
Sacramento lost only the reserve guard Kate Starbird to the
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The second-worst team in the inaugural season, Sacramento now
has the league's most explosive offense, as point guard Ticha
Penicheiro dazzles with no-look passes and the sharp-shooting
Olympian Ruthie Bolton-Holifield is finally healthy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Monarchs represent the run-and-gun style common in the
West, then the Liberty best characterizes the Eastern Conference.
The team is stocked with veterans like Sue Wicks and Teresa
Weatherspoon, but the Liberty is burdened by the knee injury to
Rebecca Lobo and is waiting for last year's star rookie, Tamika
Whitmore, to get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was the only team to have a winning record in the
East last season, and at this point, it is clear that the Western
Conference is the stronger of the two again. The East is aging, as
well as plagued with injuries from Washington to Charlotte to
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, four teams from each conference will make the WNBA's
expanded playoffs this season, vying for a chance to dethrone
Houston. The regular-season opener has been moved up two weeks and
the league finishes on Aug. 9 to accommodate training for the
Sydney Olympics. The playoffs will consist of three rounds of
two-of-three-game series this season, with no byes for the top team
in each conference.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be Houston again? ``People are dying to see if they can
do it again, and if they do, it is going to be worth talking
about,'' said Washington Coach Nancy Darsch. ``If there had been
three different teams then it wouldn't have been as emotional or as
big a deal as it is to knock off the three-time champion.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Strangers, reunited
 &HT;    Fifty-five years after responding to cries for help on the
battlefield, soldier meets man he pulled from ditch in France
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it blind luck, fate or amazing coincidence. Howard Hardrath
of Atlanta sees it as a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six years ago, in the bloody hedgerows of Normandy a month
after D-Day, Hardrath found an unknown dogface sprawled unconscious
in a muddy, bloody drainage ditch. Hardrath pulled the wounded man
out, even though he was sure ``the guy was a goner.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as part of his Memorial Day celebrations, on a day set
aside for the nation to remember all its war dead, Hardrath, 82,
plans to telephone that man, Jim O'Neil, 71, of Winters, Calif.,
whom ``by incredible luck'' he identified last July.
</P>
<P>
   At a veterans' reunion, he overheard a man telling war stories,
and what the old vet was saying made Hardrath ``jump out of my
skin.'' Why? His tale of how he'd been wounded and saved by a
stranger coincided exactly with Hardrath's most vivid memory of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were in the 313th Infantry Regiment, fighting near the
tiny village of Montgardon on July 5, 1944. O'Neil and two buddies
took cover in a water-filled ditch and were hit by German fire.
That evening, Hardrath heard cries for help.
</P>
<P>
   Against his better judgement, Hardrath says, about 1 a.m. on
July 6 he inched his way toward the moans and found a 6-foot deep
ditch, ``with two dead men and the third covered in blood with a
terrible wound on the top and side of his head. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wondered always over all these years whether this bird I
got out of the ditch lived,'' Hardrath says. ``My guess was he
didn't make it. I had no name or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, this past July 24, at the 50th anniversary reunion of the
313th, Hardrath's ``miracle'' happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Fayetteville, N.C., and I'm sitting on a couch half
asleep, and about 5 feet away one of these old GIs is telling a
friend how he got hit,'' Hardrath says. ``At these meetings,
stories like this are a dime a dozen, but then he came to the part
about how he and two buddies ran and jumped in a ditch and his two
buddies both got killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked, and he had a large scar on his head, where I
remembered it had been,'' says Hardrath. ``I go and ask the guy if
there was water in the ditch, and he says `Yes.' I say, `Was there
woods on one side of the ditch and a hayfield on the other,' and he
says, `Yes.' Then I ask, ``You didn't happen to get hit on the
afternoon of July 5, 1944, did you?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil's ears perked up.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls the moment: ``Somebody had asked me how I got my
Purple Heart, and I'd started describing what happened. Somehow
Howard overheard and realized I might be the individual he pulled
out of there. He described the physical surroundings, an American
tank that had been hit, a gunner sitting with his back toward a
hedgegrow with one of his legs missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardrath got straight to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I says, 'You know who came out there that night and got your
ass? I did.' He just said, 'Oh my God!' After 55 years and 19 days,
I just happened to be sitting near enough to overhear the key
information that revealed who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The two began comparing more notes about what had come to be
known as the Battle of Bloody Hill; the terrain, the names of
nearby towns and roads; a church located near the spot O'Neil went
down. ``Everything just clicked,'' Hardrath says.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil remembered lying in the bright light of a full moon,
calling for help, and waking up where Hardrath had taken him. He
remembered that his face and head were covered with blood, just as
Hardrath recalled. And he remembered vividly that his two buddies
in the ditch _ ``Birmbaum and Bromberg'' _ had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Both men had returned to the spot on the 50th anniversary of
D-Day, in 1994. Each had gone to the place where O'Neil remembered
he'd been hit and where Hardrath recalled saving a man, both busily
taking photographs and notes of the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't met. But last month, when Hardrath went to
California to visit O'Neil's family, they looked at snapshots from
'94. Hardrath was in three of O'Neil's shots.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, who was 15 when he was wounded, moved from Wisconsin to
California after the war and ran a successful business. He says he
has no doubt he owes his life to Hardrath. ``It was wonderful when
he was here, with 23 of my family members who wouldn't be around if
not for Howard,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hardrath, who is also from Wisconsin, was a 26-year-old platoon
sergeant that July. After the war, he moved to Atlanta, his late
wife's hometown, and went into real estate. Of rescuing O'Neil, he
says: ``I was just doing what had to be done, and I'm so happy I
did. After all, the O'Neils have eight children, so I know I did
the world a good turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The 313th, recalls Hardrath, comprised some 3,500 men, so the
odds of him finding O'Neil ``must just be astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, says Bill Bynam, a probabilities professor at
Westminster College in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is amazing,'' he says. ``Imagine these two
individuals living their lives for the next 50 years, being among a
minority of individuals attending a reunion, and happening to talk
with one another again and discovering the connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Their chance meeting is like success in a lottery, Bynum says:
``winning the big jackpot twice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing just doesn't happen,'' Hardrath says.
``It's a miracle.''

<P>
   At the age of 91, Bertha Hyman had a clear mind and a firm
resolve. When her life neared its end, she wanted no heroic
measures: no resuscitation, no respirator, no tangle of tubes. She
signed a ``living will'' outlining her wishes, informed two nieces
and gave one of them power of attorney to make medical decisions
for her if she could no longer make them herself.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hyman had trouble breathing a few days after surgery
for a broken hip in 1998, the nieces, Sabena Wilensky and Rosalind
Keyes, were horrified to find that she had been put on a
respirator. Only then did they learn that her nursing home, in
Delray Beach, Fla., had never sent her living will or
power-of-attorney form to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes recovered the documents, but doctors said the respirator
could not be turned off. In fact, that was not true. Experts in law
and medical ethics say that legally, doctors could have honored
Hyman's wishes. But her distraught nieces did not know that.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after five days, doctors agreed to remove the
respirator, saying Hyman might be able to breathe on her own. But
she could not, and, under sedation, she died a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was five extra days of miserable life,'' Wilensky said.
``We were feeling terribly guilty. We were in charge of her, and we
didn't do a good job. We didn't know how far we had to go to
protect ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaths like Hyman's are achingly familiar to many people.
Although millions of Americans have signed living wills and
power-of-attorney forms, thinking the documents would help them
avoid unwanted treatment and prolonged deaths, in many cases those
measures turn out to be useless.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why the documents, known collectively as
advance directives, can fail: people lose or forget them; living
wills are too vague to interpret; relatives disagree about what the
patient wanted; hospital staff mistakenly fear prosecution for
stopping life support; or doctors overrule the family and refuse to
stop treatment. Some experts say the very idea of living wills is
flawed, because the course of illness is too unpredictable to be
anticipated in a simple document.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of advance directives is just one symptom of a
much larger problem: widespread gaps and deficiencies in the care
of people who are dying. ``End-of-life care'' has become a frequent
subject of medical conferences and journal articles, and even the
American Medical Association has acknowledged that too many dying
patients suffer needlessly, and that the profession needs help to
improve their care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an entire health-care system not friendly to
end-of-life care, a work force not educated to end-of-life care and
an entire population just climbing out of the era when it was taboo
to talk about it,'' said Dr. Linda Emanuel, vice president of
ethics at the medical association and the creator of a course on
care of the dying that the group hopes will reach every doctor in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Emanuel's view, the facts that people even feel they need
legal documents like advance directives, and that 80 percent are
completed by patients and lawyers, with no advice from doctors, are
signs that something is wrong with health care.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sieger, a lawyer for Partnership for Caring, a successor
to the group that created the first living will in 1967, said,
``There is a concern that we have overlegalized the process of
dying, and that these are personal decisions between families and
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   When end-of-life care is poor, the results can be devastating,
not just to patients but to their loved ones. In the training
manual for its course, the medical association warns that the
doctors of dying patients have only one chance to ``get it right,''
and that if they do not, ``suffering may occur unnecessarily,
family distress may continue long after the patient's death, and
those who watch may worry that their death will be similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Families have sued doctors for ``medical battery'' for forcing
life support or resuscitation on unwilling patients, and some
states punish doctors who disregard advance directives.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who go against patients' wishes are not necessarily
driven by an urge to impose their will on others. Rather, they may
be struggling with complex medical issues. Deciding when to
withhold or stop care can be daunting, because advances in medicine
have changed the way people die, and telling when death is near can
often be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Most people today decline slowly from chronic diseases with
erratic courses, unlike people in earlier times, who were more
likely to die quickly from infectious diseases, accidents and heart
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   People today are also more likely to die in settings where
technology like feeding tubes and ventilators can keep them
nourished and breathing, and where decisions about using it must be
made. Although surveys show that 90 percent of Americans hope to
die at home, only 20 percent get their wish. Most die in hospitals.
Only 17 percent die in hospices, where the focus of care is keeping
the patient comfortable rather than prolonging life.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the simple reality is that in this era of
managed care and 10-minute office visits, doctors and patients may
not find time to discuss patients' feelings or to make plans about
treatment near the end of life.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Living wills were created in 1967, when people began to question
the price society seemed to be paying for medical progress:
hopelessly ill or brain-damaged patients being kept alive by
respirators, feeding tubes and pharmacologic intervention that
could not be halted without court orders.
</P>
<P>
   The wills were conceived by Luis Kutner, a human rights lawyer
in Chicago and a co-founder of Amnesty International. Kutner
presented his idea to the Euthanasia Society of America, which drew
up living wills and began distributing them.
</P>
<P>
   The documents represented an effort to wrench dying from
technology's grip, and even critics concede that the
advance-directive movement played a powerful part in forcing
doctors to acknowledge that, for dying people, more was not
necessarily better. Living wills are intended to tell doctors what
treatment patients will or will not want if they become critically
ill, cannot communicate and have little or no hope of recovering.
Respirators, cardiac resuscitation, feeding tubes, painkillers and
antibiotics are usually among the treatments covered.
</P>
<P>
   Experts strongly recommend that in addition to a living will, or
even in place of one, patients sign a durable power of attorney,
also called a health care proxy, appointing someone else to make
medical decisions when the patient can no longer do so. Those
documents become especially important when an illness takes an
unexpected turn, because a proxy can make decisions in situations
that were not anticipated in a living will.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost is the health care proxy,'' said Joseph
LaBarbera, an attorney with Lifshutz, Polland &AMP; Hoffman, a law firm
in New York that specializes in medical issues. ``It really gives
the doctor somebody to talk to who's familiar with the wishes of
the patient. Often, the living will isn't specific enough for
day-to-day stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Advance directives can be used in every state and are backed
either by legislation or by precedents set in court cases. A 1991
federal law, the Patient Self-Determination Act, requires that
hospitals and nursing homes inform patients that they have the
right to fill out advance directives.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, people who sign advance directives should expect to
have their wishes respected. Doctors and nurses are not punished
for honoring patients' requests to stop treatment, said Sieger.
``Doctors are not being criminally prosecuted or disciplined for
withholding life support,'' she said. On the contrary, she said,
doctors have been sued for refusing to stop unwanted treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, three decades after the first living will was
signed, many Americans still have painful deaths. Although peaceful
deaths do occur in hospices and some nursing homes, and many
hospitals attempt to honor advance directives, overall, advance
directives are ``ineffectual in shaping care,'' said Dr. Joanne
Lynn, director of Georgetown University's Center to Improve Care of
the Dying and co-director of a project known as the Support study,
the largest study ever conducted of dying patients in American
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Tonelli, a pulmonary specialist at the University of
Washington in Seattle and the author of the article ``Pulling the
Plug on Living Wills'' in the journal Chest in 1996, said: ``People
thought you would fill out one of these things and you would die
well. But our ability to guarantee each patient a good death is
about equal to our ability to guarantee them a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kaplan, executive director of Partnership for Caring, said
of the directives: ``They are frequently not followed. We get a lot
of calls asking for help in getting them honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Renie Rutchick, a social worker at Partnership for Caring, said
one of the calls came from the son of a 91-year-old man with
advanced Alzheimer's disease. Before developing dementia, the
father had named the son as his proxy and signed a living will
requesting no extraordinary measures. Now, the father had
pneumonia, and the son did not want him to be given antibiotics.
But a doctor insisted on treating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was his father's health care agent, and he just didn't know
he could really stick up for himself,'' Rutchick said. ``That
frequently happens.'' She told him his father did not have to be
treated against the family's wishes. ``I said, `If it ever happens
again, don't let them bully you into it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Nicholas, manager of Health Communications at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, was shocked to find that
a living will and health care proxy did not protect her mother, who
had advanced dementia, from unwanted, painful treatment at a
nursing home in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Without Nicholas' consent, her mother was given various
medications, made to choke down a type of adult formula and
hospitalized for a mild fever. ``My poor, frightened mother was
taken from her bed at night and brought by ambulance to a
hospital,'' Nicholas recalled. ``She was like an infant, in terror.
She had a living will, prepared by an attorney, and I worked in
health care. I had done lectures, I had handed living wills out to
people. How come they didn't work?''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas consulted a lawyer and several doctors, who told her
that nursing home officials, fearing charges of negligence, would
err on the side of overtreatment unless they had very specific
instructions to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas then met with administrators at the home and asked,
``How do I help you cover yourself so you can stop torturing my
mother and let her die a good death?''
</P>
<P>
   The solution was to state in writing that the nursing home was
not to take her mother to a hospital or give her any treatment
without first consulting Nicholas, who provided phone and beeper
numbers so that she could be reached 24 hours a day. Notes were
attached to the front of her mother's medical chart to alert all
staff members. The home also had Nicholas sign a ``do not
resuscitate'' order so that doctors would not try to revive her
mother if her heart or breathing stopped. ``Why didn't they give me
that order before?'' Nicholas asked. ``In my opinion, they don't
want to make this information available, because these people are
cash cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Nicholas' strategy worked. There were no more tubes
or needles or machines, and a few months after the meeting at the
home, with Nicholas by her side, her mother died peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, hospitals have recognized that many
terminally ill people do not want aggressive treatment that merely
postpones death. And so patients and their families, like Nicholas,
have been given the option of requesting do-not-resuscitate, or
DNR, orders.
</P>
<P>
   But traditionally, neither DNR orders nor living wills applied
in emergencies outside the hospital, and ambulance crews could not
honor them. So if a dying patient at home had severe pain or
breathing trouble, and a frightened relative dialed 911 hoping just
for help with oxygen or medication, the ambulance team would also
be obligated to carry out a full resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, states began passing laws to allow emergency
medical teams to respect ``out of hospital DNRs'' for dying
patients being cared for at home. The DNRs are legal documents,
signed by a doctor. Patients are generally advised to post them on
their bedroom doors or even to wear a special DNR bracelets
approved by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states and the District of Columbia do not allow
out-of-hospital DNRs: Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi, Nebraska, North
Dakota, Pennsylvania and Vermont. In those states, families who do
not want resuscitation are often counseled to avoid or delay
calling emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   That was the recommendation given to Dr. Linda Himot, a
psychiatrist in Pittsburgh who took care of her father, Jacob, as
he succumbed to congestive heart failure at the age of 95. A
visiting nurse suggested that if he died at home, Himot should wait
a while before calling the paramedics to have him declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   When her father died during the night last summer, Himot waited,
as the nurse had advised.
</P>
<P>
   But the paramedics told Himot they were obligated to try to
resuscitate him. As they began taking out their equipment, Himot
dashed off to find her father's living will. Legally, they were not
permitted to honor living wills. But when she produced it, they
read it and _ despite the law, apparently _ put their equipment
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a fruitless act,'' Himot said. ``It seemed
almost sacrilegious.''
</P>
<P>
   The most exhaustive information about end-of-life care comes
from Lynn's Support study of dying patients, which included 9,105
patients at five American hospitals around the country from 1989 to
1994. The study found that half died with moderate to severe pain,
hooked up to machines in intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the doctors surveyed had no idea what kind of
care their patients wanted at the end of life. Often, both doctors
and patients had avoided talking about death. Only 14 percent of
the patients had advance directives, only 90 directives said
anything specific about treatment and just 22 discussed life
support in the patient's current condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients and families often seemed adrift, confused, and in
need of guidance about what was happening and how to respond to
it,'' Lynn said. She said little had changed since the study was
done.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty in planning care at the end of life is
that even with the sickest patients, it can be hard to tell when
the end is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 20 percent of us die with a phase that is clearly
`dying,''' Lynn said. While people with terminal cancer often
follow a predictable path, more Americans die from chronic diseases
of the heart, lung and kidneys, which are less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in November by Lynn and her colleagues in The
Journal of the American Medical Association showed how difficult it
could be for doctors to make predictions. The study included 2,607
patients who were hospitalized and seriously ill with heart
failure, liver or lung disease. Using standard criteria to gauge
the severity of the illness, doctors judged that 923 would live six
months or less _ but 70 percent survived longer. Even when tighter
criteria narrowed the six-month prediction to just 19 patients,
half outlived the prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Other patients died sooner than expected. Some who were given a
40 percent likelihood of living for two more months died within
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said she and her colleagues concluded that those with
terminal diseases ``have to make peace with God and be ready to go,
but also ready to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, when Bertha Nunez, an 87-year-old Miami resident,
caught a respiratory infection and had trouble breathing, her
daughter, Bertha Bouza, accompanied her to Kendall Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The two women signed forms provided by a nurse saying that if
Nunez were to deteriorate, they would not want resuscitation or
other aggressive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Nunez stopped breathing. ``To me, at that precise
moment, she died,'' Bouza said. ``I had her in my arms, and that's
the way I wanted my mother to die.'' But doctors called guards to
remove Bouza from the room, began trying to resuscitate Nunez and
placed her on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no right to do this,'' Bouza said, weeping at the
memory. A day later, Nunez was allowed to die. ``I feel so
guilty,'' Bouza said. ``I was her only child, and she put all her
confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors involved declined to discuss the details of the
case, although one, Dr. Julio Ortiz, said: ``I don't know what
legal implications are involved here for the hospital, for the
doctors, for the nurses. When somebody expires, most hospitals have
a routine of performing a code blue. Maybe in trying to do the best
they could have done they did something wrong, which has no bearing
because the patient died anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who try to revive patients against their will are rarely
penalized, said Sieger, the lawyer for Partnership for Caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few states, Alaska and Utah, have established penalties in
legislation,'' she said. ``But the penalties are not significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers have begun to press ``medical battery'' claims
against doctors and hospitals who do not honor living wills. Few of
these cases have been closed so far, but in one, in 1996, a jury
awarded $16.5 million to the family of Brenda Young, a woman in
Michigan, now 42, who was resuscitated in 1992 despite her written
instructions, and was left with severe brain damage and little
mental function, needing constant care. The case was later settled
by the hospital for a sum that the two sides agreed not to
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is being looked to as the beginning of a trend,''
Sieger said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most American doctors are not well prepared to help patients and
their families make painful decisions about dying. Medical schools
teach little about how to discuss death with patients, or how to
treat pain or provide other types of palliative care, which is
treatment given strictly to keep a patient comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey by the American Medical Association found that
only four of 126 American medical schools required that students
take even one course on care of the dying. And The Journal of the
American Medical Association recently published a harsh assessment
of 50 leading medical textbooks, saying that most failed to say
anything on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses also said their training in end-of-life care was
inadequate, according to a national survey published in April in
the journal Oncology Nursing Forum by Dr. Betty Ferrell, a research
scientist at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif.
One nurse wrote that end of life was not even mentioned during her
training. Another said that the oncologists she worked with were
reluctant to mention a terminal prognosis to patients, and simply
went on giving chemotherapy until the patients died.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the Feb. 3 issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine reported that children dying of cancer suffered needlessly
from pain, nausea and other symptoms that could have been treated
better. Another article, in the Jan. 20 issue, said patients with
advanced Alzheimer's disease were too often given feeding tubes
that did not help them medically, but only increased their
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel, the vice president of ethics at the AMA, said the lack
of expertise, particularly in palliative care, was one of the
factors driving patients to seek doctor-assisted suicide. If pain
and other distressing symptoms were treated properly, she argues,
fewer patients would become desperate to end their lives
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But patients as well as doctors need education. Lynn said that
rather than depending solely on pieces of paper to make their
wishes known, patients had to talk with their families and doctors
about their illnesses, about what was likely to happen to them with
or without various treatments and about their hopes and fears
regarding death and aggressive procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting into a power struggle over who makes the
decisions, Tonelli, the pulmonary specialist, said, doctors,
patients and families should make them together; an advance
directive may serve as a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that advance directives are of significant value for
patients or the health care system as a whole is fairly passe,''
Tonelli said. Instead, he said, people should try to improve
patient-physician communication before the end of life and during
the final phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those efforts are much more likely to be successful in the
long run,'' Tonelli said, ``but they are less appealing to many
people, because they're not straightforward or simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said the approach Tonelli described, which the medical
profession calls ``advance-care planning,'' was more common now
than it was five years ago. ``But probably no more than 10 to 15
percent of the people who should be doing it are doing it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care is an obstacle: given 10 or 15 minutes for a
typical office appointment, doctors and patients are more likely to
spend the time on immediate medical problems than on worrying about
the future. Often, the discussions do not begin until a crisis
develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``These will remain difficult decisions,'' Tonelli said. ``Each
individual situation is different. When it's done right, you
struggle with each of them, and I don't see any short cut.''

SHOWING AGE AND WEAR, LIBERTY MAY BE WATCHING THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Liberty players say they have nothing to prove
this season. They sound sincere but not entirely persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty will begin the fourth season of the Women's National
Basketball Association as the defending Eastern Conference
champions. Twice in the past three years, the Liberty has been one
game short of a championship. Four of the team's veterans were
picked to play in the league's inaugural All-Star Game last season.
And the Liberty, ridiculed for lacking pizazz and stars, is
featured in the league's 2000 promotional advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberty is not picked to finish first or second in the
East and is doubtful to make the playoffs. The favorites in the
East are the Washington Mystics, led by Chamique Holdsclaw, last
season's rookie of the year, Nikki McCray, Vicky Bullett and Tausha
Mills, this season's rookie sensation. The Charlotte Sting and
Cleveland Rockers have been deemed contenders for the second berth
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty _ with the league's oldest starting lineup and
uncertainty at the center position _ is given an outside shot at
finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were picked fourth with Rebecca Lobo,'' Liberty
Coach Richie Adubato said. ``Any time you make a team an underdog,
that is a tremendous motivational tool for a coach to reach players
and get them to play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobo _ who missed all but the first 42 seconds of last season
with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee _ tore the
same ligament while working out in December and will be out of the
lineup until July. Kym Hampton, the team's 37-year-old all-star
center, felt so good after arthroscopic surgery on her knee that
she came out of retirement. But the knee began swelling during
training camp and Hampton retired again Friday, disappointed that
she could not play another season.
</P>
<P>
   Adubato had hoped to rely on Tamika Whitmore, the 6-foot-2-inch
power forward who rose above expectations during her 1999 rookie
season. But Whitmore arrived in camp 42 pounds overweight and has
only shed 18 pounds in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably won't be able to help us win games until after
another two or three weeks,'' Adubato said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Whitmore is able to contribute, Adubato will go with Shea
Mahoney, the 6-2 rookie forward from Western Kentucky, as his sixth
player. The coach is also looking into the possibility of the
center position ``being done by committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The three vying for the job are Olga Firsova, the 6-6 Kansas
State center who was the team's No. 1 draft pick, the 6-5
Alessandro Santo de Oliveira of Brazil and Venus Lacy, the spirited
6-3 veteran who saw limited action last season but who has
impressed Adubato with her aggressive play in camp. Sunday, the
Liberty acquired forward Tari Phillips from the Portland Fire for
guard Carolyn Young, who was not expected to play until July
because of a knee injury. Phillips, who averaged 4.1 points and 2.1
rebounds a game for the Orlando Miracle last season, was picked by
Portland in the 2000 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   If the Liberty is to repeat as division winners, it will do so
behind veterans like the all-star guard Teresa Weatherspoon, the
team's emotional leader on and off the court, and the all-star
forward Vicky Johnson, who led the Liberty last season in minutes
per game (33) and points (13.3). Sue Wicks, coming off her best
year as a pro, and the clutch-shooting Crystal Robinson, who led
the league in 3-pointers with 76, will also be expected to step
into big roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told we're too old, that we needed an overhaul,''
said Weatherspoon, 35; Wicks is 34 and Johnson is 28. ``We take
that as a challenge, a motivating factor for us to walk out on the
floor and show people that we come to work every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an 0-3 preseason, the Liberty will be tested early.
The team opens the season Monday against the defending champion
Houston Comets in Houston. Three of the Liberty's next four games
are on the road against Phoenix, Washington and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it that way because we get to see just how tough we
really are, and just how bad we really want it,'' Weatherspoon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a good start will matter little if the Liberty fades down
the stretch. To avoid getting run down in a season that has been
condensed to accommodate the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia, Adubato will most likely look to Becky Hammon, the 5-6
guard who provides an instant spark off the bench, and Jessica
Bibby, the team's fourth-round pick from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's trademark is defense and hustle. In the end, the
key to the Liberty's success this season may well be its desire to
prove all the naysayers wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we come out every night and give it 110 percent,
people still think we can't play this game,'' Johnson said.
``During the off-season, I talked to players around the league who
said: `The Liberty. You guys aren't that good.' A lot of players in
the West said that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're the only team in the league that beat Houston three
times last year.'' &QL;

TORONTO REALLY WINS BY A DOUGHNUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An early visitor to Canada's largest city searched in vain for
sin and extravagance and reluctantly decided Toronto was the place
where he would like to breathe his last breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition between life and death would be barely
noticeable,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics said much the same thing about Seattle in the late
1920s, when Mayor Bertha Knight Landes closed up the town after
firing 100 cops who had financial investments in gin mills and
bordellos.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened since we outgrew our puritanical roots?
</P>
<P>
   Seattle built the Space Needle, but Toronto has a taller one. In
fact CN Tower is the highest free-standing structure in the world.
</P>
<P>
   They've got Lake Ontario. We have Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Both cities have sports stadiums with swinging roofs.
</P>
<P>
   We've got Pike Place. Toronto has the Kensington and St.
Lawrence markets.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's theater arts are said to be surpassed only by New York
and London, yet Seattle cannot be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent performance of the musical ``Swingstep'' in Toronto,
residents of a small Cape Breton fishing village complained of
creeping urbanization bringing with it ``crime ... traffic ... and
Starbucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Toronto has almost as many coffee shops as Seattle but
they carry the corporate logo of ``Second Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   We've got raging debates over prayer in schools. A pressure
group in Toronto claims that antisocial behavior in schools would
be reversed if a daily ``Oath of Allegiance to the Queen'' became a
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   If there are so many similarities, why was Toronto chosen over
Seattle as ``the world's most livable city'' by a U.N. panel?
During a recent visit, we tried to find out.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered Toronto has efficient and well-used subway lines,
streetcar systems and underground malls linking most of the major
downtown offices and stores. We have endless traffic jams, a
downtown bus tunnel and vague promises.
</P>
<P>
   We debate whether our city should hire hit squads to reduce bird
droppings. Toronto's most famous piece of public art consists of 60
Canadian geese flying triumphantly beneath the glass ``sky'' in
Eaton Centre.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be that Toronto was named the world's most livable
city because a resident or visitor is never more than half a block
away from a sausage stand or a doughnut shoppe. In fact, the
morning ``doughnut hour'' has been described as the defining
Canadian social event by writers for the weekly CBC comedy show
``The Royal Canadian Air Farce.''
</P>
<P>
   You can hardly get more livable than that.
</P>
<P>
   What do the eastern Canadians eat with their muffins? Seafood
stew, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Chowder
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces thick-cut bacon, in quarter-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   3 cups sliced onions
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup hot water
</P>
<P>
   4 cups fish stock
</P>
<P>
   4 cups sliced potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds halibut cheeks, or other firm, white fish
</P>
<P>
   3 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sour cream, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   You can make terrific stock out of two or three fish heads, but
I know you. No way. Instead, you can substitute clam nectar or make
your stock from Knorr fish cubes, which you can buy in most
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In your chowder pot, cook the bacon slowly until it begins to
brown. Add the onions and continue cooking for about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir flour into bacon grease. Cook two minutes
then remove pan from heat. Add the hot water gradually, stirring
well. With a whisk beat in the fish stock.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the pot the potatoes, carrots, herbs and seasonings. You
can let this mess sit, refrigerated, for a day or two and the
flavors will improve.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, reheat the stock, add the fish in bite-size
pieces and when it begins to firm up add the milk. Simmer but do
not boil. Add more salt and pepper if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Serve in four large bowls with a scoop of sour cream, a
sprinkling of parsley and hard chowder crackers or croutons in
each. Or you could serve the chowder with:
</P>
<P>
   Mackenzie Muffins
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups flour
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup oat bran (not flakes)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cups brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-third cups mashed banana
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   William Lyon Mackenzie was Toronto's first mayor and I believe
he liked to combine flour, bran, baking powder, baking soda, salt
and cinnamon in a large bowl. Then he made a well in the flour
mixture and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl dump the egg and brown sugar and beat until
smooth. Add the bananas, raisins, oil and vanilla. Beat again. Pour
into well in flour mixture, stirring just until dry ingredients are
moistened.
</P>
<P>
   Fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full with batter and bake 20
to 25 minutes in a 375-degree oven. Makes about a dozen or enough
to feed one Toronto resident until he or she reaches the next
sausage stand.

BOOKS GET SHORTER AS BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE BANISHED TO THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Cal., N.J., Md.)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is fitting that Robert Kaplan's slim book ``The Nothing That
Is'' is a portrait of the numeral zero. The Harvard mathematician
is among a wave of mostly scholarly writers whose recent books have
left nothing in the place usually reserved for the pages upon pages
where scholars lay out the sources for their findings and opinions.
</P>
<P>
   To skim through the 78 pages of bibliography for Kaplan's
225-page book, look elsewhere _ namely on the Internet, where the
material resides on a Web site that belongs to his publisher,
Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   In a growing number of instances involving both trade publishers
and prominent academic publishers, bibliographies _ the traditional
structural support system for an author's work _ have been severed
from books and moved to digital outposts. There, publishers say,
they are available to anyone who wants to read them; a note in the
printed book gives the Web address where the bibliography can be
found. The advantage, the publishers say, is a smaller, cheaper,
more accessible book.
</P>
<P>
   Some authors, perhaps surprisingly, support the change, while
others have fiercely opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we're encouraging our authors to put as much as they
can on a Web site to try and clean up the books,'' said Larry
Cohen, editor in chief of MIT Press, which publishes scholarly and
popular trade books. ``Manuscript sizes are getting longer and
longer. We've been trying to figure out how to deal with it by
separating parts of the book that perhaps a minority of readers
would be interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's frightening,'' said Peter Lyman, a library
science professor and former head of the campus library system at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``Paper, by its nature,
is a stable medium that will last for hundreds of years if it's
acid-free and treated at a natural temperature and humidity.
Digital material is fugitive, and most Web sites disappear in about
18 months. It's more than vanity to have a bibliography. It's part
of a collaboration that stretches decades and maybe centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 18th century, the bibliography has underpinned the
scholarship of books by organizing chaotic records of knowledge
that came before. This list of references, titles and interviews
that influence a new book is a road map for scholars and other
readers, enabling them to follow the trail of supporting evidence
for theories and controversial points.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pare down books is provoking a practical
intellectual debate among writers, publishers and archivists, and
among its most provocative aspects is whether this sort of
slice-and-dice Web publishing is an early step toward eliminating
paper versions of some books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole issue of a book is up for question,'' said
Suzanne Calpestri, a librarian at the University of California at
Berkeley who calls the division taking place grangerizing, which is
an antique term for the clipping of book engravings. ``We don't
know what kinds of issues are involved with maintaining equipment.
We don't know how to save bytes for centuries. We know that rag
paper has lasted for hundreds of years, but the digital is so
ephemeral with changing platforms and equipment. Will you even be
able to read it 15 years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Many academic and trade publishers experimenting with these
evolving forms concede that no one really knows the answer to that
question. The Library of Congress, for example, is seeking money
for pilot programs on preserving digital material.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an answer notwithstanding, some publishers contend
that splitting up a book is a way to sell, package and price a
title in a commercially more appealing format.
</P>
<P>
   The information from the back of the book is a natural choice
for excision, they say, because of the prevailing view that only a
small portion of readers actually pore through the material. The
word bibliography is derived from the Greek bibliographia, which
literally means the writing of books; scholars often refer to this
material as ``the academic apparatus.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, some writers feel fiercely proud of this trove
of sources because it conveys the extent of their work and gives
their theories more credibility. In March the writer Jill Watts was
asked by her publisher, Oxford University Press, to consider an
electronic split of the notes and bibliography from her
yet-to-be-published portrait of Mae West, which explores the
influence black culture had on the actress' performances.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, an associate professor of history at California State
University at San Marcos, said she was stunned by the idea and
started asking other writers and academics for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what's on the Internet doesn't last forever, then we've
lost power,'' she said. ``If the academic apparatus disappears,
then we're moving back to an earlier period when authors weren't
citing sources and could just say whatever they wanted. We're
coming out of an industrial-oriented society that wanted everything
to be added up and quantified into a virtual society where that's
less valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement of her editor at Oxford, Watts decided to
include her bibliography and look for pages of notes and text to
trim instead.
</P>
<P>
   One reason university presses show enthusiasm for severing notes
and bibliographies is that they are often financially pressed. To
expand readership and revenue, these publishers are trying to offer
books that can find a popular market, and that means packaging that
is not too weighty or academic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're realizing that an author can put the core ideas into a
book,'' said Marlie Wasserman, the director of Rutgers University
Press and president of the Association of American University
Presses, which represents about 120 major academic publishers.
``But the kind of scholarly apparatus that went on for pages and
pages _ that we had to knock down trees for _ can be posted on a
Web site without interfering with the sales of a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University Press is just starting to experiment with the
idea. Recently the publisher asked one of its authors, Stephen G.
Brush, to shorten a newly revised 500-page textbook, ``Physics: The
Human Adventure.'' Instead of rewriting and trimming the text,
Brush, a professor of science history at the University of
Maryland, compromised with the publisher by agreeing to post his
100-page bibliography online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen whether this will work,'' he said. ``It
hasn't even been agreed whether the author maintains the site or
the publisher does.'' He, too, regards the shift as a baby step
toward something bigger. ``What I'm worried about is the pressure
to put a book just entirely online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who maintains the Web sites leads to even more
questions. If it's the author's responsibility, what happens in the
case of illness or death? If it's the publisher's job, what happens
if the publisher goes under?
</P>
<P>
   MIT Press encountered some of these problems recently after a
textbook author, a professor, went on sabbatical and was unable to
repair a Web site when readers complained that the bibliography
posted there had suddenly become inaccessible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some large publishers of popular trade books, like Random House,
say they are not asking writers to divide titles into electronic
and paper sections. But several authors said that other major
publishers are beginning to raise the idea.
</P>
<P>
   One author of a forthcoming historical trade book, who asked to
remain anonymous, said her publisher had asked about splitting off
the bibliography but compromised with an agreement to put other
information, like charts and illustrations, online instead.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers, however, are pressing for such divisions. Robin
Marantz Henig said she asked her publisher, Houghton Mifflin, if
she could detach the reference section of notes and other material
from ``The Monk in the Garden,'' her new biography of the
path-breaking genetic scientist Gregor Mendel. The publisher
approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people take shortcuts and don't tell readers about
the references for the sake of not weighing down a book,'' she
said. ``This allows me to be serious about the references but not
ponderous in the book. People ask me about whether Mendel fudged
his data. This allows me to post the 1936 paper that suggested he
might have and other papers that reassessed that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, the author of ``The Nothing That Is'' (1999), is still
evaluating the results of his experiment with a divided book. His
electronic references have enabled him to make his bibliography
organic _ constantly growing with feedback from reviewers and
readers. And he credits the book's unexpected success to its slim
size and format.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no other option,'' Kaplan explained. ``The publisher
wanted to have the success that it wouldn't have if it was a
larger, thicker book with a more scholarly appearance. And I didn't
want my book to be published without a bibliography to back up what
are often new and controversial points. We were at loggerheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's editorial director at Oxford, Peter Ginna, said that
the book was one of the company's top sellers, having gone through
five new printings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are issues to be worked out. The Italian and German
translations of the book failed to make note of the existence of a
Web site. Some reviewers criticized Kaplan for the lack of a
bibliography, failing to see the reader's note that said the
material was on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And one professor in Dublin, Ireland, simply could not download
the information from the bibliography, which includes references
ranging from ``Khandakhadyaka, an Astronomical Treatise of
Brahamagupta,'' an Indian treatise written in 1934, to ``The Man
Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat'' by Oliver Sacks, which was
published in 1985 (with a bibliography).
</P>
<P>
   In that case, there was an old-fashioned, low-tech solution.
Oxford University Press printed out copies of the bibliography and
dispatched snail mail to Ireland.

Central Park was considered dangerous and rundown, it was not such
a big deal that soccer players tore up the grass with their cleats
or dog owners did not always clean up. But now, the city is getting
fussy about the park. By Barbara Stewart.

   SKIMPY-BOOKS (New York) _ In a growing number of instances
involving both trade publishers and prominent academic publishers,
bibliographies _ the traditional structural support system for an
author's work _ have been severed from books and moved to digital
outposts. There, publishers say, they are available to anyone who
wants to read them. The advantage, the publishers say, is a
smaller, cheaper, more accessible book. Some authors support the
change, while others have fiercely opposed it. By Doreen Carvajal.

ISRAEL'S PRESIDENT, ACCUSED OF HIDING $300,000 CASH GIFTS, WILL
RESIGN  

</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Ezer Weizman, lambasted for financial
misdealings in a new report by state prosecutors, will resign on
July 10, his spokeswoman said Sunday, putting a scandal-tainted end
to what had been one of the most distinguished careers in Israeli
public life.
</P>
<P>
   An election in parliament to select Israel's next president is
tentatively scheduled for Aug. 1, with former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres expected to get Prime Minister Ehud Barak's backing in a
contest against Moshe Katzav, a longtime legislator from the
right-wing Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   Though the position is largely ceremonial, the president of
Israel represents the country in countless diplomatic forums, and
has the power to appoint judges, commute sentences and perform
other judicial functions.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman decided to quit days after the release of a scathing
report by Israel's attorney general on his unreported and untaxed
receipt of more than $300,000 in cash gifts from two businessmen a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were insufficient grounds for prosecution, Weizman
could have faced criminal charges on at least one count of bribery
had the statute of limitations not expired, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, who was a cabinet minister and member of parliament in
the period he received the payments, had failed to abide by
financial disclosure rules for public officials, the attorney
general said.
</P>
<P>
   The report charged that the president's conduct ``hurt the
public and damaged its faith in elected public officials.''
</P>
<P>
   That faith took a further beating Sunday with the resignation of
Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is charged with three
criminal counts of sexual assault and harassment, based on the
testimony of three former female subordinates. Mordechai, a highly
decorated former general and defense minister, was an unsuccessful
prime ministerial candidate in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, stands
accused of the misuse of public funds during his term in office,
and close associates of Barak are under investigation for possible
criminal violations of Israel's campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, whose second term as president was to have ended in two
years, has been a public figure in Israel since he led its air
force to victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He had never been
tarred by scandal before reports of the gifts surfaced last year.
</P>
<P>
   Famously caustic in tone and intemperate toward critics, he had
cultivated a reputation of cranky rectitude that seemed to elevate
him above the partisan political fray. Even his enemies saw him as
a man whose ideas of honor and principle led him to sabotage his
personal political aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But in his sworn testimony to the attorney general's office,
Weizman readily acknowledged that Rami Unger, an Israeli
businessman, and Edouard Seroussi, a French entrepreneur, had
provided the funds to support his political ambitions. ``They
didn't want me because of my pretty eyes,'' he told investigators.
``They wanted me because of what I was, and what they hoped that I
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he stopped accepting the gifts when he first became a
candidate for the presidency a decade ago, because ``perhaps I
thought that if I was going to be president, it would be more
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He had said after the report's release that he would stick to
previously announced plan to remain in office until the Jewish New
Year in October. But the speaker of parliament, Avraham Burg,
warned Weizman's chief of staff that if the president did not step
down now, there would be a motion in parliament to have him
dismissed. Weizman informed Burg late Saturday that he would resign
in six weeks, said Batya Keinan, the president's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ophir Pines, chairman of the governing coalition's parliamentary
bloc, said Sunday that by resigning, Weizman ``had maintained his
honor, and the honor of the presidency.''

COHEN ASSAILS BUSH'S MILITARY ADVICE AND INVITES HIM TO A
BRIEFING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen Sunday invited
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his national security advisers to
the Pentagon for a briefing on the state of the nation's strategic
nuclear arsenal after criticizing Bush's recent pledge to reduce
the number of American nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded by pointing to the military
credentials of the Texan's advisers and suggesting that the
campaign of Vice President Al Gore was playing politics with the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen extended the invitation following Bush's proposal last
week to consider making unilateral reductions in nuclear weapons,
possibly deeper than those being negotiated between the United
States and Russia. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, also pledged to construct a far more expansive
antiballistic missile defense than the one currently contemplated
by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, appearing Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said Bush's
proposals contained ``internal inconsistencies.'' Building a larger
missile defense than the administration's limited one, Cohen added,
would force the Russians and other nations, like China, to respond
with increases in their offensive nuclear arsenals, making
negotiated reductions far less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any military commander will tell you, it's far better to have
more numbers against a defense than to have a higher defense,''
Cohen said. ``And so what you do by going up higher on defense, you
will force the Russians and others to raise their limits much
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's criticisms echoed those by Bush's challenger Vice
President Al Gore, who used a commencement address at the United
States Military Academy on Saturday to attack the governor's
proposals as harmful to arms control and threatening to global
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Although critical of Bush's ideas, Cohen tried to couch his
remarks as a nonpartisan effort to inform the emerging political
debate over the nation's nuclear arms and defense strategy. Cohen,
a former senator from Maine and the only Republican in Clinton's
cabinet, expressed his ``high regard'' for the Governor and his
advisers, who include a number of luminaries from past Republican
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would invite Bush to meet with members of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and Adm. Richard W. Mies, commander of the American
nuclear arsenal, as a matter of fairness in the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the joint chiefs would be willing certainly to do
this, and I think it would be important,'' he said, ``because if
this is going to become an area of debate in the fall elections,
then I think both candidates ought to have equal opportunity to
have access to the information that the vice president does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he and then Vice President Gore will be in a
better position to debate this in a way that's responsible and, I
think, informed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, the Bush campaign's press secretary, said in
response to Cohen's proposal, referring to two key Bush advisers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely Secretary Cohen is not suggesting that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin Powell, who led our
defenses, don't understand them. And we are confident that the
Joint Chiefs of Staff would welcome Governor Bush's proposal
because it allows military planners to determine the appropriate
levels of security based on new guidance and a new security era.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that Al Gore would call on his administration
not to play politics with these briefings or the Joint Chiefs of
Staff,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said that the invitation to Bush was Cohen's
idea. While it is common for a president elect to receive
high-level national security briefings as part of the transition to
the White House, it is unusual to extend such an early invitation
to a presidential candidate from the party out of power, especially
one who has not yet received his party's formal nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cohen said he ``was appointed in this position to
take the politics out of national security debates.'' The
invitation, nonetheless, offered tantalizing political
implications.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Cohen's criticism, the invitation could be seen as a
suggestion that Bush's ideas are ill-formed. At the same time,
having Bush discuss nuclear strategy with senior commanders could
lend weight to the governor's handling of defense issues in the
coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they had not yet made arrangements for a
briefing. One potentially knotty problem could be the level of
secrecy surrounding the nation's nuclear weapons. Since Bush does
not have a security clearance, he might be able to receive only an
unclassified briefing.
</P>
<P>
   In his proposal last week, Bush did not say he would reduce the
number of nuclear weapons automatically. Instead, he said he would
consider reductions based on recommendations by the Pentagon's
military commanders. Last Tuesday, even as Bush made his proposals,
those commanders appeared on Capitol Hill and said they would
oppose reducing the number of warheads below the 2,000 to 2,500
being negotiated under the third strategic arms reduction treaty,
or Start 3.
</P>
<P>
   Under Start 2, which Russia's parliament recently ratified, the
American and Russian arsenals are supposed to come down to 3,000 to
3,500, from roughly 6,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Sunday, Cohen defended the administration's
efforts to negotiate the Start 3 reductions with the Russians, as
well as changes to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 that
would allow for a limited missile defense aimed at emerging threats
from countries like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to do it in the context of how we balance the
defense and the offense,'' Cohen said. ``And we should do so in a
very methodical, thoughtful, and intellectually sound way.''

AUSTRALIANS MARCH IN SUPPORT OF ABORIGINES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ More than 200,000 people, a crowd larger
than any expected at the Olympics here in September, marched on
Sunday to support campaigns for social justice for Australia's
black minority.
</P>
<P>
   The largest civil rights gathering in Australian history clogged
Sydney, a sprawling city of 8 million people, and forced police to
close much of the city to traffic for up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   High above the river of people who delivered the country's
sharpest political street message since anti-Vietnam war
demonstrations in the 1970s, a sky-writer left a white vapor trail
in the sky, tracing the simple message: ``SORRY!''
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated the crowd at more than 150,000. Rally leaders
claimed the total was much higher, and a national TV network gave
an estimate of 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Clark, chairman of Australia's leading indigenous lobby
group, the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander Commission,
called the strong showing ``a huge success,'' while other march
organizers were swift to take the size of the gathering as a
mandate to press the government for a formal treaty on the status
and rights of Australia's 380,000 Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Scott, chairwoman of the multiracial Reconciliation
Council that organized the march, noted that such agreements have
been negotiated for minorities in Canada, Scandinavia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney parade _ a three-mile walk through downtown with the
air of a family outing in brisk fall weather _ was the centerpiece
of a weekend of nationwide ceremonies and rallies organized by the
council to acknowledge mistreatment of Aborigines and to press for
future equity for them.
</P>
<P>
   From early morning to mid-afternoon, a river of people flowed
across the eight-lane, mile-long Harbor Bridge on which the
Australian national flag and the black, red and yellow Aboriginal
political flag were flying. Organizers chose the route to symbolize
hopes for ending two centuries of estrangement between the white
majority and Aborigines in this country of 19 million.
</P>
<P>
   European settlement began in Australia in 1788 with a British
convict colony on Sydney Harbor. Aboriginal history here goes back
to 600 tribal groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers who roamed this
vast island continent for 40,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's marchers were overwhelmingly white, but there were also
Asians, Australia's latest immigrants. The demonstration encouraged
both black and white civil rights leaders, who concede that recent
surveys have revealed that deep national divisions still exist on
what should be done about Aboriginal grievances and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's prime minister, John Howard, a conservative elected
in 1996, rejects the demands of Aborigines for a formal government
apology for past mistreatment and calls for a civil rights treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's march started from an intersection near his official
waterfront residence, but Howard did not join the gathering.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Reconciliation Council acknowledges that its own extensive
research shows majority support for Howard's position. The surveys
show that 58 percent oppose special rights for Aborigines to
reflect their historic position. Some 62 percent reject the idea of
an apology for previous wrongs, some fearing retroactive
compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, 61, who is known as a close student of such polls, says
he favors what he terms ``practical reconciliation.'' On the eve of
the march he declared again that this was more likely to be
achieved by popular action than by official words and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Howard's critics turned their backs on him and yelled
``Say sorry!'' as he spoke at a reconciliation ceremony on Saturday
to a mostly white audience of about 1,500 at the Sydney Opera House
on Bennelong Point, which is named for the chieftain who greeted
the British invaders there.
</P>
<P>
   Since that invasion, the first Australians have become the
worst-off Australians. In this generally affluent nation, their
levels of health, education, income, employment, housing, and life
expectancy are far lower than those of whites and Asians, and they
have the highest rates of imprisonment and welfare dependency.
Their plight has until recently attracted more indifference than
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines have had full civil rights since the 1960s, and in
the 1990s they made political gains. For most, these advances have
not lifted living standards much, despite welfare and other
government funding of $1.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rising generation of Aboriginal leaders _ such as Sen. Aden
Ridgway, 38, the only indigenous member of the federal parliament,
and Clark, 47, who are both of mixed parentage _ say the problems
and answers are matters of self-esteem and self-determination
rather than money.

 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the age of 91, Bertha Hyman had a clear mind and a firm
resolve. When her life neared its end, she wanted no heroic
measures: no resuscitation, no respirator, no tangle of tubes. She
signed a ``living will'' outlining her wishes, informed two nieces
and gave one of them power of attorney to make medical decisions
for her if she could no longer make them herself.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hyman had trouble breathing a few days after surgery
for a broken hip in 1998, the nieces, Sabena Wilensky and Rosalind
Keyes, were horrified to find that she had been put on a
respirator. Only then did they learn that her nursing home, in
Delray Beach, Fla., had never sent her living will or
power-of-attorney form to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes recovered the documents, but doctors said the respirator
could not be turned off. In fact, that was not true. Experts in law
and medical ethics say that legally, doctors could have honored
Hyman's wishes. But her distraught nieces did not know that.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after five days, doctors agreed to remove the
respirator, saying Hyman might be able to breathe on her own. But
she could not, and, under sedation, she died a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was five extra days of miserable life,'' Wilensky said.
``We were feeling terribly guilty. We were in charge of her, and we
didn't do a good job. We didn't know how far we had to go to
protect ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaths like Hyman's are achingly familiar to many people.
Although millions of Americans have signed living wills and
power-of-attorney forms, thinking the documents would help them
avoid unwanted treatment and prolonged deaths, in many cases those
measures turn out to be useless.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why the documents, known collectively as
advance directives, can fail: people lose or forget them; living
wills are too vague to interpret; relatives disagree about what the
patient wanted; hospital staff mistakenly fear prosecution for
stopping life support; or doctors overrule the family and refuse to
stop treatment. Some experts say the very idea of living wills is
flawed, because the course of illness is too unpredictable to be
anticipated in a simple document.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of advance directives is just one symptom of a
much larger problem: widespread gaps and deficiencies in the care
of people who are dying. ``End-of-life care'' has become a frequent
subject of medical conferences and journal articles, and even the
American Medical Association has acknowledged that too many dying
patients suffer needlessly, and that the profession needs help to
improve their care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an entire health-care system not friendly to
end-of-life care, a work force not educated to end-of-life care and
an entire population just climbing out of the era when it was taboo
to talk about it,'' said Dr. Linda Emanuel, vice president of
ethics at the medical association and the creator of a course on
care of the dying that the group hopes will reach every doctor in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Emanuel's view, the facts that people even feel they need
legal documents like advance directives, and that 80 percent are
completed by patients and lawyers, with no advice from doctors, are
signs that something is wrong with health care.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sieger, a lawyer for Partnership for Caring, a successor
to the group that created the first living will in 1967, said,
``There is a concern that we have overlegalized the process of
dying, and that these are personal decisions between families and
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   When end-of-life care is poor, the results can be devastating,
not just to patients but to their loved ones. In the training
manual for its course, the medical association warns that the
doctors of dying patients have only one chance to ``get it right,''
and that if they do not, ``suffering may occur unnecessarily,
family distress may continue long after the patient's death, and
those who watch may worry that their death will be similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Families have sued doctors for ``medical battery'' for forcing
life support or resuscitation on unwilling patients, and some
states punish doctors who disregard advance directives.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who go against patients' wishes are not necessarily
driven by an urge to impose their will on others. Rather, they may
be struggling with complex medical issues. Deciding when to
withhold or stop care can be daunting, because advances in medicine
have changed the way people die, and telling when death is near can
often be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Most people today decline slowly from chronic diseases with
erratic courses, unlike people in earlier times, who were more
likely to die quickly from infectious diseases, accidents and heart
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   People today are also more likely to die in settings where
technology like feeding tubes and ventilators can keep them
nourished and breathing, and where decisions about using it must be
made. Although surveys show that 90 percent of Americans hope to
die at home, only 20 percent get their wish. Most die in hospitals.
Only 17 percent die in hospices, where the focus of care is keeping
the patient comfortable rather than prolonging life.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the simple reality is that in this era of
managed care and 10-minute office visits, doctors and patients may
not find time to discuss patients' feelings or to make plans about
treatment near the end of life.

   Living wills were created in 1967, when people began to question
the price society seemed to be paying for medical progress:
hopelessly ill or brain-damaged patients being kept alive by
respirators, feeding tubes and pharmacologic intervention that
could not be halted without court orders.
</P>
<P>
   The wills were conceived by Luis Kutner, a human rights lawyer
in Chicago and a co-founder of Amnesty International. Kutner
presented his idea to the Euthanasia Society of America, which drew
up living wills and began distributing them.
</P>
<P>
   The documents represented an effort to wrench dying from
technology's grip, and even critics concede that the
advance-directive movement played a powerful part in forcing
doctors to acknowledge that, for dying people, more was not
necessarily better. Living wills are intended to tell doctors what
treatment patients will or will not want if they become critically
ill, cannot communicate and have little or no hope of recovering.
Respirators, cardiac resuscitation, feeding tubes, painkillers and
antibiotics are usually among the treatments covered.
</P>
<P>
   Experts strongly recommend that in addition to a living will, or
even in place of one, patients sign a durable power of attorney,
also called a health care proxy, appointing someone else to make
medical decisions when the patient can no longer do so. Those
documents become especially important when an illness takes an
unexpected turn, because a proxy can make decisions in situations
that were not anticipated in a living will.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost is the health care proxy,'' said Joseph
LaBarbera, an attorney with Lifshutz, Polland &AMP; Hoffman, a law firm
in New York that specializes in medical issues. ``It really gives
the doctor somebody to talk to who's familiar with the wishes of
the patient. Often, the living will isn't specific enough for
day-to-day stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Advance directives can be used in every state and are backed
either by legislation or by precedents set in court cases. A 1991
federal law, the Patient Self-Determination Act, requires that
hospitals and nursing homes inform patients that they have the
right to fill out advance directives.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, people who sign advance directives should expect to
have their wishes respected. Doctors and nurses are not punished
for honoring patients' requests to stop treatment, said Sieger.
``Doctors are not being criminally prosecuted or disciplined for
withholding life support,'' she said. On the contrary, she said,
doctors have been sued for refusing to stop unwanted treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, three decades after the first living will was
signed, many Americans still have painful deaths. Although peaceful
deaths do occur in hospices and some nursing homes, and many
hospitals attempt to honor advance directives, overall, advance
directives are ``ineffectual in shaping care,'' said Dr. Joanne
Lynn, director of Georgetown University's Center to Improve Care of
the Dying and co-director of a project known as the Support study,
the largest study ever conducted of dying patients in American
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Tonelli, a pulmonary specialist at the University of
Washington in Seattle and the author of the article ``Pulling the
Plug on Living Wills'' in the journal Chest in 1996, said: ``People
thought you would fill out one of these things and you would die
well. But our ability to guarantee each patient a good death is
about equal to our ability to guarantee them a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kaplan, executive director of Partnership for Caring, said
of the directives: ``They are frequently not followed. We get a lot
of calls asking for help in getting them honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Renie Rutchick, a social worker at Partnership for Caring, said
one of the calls came from the son of a 91-year-old man with
advanced Alzheimer's disease. Before developing dementia, the
father had named the son as his proxy and signed a living will
requesting no extraordinary measures. Now, the father had
pneumonia, and the son did not want him to be given antibiotics.
But a doctor insisted on treating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was his father's health care agent, and he just didn't know
he could really stick up for himself,'' Rutchick said. ``That
frequently happens.'' She told him his father did not have to be
treated against the family's wishes. ``I said, `If it ever happens
again, don't let them bully you into it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Nicholas, manager of Health Communications at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, was shocked to find that
a living will and health care proxy did not protect her mother, who
had advanced dementia, from unwanted, painful treatment at a
nursing home in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Without Nicholas' consent, her mother was given various
medications, made to choke down a type of adult formula and
hospitalized for a mild fever. ``My poor, frightened mother was
taken from her bed at night and brought by ambulance to a
hospital,'' Nicholas recalled. ``She was like an infant, in terror.
She had a living will, prepared by an attorney, and I worked in
health care. I had done lectures, I had handed living wills out to
people. How come they didn't work?''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas consulted a lawyer and several doctors, who told her
that nursing home officials, fearing charges of negligence, would
err on the side of overtreatment unless they had very specific
instructions to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas then met with administrators at the home and asked,
``How do I help you cover yourself so you can stop torturing my
mother and let her die a good death?''
</P>
<P>
   The solution was to state in writing that the nursing home was
not to take her mother to a hospital or give her any treatment
without first consulting Nicholas, who provided phone and beeper
numbers so that she could be reached 24 hours a day. Notes were
attached to the front of her mother's medical chart to alert all
staff members. The home also had Nicholas sign a ``do not
resuscitate'' order so that doctors would not try to revive her
mother if her heart or breathing stopped. ``Why didn't they give me
that order before?'' Nicholas asked. ``In my opinion, they don't
want to make this information available, because these people are
cash cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Nicholas' strategy worked. There were no more tubes
or needles or machines, and a few months after the meeting at the
home, with Nicholas by her side, her mother died peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, hospitals have recognized that many
terminally ill people do not want aggressive treatment that merely
postpones death. And so patients and their families, like Nicholas,
have been given the option of requesting do-not-resuscitate, or
DNR, orders.
</P>
<P>
   But traditionally, neither DNR orders nor living wills applied
in emergencies outside the hospital, and ambulance crews could not
honor them. So if a dying patient at home had severe pain or
breathing trouble, and a frightened relative dialed 911 hoping just
for help with oxygen or medication, the ambulance team would also
be obligated to carry out a full resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, states began passing laws to allow emergency
medical teams to respect ``out of hospital DNRs'' for dying
patients being cared for at home. The DNRs are legal documents,
signed by a doctor. Patients are generally advised to post them on
their bedroom doors or even to wear a special DNR bracelets
approved by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states and the District of Columbia do not allow
out-of-hospital DNRs: Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi, Nebraska, North
Dakota, Pennsylvania and Vermont. In those states, families who do
not want resuscitation are often counseled to avoid or delay
calling emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   That was the recommendation given to Dr. Linda Himot, a
psychiatrist in Pittsburgh who took care of her father, Jacob, as
he succumbed to congestive heart failure at the age of 95. A
visiting nurse suggested that if he died at home, Himot should wait
a while before calling the paramedics to have him declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   When her father died during the night last summer, Himot waited,
as the nurse had advised.
</P>
<P>
   But the paramedics told Himot they were obligated to try to
resuscitate him. As they began taking out their equipment, Himot
dashed off to find her father's living will. Legally, they were not
permitted to honor living wills. But when she produced it, they
read it and _ despite the law, apparently _ put their equipment
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a fruitless act,'' Himot said. ``It seemed
almost sacrilegious.''
</P>
<P>
   The most exhaustive information about end-of-life care comes
from Lynn's Support study of dying patients, which included 9,105
patients at five American hospitals around the country from 1989 to
1994. The study found that half died with moderate to severe pain,
hooked up to machines in intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the doctors surveyed had no idea what kind of
care their patients wanted at the end of life. Often, both doctors
and patients had avoided talking about death. Only 14 percent of
the patients had advance directives, only 90 directives said
anything specific about treatment and just 22 discussed life
support in the patient's current condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients and families often seemed adrift, confused, and in
need of guidance about what was happening and how to respond to
it,'' Lynn said. She said little had changed since the study was
done.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty in planning care at the end of life is
that even with the sickest patients, it can be hard to tell when
the end is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 20 percent of us die with a phase that is clearly
`dying,''' Lynn said. While people with terminal cancer often
follow a predictable path, more Americans die from chronic diseases
of the heart, lung and kidneys, which are less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in November by Lynn and her colleagues in The
Journal of the American Medical Association showed how difficult it
could be for doctors to make predictions. The study included 2,607
patients who were hospitalized and seriously ill with heart
failure, liver or lung disease. Using standard criteria to gauge
the severity of the illness, doctors judged that 923 would live six
months or less _ but 70 percent survived longer. Even when tighter
criteria narrowed the six-month prediction to just 19 patients,
half outlived the prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Other patients died sooner than expected. Some who were given a
40 percent likelihood of living for two more months died within
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said she and her colleagues concluded that those with
terminal diseases ``have to make peace with God and be ready to go,
but also ready to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, when Bertha Nunez, an 87-year-old Miami resident,
caught a respiratory infection and had trouble breathing, her
daughter, Bertha Bouza, accompanied her to Kendall Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The two women signed forms provided by a nurse saying that if
Nunez were to deteriorate, they would not want resuscitation or
other aggressive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Nunez stopped breathing. ``To me, at that precise
moment, she died,'' Bouza said. ``I had her in my arms, and that's
the way I wanted my mother to die.'' But doctors called guards to
remove Bouza from the room, began trying to resuscitate Nunez and
placed her on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no right to do this,'' Bouza said, weeping at the
memory. A day later, Nunez was allowed to die. ``I feel so
guilty,'' Bouza said. ``I was her only child, and she put all her
confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors involved declined to discuss the details of the
case, although one, Dr. Julio Ortiz, said: ``I don't know what
legal implications are involved here for the hospital, for the
doctors, for the nurses. When somebody expires, most hospitals have
a routine of performing a code blue. Maybe in trying to do the best
they could have done they did something wrong, which has no bearing
because the patient died anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who try to revive patients against their will are rarely
penalized, said Sieger, the lawyer for Partnership for Caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few states, Alaska and Utah, have established penalties in
legislation,'' she said. ``But the penalties are not significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers have begun to press ``medical battery'' claims
against doctors and hospitals who do not honor living wills. Few of
these cases have been closed so far, but in one, in 1996, a jury
awarded $16.5 million to the family of Brenda Young, a woman in
Michigan, now 42, who was resuscitated in 1992 despite her written
instructions, and was left with severe brain damage and little
mental function, needing constant care. The case was later settled
by the hospital for a sum that the two sides agreed not to
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is being looked to as the beginning of a trend,''
Sieger said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most American doctors are not well prepared to help patients and
their families make painful decisions about dying. Medical schools
teach little about how to discuss death with patients, or how to
treat pain or provide other types of palliative care, which is
treatment given strictly to keep a patient comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey by the American Medical Association found that
only four of 126 American medical schools required that students
take even one course on care of the dying. And The Journal of the
American Medical Association recently published a harsh assessment
of 50 leading medical textbooks, saying that most failed to say
anything on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses also said their training in end-of-life care was
inadequate, according to a national survey published in April in
the journal Oncology Nursing Forum by Dr. Betty Ferrell, a research
scientist at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif.
One nurse wrote that end of life was not even mentioned during her
training. Another said that the oncologists she worked with were
reluctant to mention a terminal prognosis to patients, and simply
went on giving chemotherapy until the patients died.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the Feb. 3 issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine reported that children dying of cancer suffered needlessly
from pain, nausea and other symptoms that could have been treated
better. Another article, in the Jan. 20 issue, said patients with
advanced Alzheimer's disease were too often given feeding tubes
that did not help them medically, but only increased their
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel, the vice president of ethics at the AMA, said the lack
of expertise, particularly in palliative care, was one of the
factors driving patients to seek doctor-assisted suicide. If pain
and other distressing symptoms were treated properly, she argues,
fewer patients would become desperate to end their lives
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But patients as well as doctors need education. Lynn said that
rather than depending solely on pieces of paper to make their
wishes known, patients had to talk with their families and doctors
about their illnesses, about what was likely to happen to them with
or without various treatments and about their hopes and fears
regarding death and aggressive procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting into a power struggle over who makes the
decisions, Tonelli, the pulmonary specialist, said, doctors,
patients and families should make them together; an advance
directive may serve as a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that advance directives are of significant value for
patients or the health care system as a whole is fairly passe,''
Tonelli said. Instead, he said, people should try to improve
patient-physician communication before the end of life and during
the final phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those efforts are much more likely to be successful in the
long run,'' Tonelli said, ``but they are less appealing to many
people, because they're not straightforward or simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said the approach Tonelli described, which the medical
profession calls ``advance-care planning,'' was more common now
than it was five years ago. ``But probably no more than 10 to 15
percent of the people who should be doing it are doing it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care is an obstacle: given 10 or 15 minutes for a
typical office appointment, doctors and patients are more likely to
spend the time on immediate medical problems than on worrying about
the future. Often, the discussions do not begin until a crisis
develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``These will remain difficult decisions,'' Tonelli said. ``Each
individual situation is different. When it's done right, you
struggle with each of them, and I don't see any short cut.''

4 HURT AS ISRAELIS FIRE AT TAUNTING CIVILIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Israeli soldiers Sunday fired into a crowd of
Lebanese and Palestinian civilians who were throwing stones and
trying to push through a fence separating what was until last week
the Israeli-controlled buffer zone between the two countries. Four
people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Also in southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah fighter killed a Christian
man, and two Lebanese children were killed and seven people wounded
when their car drove over a land mine on a road.
</P>
<P>
   The events underlined the potentially deadly confusion and
tension that still reign in much of southern Lebanon, four days
after Israel abruptly withdrew its forces from the nine-mile-wide
area it occupied for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although a parade of Lebanese government officials have visited
the area and claimed victory over Israel, the Lebanese army has
stayed away, leaving to the Hezbollah militia the work of policing
towns and villages and rounding up abandoned Israeli weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which waged a long war against Israel and its
Lebanese allies in the south, has deployed hundreds of its fighters
in the area to prevent looting, police villages and pursue members
of the South Lebanon army who worked for Israel during the
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim guerrillas have sought in recent days to present
themselves as mere custodians of southern Lebanon, acting as a
temporary force of law and order until the government takes over.
But its ability to act as a civil guard, rather than a militia, has
been sorely tested, as the increasingly unruly scenes at the border
fences between Lebanon and Israel have shown.
</P>
<P>
   At Kafr Kila, where the shooting by Israeli soldiers occurred,
barely 15 yards separate Israeli guards and the throngs of Lebanese
who came to gawk and shout insults at them over the weekend. A
Hezbollah official did not make an appearance until late in the
day, hours after Israeli soldiers had lobbed smoke bombs over the
fence and fired into the air over the heads of the Lebanese. Once
there, he urged the demonstrators to stop throwing stones and
trying to push across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of the militia, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
has said it is to be expected that, after so many years of
occupation and conflict, Lebanese would express anger and hostility
toward the first Israelis many of them have seen.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasrallah also has sought to reassure the Christians who
live in the former security zone, including those who may have had
family members in the South Lebanon army or who may have found work
in Israel during the isolated years of occupation, that Hezbollah
intends to protect all Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   In the south Lebanese village of Qlaia, two of Nasrallah's
deputies, Sheik Naim Qassem and Muhammad Raed, made a point of
publicly reassuring the Maronite Christian residents after their
priest canceled Sunday Mass at his St. George Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who attacks the residents of Qlaia attacks Hezbollah, and
he who violates the people of the south violates the resistance,''
Raed told villagers outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, after meeting with the two Hezbollah representatives
in private, later celebrated Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what led to the killing of a Christian man in
the village of Rmeiche earlier in the day. Some villagers told
reporters that the killer was a Hezbollah fighter who wanted
revenge on the dead man's family, which included members of the
South Lebanon army. Others said the killer had opened fire on a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese police, who have a few hundred men in the south,
called the shooting an ``individual incident,'' and Hezbollah
denied that it had any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 members of the South Lebanon army and their
families fled to Israel during the withdrawal, although the United
Nations brought several busloads of them back to Lebanon Sunday so
they could surrender to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 1,500 former militia fighters had given
themselves up to Hezbollah, which has turned them over to the
Lebanese army for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese now also face the problem of clearing Israeli mines
in the former buffer strip. The U.N. officials who are working
along the border to certify Israel's withdrawal have said mines
threaten their safety and have called on Israel to turn over maps
of the mined areas.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Increasingly, as the major classical record labels
undergo seismic reorganizations, followers of new music are finding
that independent boutique labels like CRI, New World Records and
Bridge are becoming the only companies willing to record new works.
At Sony Classical, for example, film scores, crossover projects and
topical works dominate the contemporary music releases. New music
was never a priority at BMG, and it is unlikely to fare well as the
company reconsiders its classical music lines this spring. And at
Universal Classics, the Argo label, which had recorded American
composers like Aaron Kernis and Michael Daugherty, was scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Nonesuch has been notably successful with
contemporary works, which make up the majority of its releases.
Nonesuch is owned by Time Warner, which is buying EMI. If it leaves
EMI a free hand, perhaps that label's recent flirtations with new
music, by way of the young English composer Thomas Ades and others,
may continue.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last decade it is CRI, especially, that has been a
vital home for both traditionalists and listeners with eclectic
tastes, thanks to the efforts of Joseph R. Dalton, the label's
37-year-old executive director. During his decade at the venerable
label, Dalton has restored CRI to its original mission: partly to
be an alternative to the big commercial labels, which have always
kept new works at arm's length, and partly to document the major
currents and obscure tributaries of the developing American style.
</P>
<P>
   For about three decades, starting in the mid-1950s, CRI (which
stands for Composers' Recordings Inc.) was the first place
collectors turned for new works, but when Dalton arrived in 1990,
it had gained a reputation as a dusty repository of austere
academic music. By seeking out musicians that his predecessors had
ignored _ including post-Minimalists, young composers and
performers with pop music sensibilities, and Asian and Latin
American composers whose music bears the accents of their own
cultures _ Dalton has revitalized the label.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Dalton surprised much of the new-music world by
abruptly announcing his resignation. He left CRI on Friday and says
he plans to take a few months off before deciding what to do next.
CRI has moved quickly to find a successor _ some 30 candidates are
under consideration _ but its first choice has reportedly turned
down the job. There is talk of bringing the label under the
umbrella of the American Music Center, but the discussions are said
to be preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised to hear that he was leaving,'' said Kernis,
whose first recording was released on CRI in 1992. ``I'm sorry for
us, sorry for the business of new music. He's given a lot of
composers and performers wonderful opportunities. It's hard to
imagine the label finding someone who will have the same kind of
openness and flexibility and who is interested in so many styles
and in exploring so many ways of seeing new music.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the extent to which CRI has been revived under Dalton's
leadership, the question of whether he was pushed is barely worth
asking. People close to him say the frustrations of working for a
nonprofit arts organization _ principally, working long hours at
comparatively low wages with a skeleton support staff _ caught up
with him. (Nonprofit tax status allows an organization to seek
subsidies and grants. Most performing arts groups are nonprofit
because the income from ticket sales does not cover costs. CRI, New
World Records and several other small, specialist labels have
nonprofit status.)
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, after a brief demurral, agreed with this analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised at the range of emotions I'm having,'' he told a
visitor to the company's offices on Spring Street in SoHo during
his final days at the label. ``People say, `How can you leave CRI?
You  &UR; are  &LR; CRI' Well, to be CRI for 10 years is a lot. It's hard. It
needed that _ someone to be a man about town, identified with the
label as I have been, to help it break out of its sleepy, dusty
academic image. But it wears on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest frustration is one that is increasingly
common in the nonprofit world: the sense that while the artists
reap the benefits that nonprofit organizations bring them, those
who keep the machinery running get few rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really needs to be something prior to a lifetime
achievement award for the people who serve the arts as faithfully
as the artists,'' Dalton said. ``It's almost a vocation, getting
into this work, but there is very little nourishment. I got pats on
the head from my board. But I didn't sign on to be a starving
artist. I have an MBA. Caring for administrators, not just training
them, is something I don't think is addressed enough, and it's
crucial for the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Dalton arrived at CRI in 1990, the label had a
distinguished history and a catalog of about 400 discs. It was
started in 1954 by the composers Otto Luening and Douglas Moore,
and Oliver Daniel, an arts executive, who included in the company's
charter the guarantee that CRI's recordings would not go out of
print so long as the company existed. Its early projects included
works by experimenters like Henry Cowell, Lou Harrison, Harry
Partch and John Cage as well as a full complement of Serialists,
neo-Romantics and composers of other mainstream and academic
persuasions. But by 1990, much of the adventure had left the label,
and it had come to be regarded as crusty and out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, then 26, was exactly what the company needed. With a
music degree from Catholic University in Washington and an MBA from
Southern Methodist University in Texas, he had worked for a season
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and for three years at Sony
Classical.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my first interview, I told them I came to New York because
I was attracted to the works of Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass and
Steve Reich, who were working here,'' Dalton said. ``And I saw
their backs tighten, but when I met with some of the businessmen on
the label's board, I said, `These people are on major labels, and
they sell.' It was clear to me pretty quickly why things weren't
happening at CRI.''
</P>
<P>
   An early priority was to mend fences with composers who felt
poorly treated by CRI. Another was to address CRI's reputation as a
vanity label. Originally composers had to subsidize their
recordings, usually with grants and awards, although it was never
as if anyone with the cash could buy a place in the catalog: From
the start, an adjudication committee screened submissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guidelines on how to submit work,'' Dalton said, ``and
when I arrived, the guidelines said that if you don't have complete
funding, don't send us your music. I stopped sending that out
immediately; I thought it was appalling. My view was that an arts
organization decides what it wants to do and then finds the money
to do it. And that's how we operate now.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, CRI's projects are still subsidized by grants,
sometimes arranged by the composers, but often arranged by CRI once
a recording has been approved by its editorial committee. The
adjudication process, too, has changed during Dalton's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that Jody and I have tried to do is keep the
committee rotating and anonymous,'' said the composer Chester
Biscardi, referring to Dalton by his nickname. Biscardi is a member
of the company's board and the chairman of its editorial committee.
``There are nine of us, and in terms of race, gender and style, it
is very diverse in its representation so that we can get a balanced
response. We get the tapes and scores, we listen to them, we have
informal discussions and we come to a consensus about what's good
for the label and whether it's possible financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairly quickly, Dalton was able to open CRI's gates to composers
who had previously been excluded. Beginning with a handful of
recordings inspired by the Bang on a Can Festival, he established
the Emergency Music series as a home for downtown composers who
bring together popular music influences, Minimalism and traditional
techniques in their work. Another series, Exchange: Music at the
Crossroads, has focused mostly on immigrant composers whose works
embrace their cultural roots. He reissued the label's older
recordings in an American Masters series that reminded collectors
that the catalog was full of neglected gems and important scores.
And a jazz series that he planned will have its first release this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The yardstick for success at CRI is modest. A collection of
works by gay composers was a runaway hit with sales of 7,000, a
minuscule figure by pop standards. The company's all-time best
seller, a decades-old collection of works by Harry Partch, has sold
about 25,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing one runs into at nonprofits,'' Dalton said, ``is
that there is always a board member saying, `Why are we nonprofit
anyway?' And you get board members who think they are going to come
in and give you `business sense.' I let them argue that among
themselves because, frankly, it's abusive to hear board members
telling you that `CRI is a business and has to be run like a
business' when you're spending 10 hours a day doing paperwork for
grants. They don't get it. It's not that being called nonprofit
makes us struggling and poor. It's that we're dedicated to
something that will not survive commercially.''
</P>
<P>
   CRI has, at any rate, upheld its pledge to keep its discs in
print, no matter how slowly they sell. The company has a warehouse
of LP's that collectors can still order through its Web site
(www.composersrecordings.com) and if someone wants an LP that has
not made the transition to CD and is out of stock, the company will
make a cassette dub and photocopy the liner notes. In recent
months, Dalton has been negotiating with Emusic, a company that
will allow collectors to either download works from the Internet or
order custom compilations of pieces from the CRI catalogue. He
expects that service to be available within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What CRI does is of the utmost importance,'' said Fran
Richard, who runs the concert music department at Ascap, the
performing rights organization. ``Every composer needs recordings.
Without them, they're dead in the water, because not everyone
attends concerts, and even for those who do, it takes time to get
to know the piece. And to me, Jody was a real hero of this
business. He was a discerning impresario, with courage and vision,
and the choices he made were significant predictions of the
important works of the end of the 20th century. He produced a
legacy that has added immensely to the richness of the field, and
he's going to be missed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ With the historic drop in violent crime beginning to
take hold in even the most blighted urban areas, cities across the
country are being transformed as neighborhoods that had become
frightening wastelands are showing glimmers of renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   From Boston to New Orleans and Los Angeles to Miami,
neighborhoods where drug gangs controlled the streets, commandeered
empty houses and terrorized residents are slowly beginning to seem
safer and more livable, according to interviews with people in nine
cities that have seen sharp drops in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   New homes are being built, stores are opening, subway and bus
lines are adding service and banks and shopping strips are breaking
ground. There is less graffiti, and there are fewer abandoned cars
and vacant lots. And, for the first time in years, people are
sitting on their front porches and parents feel safe letting their
children walk to school.
</P>
<P>
   In the U Street neighborhood of Washington, the subway system is
operating later at night and an organic grocery store and a private
jazz club with a $2,500 annual membership fee are to open soon. In
the Oakwood section of Los Angeles, forbidding 8--foot fences are
being replaced with lower picket fences and other inviting designs.
And in Miami's Overtown and Liberty City neighborhoods, textile
plants, production studios and a food processing plant are opening.
</P>
<P>
   Especially striking is that people are beginning to move to
these neighborhoods from more stable urban areas and the suburbs,
the interviews suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that cities are safer,'' said Robert Sampson,
a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. ``And there
is a return to the city among not just empty nesters, but people
with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these neighborhoods are still struggling with crime and
poverty. But the improvements have taken on such momentum that they
do not appear to be slowed by increases in some violent crimes in
several cities last year, including Boston, Houston, New York, San
Antonio and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, surveys conducted by a Northwestern University
political scientist, Wesley G. Skogan, have found that in the
sections of the city where crime has declined sharply, primarily
African-American neighborhoods on the South and West sides, there
have been ``extremely large increases in the quality of life,''
Skogan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said residents in those neighborhoods had reported a
lessening of drug and gang activity, declines in public drinking,
loitering and disorder in the schools and streets that were cleaner
and had fewer abandoned buildings and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Changes like that were clear last week in one neighborhood on
the West Side of Chicago. In a city where neighborhoods are a
source of strong local pride, this section about five miles west of
the Loop did not even have a name until recently and had virtually
fallen off the map, longtime residents say. Now they say the area
has revived enough to be considered part of the Tri-Taylor
neighborhood, which is near the University of Illinois
</P>
<P>
   ``We were considered nowhere really,'' said Nancy Echevarria,
46, who has lived on Taylor Street almost all her life. ``The
neighborhood was taboo. It was like the OK Corral here. Gangs of 30
guys would position themselves right on the street selling drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Echevarria and her husband, Fidel, who are raising two children,
ages 7 and 9, and a granddaughter, age 3, used to call the police
frequently, and in retaliation, she said gang members put a bullet
through her front door a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, the rampant crime in the police
district that includes the neighborhood dropped more than in any
other section of Chicago, 36 percent from 1992 to 1998, police
figures show. Echevarria says she sees far fewer drug dealers, and
there is only one vacant house left on her block. On Taylor Street,
$350,000 condominiums are being built, and the value of three
houses owned by Echevarria has skyrocketed, to more than $150,000
each from about $15,000 some 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her children skate and bicycle on the streets, which have new
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day,'' she said, ``it was so nice to come out in the
morning and just sit and hear the birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say such progress results from a number of social and
economic factors that have helped bring about the decrease in crime
and are benefiting from it. The booming economy has created so much
urban development that builders and businesses are venturing
farther away from well-established neighborhoods into ones that
were once on the edge of livability.
</P>
<P>
   Cities are using budget surpluses to offer tax incentives to
businesses that open in these areas. And in some places, like
Chicago, other major changes are under way in these communities,
including changes in schools and the dismantling of huge,
crime-plagued housing projects, like Rockwell Gardens, which is not
far from the Echevarria home.
</P>
<P>
   With less crime, there have been more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Frank R. Nero, the president of the Beacon Council, a
private nonprofit economic development agency, said factories and
other businesses had been moving into neighborhoods like Overtown
and Liberty City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are starting to feel more comfortable,'' Nero said.
``The more investment you have in an area, the safer it is and the
safer it will become.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as things improve and as new policing strategies
concentrate on community outreach, residents have become more
willing to cooperate with the police, and that cooperation has
helped reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Flack, who has lived in the Skyline Park neighborhood of
San Antonio for 15 years, said he saw the police on patrol much
more often and had developed more of a relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know them and they know me,'' Flack said as he sat on his
porch the other day. ``If they've got a problem, they let me know,
and if I've got a problem, I know just who to call.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a shooting near his house several days ago, he said.
``The police came by and told me that a kid had shot at another
bunch of kids, and I said, `Oh, that would be so-and-so who lives
in that green house over there,''' he said. ``They had that deal
wrapped up in a couple of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In city after city, the changes are seeping into the fabric of
neighborhood life.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, in the Uphams Corner section of the Dorchester
neighborhood, an area known for crimes like the 1992 slaying of a
man who was eating dinner with his wife at the Tasty Chicken
restaurant, drug houses have been shut down and businesses have
opened, including a children's clothing shop and a housewares
store. Youth programs have been created, a park that used to be
littered with used condoms and drug needles is being renovated and
the community has begun sponsoring a street festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see fewer bars on windows,'' said Jan Mattimoe, a middle
school teacher who helps organize a community improvement project.
``This spring I've seen more flowers in this area than I've ever
seen. There is real desire to get out there and make things look
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington's U Street neighborhood, Cici Mukhtar, the owner
of a cafe, said she was glad to have a fancy organic supermarket
and an exclusive jazz club moving in. That is all part of what has
made the neighborhood more attractive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, just amazing what's happening here,'' Mukhtar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Myra Power, 28, who lived in the neighborhood from 1991 until
moving to New York in 1997, was back last week, looking for work
and a place to live. She said she noticed a huge change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I lived here, I wouldn't leave home without my Mace,''
Power said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, children stay out late at night playing basketball and
waiting in line to use the swings at the playground. Construction
crews are busy renovating old buildings and building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends, Powers said, now leave belongings out on their
porches. ``It used to be that the only thing they'd leave out was
barbed wire,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of worrying about break-ins, she said, they fret
over how to plant the most attractive garden.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, the crack houses and blighted buildings that
choked the city's Irish Channel neighborhood are beginning to give
way to avant-garde galleries, clothing shops and even a designer
jewelry shop on Lower Magazine Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a grocery next door that would sell one beer
and one cigarette, and there was a pay phone there, so there was a
lot of loitering,'' said Patty Spinale, who opened her lingerie
shop, House of Lounge, on Lower Magazine Street two years ago.
``The neighborhood has really significantly cleaned up in the last
two years in terms of people investing in it. More tourists are
comfortable with venturing into the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Houston, Capt. Mark L. Curran, commander of the Eastside
Division for the Police Department, said he heard evidence of
improvement in the complaints he fielded at civic club meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the early '90s, it was rape and burglaries,'' Curran
said. ``Now it's, `I want you to take care of my neighbor's barking
dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as their neighborhoods have become more attractive, some
residents have found themselves pushed out, along with the
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The end of gang warfare that had terrorized the Oakwood section
of Los Angeles, just blocks from Venice Beach, meant safer streets
in an area that had been the city's only black neighborhood near
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It has also meant that some people who had lived there for more
than 30 years lost their leases as landlords sold property to
affluent newcomers or raised rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up and down the street you see whites walking these days,''
said Melvyn Hayward Sr., a longtime neighborhood organizer and
director of the Vera Davis Community Center. ``In 20 years, you
would never see that. They wouldn't come down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are still quite new in most of these neighborhoods,
and some residents are skeptical that the improvements will endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still crime,'' said Cynthia Harris, a case worker for
a health center, who lives in Uphams Corner in Boston. ``My son
finds needles in the driveway where he plays. And if I had an
opportunity to move, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Taylor Street neighborhood of Chicago, one developer,
Senan Nugent, hires gang members to watch his properties so that
other gang members will not steal plumbing pipes and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nugent and others said they would not be there if they
were not convinced that it was a safe, promising place to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dave Williams bought a new three-unit condominium on Taylor
Street for $367,000 this year, and he is renting it and three other
buildings to students at the University of Illinois and employees
at Rush Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The renters are people who would not dare live here in the past,
Williams said. Many of the students come from the suburbs and drive
sport utility vehicles, but they have no trouble getting their
parents to co-sign their leases.
</P>
<P>
   And although he put up high wrought iron fences with electronic
security systems at the condominium, he said that only two of his
12 tenants bothered to turn on their systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were actually quite skeptical and nervous when we first
invested,'' said Williams, a emergency room physician who lives
downtown. ``But things have gotten steadily better. It's really one
of Chicago's new frontiers now.''

BEER COMMERICAL MAKES RANT A NATIONAL PASTIME FOR JOE CANADIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Over the din of a multiscreen sports bar,
Dallas Hyde recalled the magical moment at a Calgary Flames hockey
game, when ``he'' stood up in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the crowd went nuts,'' Hyde, a 24-year-old oil
change supervisor, recalled of the moment when Jeff Douglas stepped
before a microphone to deliver ``The Rant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a lumberjack or a fur trader, I don't live in an
igloo, eat blubber or own a dogsled,'' the Nova Scotia actor said,
repeating lines from a Molson Canadian beer commercial that has
become a nationalist mantra for 30 million Canadians this spring.
Addressing an invisible American audience, ``Joe Canadian''
patiently continued his lesson: ``I have a prime minister, not a
president. I speak English and French, not American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack,'' he said,
uttering patriotic lines that are recited in bars and high school
hallways from Vancouver to Halifax. ``I believe in peacekeeping,
not policing; diversity, not assimilation.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, the television version is flashing images of maple
leaves and beavers as Joe Canadian reaches his climax, bellowing:
``Canada is the second-largest land mass, the first nation of
hockey, and the best part of North America. My name is Joe and I am
Canadian.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian hockey teams struck out in the Stanley Cup for a
record-breaking seventh year in a row, the Canadian dollar is stuck
at two-thirds the American dollar, a southern brain drain is
cherry-picking this year's crop of college graduates, but Canadians
have found a powerful spine stiffening elixir: a nationalistic beer
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of being measured against the eternal American yardstick,
Canadians are doing something uncharacteristically Canadian:
beating their chests with patriotism. The Rant, as the 60-second
commercial is known, has won cheers in movie theaters, endless
debate on talk radio, fist-pumping ovations by fans at National
Hockey League games, and 14,000 e-mails to a special website
created by Molson, www.iam.ca.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taken aback by how much it struck a chord with
everybody,'' said Paul Thomson, a Molson spokesman who quickly put
the Joe Canadian actor on a national tour of hockey rinks. ``There
was a lot of Canadian pride that was below the surface, exploding
the myth that young adult Canadians are not proud of their
country.''
</P>
<P>
   At Schanks Athletic Club, the sports bar here, Kim Anderson said
of the ad, ``It's kind of neat for him to yell it out,'' though
adding, ``After all, everything here is American.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a nation with the highest level of foreign economic
ownership in the developed world _ 23 percent of companies _ the
beer-drinking patrons of Schanks were sitting in the electronic
wash of ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   From British Columbia, long a liberal bastion, Lisa McCaskill, a
sales manager, said, ``I saw it in a movie theater in Vancouver,
and people were cheering _ real patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Hunt, a 35-year-old Toronto advertising executive, wrote
the advertisement after returning to Canada last fall from a
three-year stint in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent people out on the street to see how young people felt
about being Canadian,'' said Hunt, a creative director for Bensimon
Byrne D'Arcy. ``They started pretty quiet, but once they got going,
it was a dormant volcano ready to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this flag-waving surge has collided with two
forces that historically have deflated chest-pumping patriotism
here: English Canada's cutting humor and the nation's unity-defying
regionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack,'' Mark
Steyn, a National Post newspaper columnist, wrote recently.
``That's because, even though I am a beer-guzzling hockey fan, I
took sewing classes in Canada's non-gender-stereotyping school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that many Canadians feel squeamish about reciting the
national oath of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II. On one hand,
they gripe, pledging allegiance seems so American. On the other
hand, swearing allegiance to the Queen seems so British. Steyn
concluded: ``If you drink enough Molson, eventually even Canada
makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where east-west links are tenuous, comedians
quickly deconstructed The Rant into a series of regional
mini-rants.
</P>
<P>
   From this western province, an ``I am Albertan'' parody hails
John Deere for making ``the best hats,'' and then rants: ``I speak
flawless English and gripe to the store manager about French labels
on cereal boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   From Quebec, an English-language radio station aired a morning
drive-time satire that contradicted any notion of unity there. ``I
believe in language police, not equal rights,'' the announcer says
in a heavy French accent. ``I believe Club Supersex is an
appropriate place for my wife and I to celebrate our
anniversaire.''
</P>
<P>
   From Newfoundland, a regional rant concludes: ``Newfoundland is
the second island province, the first nation of drinking, and the
best party in North America! My name is Baz, and I am Newfie!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the inability of some Canadians to take patriotism
seriously, The Rant is believed to have prompted the government of
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, to announce that,
starting next September, each student will start the day by
standing at attention, singing the national anthem, ``O Canada,''
and pledging allegiance to the queen.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Alberta, governing Conservative Party lawmakers are
considering legislation that would require schoolchildren to sing
``O Canada'' at least weekly. In Quebec, which has been run by the
separatist Parti Quebecois since 1994, Canadian symbols, such as
the national flag and anthem, are officially ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The new nationalist mood has won applause in Ottawa, the
national capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has decided nationalism sells,'' Charles Gordon, a
columnist for The Ottawa Citizen wrote approvingly in Maclean's
magazine. ``If that's true, it's good. It means that a unique
culture, in art and music and theater and writing, can survive in
this country, survive in fact of a powerful culture pouring over
our border every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Canada's heritage minister, Sheila Copps, traveled to
Boston, where she showed the commercial to an International Press
Institute panel titled: ``American Culture _ the People's Choice or
a Form of Imperialism?''
</P>
<P>
   But unless a giddy new nationalism can really bubble out of a
beer commercial, Toronto's Globe and Mail offered this sobering cup
of expresso. A few years ago, the Charles R. Bronfman Foundation, a
private cultural group, tried to spoonfeed history to the Canadian
masses with a series titled Heritage Minutes. ``All they sparked,''
the newspaper editorialist recalled, ``was a series of parodies on
the Comedy Network called Sacrilege Moments, financed by _ wait for
it _ Molson.''

SHOWING AGE AND WEAR, LIBERTY MAY BE WATCHING THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes last word in 1st graf)  
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Liberty players say they have nothing to prove
this season. They sound sincere but not entirely convinced.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty will begin the fourth season of the Women's National
Basketball Association as the defending Eastern Conference
champions. Twice in the past three years, the Liberty has been one
game short of a championship. Four of the team's veterans were
picked to play in the league's inaugural All-Star Game last season.
And the Liberty, ridiculed for lacking pizazz and stars, is
featured in the league's 2000 promotional advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberty is not picked to finish first or second in the
East and is doubtful to make the playoffs. The favorites in the
East are the Washington Mystics, led by Chamique Holdsclaw, last
season's rookie of the year, Nikki McCray, Vicky Bullett and Tausha
Mills, this season's rookie sensation. The Charlotte Sting and
Cleveland Rockers have been deemed contenders for the second berth
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty _ with the league's oldest starting lineup and
uncertainty at the center position _ is given an outside shot at
finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were picked fourth with Rebecca Lobo,'' Liberty
Coach Richie Adubato said. ``Any time you make a team an underdog,
that is a tremendous motivational tool for a coach to reach players
and get them to play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobo _ who missed all but the first 42 seconds of last season
with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee _ tore the
same ligament while working out in December and will be out of the
lineup until July. Kym Hampton, the team's 37-year-old all-star
center, felt so good after arthroscopic surgery on her knee that
she came out of retirement. But the knee began swelling during
training camp and Hampton retired again Friday, disappointed that
she could not play another season.
</P>
<P>
   Adubato had hoped to rely on Tamika Whitmore, the 6-foot-2-inch
power forward who rose above expectations during her 1999 rookie
season. But Whitmore arrived in camp 42 pounds overweight and has
only shed 18 pounds in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably won't be able to help us win games until after
another two or three weeks,'' Adubato said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Whitmore is able to contribute, Adubato will go with Shea
Mahoney, the 6-2 rookie forward from Western Kentucky, as his sixth
player. The coach is also looking into the possibility of the
center position ``being done by committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The three vying for the job are Olga Firsova, the 6-6 Kansas
State center who was the team's No. 1 draft pick, the 6-5
Alessandro Santo de Oliveira of Brazil and Venus Lacy, the spirited
6-3 veteran who saw limited action last season but who has
impressed Adubato with her aggressive play in camp. Sunday, the
Liberty acquired forward Tari Phillips from the Portland Fire for
guard Carolyn Young, who was not expected to play until July
because of a knee injury. Phillips, who averaged 4.1 points and 2.1
rebounds a game for the Orlando Miracle last season, was picked by
Portland in the 2000 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   If the Liberty is to repeat as division winners, it will do so
behind veterans like the all-star guard Teresa Weatherspoon, the
team's emotional leader on and off the court, and the all-star
forward Vicky Johnson, who led the Liberty last season in minutes
per game (33) and points (13.3). Sue Wicks, coming off her best
year as a pro, and the clutch-shooting Crystal Robinson, who led
the league in 3-pointers with 76, will also be expected to step
into big roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told we're too old, that we needed an overhaul,''
said Weatherspoon, 35; Wicks is 34 and Johnson is 28. ``We take
that as a challenge, a motivating factor for us to walk out on the
floor and show people that we come to work every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an 0-3 preseason, the Liberty will be tested early.
The team opens the season Monday against the defending champion
Houston Comets in Houston. Three of the Liberty's next four games
are on the road against Phoenix, Washington and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it that way because we get to see just how tough we
really are, and just how bad we really want it,'' Weatherspoon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a good start will matter little if the Liberty fades down
the stretch. To avoid getting run down in a season that has been
condensed to accommodate the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia, Adubato will most likely look to Becky Hammon, the 5-6
guard who provides an instant spark off the bench, and Jessica
Bibby, the team's fourth-round pick from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's trademark is defense and hustle. In the end, the
key to the Liberty's success this season may well be its desire to
prove all the naysayers wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we come out every night and give it 110 percent,
people still think we can't play this game,'' Johnson said.
``During the off-season, I talked to players around the league who
said: `The Liberty. You guys aren't that good.' A lot of players in
the West said that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're the only team in the league that beat Houston three
times last year.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   David Merrick's death reminded me of an event I've always
considered a small part of American theater history.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1968, I worked for a company that supplied equipment and
personnel for a television show that visited famous people, and
Merrick was one of the subjects. The taping took place in his
office above the St. James Theater. I supervised the setup and
stayed when the interview was over to make sure things were in
order.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick eventually came out the stage door and stood waiting for
his car. ``Hello, Dolly!'' was then in its umpteenth year at the
theater, and people going to the matinee were streaming by and
talking about how wonderful they expected the show to be.
</P>
<P>
   I finally went over to Merrick and said: ``You know, all these
people are going by talking about the show and they have no idea
you're the one responsible. It reminds me of the final scene in
`42nd Street.''' He replied, coolly, ``I've never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing to take a hint, I launched into a description of the
movie, finishing with the shot of Warner Baxter sitting near the
stage door, unrecognized and ignored, while the audience passes by
raving about the show he was responsible for.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick listened and then said: ``I never see anything made
before 1950. It makes me feel old.'' I backed off _ but I never
doubted that I had placed the seed for what was to become one of
his major musicals.

   This takes some thinking: The young woman's voice, obviously

York.''

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Riding home from a downtown orchestra rehearsal on a No. 6
subway train, I watched a lithe young man who was showing off for
his girlfriend and other chums.
</P>
<P>
   He casually placed his palms on the floor, then kicked off and
stood on his hands _ legs straight up and motionless _ for about a
minute, as the train waited in the station. He then swiveled his
still upside-down body so that he was facing in the direction the
train would move. When it did accelerate, he started walking on his
hands in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   For an encore, he grasped two vertical poles, kicked off until
his shoes were flat against the ceiling of the car and maintained
that position for about 30 seconds. He looked like a statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mankind was not meant to do such things,'' I said as the
performance ended. I've never seen better, even in a circus.

<P>
   The human hand is a wonderful thing,
</P>
<P>
   With or without a wedding ring.
</P>
<P>
   The human hand can stroke a cat,
</P>
<P>
   The human hand knows where it's at.
</P>
<P>
   The human hand can scratch a chin,
</P>
<P>
   The human hand is really in.
</P>
<P>
   The human hand can scratch a neck,
</P>
<P>
   We'll find a rhyme, we will, by heck.
</P>
<P>
   The human hand can scratch a rump,
</P>
<P>
   And leave the fur in a funny lump.
</P>
<P>
   The human hand can break a fast,
</P>
<P>
   Here comes supper at long, long last.
</P>
<P>
   The human hand can brush us well,
</P>
<P>
   The joy of that is hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The human hand can make our beds,
</P>
<P>
   When we have to rest our sleepy heads.
</P>
<P>
   And now before we decide to part,
</P>
<P>
   May we say ``thank you'' to the human heart?

   The surprised recipient of the message usually looks up and,
with a wide grin, acknowledges membership in our high-tech club. We
leave the train feeling cheerfully connected.

   I only hope that someone doesn't figure out a way to beam us
advertising!

   Jean Handley and two friends had just had a lovely day _ an
afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera and a good dinner with wine and
impeccable service. Leaving the restaurant on West 54th Street
where they had dined, they looked up and saw a full moon rising
above the city.
</P>
<P>
   The magic wasn't yet over. Walking past the University Club,
they stopped to admire a magnificent urn of white tulips being
loaded into a van. The driver noticed them, paused in his work,
reached into the van and handed each of the women a nosegay of
daffodils. ``If we doubted it for a moment, we knew then that we
were in Manhattan and spring was in the air,'' Handley said.

U.N. BETTER ORGANIZED, CONGRESSIONAL REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a surprisingly positive report on changes at
the United Nations, the U.S. General Accounting Office has told
Congress the administration of Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
made considerable strides in improving management of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, where criticisms of the United Nations have been
frequent. It lays out for Congress the complexities of the U.N.
structure and, against that background, differentiates between
reform goals that a secretary-general and the U. N. Secretariat can
meet alone, and those that depend on the decisions of 188 member
nations.
</P>
<P>
   U. N. officials said they have been trying to make this case to
impatient members of Congress for years, and some demands for
reform from Washington have been characterized as impossible in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by an investigative arm of Congress, found that
where there are serious failures or lags in making changes _ like
designing programs and their budgets more concretely, or in
monitoring results _ the shortcomings are often related to
instructions from the General Assembly that aren't clear. The U.N.
General Assembly is a parliament of nations where international
politics often block decisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our examination of General Assembly resolutions for 1997
and 1998 that required secretariat action,'' the report states,
``we judged 20 percent in each year to be too open-ended or vague
to determine what objectives the secretary-general was expected to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes: ``According to U.N. and U.S. officials,
some resolutions are vague and open-ended because members do not
agree on what outcome is desired. A vague resolution is the
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional study includes as examples the creation of
broad assignments, like ending human rights abuses or fostering
sustainable development, without stating exactly what the Assembly
wanted the Secretariat to accomplish, or how.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. General Assembly, which often pits a majority of
developing nations against the richer industrial countries, has
also stymied the secretary-general's attempts to assign specific
time limits into U.N. programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report credits Annan's administration, which began in 1997,
with improving coordination among U.N. departments and programs, at
least at higher levels, with the creation of a cabinet-style
management team. The study also noted that the appointment of a
deputy secretary-general, for the first time in the organization's
history, has given the United Nations a chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, a Canadian, made the
establishment of an organization-wide code of conduct a priority,
the report stated. The code was approved by the General Assembly in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing peace and security issues, now at the center of
criticisms of the United Nations, the report again drew a
distinction between what the secretary-general can accomplish and
what problems lie beyond his capacity to solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the senior management group and executive committee
on peace and security have helped unify policy and integrate
planning for the U.N.'s peace operations,'' the report said,
``these reform initiatives do not address the overall capacity of
the United Nations to manage, logistically support and respond to
rapid changes in the demand for and scope of peace operations
required by member states.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office surveyors said they were told by
both U.N. officials and member nations that the organization,
constrained financially in the face of increasing demands for
services , ``does not have the capability to manage the scope and
scale of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The report praises the U.N. mission in East Timor as an example
of a mission fielded relatively quickly and efficiently because of
good planning. In other missions, in the Mideast and Central
America, however, the study found less satisfactory coordination at
lower levels, particularly between the U. N. peacekeeping and
political departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperation is not enough,'' the report said. ``Integration of
efforts on a daily basis from these departments is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``United Nations: Reform Initiatives Have
Strengthened Operations, But Overall Objectives Have Not Yet Been
Achieved,'' May 2000, is published by the U.S. General Accounting
Office and information is available on the World Wide Web at
www.gao.gov.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No poet, no artist of any art has his meaning alone,'' T.S.
Eliot declared in his celebrated essay ``Tradition and the
Individual Talent.'' It was his manifesto on how those artists who
want to shape the future must absorb the past. Each artist must
write with the history of European art in his bones, Eliot said,
citing Homer, Shakespeare and anonymous Paleolithic draftsmen, and
he must do the same with the art of his own country.
</P>
<P>
   We can dispense with those masculine pronouns, turn to the
performing arts and focus on the United States, the country of
Eliot's birth, which went unnamed in that essay. We can say that
American artists should take the stage with all the performing
traditions of North America (and any other continent they choose)
in their bones. And with the 1900s behind us, the artists of
Eliot's generation, those modernists who turned every art form on
its head, do matter as much as Homer and Shakespeare. They are our
classics now, too, and they are what keep phrases like ``the
classical tradition'' alive and on the move.
</P>
<P>
   That relatively new term postmodernism (how quickly it's
becoming deadly) has its own prescriptions for how artists should
work with the past: They should appropriate, parody, fracture and
collage it. Fine. But why should there be just one proper (read
ironic and hip) way? Seeing two dance companies in the last few
weeks reminded me that artists can still meet the past with all-out
passion as well as with critical intelligence. They can encounter
it, inhabit it, partner and be partnered by it.
</P>
<P>
   Take the fierce genius of modern dance, Martha Graham. Like
Eliot or Louis Armstrong, Graham invented a language that molded _
some would even say branded _ generations of artists. Over the
years some of her dancers left to choreograph and form their own
companies. The best known, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor, had to
throw off her technique to find their own.
</P>
<P>
   The young company Buglisi/Foreman Dance (this is its fifth
season) renews the Graham technique in all its full-bodied glory.
And not a moment too soon, since financial difficulties have just
made the Graham Company suspend operations indefinitely. Everything
is here: those potent torsos, contracting, releasing, spiraling;
legs, arms and heads alert to every surge of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not because they are in the first flush of
discovering Graham. The choreographers, Jacqulyn Buglisi and Donlin
Foreman, and their co-founders, Terese Capucilli and Christine
Dakin (magnificent dancers both), are all longtime Graham company
members. But no one here is shadowed by Graham's overwhelming
temperament, by that ruthless glory-driven _ as she used to say,
doom-eager _ embrace of suffering, struggle and self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   They have inherited her theatrical mastery of lighting, costumes
and stage space, her way of making us feel that each dance is an
encounter with destiny. It's the Buglisi/Foreman sense of destiny _
or of our many destinies _ that's new. Buglisi and Foreman are
drawn to the expressive nuances, the everyday emotions that bind
and separate us even when desire or grief is most acute. They
explore quiet (call it the action of contemplation) and the give
and take between couples or groups. I'd call them both wise
romantics.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman's suite of dances, ``Arms Around Me,'' is an elegy
filled with the mood changes that are part of dying or of watching
someone die. There are images of slow decline and debilitation (it
is dedicated to friends ``lost to AIDS and time''), and there are
also moments of yearning, valor and a kind of sweet acceptance.
There is a lovely openness throughout the piece, technically and
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   Graham created tragic or solitary heroines (Clytemnestra, Medea,
Jocasta) who tested the boundaries of the most primal emotions. The
heroines of Buglisi's luminous ``Suspended Women'' move, float
really, in a dream space where those primal emotions _
renunciation, sexuality, chastity and ecstasy _ seem in no way at
odds. Graham made a great dance about Emily Dickinson based on the
lines ``This is my letter to the world/That never wrote to me.''
Buglisi's inspiration is Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, a worldly and
beautiful young woman in 17th-century Mexico, who left her family
and court life to become a nun, a poet and a scholar. (The last a
vocation she defended in a bold letter to her disapproving bishop.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful sight, these women in long full gowns, rising,
falling, losing and finding themselves. They move to the music of
Ravel and to the musical interpolations of Roumain, who cherishes
Ravel's voluptuous rigor. It's a beautiful dance. I can't pretend
to analyze it fully, any more than one can fully analyze what a
poem leaves you with after its structure has been analyzed. That's
the point, I think. This is a dance about the soul's intimate
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Trisha Brown was one of the young experimental choreographers
inspired by Merce Cunningham rather than by Martha Graham. Starting
in the early 1960s she and her colleagues in the Judson Dance
Theater took dance back _ and forward _ to the basics of movement:
walking, skipping, climbing, isolating body parts and working (or
playing ) with them in repeated patterns. They explored the
relation of bodies to silence and to common settings or objects
like walls, chairs, lofts instead of big stages.
</P>
<P>
   Some experimenters keep doing what they know best, and some keep
on experimenting. Brown made her way into more complicated dances
and then into music. First it was contemporary music (Alvin Curran,
Laurie Anderson), then classical from the 17th to the early 20th
century (Bach, Webern and a fine, at times ravishing production of
Monteverdi's opera ``Orfeo,'' which she directed and
choreographed).
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Rapture to Leon James,'' she has drawn her own
choreographic map of 1930s African-American jazz dance. James was
one of the great dancers at Harlem's famous Savoy Ballroom, a
leader in that ecstatic yet controlled form known as swing dance.
You've seen it. The torso, with its pelvic angles and shoulder
thrusts, the witty quick feet and the mobile arms, which are
pressed into the body with fingers snapping and raised just above
the head to clap out a few beats, strong enough to push a partner
through one's legs and then flip her _ or him _ into the air.
</P>
<P>
   And here, in her most recent season, were nine of Brown's
terrific dancers, calling and responding to this form, nurtured and
urged on by the Dave Douglas Quartet. They have wavy torsos,
easygoing limbs and flexible joints. Their quiet but intense focus
makes ``Rapture'' as much meditation as celebration. But why do
meditation and celebration have to be so different? Brown is always
described as a cerebral choreographer, but her work is full of
single-minded passion. Black jazz and vernacular dancers from
Josephine Baker to the Nicholas Brothers and Lindy Hoppers, like
James, are praised for their instinct and freewheeling abandon. But
one finds just as many games, structures and complex brain-body
rhythms in their work.
</P>
<P>
   Brown understands and adores all this, which makes ``Rapture to
Leon James'' an ideal pairing of the past and the future. Leon
James and Trisha Brown remain themselves, and yet, together, they
become something marvelous and new.

RED BULLET TO SKIP BELMONT STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rubber match between Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of
the Kentucky Derby, and Red Bullet, winner of the Preakness, was
postponed Sunday when the owner of Red Bullet withdrew his colt
from consideration for the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The horse's owner, Frank Stronach, decided that the Belmont
would be too punishing for Red Bullet, three weeks after he outran
Fusaichi Pegasus in the Preakness. They will almost certainly meet
later, but it will not be in New York on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to squeeze the lemon dry,'' said Joe Orseno, who
trains Red Bullet. ``We already won the Preakness with a horse that
didn't race as a 2-year-old, and we think it's best to give him
more time between his races right now. We want to race him as a
4-year-old and, if you run a mile-and-a-half race that knocks you
out for three months, it's pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet will be prepared instead for the $1 million Haskell
Invitational at Monmouth Park in New Jersey on Aug. 6 and the $1
million Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 26. The horse has raced only
five times, with four first-place finishes and one second, but he
did not race at 2 because Orseno felt that he was too clumsy and
too slow grasping the strictures of racing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he ran second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct in April but skipped the Derby in May and came
back to win the Preakness as a fresh horse just when people were
acclaiming Fusaichi Pegasus as a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked it over,'' Orseno said, ``and I give Mr. Stronach a
lot of credit. Skipping the Derby was hard, and the Belmont is a
million-dollar race. Our goal is to win the 3-year-old championship
with him, and we fully understand that if Fusaichi Pegasus wins the
Belmont Stakes we'll be behind him in the running for the Eclipse
Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to knowing your horse. Neil Drysdale knows his
horse, and he sometimes gets a little flak for the things he does.
But we know our horse, too, and this is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, the English trainer who shields Fusaichi Pegasus from
public clamor and sometimes public view, has not committed his
horse to the Belmont. But he flew to New York from California over
the weekend and seemed satisfied with his colt, who is being
stabled at Aqueduct. But he insisted ``it's still too early to
say.'' But most racing people consider Fusaichi Pegasus a certain
starter in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes, the premier race of the year in New York,
has now lost two of its main elements of drama. For the last three
years, record crowds of 70,000 and more flocked to Belmont Park in
the hope of seeing a sweep of the Triple Crown. But Silver Charm,
Real Quiet and Charismatic all lost their crowns when they were
upset in the final yards.
</P>
<P>
   This year it seemed that Fusaichi Pegasus would sweep the Triple
Crown, especially after he raced to a powerful victory in the
Kentucky Derby. But when he lost the Preakness to Red Bullet, his
chances of sweeping the Triple Crown vanished.
</P>
<P>
   So, Belmont did the next best thing, pumping up a possible duel
between two great rivals. But now, even that intriguing prospect
has vanished.

   LOS ANGELES _ Enough about the ebay boom.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less-publicized hot spots for those seeking a
little less confusion in shopping for unique sports collectibles
for sale or by auction. Such as:
</P>
<P>
   --The Dodgers have given Art of the Game, an L.A.-based fine-art
and sports memorabilia chain, exclusive marketing rights to sell
original wooden seats from Dodger Stadium removed from the dugout

PACERS WILL TRY TO DOUSE KNICKS' FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers want to squeeze life from the New York Knicks
Monday in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals at Madison Square
Garden. If they can push a 2-1 series lead into a 3-1 advantage,
the Pacers believe the Knicks could become breathless,
introspective and numb.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how the Pacers felt after losing Game 3 at the Garden
on Saturday. A three-game lead in the best-of-7 series was there to
be swiped, the Pacers said, but they slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of beating up on them and taking the life out of them,
we gave them life,'' Pacers forward Dale Davis said. ``And, you
know, they can take a little life and make a big thing out of it.
They have a history of performing some miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers forward Austin Croshere said: ``We always seem to bounce
back when we have to. This is a game where we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird talked about how his team led Game 3 by
a point at halftime, during which he talked to his team about
taking away the Knicks' life, bounce and spirit. He said his team
could put the Knicks ``in a whole world of hurt.'' But the Knicks _
without Patrick Ewing and Marcus Camby because of injuries _
heartily inhaled and exhaled with playoff highs from Latrell
Sprewell (32 points) and Allan Houston (28 points) that helped foil
the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them life,'' said Bird, who canceled practice Sunday
but watched film and talked strategy with his team. ``And now it's
going to be a battle, a war. I've never come to Madison Square
Garden and heard a crowd as soft as they were. And I'll never see
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because Bird believes the Knicks and their fans have new
life.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both teams keep the same mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in control of this series,'' Indiana's Jalen Rose
said. ``We win two more games, and we're in the NBA finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added: ``Their heels are still against the wall. We're
still the same team that got the No. 1 seed in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird and his players must keep that as their focus.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers enter Game 4 Monday pondering three key elements: How
to keep a hot hand going, how to negate Sprewell and Houston and
how to jolt their bench.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers center Rik Smits scored 21 points in the first half of
Game 3 but only four in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense was good, but I think we had a lot of guys that
wanted to get involved in things and that's our offense,'' Smits
said about his fancy start and dull finish. ``I have no idea this
time if Patrick Ewing will play, and it really doesn't matter. We
want to concentrate on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, of course it matters. The Knicks play more half-court
basketball with Ewing, who can give Smits trouble on both ends.
Without him they are more loose on the perimeter and they run more,
allowing Sprewell and Houston to slash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get 21 points in the first half it is not a guaranteed
blueprint to get 21 in the second,'' forward Sam Perkins said of
Smits' flip-flop game. ``But you should get more touches. And when
the team starts doing things that are not working, well, you just
have to know the game, know your plan. That's what the Knicks did.
They went to things working for them _ Sprewell and Houston _ and
we didn't and couldn't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird said: ``Rik couldn't get a 40-point game because we stopped
throwing him the ball and started moving side to side. I knew we
were in trouble at the start of the second half when there were two
loose balls on the floor and we didn't get either one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Sprewell and Houston can light it up and we will
mix it up on them if they get going. It is a matter of showing up
and playing. Everybody talks about doubling those guys, but all I
visualize when we start talking about doubling them is Larry
Johnson wide open under the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers kept finding themselves in one-on-one situations with
Sprewell and Houston, and too often for the Pacers they lost the
matchups. Both players are exceptional at forcing switches and
sizing up defenders before slashing toward the basket or taking a
quick shot. Indiana appears to have decided, especially late in
Game 4, to double both players to take the ball out of their hands
in the final critical moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually play better every other day,'' Bird said. ``I
expect our team and especially our bench to come back and play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   With vigor. With the sole purpose of extinguishing the Knicks'
new life. &QL;

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY 
Let's try welcoming the unofficial start of summer by taking in a
baseball game, OK? There are more than a half-dozen choices. Any
will be acceptable. MLB: Angels at Cleveland, Channel 9, 10:05
a.m.; Oakland at New York, ESPN2, 10 a.m.; Atlanta at Chicago, TBS,
1 p.m.; Houston at Colorado, ESPN, 1 p.m.; St. Louis at Arizona,
ESPN2, 1 p.m.; Detroit at Texas, ESPN, 4 p.m.; New York at Dodgers,
Channel 5, 4:05 p.m. 
TUESDAY 
The Blazers have hung around in the Western Conference finals
longer than Andy Richter's farewell week on ``Conan.'' Time to show
these Lakers sidekicks the Staples Center exit, stage left. NBA:
Western Conference finals Game 5: Portland at Lakers, Channel 4, 6
p.m. 
WEDNESDAY 
CBS' much talked-about series ``Survivor'' debuts tonight -- 16
contestants on an island in a survival-of-the-fittest format. Kinda
like the format for the NBA playoffs, except the knicked-up Knicks
refuse to be eaten. !racepay!NBA: Eastern Conference finals, Game
5: New York at Indiana, Channel 4, 6 p.m. 
THURSDAY 
Don't get us started on whether the National Spelling Bee is a
sporting event meant to fill ESPN programming or something
Nickelodeon should be handling right after ``Ren And Stimpy.'' Are
there no more morning exercise shows to plug in instead? Do we have
to see another freckle-faced, red-haired girl spit out words such
as ``logorrhea'' (last year's winning word) as we lose our
cafeteria lunch. Just once, we'd like to hear the big-shot adult
give the word, and have the kid say, ``Hmmmm. Could you spell that
for me?'' National Spelling Bee finals, ESPN, 10 a.m. (replayed on
ESPN2 at 4:30 p.m.) 
FRIDAY 
As this crazy interleague play starts again, it's unfortunate that
Tim Belcher remains on the Angels' disabled list. Get him out there
to pitch again to Chan Ho Park, who desperately wants to defend his
Ultimate Baseball Kickboxing title. MLB: Dodgers at Angels, Channel
5, 7 p.m. (Fox Channel 11 has Saturday's game at 1 p.m. and Fox
Sports Net 2 has Sunday's game at 1 p.m.) 
SATURDAY 
After showing the first two games on cable-friendly ESPN, big
brother ABC takes over the Stanley Cup Finals in Dallas -- and
keeps it the rest of the way. Hockey has never translated into a
network event. Why start now? NHL: Stanley Cup Finals Game 3: New
Jersey at Dallas, Channel 7, 5 p.m. 
SUNDAY 
We thought we told you to get ridda these guys. NBA: Western
Conference finals Game 7: Portland at Lakers, Channel 4, TBA.

TENSIONS HIGH IN PERU AS FUJIMORI LEADS UNCONTESTED ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ In a vote long on protest but short on suspense,
President Alberto Fujimori swept to an apparent victory Sunday
against an opponent who had urged his supporters to abstain because
of vote fraud and an array of campaign irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had hoped for a third landslide victory that would
venerate his successes defeating two terrorist groups and
hyperinflation and making peace with Ecuador after decades of
border tensions. Instead, the 61-year-old leader appeared on his
way to a hollow victory leaving the country badly polarized and
facing possible economic sanctions just as it tries to emerge from
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting capped a campaign full of dirty tricks, violent
demonstrations and sweeping condemnations from Fujimori's opponent,
Alejandro Toledo, who withdrew on May 18 _ too late to pull his
name off the ballot. The Clinton administration, France, Britain,
Canada, Argentina and Costa Rica echoed Toledo's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   As voting drew to a close Sunday afternoon, demonstrations grew
more intense and downtown Lima was filled with the pungent smell of
tear gas. Government helicopters buzzed overhead as a crowd of some
8,000 demonstrators assembled.
</P>
<P>
   In Chimbote, a northern port and Toledo's hometown, armored
vehicles rolled through the streets as police broke up
anti-Fujimori demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   It was unlikely definitive vote results would be completed by
the end of Sunday, but not even the opposition was predicting
anything but a commanding Fujimori victory. The only question was
how many voters defaced their ballots or risked fines equivalent to
$35 by not voting at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States released a report last week
saying, ``the Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could
be considered free and fair,'' noting that government funding was
used in the Fujimori campaign, media access was dominated by the
president, and that there was not enough time to inspect new
computer vote tabulation software to assure a fair count.
</P>
<P>
   Before a single vote was cast, election observers from the
Organization of American States and the Carter Center, based in
Atlanta, had withdrawn in disgust after they failed to persuade the
government to postpone the vote. Toledo, the only challenger on the
ballot, did not vote and told reporters the election was as
``fraudulent as a soccer game in which the field is tilted and one
side chooses the referees and the reporters who cover the
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's bid for a third term has stirred opposition here ever
since Congress fired three judges more than two years ago for
ruling that a constitutional ban on a third presidential term
prohibited the president from running. Fujimori argued that he
could run since the constitution was written after his first term,
meaning the ban would only apply if he ran for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters appeared to be going through the motion of voting in
an election that suddenly lacked drama when Toledo pulled out 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no institution in this country that is free
anymore,'' said Enrique Fernandez, a 48-year-old folk music
promoter, before voting in the working-class neighborhood of Rimac
in order to avoid a fine or problems with the police. ``The Justice
Ministry and election authorities are totally controlled and this
is all a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a 54-year-old business professor who was educated in the
United States, insisted that Sunday's uncontested election would
hurl Peru into uncharted, turbulent political currents. Once
re-elected to a third term, he said, Fujimori ``will be a permanent
source of political instability that will have permanent economic
consequences. I can assure you he will not last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Toledo predicted that protests around the country will
gather momentum. There have already been strikes and road blockades
in the cities of Iquitos, Cuzco and Chiclayo in recent days, as
well as several violent incidents in Lima including rock and
firebomb attacks by groups of university students on the
presidential palace itself.
</P>
<P>
   The tainted Peruvian election will dominate a meeting of foreign
ministers of the countries belonging to the Organization of
American States scheduled to meet in Canada later this week. The
foreign ministers could ultimately decide on sanctions, although in
the past severe action has only been taken in cases of coup d'etats
or other overt interruptions of democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely sanctions will come from the United States,
where Congress has already passed a joint resolution calling for a
review of all political, economic and military relations with Peru.
Still, it remains doubtful Washington will cut deeply into
assistance that goes toward Peru's efforts at combating terrorism
and narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration pushed hard for Fujimori to hold a
second-round vote during a questionable slow count in the days
following the first-round of balloting on April 9. But in recent
weeks Washington has softened its criticism of Peru and allowed the
Organization of American States, a usually cautious regional
organization, to take the lead in pushing for democratic reform
here.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, President Clinton had strong words for Peru on
Friday, the day after election authorities had already decided to
go ahead with vote. ``Free, fair and open elections are the
foundation of a democratic society,'' he said. ``Without them, our
relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is counting on the United States to go easy on him,
rather than jeopardize the cooperation of the two countries in
economic, anti-terrorism and especially anti-drug programs that
have halved this country's coca plant production in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be terrible if our anti-narcotics collaboration was
upset and we will continue to welcome U.S. investment,'' Fujimori
said. ``These are elements in our relations that will supersede
whatever tensions arise from the election.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori used an assortment of sweet carrots and rather sharp
sticks on his way to a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In a wave of populism, he raised the minimum wage and handed out
land titles to 150,000 peasants during the campaign. But Fujimori
was also besieged by criticism from international election
observers for a wide array of campaign irregularities. Poor mothers
dependent on government milk and food handouts were pressured to
attend Fujimori rallies, for example, and intelligence agents
followed and harassed leaders of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Many tabloid newspapers that have connections to Fujimori's
intelligence service and all television networks save for one cable
television station either did not cover the Toledo campaign or
tilted their coverage toward salacious and unproved allegations of
financial fraud, sexual innuendo and claims that he had an
illegitimate daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, a journalist who said he had videotapes showing
Fujimori's intelligence chief meeting with election officials was
assaulted by three unidentified men. From a hospital bed, he said
the assailants cut his wrist to the bone with a saw as they
demanded he disclose his sources inside the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours following the April 9 vote, cries of fraud arose
when ballots and tally sheets disappeared for several hours.
Election authorities only announced that Fujimori did not receive
the required majority to avert a second round after three days of
heavy international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo ran a strong race in the April first round, promising to
give the poor jobs and to disentangle the courts and congress from
the tight grip of presidential control.
</P>
<P>
   But he appeared to fumble badly when he suddenly sought to drop
out of the race 10 days ago, claiming that he was not willing to
lead his supporters into a fraudulent vote unless the election date
was postponed several weeks to give international observers an
opportunity to audit computer software designed to count ballots.
</P>
<P>
   He slid in a variety of opinion polls, as voters either
expressed disappointment in his apparent surrender or dismay that
he was willing to incite unrest and damage the image of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by Datum Internacional between May 19 and 22,
which only the week before had shown a virtual tie between the two
candidates, showed that 55 percent of voters disapproved of
Toledo's decision to drop out of the race. The poll also showed
Fujimori leading Toledo by a 54-46 percent margin, suggesting that
Fujimori could win a clean, free election anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's argument that he was a victim of fraud was also hurt by
public criticism levied at him by the head of the observation team
from the Organization American States, who said Toledo's
oscillating position on conditions for competing in the runoff made
it more difficult to negotiate a delay in the election date.

FIRST TWO WOMEN STARTING INDY 500 HAVE AN ENTANGLED MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The historic moment was brief Sunday, only 74
laps long until the first two women to start the Indianapolis 500
left the race under their own power, their cars varying degrees of
mangled, their hopes crushed.
</P>
<P>
   They were an unlikely twosome _ 53-year-old Lyn St. James, the
oldest in the field of 33, making her seventh start, from the last
row, and the 19-year-old rookie Sarah Fisher, who had qualified
19th, in the seventh row.
</P>
<P>
   All week long, Fisher had downplayed the milestone, and tried to
separate herself from St. James, who had her beginning racing stock
cars, was not running in the Indy Racing League and did not have
the same solid open-wheel background as Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher could not separate herself from St. James Sunday
afternoon going into Turn 1, the two entangling and subsequently
crashing into the wall. ``Of course I'm very disappointed,'' Fisher
said, then added about the two women unintentionally taking each
other out of the race: ``It's not ironic. We're just two race-car
drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James, who was lapped in the 11th lap by the eventual
winner, Juan Montoya, was running two laps behind Fisher, driving
defensively with her mirrors because she had trouble handling her
car.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, in 23rd place overall, was approaching Turn 1, coming up
on the inside of St. James. But Fisher's fellow rookie, Jaques
Lazier, tried to pass Fisher on her inside and squeezed her in a
space not built for three cars as the three drivers headed into the
turn.
</P>
<P>
   St. James, trying to avoid the wall, came down into Fisher, and
then bumped off the car right into the wall, her right-side pod
severing off and catapulting into the sky. Fisher followed next and
clipped her right side on the wall, damaging her suspension, but
not much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a car coming behind me into Turn 1,'' said St. James,
who did not know that it was Fisher's at the time. ``I took a
defensive line but wanted to stay out of the loose stuff. Whoever
it was, I was surprised they would try to force a pass at that
point. I'm extremely disappointed it happened, but I'm even more
disappointed it happened under those circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's team owner, Derrick Walker, saw the Indy sandwich occur
differently. He cited St. James' slow speed, but put more blame on
Lazier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn was running really really slow, it looked like she was
running with a boat anchor hanging off the back,'' Walker said.
``Sarah was closing around her so quick she had to pass her. I
don't know who the clown on the inside was. Lazier? Well, Lazier
made two coming into the turn into three. That squeezed her. Only a
third into the race, it was a bonehead move to make two going into
three into the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll kill the son of a gun,'' Fisher screamed into her headset
to her team members as she came to a stop, and like St. James,
needed a tow back to the garage. Then she was upset with herself.
``She apologized for screwing up,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anybody fault,'' Fisher said later, back in
her garage as her mechanics tried to see if they could repair the
suspension in time to get her back out on the track. They could
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stuck in the middle,'' Fisher said. ``I was a sitting
duck in this case. When you're passing three abreast, it doesn't
happen very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fisher downplayed the connection with St. James, when
Fisher was 15, she attended a five-day driving camp run by St.
James, after which the participants could race go-karts, already
two levels below her. Fisher said it was it a waste of time. ``It
wasn't really helpful for me at that point in my career,'' she said
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was what happened Sunday. Officially, Fisher was 31st, St.
James, 32nd, and the pole-sitter, Greg Ray, who crashed into the
wall in Lap 66, last. Fisher had been battling engine problems on
two of her pit stops, but still controlled the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah Fisher could have finished this 500 race and could have
benefited from that experience to come back here,'' Walker said.
``Really, she has nothing to be ashamed about. She did everything
right.'' &QL;

ANGELS PUT POWER ON HIGH

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Brian Cooper gave the Anaheim Angels
something they hadn't had in more than a month, but their bats did
something no Angels team had ever done, and together, it resulted
in an 8-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Sunday before
23,645 at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper became the first Angels starter since Scott Schoeneweis
on April 26 to throw eight innings. But what made Cooper a winner
was the Angels outburst in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of five hitters, the Angels hit four home runs, the
first time in club history they've hit four in an inning. Their 48
homers in May are the most in club history for any month.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, who had four hits in the game, hit the first one,
a three-run homer off Royals starter Miguel Batista. After Adam
Kennedy flied out, Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson hit
consecutive homers, turning what had been a 2-0 deficit into a 6-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Up to then, Cooper had been a little erratic. But the runs gave
him what he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was outstanding,'' said Cooper, who is 2-0 with a 3.21 ERA
in two starts since being called up May 22. ``We were losing 2-0,
and I hadn't found it yet. But we got those runs and that's what
started it for me. We got that lead, and I went right after them. I
got three quick outs, and it got my timing down, and I hit a groove
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   An outing like Cooper's was needed to give rest to an Angels
bullpen that's been used a lot lately. In his eight innings, Cooper
gave up three runs (one earned) and six hits with four strikeouts
and one walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pitching performance like that never comes at a bad time,''
Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``But the last couple of weeks
with the condition of our starters, the bullpen's just taken the
ball and really been stretched out. For him to do that, that's
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper gave up an RBI single to Joe Randa in the second inning,
and it turned out to be the only earned run he allowed all day.
Mike Sweeney reached on third baseman Troy Glaus' throwing error in
the third inning and came around to score on a single by Jermaine
Dye. In the eighth, shortstop Keith Luuloa's throwing error led to
another unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   But when the defense was good behind him, Cooper was too.
Between Brian Johnson's one-out single in the fourth and the error
by Luuloa leading off the eighth, Cooper retired 11 consecutive
batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty much what I strive for every game, finding that
groove,'' Cooper said. ``Typically for me it doesn't start until
later in the game. But the way I consider it, once I find it, it's
game-over. I'm full of confidence. I don't feel like I'll be
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Royals still had a chance in the ninth inning
after Cooper was out of the game. The Royals have won 12 games in
their final at-bat this season and they put a scare Sunday into the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie and Mike Holtz combined to allow one run and four
hits when Scioscia brought in Shigetoshi Hasegawa with the bases
loaded and one out. Carlos Febles came up representing the tying
run, but Hasegawa got him to hit into a game-ending double play. It
was Hasegawa's second save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Batista (2-3) held the Angels to four singles through four
innings, but the Angels bats erupted in the fifth. The four home
runs drove in all six runs, but the inning was started by a walk
and a perfect hit-and-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck led off with a walk and took off for second on a
pitch to Luuloa. Luuloa hit a grounder to the shortstop's spot
vacated by Luis Ordaz, who went to cover second. Walbeck went to
third on the play, then scored on Erstad's three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys slugging,'' said Vaughn, whose 18 homers
lead the American League. ``These guys can hurt you if you make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad got his fourth hit of the day in the eighth, driving in
two runs with a bloop single. His 82 hits lead the majors.

SPORTS COLUMN: PACERS FADE WITH THE GARDEN CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a lazy Sunday afternoon, a few Indiana Pacers
players trickled into Madison Square Garden for a light
shoot-around Sunday. Larry Bird had called in the team to watch
film but had given them a day off from practice.
</P>
<P>
   With a crucial Game 4 with the Knicks coming up Monday, a
difficult loss in Game 3 to digest, Bird figured a day of
relaxation and contemplation in New York would serve his team well.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis sat in a chair on the sideline surrounded by the news
media, Rik Smits, who played an unaccustomed 40 minutes on Saturday
_ and looked it _ draped himself over a couple of chairs. Mark
Jackson filed out to the floor and held court, then Reggie Miller
sat down under a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3, and the Knicks' 98-95 victory, was hashed and rehashed.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Perkins, the Pacers' 38-year-old sage, sat on a table and
lamented Saturday's loss. ``Yesterday's game was a winable game,''
Perkins said. ``We only led by one point at intermission but we
played well, we showed them that we could play well, we could beat
them here, and 3-0 sounds a lot better than 2-1. You have to finish
a team like this when you get the chance because you know how the
Knicks are.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he meant, Perkins smiled. ``Anything can happen in
this building,'' he said. ``Yesterday Spree is shooting a shot that
has no chance of going in, they call a foul on Reggie that bails
him out. Last year you had the 4-point play. And just all the other
stuff.'' Off by center court Larry Bird, the Pacers coach _ and, as
it turns out, their most consistent money player _ held court.
</P>
<P>
   In all the analysis of the game, Bird picked up on something
that only a bird truly might see. From a height and distance, with
a panoramic vantage point, he talked about an opportunity lost in a
crucial Game 3, with Indiana leading the series by 2-0. Patrick
Ewing was injured, in street clothes, Marcus Camby slipped on the
court and fell and was eventually wheeled out of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Bird watched his team disintegrate. Poor shots, bad shots; bad
calls exaggerated by Miller's chirping at the officials. But this
was not what Bird picked up on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers missed a subtle signal on Saturday that the Knicks
were out of emotional steam. Some Pacers players were too young to
pick it up. A veteran like Smits was too old to do anything about
it, a player like Miller was too self-absorbed to notice. Bird was
not talking about a missed shot or a bad pass, a loose ball the
Pacers did not grab, Bird was referring to the Knicks crowd. The
fans. They were gone.
</P>
<P>
   At a critical point in the game, Bird felt an odd stillness fall
over the Garden. He thought back on all the games he had played in
this building as a Celtic, going back to 1979. He had never felt
this before. Not from the never-say-die Knicks. The spirit was
gone. The energy that usually leads a Knicks rally, the electricity
that shoots through the corridors and up to the rafters. Gone.
``I've never heard a Garden crowd as soft as this one was
yesterday,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   For someone like Bird, a basketball artist who prided himself on
precision when he played, the choice of words was revealing.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say the Garden was flat. He did not say the crowd was
quiet. Or worried or drained of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Bird referred to the Knicks crowd as he might refer to an
opposing center he planned to attack. He said the Garden crowd was
soft. He thought the Pacers could make their comeback and get away
without having to tear through the emotional concentration of
Knicks fans in the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great opportunity,'' Bird said Sunday. ``It was so
important to get that game yesterday. Now we play them again and
it's going to be a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Madison Square Garden crowd may have fallen silent with
Camby's loss, but Indiana faded along with them. ``That's been our
three-year pattern,'' Bird said. ``We play well with our backs
against the wall when things aren't going well, but when things are
going well, we can't close it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose walked out of the building Sunday afternoon when
someone asked how he felt a loss would affect the Pacers. His face
tightened. ``We're not going to lose this series,'' he said. ``I
don't care what anyone says. We're going to win this series.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was not so sure. ``It's not about X's and O's at this
point,'' Bird said. ``It's a matter of showing up and playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird joked about the Garden crowd and said he hoped the spirit
would somehow stay away Monday. He realized the Pacers had a one
game pass and had blown it. Another missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard the Garden so soft before,'' Bird said ``I
guarantee you, I'll never hear it again.'' &QL;

BELCHER TO TRY IT AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Pitcher Tim Belcher will begin a rehab
assignment Saturday at Triple-A Edmonton, and the Anaheim Angels
hope he'll be in the starting rotation around June 13 when the club
begins a three-game series at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher had offseason surgery to repair a torn muscle in his
right elbow and was expected back in early May. But he had a
setback when on a rehab assignment and had to stop throwing for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better this time than when I went out (on a rehab
assignment) the last time,'' Belcher said. ``I thought I felt good
last time. But I thought I'd always have stiffness and soreness the
rest of my career. Now I've got nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery process has been a difficult one for Belcher, who
before last season never had any elbow problems his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating, tiring,'' he said. ``You have to be
real patient, which is not my strong suit, relative to baseball or
life in general. So it's been tough. One thing that's helped is
being a starting pitcher. Even when you're healthy, you're sitting
and watching 80 percent of the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding a healthy Belcher figures to help a rotation that is
inexperienced. The current rotation consists of three pitchers -
Brian Cooper, Jarrod Washburn and Seth Etherton (who began this
season in the minors), and a fourth - Scott Schoeneweis - who is in
his first big-league season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The other starter - Kent Bottenfield - hasn't won in his past
four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's everything he's billed to be,'' manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``He's a great competitor, he knows the game, and he knows
how to get hitters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Subpar pitching: Bottenfield was an All-Star and an 18-game
winner for the St. Louis Cardinals last season, but he has only
three wins in 11 starts this season and none in his past four
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bottenfield earned the victory with 6 scoreless innings
May 5 against Seattle, he is 0-2 with a 7.33 ERA in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not where he should be,'' Scioscia said. ``I think now
he's trying too hard and his mechanics are off. It's something he
went through last year. His rhythm is a little off, but this guy's
for real. He'll settle in, I have no worries there.''

CHINA PROSCRIBES PRESS FROM NAMING TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In the best-selling children's series Harry Potter,
there is a character so disturbing that Harry's friends refer to
him only as ``He Who Must Not Be Named'' _ as if pronouncing the
name ``Voldemort'' would somehow solidify the demon's existence.
</P>
<P>
   President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan is clearly China's Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election in March, China's state-controlled press has
been filled with reporting about Taiwan and its new government. The
papers have parsed the new president's every sentence and analyzed
his administration's intentions in minute detail.
</P>
<P>
   But in this daily cascade of print, there are several words that
have practically never appeared, forbidden by government order:
``Chen Shui-bian,'' the new leader's name, and the word
``president.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, reporters and editorial writers have had to fall back
on a handful of government approved circumlocutions, all designed
to dance around the fact that the man they call, for example, ``the
new leader of the Taiwan authority'' was, after all, democratically
elected the island's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No media outlets are allowed to use his name, at all,'' said a
Beijing journalist. ``And even though so many articles are written
about Taiwan, we can't write what we like. Papers are only allowed
to print what the central government has agreed upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, words in the Chinese press are carefully chosen _ or
omitted _ and carry political messages. Discussions of sensitive
subjects routinely involve a state-sanctioned vocabulary and
punctuation. And few topics are more sensitive than Taiwan, which
Beijing regards as a breakaway province that must, by force if
necessary, eventually be reunited with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   And so ``Taiwanese independence,'' for example, always appears
in quotation marks, indicating that the author recognizes the
error, even absurdity, of the phrase. The election of Chen, whose
Democratic Progressive Party has in the past supported
independence, has caused particular consternation.
</P>
<P>
   But even many Chinese journalists are perplexed at the decision
not to name Chen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why they wouldn't want to use the term `president,'
since we don't recognize Taiwan as a country,'' said a Chinese
reporter. ``But not to use his name? Everybody here knows about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Chinese government seems to want to eliminate any
concrete evidence of Taiwan's boisterous election and of Chen's
euphoric inauguration earlier this month. State television carried
no images of the events. And, although Chen's inauguration speech
was carefully dissected in every major Chinese newspaper, none have
actually carried the text. Within hours, however, copies were
circulating on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Chang Huei-mei, a Taiwanese pop star also known as A-mei who is
wildly popular here, followed Chen into the realm of the
unmentionable. After the singer performed at Chen's swearing-in
ceremony, China's state broadcast stations and newspapers were told
they could no longer use advertisements for Sprite soft drinks that
feature her, though they had been used the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's name has appeared in the major state-controlled news only
once since he announced his candidacy last fall. On March 18, the
day of Chen's election, the state-run New China News Agency issued
a two-sentence report: ``This evening the electoral activities for
the leadership of the Taiwan region concluded. The DPP candidate
Chen Shui-bian won 39.3 percent, the independent candidate James
Soong won 36.84 percent, and the KMT candidate Lien Chan won 23.1
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The press here refers to other Taiwan politicians directly and
frequently, including the former president, Lee Teng-hui, and
Chen's vice president, Lu Hsiu-lien _ though invariably to heap
scorn and criticism on them. The Beijing press referred to Lee
during his tenure term as the ``so-called president.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu has been as outspoken in her support of Taiwanese
independence as Chen has been circumspect on this issue. At a
recent briefing for foreign journalists, a Chinese official
explaned their policy for not naming Chen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee Teng-hui and Lu Hsiu-lien are die-hard separatists and
incurable in this regard, so we name them,'' he said. But as for
Chen, ``We will heed his word and his acts, so we try to
distinguish him from the others.''
</P>
<P>
   A former official of the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda
department explained that the decision made a certain sense in
terms of the norms of propaganda, and keeping options open as
relations with Taiwan's new leadership evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen is the elected leader and China must deal with him,'' he
said. ``When the government is conducting a propaganda offensive,
if it names the target, then the target has entered a `blacklist'
and it's nearly impossible to back off the condemnation. So by
keeping Chen's name out of it _ it seems silly and childish _ but
it's a way of keeping room for maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few others, these days, who enjoy this status _
often someone whose spirit is ever-present and intensely
threatening to the government, but whose name is never mentioned in
the state press.
</P>
<P>
   A notable example is Zhao Ziyang, the former Communist Party
leader who was deposed in 1989 after he expressed sympathy for
student protesters. Still popular after a decade of house arrest,
Zhao is China's ultimate Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhao is out of the news, and Chen at its center. So a few
tabloids have recently defied government policy and printed Chen's
name _ when it seemed too absurd not to.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists suggest that another reason why the Chinese
authorities forbid the use of Chen's name is that they cannot
decide what honorific to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ```Mr. Chen' _ that sounds too polite,'' said one journalist.
``And of course, `President Chen' is out of the question. So what
we've arrived at for now is to just call him `the new leader of the
region of Taiwan.'''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Rangers received six players from the Detroit
Tigers in the Juan Gonzalez trade. There's no guarantee any of them
will play in the three-game series with the Tigers that starts
tonight at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   The rundown:
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto, who is limited to pinch-hitter duty because
of a strained groin muscle, said he's ready to return to the field.
Manager Johnny Oates said he hasn't been told that. Either way,
Catalanotto is still a reserve behind Luis Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to getting back in the lineup,''
Catalanotto said. ``But that's a decision Johnny has to make. I'm
not going to hang my head if he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler will not play in the series. He is sidelined with a
strained hip flexor muscle, and his return is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm really disappointed,'' Kapler said. ``It's like an
intensity deep inside of me. It's just my competitive nature. It's
not a revenge thing or a hate thing. Most of those guys over there
I like and I'm close friends with. It's not a spiteful, negative
thing. It's like a sibling rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Francisco Cordero remains an important member of the
Rangers' bullpen, but his appearances depend on the Rangers
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve catcher Bill Haselman started yesterday. Having done
that and given Ivan Rodriguez a day off, it's unlikely Haselman
will start in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Thompson is out for the season with a torn rotator cuff.
General manager Doug Melvin got another grim reminder of his
absence when he learned Thompson's 1.48 earned-run average in
interleague play over the past three years is the lowest in the
majors. The Rangers begin interleague play Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed pitcher Alan Webb is 0-4 with an 11.72 ERA for
Double-A Tulsa.  &QL; 
Greer responds
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer returned to the Rangers' starting lineup and went
0-4 yesterday. But he had a double as a pinch hitter in Friday's
game, and manager Johnny Oates took notice when he saw Greer
``explode ''around first base. That reassured Oates that Greer's
ankle surgery has helped restore some of the speed he has been
losing over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, he was the fastest guy in our camp until we
got \RTom\S Goodwin,'' Oates said.''I don't think it's been that
way for a while and even Rusty didn't know how bad it was. He was
all right running the bases, but when he had to round a base, or in
the outfield curve after a ball, the ankle wouldn't let him.''  &QL; 
Oliver fine
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver was examined by Minnesota Twins physician Dan Buss
during yesterday's game and was cleared to pitch in Wednesday's
game against the Detroit Tigers. Oliver complained of a dead arm in

RANGERS PAY CALL ON GONZALEZ
</HEADLINE>

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The parting seems permanent. Juan Gonzalez has no
interest in re-signing with the Rangers and general manager Doug
Melvin remains convinced it's not wise to commit $10-15 million to
one player.
</P>
<P>
   That was the overriding reason why Melvin traded Gonzalez to the
Detroit Tigers on Nov. 2 in a nine-player trade that brought
outfielder Gabe Kapler, infielder Frank Catalanotto, catcher Bill
Haselman and pitchers Justin Thompson, Francisco Cordero and Alan
Webb to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In Melvin's mind, that reasoning remains valid, especially
because Gonzalez declined an eight-year, $140 million offer from
the Tigers in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see that, you feel sort of glad we made the
decision,'' Melvin said. ``It confirms what we feel. I still
haven't been sold on the fact of paying that kind of money a player
like him would command.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and the Rangers will be reunited today, but only in
that they'll be in the same ballpark for the first time since the
trade. The Rangers open a three-game series with the Tigers tonight
at Comerica Park, and for the first time, they'll be looking at
Gonzalez in the opposite dugout. It seems destined to remain that
way for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was terse and to the point with Detroit reporters
yesterday when asked if he thought there was a chance of re-signing
with the Rangers when he becomes a free agent at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what?'' Gonzalez said. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   It's highly unlikely he would be given the opportunity. Melvin
is becoming more and more convinced that teams with one player
making more than $10 million have a difficult time assembling the
complete team needed to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that a number of players making more than $10
million failed to make the playoffs last year, including Gary
Sheffield and Kevin Brown with the Dodgers, Sammy Sosa with the
Cubs, Larry Walker with the Rockies, Barry Bonds with the Giants
and Albert Belle with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a knock on the player,'' Melvin said. ``You need
depth, you need pitching depth. That's what \RYankees general
manager\S Brian Cashman was telling me they're struggling with, now
that they're having to pay Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams and Mariano
Rivera a lot of money. They can't afford the kind of depth they
used to have.'' talked about it, paying a guy more than $10
million.'']
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his reunion with his former teammates, Gonzalez
said, ``I'll see my friends, say hello and that's about it. I don't
have any friends between the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who has known Gonzalez longer than
anybody with the Rangers, said: ``I'm sure he's going to play very
hard. He'll probably be excited to play against us for the first
time. I'm looking forward to seeing him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has a strained planter fascia in his left foot and will
probably be limited to designated-hitter duties during the
three-game series.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner missed the
last two games of the Western Conference Finals after spraining his
right knee early in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock sounded less convinced yesterday than
Saturday that Langenbrunner would be able to play tomorrow in Game
1 of the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really day to day,'' Hitchcock said yesterday. ``He's a
question mark to play in Game 1. If he can't feel comfortable,
there's no point in going out there. What we don't want to do is
have him go out there for one game and then be out for the rest of
the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brenden Morrow returned a week after he fractured
his right ankle in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, and
defenseman Richard Matvichuk played in Game 7 on Saturday after
suffering a concussion in Game 6 two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars would love to see Langenbrunner back in their lineup
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to put any pressure on Jamie, but if he can get
back and play, that's a plus for our team,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said.  &QL; 
Remembering Richard
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Guy Carbonneau grew up under the influence of
Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard. So, naturally, he was mourning the
NHL's and Quebec's loss after Richard died Saturday at the age of
78.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a chance to watch him play. But I had a chance to
meet him a lot when I was in Montreal,'' Carbonneau said. ``For me,
he was an ambassador. He was one of the best hockey players in the
world. He was just living hockey every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Richard, Stars forward Kirk Muller once was the Canadiens'
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about him before I arrived in Montreal, and once I got
there I realized that of all the great players Montreal's been
fortunate enough to have, he was the elite of them all,'' Muller
said. ``He was a super person. It will be tough for that whole
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller wore Richard's old No. 9 during the All-Star game in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me over afterward and said, `You're a Hab, right?' I
said yeah. He goes, `You're wearing No. 9.' I said yeah. He said,
`Don't make it a habit.' I still don't know to this day whether he
was serious about it or not.''  &QL; 
Back to Jersey
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' Stanley Cup Finals series against New Jersey is
somewhat of a homecoming for Kirk Muller, who played his first
seven NHL seasons with the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years is the longest time I have ever been with any one
team, and it brings back memories going back,'' Muller said. ``It
will be interesting the feelings going in there for the Stanley Cup
Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Muller's friends, defenseman Ken Daneyko, still plays
with New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually grew up with Kenny,'' Muller said. ``I started my
career with him and spent seven years with him and lived with him,
and he's still plugging along. We still talk a little bit. When you
have that kind of past with a guy you want to stay in touch with
them.''  &QL; 
Ouch
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matvichuk still was feeling the effects of his
concussion Friday night as he watched Flyers forward Eric Lindros
suffer yet another concussion, on an open-ice check from New
Jersey's Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two physical teams, but you never want to see a player
get hit like that,'' Matvichuk said. ``It could be a career-ending
injury. ... It's one of those things where it's a physical game.
You've got guys that are 6 feet now that can skate like the wind
and shoot like there's no tomorrow. Of course, there are going to
be injuries. But you never want to see anybody get hit like that.''
 &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brenden Morrow has played in plenty of Game 7s in
his hockey career. The only problem is none of them were in the
NHL. So was he nervous? ``A little bit,'' he said. ``OK, a lot
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were 6-for-29 on the power play in the Western
Conference Finals, including 2-for-4 in Game 7, and they held
Colorado to 3-for-30 for the series, including 0-for-3 with only
four shots in Game 7. Colorado did not score on its last 18
power-play chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars improved their record in Game 7s to 5-5, and Ed
Belfour improved to 4-0 in Game 7s.

MCGWIRE TAKES A POUNDING INSIDE FROM METS' RUSCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ No player with as many career home runs as Mark
McGwire has homered with such frequency. If you are a pitcher,
sooner or later, the St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman will get
you. He took Glendon Rusch deep two years ago, on a pitch Rusch
tried to throw inside but left in the middle of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch threw inside to McGwire again Sunday, as he did to many of
the Cardinals. It was an effective strategy, and it produced a 6-2
victory for Rusch and the Mets, who swept the first-place Cardinals
and have won eight of their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch, who had been given an average of fewer than two runs per
start this year, finally received some run support, and he didn't
waste it. The left-hander worked seven innings, allowing two runs
on five hits and walking one to improve to 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the ball is juiced, but I think the hitters have
caught up to the pitchers' pattern,'' said catcher Todd Pratt. ``We
like to pitch middle-away now, and no one pitches inside
consistently anymore. If they do, they can't consistently throw
strikes inside. As hitters, we know we're going to get our pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Glendon just kept on pounding inside and pounding
inside. When they thought he was going to go away, he came back
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile, Edgardo Alfonzo and Pratt had homered off Darryl
Kile to give Rusch a 4-1 lead by the time he faced McGwire with a
runner on first and no outs in the fourth. Pratt never moved his
glove as Rusch froze McGwire with an 89 mile-per-hour fastball.
McGwire moved his body as if the ball had come too far inside, but
the pitch was an obvious third strike.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went 1 for 4 Sunday and was 3 for 11 in the series, with
no home runs. Every other team that has faced McGwire three times
this year has allowed at least one home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to stay in on him and tie him up,'' Rusch said.
``He's an unbelievable hitter, as far as getting to a lot of
pitches. Fortunately, he didn't beat me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusch said he tries to take the same aggressive approach no
matter the score. But pitching with a lead, which Rusch hadn't done
in four starts, helped make him more aggressive, he said. It is an
idea impressed on him by Mets left-hander Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   This is Rusch's fourth major league season, but he said he feels
like a rookie. ``That's good for me,'' said the 25-year-old Rusch.
``It keeps me open-minded and helps me be a sponge.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rusch, Leiter is left-handed, but the similarities end
there. Leiter is a hard thrower who works inside to hitters; Rusch
throws softer and usually to the outside part of the plate. But
Rusch has sought out Leiter and the Mets' other veteran
left-handers for advice, and Leiter told him he can make his
outside pitches better by letting hitters know he can also come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act like this little bump out here is mine, and I'm going
right after you,'' Leiter said he told Rusch. ``You don't have to
throw 95 miles per hour to be intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusch gave way to John Franco in the eighth inning, and Armando
Benitez finished off the Cardinals with a five-pitch, 1-2-3 ninth.
The victory completed the Mets' second consecutive weekend sweep of
a first-place team; last week at Shea Stadium, they took three in a
row from the National League West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are 12-5 against teams that currently have a winning
record; they are 16-17 in all other games. The Mets' only losses in
their last 10 games have been one-run defeats to the San Diego
Padres, a last-place club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to make sure we don't take anything for
granted,'' said Todd Zeile, who had two homers Saturday and was 3
for 4 Sunday. ``We should have won at least one of the ball games
in San Diego. We let a couple of games get away from us when we
were flat. I don't think we were flat here at all.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Central Park is gorgeous right now _ moist and lush
and shimmering with health. Especially breathtaking are the thick,
deep green lawns, the dust bowls of a few years ago, that cost
millions of dollars to restore.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the anticipated number of visitors this year is up to
20 million _ an increase of at least 5 million over the last few
years. No wonder so many of them want to treat it like a vastly
superior extension of a backyard, lolling on the grass and walking
dogs. Jogging and roller-skating. Strumming guitars and beating
drums.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, messing the place up. Littering, making noise
and trampling the exquisite grass. The problem with the lovely new
Central Park is that people love it so much. Before, when it was
considered dangerous and rundown, it was not such a big deal that
musicians amplified their sound or soccer players tore up the grass
with their cleats or dog owners did not always clean up.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after spending $250 million on the park _ mostly money
raised by the Central Park Conservancy, founded in 1980 and now one
of New York's most prestigious philanthropies _ the city is getting
fussy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was a shambles, it didn't really matter what you did
on it,'' said Henry Stern, the parks and recreation commissioner.
``For a long time, the rules were ignored. But now, after 20 years
and millions of dollars, we have a safe park, a clean park, a nice
park, and keeping it like that means some restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   And some resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refer to it as a grass museum,'' said David Gibson, who has
two children in the West Side Soccer League, an after-school
program that had to bus children to Wards Island while Central
Park's North Meadow was restored. Marc Freedman, president of the
league, said he feared that its 3,500 children ages 5 to 15 would
not be able to return to the park, given the heavy competition for
slots on the playing fields. ``The Conservancy is not as friendly
toward kids' sports,'' he said. ``I want to have beautiful grass
for the kids to play on, but for me priority is for kids to play.
For them, the priority is nice, green grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's other priority seems to be enforcing long-ignored
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are not new. Musicians have long been forbidden to be
too noisy or to use loudspeakers without permission. Permits have
long been required for gatherings of 20 or more people, as well as
bonds that can be revoked if the area is not properly cleaned up.
It has always been illegal to litter or to let dogs run free
outside official runs.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, the city is clamping down. First, there were
the wars over leashing dogs. Signs announcing $100 fines for
littering are soon to go up. And this month, the city has been
ordering the park's musicians and dancers to lower the volume and
perform less often.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the Jazz Blues Ensemble and David Ippolito, who calls
himself That Guitar Man, have been playing in the same spots for
years, acquiring loyal fans and even becoming minor tourist
attractions. Others, like the skaters who dance to amplified rock
music and the African drummers at Bethesda Fountain, provide the
kind of colorful scenes that New Yorkers and tourists _ some of
them, anyway _ say makes the city vibrant and worth visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kaufman, a Central Park Conservancy official, who was at
Bethesda Fountain on Saturday trying to disperse the drummers,
said: ``We've made the park beautiful. ``Now we want to to make it
beautiful to all the senses, including hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans of the music say it raises their spirits and creates a
rare, precious urban community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's best about New York,'' said Lynn Walsh, a
secretary who has been gathering with about 20 other drummers at
the fountain for six years. ``This park, the outdoors, the beauty.
Most of all the feeling of love.''
</P>
<P>
   The city says there are numerous complaints about the drumming
every year. A few weeks ago, police officers ordered the drummers
to stop playing and confiscated seven African drums.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York
Civil Liberties Union, turned up at Bethesda Fountain to try to
work out a compromise that would let the drummers play. ``Usually,
we sue,'' said Siegel. ``But this time we're trying to mediate.
This is a great park and we don't need ugly scenes.'' He added that
Kaufman and other conservancy officials were not supposed to make
policy or enforce park regulations, and complained that Kaufman
appeared to be doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that are tugging at Central Park today _ noisy music
versus peace and quiet, lawn as landscape versus lawn as carpet,
orderliness vs. freedom _ were controversial from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   When Frederick Law Olmsted, the park's legendary creator,
inaugurated free band concerts in 1859, there was ``great
resistance,' '' said Witold Rybczynski, author of ``A Clearing in
the Distance,'' a biography of Olmsted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally tens of thousands of people went,'' Rybczynski said
in an interview. ``But for a long time they weren't allowed to sit
on the grass. Rich people would sit in their carriages. Everybody
else had to stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Central Park ``looks like nature,'' visitors often
forget they are in a fragile, artificial environment, he said.
``People think they're in the country and, within limits, are free
to do what they want. It feels wrong to have rules _ it looks so
natural, like the Garden of Eden. But the park is very delicate. If
people all start walking on grass or littering, that's it. Sound
can really carry and spoil things for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   But balancing the enforcement of park rules is equally delicate,
he said. Being too lenient can result in visitors' impinging on one
another and damaging things. Being too rigid drives people away,
potentially worsening the neglect of the park. ``Parks only exist
because people go there,'' Rybczynski said.
</P>
<P>
   Central Park began its decline during the 1960s, when people
began avoiding it for fear of being mugged. The slide was arrested
after the Central Park Conservancy raised hundreds of millions of
dollars to rehabilitate it, calling on the wealth of nearby
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Now the challenge is to keep people from loving Central Park to
death, and to persuade them to share and be considerate.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stern has asked drummers and musicians who use amplifiers to use
the band shell. But the musicians and their regular listeners
object to the formality and sterility of the concrete stage,
preferring the intimacy of the lawn or lakeside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drums are part of my culture,'' said Rose Brito, 34, who said
she was Irish and Puerto Rican. ``To me, the noise touches my soul.
The louder it is, the more free I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hiss, who writes about parks and open space, suggested that
a ``sound map'' be made, to find relatively enclosed areas for
music.
</P>
<P>
   But preventing hundreds of thousands of feet from stamping the
grass blades into mulch is tougher. One solution might be to spread
the wealth of visitors to other parks, like Riverside, Prospect,
Van Cortlandt and dozens of others, said Mark Caserta, an employee
of the Parks Council, an independent, nonprofit advocacy group for
the city's parks.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts over music and silence should be worked out case
by case, Rybczynski said. ``That makes it a political hot potato,''
he said. ``But simply banning music doesn't seem right. The park
clearly requires cooperation. We've gotten very bad at compromise
in our society. But the park clearly requires compromise.''

WORTHAM AND BOWDEN BACK HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ The Cowboys have improved their speed on both sides of
the ball this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless you count Barron Wortham behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barron is the worst driver in the United States,'' said Joe
Bowden, Wortham's best friend with the Tennessee Titans the past
six seasons, and now his teammate with the Cowboys after both
signed as free agents last month. ``You don't want to ride with
him. You kind of get impatient with a guy like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if the speed limit is 55 mph , Barron is the only guy
I know who drives 54 or 53.''
</P>
<P>
   Both free agents signed with the Cowboys within 24 hours of each
other. Appropriately, Wortham followed Bowden. You might say
Wortham drives a slow bargain as well, since he began talking to
the Cowboys long before Bowden did.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, a Fort Worth native who lettered in football and track
for the Everman Bulldogs, is a self-proclaimed ``slow poke'' who
takes nearly an hour to drive from South Fort Worth to Valley Ranch
each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have drivers honking at me, shaking their fist,'' said
Wortham, who started at middle linebacker for the Titans in Super
Bowl XXXIV in January. ``But I'm a cautious kind of driver. I want
to get where I'm going in one piece. Besides, the \RValley Ranch\S
facility isn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to football, Wortham was described in the Titans
media guide as ``a powerful hitter whose motor is always running.''
But when it comes to competing on the highway with speeding
commuters, Wortham chooses neither to beat nor to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be that fast pace of city living ... but they're never
going to get me,'' said Wortham, who was born at John Peter Smith
Hospital just over 30 years ago and has never considered living
anywhere other than Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their athletic ability and versatility, Wortham and
Bowden can play either inside or outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed, I called Barron and said, `Get in here. This
system is made for you and me,' '' Bowden said. ``Here we
read-and-react; we don't have to do so much thinking. And we don't
have to play over the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, Bowden and Dat Nguyen are all 5-foot-11. Pro Bowl
weakside linebacker Dexter Coakley is listed as 5-10. Only 1999
strong-side starter Darren Hambrick is over 6-foot among the
regulars at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not putting down the system we ran in Tennessee, but the
bigger defensive tackles here allows \Rlinebackers\S to make
plays,'' Wortham said. ``This defense is suited for small, quick,
athletic linebackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Godfrey, who led the Cowboys in tackles last season from
his middle linebacker position, signed as an unrestricted free
agent with the Titans. As much as the Cowboys liked Godfrey _ and
they couldn't touch Tennessee's five-year, $25 million contract
offer _ they are more than content in ``trading'' Godfrey to the
Titans for both Bowden and Wortham.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't bum a ride from Wortham, if you want to get somewhere
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``And never go out with him to eat and say, Barron, let me pick
up the check.' ``Never'' say that!'' Bowden said. ``You won't
believe how much this guy can eat. It's almost sick ....''
</P>
<P>
   But that's another story.

RANGERS STUNNED BY SWEEP
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Rangers pitcher Rick Helling could be on the
American League All-Star team this year. The way Sean Bergman has
pitched this year, he could be released by the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Helling entered the game with a 3.22 earned-run average, fourth
best in the American League. Bergman had a 9.93 ERA, which would
have been the worst if he had enough innings to qualify. Opponents
were hitting .212 off Helling, second lowest in the league. They
were hitting .382 off Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   As Rangers designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro said, ``I felt
pretty good coming in about our chances of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't win. The Minnesota Twins scored four runs in
the first three innings and somehow Bergman and three relievers
made it stand for a 4-3 victory yesterday afternoon at the
Metrodome. The victory allowed the Twins to sweep the three-game
series against the stunned Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect this, not when we were playing pretty
decently coming in here,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Palmeiro, ``They obviously played better than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Helling: ``It's tough to lose three here, but this is a
big-league team. I don't take any team for granted, and I think I
can speak for the rest of the team, nobody else does either. It
doesn't matter if it's the Minnesota Twins or the New York Yankees;
every team has a chance to win. They played well, and we didn't;
when that happens, you've got a chance to get swept.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, manager Johnny Oates had a hard time believing the
Rangers didn't do more damage to Bergman, who allowed three runs on
seven hits but saved himself by not walking a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was frustrating,'' Oates said. ``The game was there for
the taking, and we didn't take it. The last two nights we didn't
pitch well; today we had a shot to win and couldn't. Rick got off
to a rocky start, but after the third inning he pitched extremely
well. We had all sorts of chances to score runs and have good
at-bats, and we didn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position,
including 0-for-6 in the seventh and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still getting people on base, but we're not getting big
base hits,'' Oates said. Bergman ``gave us some pitches to hit. If
we're patient ... we should have scored a lot of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, trailing 4-3, got their rally going in the seventh
with an infield single by David Segui and Ruben Mateo's single to
left. Mike Lamb advanced Segui to third with a line-drive out to
deep center, but Bergman came back to strike out Royce Clayton in
an 11-pitch at-bat and got Bill Haselman on a grounder to short to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Carrasco replaced Bergman to start the eighth and
immediately gave up a double to Luis Alicea. But he came back to
strike out Frank Catalanotto, and Eddie Guardado came in to get
Rusty Greer on a grounder to second. Palmeiro drew a walk, but
Guardado struck out Segui, once again leaving the Rangers
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins, who pitched himself out of the Twins' rotation
this season, took the Rangers down in order in the ninth to earn
his first career major-league save. It was that kind of day for the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Helling started his day by giving up a leadoff home run to
Jacque Jones in the first inning. With one out, Matt Lawton singled
to left, stole second, went to third on Haselman's throwing error
and scored Ron Coomer's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota had runners on second and third with no outs in the
second inning, but Helling kept the Twins from scoring. But, with
the game tied 2-2, he wasn't so lucky in the third. This time with
runners at second and third, Corey Koskie delivered a two-out,
two-run single to give the Twins a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Helling then proceeded to retire 13 consecutive batters. But the
Rangers could never pull even. / nn

RAIN DELAYS THE MEMORIAL, AND PERHAPS THE INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Instead of playing golf Sunday, Tiger Woods spent
the afternoon watching rain.
</P>
<P>
   The final round of the Memorial Tournament was suspended until
Monday after rain saturated Muirfield Village Golf Club and made it
impossible to continue. This is the second time in four years that
the Memorial's fourth round has been pushed back to a Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended at 11:15 a.m., long before the leaders could
tee off. When play resumes Monday at 8 a.m., Woods (17-under, 199)
will hold a commanding six-stroke lead over Steve Lowery
(11-under), and a seven-stroke lead over Justin Leonard (10-under).
So while Woods wanted to finish Sunday, he did not feel he would
lose momentum after shooting a 9-under 63 on Friday and a 7-under
65 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to lose your entire game in one day if you're
playing well,'' Woods said. ``You're not going to struggle to break
90 tomorrow. Mentally, you know you need to go out there and get
the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he did during the rain delay, Woods said, ``I ate a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Pavin and Don Pooley, who played in the first group, were
the only golfers who finished Sunday. They shot 71s. Forty of the
80 players in the field failed to complete even one hole.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who is the defending champion at the Memorial, will be
trying to become the first PGA Tour player to win four times this
year. Phil Mickelson, who is not in this field, has three victories
this year. Woods has already won the Mercedes Championships, the
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and the Bay Hill Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Monday will probably be Woods' last round in competition before
the U.S. Open from June 15 to 18 at Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will not play this week's Kemper Open, nor is he expected
to play the Buick Classic (June 8-11) at Westchester Country Club
in Harrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third Monday scheduled on tour this year, and Woods
has been involved in all three. He won at Pebble Beach in February
on a memorable Monday, overcoming a seven-stroke deficit with seven
holes to play. At the Players Championship in March, Woods lost a
Monday final-hole duel with Hal Sutton, who won by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But with Woods holding a six-stroke lead, this Monday finish may
not be as dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too often I've had a six-stroke lead,'' Woods said. ``If
it's calm and soft tomorrow, you'll have to make birdies. If the
wind blows, you won't have to go as low.'' &QL;

WORDS OF WISDOM AND WIT FOR NEW GRADUATES 
</HEADLINE>

   Legend has it that the longest commencement address, said to
have been given in the early days of Harvard University, lasted six
hours _ the first three in Latin and the rest in Greek. The
shortest, alternately attributed to Andy Rooney or Woody Allen, was
just two sentences: ``We've given you a perfect world. Don't screw
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Every spring, they parade to the podiums of colleges and
universities across the United States, offering sage advice _ or at
least a few one-liners. Poets and politicians. Athletes and
artists. Diplomats and do-gooders.
</P>
<P>
   This year seemed an especially auspicious opportunity for
keynoters, as the class of 2000 switched their tassels from side to
side.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of global responsibility _ to end poverty, fight
disease, keep peace. They talked about technology, its gifts and
its perils. They marveled at society's progress _ and questioned
whether it has been swift enough in the field of human relations.
They urged graduates to value time over money: ``You must place
interest in principle above interest on principal,'' Julian Bond,
the chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, said at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Many mentioned their own parents, and nearly all promised to
keep their speeches shorter than the ones they could not remember
from their own commencements. ``I intend to stop speaking before
you stop listening,'' George Mitchell, the former senator from
Maine, told his audience at Washington &AMP; Jefferson College in
Pennsylvania.

   There is a dreamlike quality to every commencement day. But the
veil trembles more mysteriously if you are graduating in the year
2000. It makes you wonder if the date is a destiny or an accident.
A turning point in your life coincided with a turning point in our
era. It is like the moment when a tide has risen to its highest and
then rests: Everything is at the full and yet everything is
volatile.
</P>
<P>
   You stand at a boundary. Behind you is your natural habitat, as
it were, the ground of your creaturely being, the old haunts where
you were nurtured; in front of you is a less knowable prospect of
invitation and challenge, the testing ground of your possibilities.
You stand between whatever binds you to your past and whatever
might be unbounded in your future.

   First question that I want to ask you is, and I want you to
really seriously ponder this: Are you happy with the person you are
today?
</P>
<P>
   Did you keep the promises you made to yourself and apply all of
your energies and resources to soak up every ounce of learning and
life at Simmons and Boston? And on your way to this degree, did you
help a child learn to read or do long division or, more likely
today, write a computer program?
</P>
<P>
   Did you visit an elder, listen to her story and learn to see the
world vividly through dimmed and failing eyes? Did you maintain, or
in some cases develop, a sense of humor, especially about yourself
and even more importantly about the difficulties life sometimes
brings?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, on your way to your current learned state, did you
remember to keep those parts from birth that endeared you to your
family _ the innocence, the wonder, the naivete? ...
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm sure you're asking yourself, ``What's with all the
questions? Classes are over!'' Well, consider this the last exam
that you will have, and it's one you don't even have to take. It
certainly isn't going to be graded; it's a self-examination.

   If we can shrink the world's population to a village of only 100
people, keeping all existing ratios the same, that village would
look like this: There would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the
Western Hemisphere _ north and south _ and 21 Africans; 52 would be
female; 70 would be nonwhite and 30 white; 70 would be
non-Christian and 30 would be Christian.
</P>

   Six of the 100 people would own 59 percent of all the wealth in
the world, and all six of those people would be from the United
States. Eighty of the 100 people would live in substandard housing.
Seventy would be unable to read and write. Fifty would suffer from
malnutrition. One would have a college education.

to hear that an Amherst education can actually lead to a job where
you can wear sweats all day, sleep in late, play your stereo all
you want, and get paid lots of money to draw silly little pictures
in between games of Quake on your computer. ...

<P>
   Knowing you have an audience, especially one that matters to
you, can be utterly paralyzing. The fear of failure, the weight of
expectation, the indecision that comes from striving for perfection
can transform even simple tasks into brain-melting impossibilities.
But knowing you have an audience can also elevate you to do more
than you might otherwise. And to do it better. To consider what
you're doing from more that one view.
</P>
<P>
   As a syndicated cartoonist, I have a huge audience. They tell me
it's over 25 million readers. This might be cause for a little
intimidation were it not for my handy science background reminding

successful, the people I have admired the most, are not necessarily
those who are the most brilliant, or witty, or have mastered a
particular discipline, but those who had the stamina to stay the
course over a long period of time. ... It's like the difference
between the shooting star that flashes across the sky and is gone _
you're not even sure it was there _ and the North Star that is
there every night, night after night.

   You know the story of the farmer who in his back yard had
chicken, and then he had a chicken that was a little odd looking.
... It behaved like a chicken. It was pecking away like other
chickens. It didn't know that there was a blue sky overhead and a
glorious sunshine until someone who was knowledgeable in these
things came along and said to the farmer: `Hey, that's no chicken.
That's an eagle.' ...
</P>
<P>
   And this man took this strange-looking chicken and climbed the
mountain and waited until sunrise. And then he turned this
strange-looking chicken towards the sun and said, `Eagle, fly,
eagle.' And the strange-looking chicken shook itself, spread out
its pinions, and lifted off and soared and soared and soared and
flew away, away into the distance.

<P>
   The demoralization of society is advanced when the word
``values'' supplants the word ``virtues'' in political and ethical
contexts. When we move beyond talk of good and evil, when the
categories virtue and vice are transcended, we are left with the
thin gruel of values-talk.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike virtues, everyone has lots of values. Everyone has as
many as they choose! Hitler had lots of values. George Washington
had virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Values are an equal-opportunity business. They are mere choices.
In contrast, virtues are habits, difficult to develop and therefore
not accessible to all. Therefore, speaking of virtues rather than
values is elitist, offensive to democracy's egalitarian, leveling
ethos, which I say is precisely why talk of virtues should be
revived and talk of values should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of American higher education is not to serve as a
values cafeteria where young people are encouraged to pick
whichever strikes their fancy. Rather, the purpose of higher
education for citizens of a democracy should be to help them
identify excellence in its various realms and to understand what
virtues make it so.

philosophy. Neither its pipes not its theories will hold water.''

   Give you an example of the sophistication of your brain: First
of all the sound waves had to leave my lips, enter your auditory
meatus, travel down to the tympanic membrane, set up a vibratory
force, which traveled across the ossicles of your middle ear to the
oval and round windows, setting up a vibratory force in the
endolymph, which mechanically distorted the microcilia, converting
mechanical energy to electrical energy, which traveled across the
cochlear nerve to the cochlear nucleus to the pons-to-medullary
juncture, from there to the superior olivary nucleus ascending
bilaterally up the brain stem to the lateral lemniscus and the
anterior colliculus and the medial geniculate nuclei across the
thalamic radiations to the posterior temporal lobes, going through
the frontal lobes, coming down the ...
</P>
<P>
   Anyway! You get the point. And that's the simplified version of
what your brain had to do. It can do much more complex things than
that and you barely have to think about it. So with a brain like
that, why would anybody ever utter the words ``I can't''?

   I believe that one of the pernicious lies that has been told to
your generation is that one can ``have it all.'' Although I can't
explain how I knew it, I always knew that this was not possible.
Again, I looked to history and discovered that those women who had
achieved at the level at which I had set my sights had been
childless and those that were not had suffered constant guilt at
not being able to meet the demands of both their work and their
children. And, believe me, I understand the irony of bringing this
up on Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Although I would be the first to say that this situation is not
a fair one, I must also state that I would hate for you to discover
that choices must be made after you had already made those whose
consequences will shape your life for years to come. I believe that
it is important to be clear about your goals and to be willing to
shape your life in a way that makes them possible to achieve.

   Have those lives had impact? Their lives have expanded the very

contribute to the movements that have meaning, and to work on
behalf of the oppressed. You, at this commencement at Antioch, have
the somewhat unique opportunity to prove that old axiom, that man
is made for more than meat and life is more than bread.

   As a new millennium dawns, the eradication of extreme poverty
ought to be one of our most urgent and important goals. Extreme
poverty breeds disease and shortens life expectancy. It reduces the
aspirations and severely limits the potential of children, many of
whom cannot and do not envision the future, free of deprivation and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   In today's modern world, there is no reason why hundreds of
millions of people and families have to live in extreme poverty.
There is no reason why hundreds of millions of children have to
grow up with little hope for a brighter future. Given the impact of
modern technology, the unlimited growth and material resources and
surplus wealth, it is possible to ensure that every man, woman and
child experience a modicum of economic welfare.

SPORTS COLUMN: ROBINSON, GAINEY AND THE ETERNAL CHAMPIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late last week, Devils coach Larry Robinson praised Scott
Stevens by invoking a name: Bob Gainey. Robinson said Stevens, his
captain and star defenseman, reminded him of Gainey, a former
captain of the Montreal Canadiens. Robinson and Gainey played
together in Montreal in the mid-1970s through the 1980s, when the
franchise won six of its 24 Stanley Cup championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't speak a lot,'' Robinson said of Gainey and Stevens.
``But when they do, there is a lot of meaning there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gainey's reputation may not be widely known throughout
the entire sports world, his name is generally understood in hockey
to stand for leadership by example, for competitive integrity and
for quiet dignity. From an ex-Canadien of that era, comparison to
Gainey is high praise.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Gainey will compete for the Stanley Cup again this
week, wearing business suits instead of sweaty uniforms. But only
one will get his name engraved in silver this spring. Robinson
coaches a Devils team that qualified for the championship round by
beating Philadelphia in seven games in the Eastern Conference
finals. Gainey is the general manager of the Dallas Stars, the
defending champions who qualified again by ousting Colorado in Game
7 of the Western finals on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still talk from time to time,'' Robinson said of Gainey.
``I respect and cherish our friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   When the series begins at Continental Arena Tuesday night,
Gainey's Stars will be favored. Not only are they the defending
champions, but they also represent a conference that has won the
trophy the last four seasons. The last time an Eastern team won was
in 1995. That team was the Devils, and they were the underdogs that
spring to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   There are not many other direct connections between the Devils
and the Stars, but one of them is Kirk Muller. Now a veteran
role-player with Dallas at age 34, Muller began his career in 1984
with the Devils, with whom he became a high-scoring power forward
before being traded to Montreal in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the team I grew up with,'' he said of the Devils.
``I've got a lot of great memories going back. It will be an
interesting feeling going in there to play the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller also has a connection to Gainey and two Dallas teammates.
Like Gainey, he is a former captain of the Canadiens. So are Guy
Carbonneau and Mike Keane. The three of them work together as a
checking line. Between games 1 and 2, Keane, Muller, Carbonneau and
Gainey are expected to travel to Montreal to honor another former
Canadiens captain. They will attend a memorial service for Maurice
Richard, who died on Saturday of cancer at age 78.
</P>
<P>
   The mourning for Richard and the championship-round presence of
Robinson and Gainey provide a Memorial Day reminder of the temporal
nature of both legendary players and sports dynasties. For much of
the 20th century, spring and the hockey playoffs used to mean an
intense focus on Montreal. But the Canadiens have won just two
championships in the last two decades, and they have missed the
playoffs the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Like Robinson and Gainey, pieces of the last great Montreal
group _ the four consecutive championship teams from 1976 through
1979 _ are scattered about the league and doing well. Ken Dryden,
the former goalie, is the president of the Toronto Maple Leafs;
Scotty Bowman, the coach, runs a good team in Detroit. Other
ex-players like Serge Savard, Rejean Houle, Jacques Lemaire, Mario
Tremblay, Doug Jarvis, Doug Risebrough and Guy Lapointe have all
tried coaching and managing with varying degrees of success. Houle
is general manager of the Canadiens; Jarvis is a Dallas assistant
coach.
</P>
<P>
   So why bring up the Canadiens again in this way when they did
not even make the playoffs again? Precisely because they are so far
from here. It has been a good tournament this spring, and it might
be a great final round. But hockey as a whole, expanding wildly to
Sunbelt states and college football cities and Nascar counties,
needs and misses the mystique of the Montreal Canadiens in the
springtime. The appearance of leaders like Robinson and Gainey are
a constant reminder, evoking mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden, an occasional author who also wrote and narrated a
documentary television series, wrote of these players, that
franchise and this sport in his 1983 book, ``The Game.'' At the
time, his description of Gainey was an insightful observation about
a contemporary player on a great team. Seventeen years later, his
words seem like an amber memory from a franchise that has lost its
luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is such a thing as a `player's player,' it would be
Gainey,'' Dryden wrote. ``Someone who has the personal and playing
qualities that others wish they had, basic, unalterable qualities _
dependability, discipline, hard work, courage _ the roots of every
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you want a team game, where the goal is the team and
the goal is to win, you need a player with an emotional and
practical stake in a team game, a player to remind you of that
game, to bring you back to it whenever you forget it, to be the
playing conscience of the team. Like Bob Gainey.'' &QL;

BELTRE COULD BE HEADED FOR DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adrian Beltre's sprint down the first-base line
Saturday night could be his last for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers are expected to put the third baseman on
the disabled list unless there is a drastic improvement today in
the right hamstring he strained while running out a ground ball in
the sixth inning of Saturday's loss to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no moves today,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said Sunday. ``But it's pretty much a given unless there's a
difference between now and (Monday). He's not too good today.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre slowed down and grabbed his leg in apparent pain before
reaching first base in his third at-bat Saturday. He dropped to the
ground after passing the bag and had to be helped off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in some pain,'' Johnson said. ``He had problems sleeping
(Saturday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre is batting .269 with five home runs and 31 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino made the start at third base Sunday and reassured
the Dodgers by making key defensive plays such as throwing out a
runner at the plate in the third inning and running down a foul
ball for an out in the second. He also reached base twice,
including a fifth-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson did not want to think about a long-term replacement
until he knows more about Beltre's condition. For the near future,
Vizcaino and Dave Hansen are expected to split time at third.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Alex Cora would have been Johnson's first choice to
fill an open roster spot, but Cora has been bothered by a problem
with the muscles in his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of possibilities,'' Johnson said of who would be
called up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: Mike Fetters made his first appearance Saturday
since a sore right elbow put him on the disabled list May 4. The
right-hander, who has not allowed a run in 10 of his 12 appearances
this season, started where he left off by pitching a hitless and
scoreless eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Shawn Green took over the National League lead
for doubles when he doubled in the first inning Saturday for his
18th of the season. Green's first-inning double Sunday gave him 10
in the past 17 games, tying him with Eric Young of the Chicago Cubs
for for the major- league lead. He had four doubles last season
with Toronto. ... Reliever Allan Mills extended his
scoreless-innings streak to 8 by pitching a scoreless seventh
inning Saturday, lowering his ERA to 3.63. ... The Dodgers have
scored at least one run in the first inning in six consecutive
games, but the quick starts haven't equated to good finishes. The
Dodgers have lost four of their past five games when scoring in the
first.

IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY AS PRINCETON GOES FOR A TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOPHIA HOLLANDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ Coach Bill Tierney of Princeton scanned the
field uneasily Saturday and saw a strange mix of players in the
waning minutes of the men's lacrosse national semifinal against
Virginia. The coach saw untested Tigers: the freshmen Josh White
and Sean Hartofilis and the sophomore attack Brendan Tierney, his
son.
</P>
<P>
   He paused. There were two minutes remaining, and after trailing
the Cavaliers for 43 minutes, the Tigers were tied, 11-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you've got the people you want out there?'' he
asked his offensive coach, David Metzbower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, we're OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Brendan Tierney received a pass from White and
shoved a shot past Cavalier goalie Derek Kenney for his second goal
of the game, both in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney's son Brendan, who had been maligned in discussion
groups on the Internet for being too small and too slow to play
major college lacrosse and for capitalizing on his family
connection at Princeton, had won the game. The coach's other son,
the junior goalie Trevor Tierney, had preserved the victory with 14
saves.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his sons' performances, Tierney bowed his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try so hard when coaching your sons not to be too hard or
too soft on them,'' he said in a soft voice. ``It's a hard
situation. It's hard to put into words just what this means. It's
every coach's dream, every dad's dream, and it all came together
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tierneys and the rest of the third-seeded Tigers (12-2) will
meet No. 1 Syracuse (14-1) Monday at 10:55 a.m. in the national
title game. On April 23, the Orangemen raked the Tigers, 16-4. It
was the worst Princeton defeat in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The game took place the day after Princeton sewed up the Ivy
League championship by defeating Cornell. In that game the Tigers
lost their second-leading scorer, the sophomore attack B.J. Prager,
to injury. The reeling Tigers, unprepared and unsettled, staggered
into the Carrier Dome and got crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse said it was ready for the revamped Tiger team. ``This
is a new season,'' said the Orangemen senior Tim Byrnes, citing
Princeton's 5-0 record in title games. ``Were definitely playing a
different team now.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse is the only team Princeton has lost to in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament since 1992. Against all
other teams, the Tigers are 16-0. Against Syracuse, they are 3-3,
including a 7-5 loss last year in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 the third-seeded Tigers upset top-seeded Syracuse by
10-9 for their first NCAA title, despite not having any superstars.
The current no-name Tigers cling to that victory as proof of the
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an unbelievable bunch of overachievers,'' Trevor Tierney
said. ``When I was a freshman, we were the team to beat. Now
everybody is counting on us to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a team that has relied on his slick saves. His 4.64
goals-against average in Ivy League games was the lowest in league
play since 1981. Over all, he has a 7.57 goals-against average and
a .643 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   For Trevor Tierney, the decision to play for his father was an
easy one. Four years ago the coach was sitting at home when the
phone, the one he used for recruiting, rang. He was ready to talk
to a talented high school senior and roll out his best pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Coach Tierney?`` a young voice asked politely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's this?'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trevor Tierney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let you know that I'm coming to Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   They laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to get him,'' Tierney the coach said. ``We
weren't sure if we were going to.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brendan Tierney, the choice was not as easy. ``I kind of
wanted to get away for my whole life, like any normal teen-ager,''
he said. ``But it's hard to turn down such a great lacrosse program
and the best education in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So the brothers grit their teeth when their father yells at them
on the field, biting back responses they would blare out at home.
The father forces himself through painful moments, like when he
pulled Trevor after a poor first quarter last year against North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And they both know that when the coach screams on the sideline,
his face red, it is a field persona and nothing personal. Not
everyone knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think my dad is a raving maniac all the time,'' Trevor
Tierney said. ``But he's a great dad.''
</P>
<P>
   And not a bad coach, either. &QL;

COMMENTARY: STALKING THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A specter is stalking the Internet: the specter of
the Web stalker.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a credit card issuer letting merchants of porn in on
your buying habits or confiding your travel plans or medication
purchases to private investigators. It can be a thief using your
Social Security number to steal your identity and ruin your credit.
It can even be a criminal searching the Web for your photograph, as
has happened with tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, says an industry busily compiling dossiers on
every American. Leave it to us to police ourselves. Someday _ after
we have your personal history going back to grades in grammar
school _ we'll get around to restraining our intrusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after listening to false promises for five years, a
majority of the Federal Trade Commission _ Republicans dissenting _
roused itself to suggest a law providing Americans the rudiments of
privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report revealed that fewer than one in 10 Internet sites
that collect personal identifying data display the industry's
voluntary privacy seal. ``Self-regulation'' promised by the
mushrooming companies is a farce because they salivate at the heavy
money to be made in shadowing the users of computers, snooping into
their private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the FTC chairman, told Senate Commerce that Web
sites should be required by law to tell users in clear language
what information they collect (often surreptitiously, through
``cookies'' implanted in computers to track your movements), and to
whom they sell or trade your personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Such disclosure is long overdue; legal gobbledygook that passes
for privacy policy conceals by confusing. Pitofsky also recommends
that netties be given the right to see what's been collected about
them, just as consumers already have the right to read and correct
inaccuracies in their credit reports.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good, although the pro-snooping lobby protests that
this is much too onerous and would slow the e-commerce boom. But
then the FTC flinched from its responsibility to consumers: It
suggested merely that Web sites be obligated to offer consumers
``the choice'' of saying no to profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds protective, but Web stalkers know that baby step to be a
sham. Marketers call it ``opt out''; it puts the burden of
protecting privacy on the consumer. Most people have neither the
time, know-how or gumption to examine closely the uses to which
their data will be put; they are unlikely to take the initiative to
direct dozens of Web sites to not shadow and share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opt out'' is the marketer's public relations trick to provide
the pretense of choice. That was the sellout that Senate Banking
chairman Phil Gramm and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers
engineered, at the banking lobby's urging, to let banks get away
with new intrusions into depositors' financial privacy. We will
have to wait until Sen. Richard Shelby, the GOP's privacy champion,
becomes Banking Committee chairman before that is changed to ``opt
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The only genuine online privacy protection is informed, written
consent. That is when the burden of getting permission to pass
around personal data falls where it belongs, on the seller, who
must explain the deal and persuade or offer inducements to the
buyer to choose to give permission.
</P>
<P>
   Real privacy depends on who is required to do the asking. An
online privacy policy that fails to conclude with ``now that you
know exactly what we will do with your information, do you give
your consent?'' is a phony privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   At Senate Commerce last week, Democrats Jay Rockefeller and
Fritz Hollings offered a bill to require Web sites to ask such
consent. Chairman John McCain, in obeisance to evenhandedness, will
offer online hardliners further hearings next week to promise the
voluntary moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be taking on the most influential lobby in Washington
today,'' McCain tells me. He thinks the Rockefeller-Hollings
approach may be ``too encroaching'' on industry. Will he at least
move the FTC's watered-down recommendations? ``I'll introduce a
bill and we'll mark it up. But the way the Senate is being run
these days, it may never come to a floor vote. In my 14 years here,
I've never seen less done.''
</P>
<P>
   E-commercites: Until the online stalking and profiling is
stopped, go to a store and pay cash.

EXAMINING THE DIRECTION OF NEW YORK'S CRIME RATE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: With CRIME-DROP-REACT) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York preceded most cities in experiencing the
historic drop in crime that has swept across America's urban areas
and spurred an economic renaissance in many once-devastated
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But while crime in New York remains at a 30-year low, city
officials have spent considerable time and effort in the last year
trying to allay fears that the city may be headed back to the days
when more than 1,500 murders a year were not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, the city's murder rate had dropped to its
lowest point since 1964. But after a decline in homicides to 629 in
1998 from 2,245 in 1990, New York is beginning to record a slight
increase in murders, police records show.
</P>
<P>
   Although all other major categories of crime have continued to
decline, there have been 269 homicides this year, compared with 248
at the same point last year, police records show. And several
recent crimes _ a woman attacked by a man with a brick on a Midtown
street last fall, a spate of cabdriver killings and the murders of
five people last week at a Wendy's in Queens _ have drawn intense
media attention, suggesting that the perception, if not the
reality, of a dangerous city may be returning.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides, in fact, are down 62 percent compared with 1993,
police records show. ``When things are going well, sometimes the
shock is so large because you have told people they don't have to
worry about crime,'' said Thomas A. Repetto, chairman of the
Citizen's Crime Commission, a police watchdog group in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   While some law enforcement officials say domestic violence, gang
killings and a growth in the juvenile and young adult population
most often linked to murders are responsible for the two-year spike
in homicides, Andrew Karmen, a sociologist at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said, ``There is nothing you can
point to and say that `this is the culprit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Karmen said economic, demographic and other factors are probably
playing a role in the murder rate's increase, leading to questions
about the extent to which law enforcement has suppressed violence.
In New York, officials have credited smart and aggressive police
work for the crime rate's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that in many respects, the New York police
have become victims of their own success: the declining crime rate
has raised expectations and created statistical lows that will
serve to highlight any future increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of fear,'' Repetto said,
``because you've told yourself crime is not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yolanda Jimenez, the deputy police commissioner who handles
community affairs, said city officials have been doing more to
educate people about crime trends. ``We have had a challenging four
years,'' she said. ``But in spite and despite all that, the large
crime reductions have really paved the way for people do deal with
issues like quality of life and programs for young people.''

LUCENT ANGLING FOR OPTICAL NETWORKING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies Inc., North America's No. 1 maker of
communications equipment, is negotiating to acquire privately held
optical network technology company Chromatis Networks Inc. for as
much as $5.5 billion in stock, people close to the companies said
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While the talks could still fall apart amid wrangling over price
and lingering interest in Chromatis from other companies, including
Nortel Networks Corp. of Brampton, Ontario, one person close to the
negotiations said the likelihood of Chromatis completing a deal
with Lucent was ``over 90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lucent and Chromatis cement a deal, it will almost surely be
announced in time for the Supercomm 2000 communications equipment
trade show, which begins June 4 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Herndon, Va., Chromatis makes equipment that
consolidates data and voice communication traffic from within a
large corporation or among many smaller businesses, and then
transmits that information using light waves across high-capacity
fiber optic networks within cities.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber optic networking can transmit millions of bits, or
billions of bits, of information each second along fiber optic
cables using pulses of light emitted by lasers, rather than using
pulses of electricity traveling on copper cables that have more
limited capacity. Most of the advances in optical networking in
recent years have applied to long-distance networks that transmit
information among cities or across continents. Now, a number of
start-up companies, including Chromatis, are developing products to
add capacity and flexibility to optical networks within
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has long been in optical networking, but faces increasing
competition from such companies as Nortel, a long-time rival. While
Nortel and Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of Internet
communications equipment, have been aggressive in acquiring optical
networking companies, a deal for Chromatis would be Lucent's first
major acquisition of an optical systems company.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to Lucent and Chromatis the
negotiations are being driven by Lucent's senior executives,
including Chairman Richard A. McGinn, Patricia F. Russo, chief of
the unit that sells equipment to big communications carriers, and
Harry L. Bosco, head of the optical unit.
</P>
<P>
   But one person close to Lucent said that at least some of the
company's less-senior technology employees are lobbying against the
acquisition of Chromatis, suggesting instead Lucent acquire Astral
Point Communications, based in Chelmsford, Mass. Lucent already has
an agreement to sell Astral Point's equipment under the Lucent
brand. A Lucent spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the products from Astral Point and Chromatis are
meant to do similar things, but according to communications
equipment experts, the systems of each have particular strengths in
different areas.
</P>
<P>
   The systems created by Chromatis are thought by some experts to
be better at handling data transmitted in a format developed for
the Internet, called Internet protocol, while Astral Point's
systems considered more adept at handling data in a different
format, known as asynchronous transfer mode.
</P>
<P>
   Both formats split data into small pieces to transmit them
across networks. But while the data packets created by Internet
protocol are often different sizes, asynchronous transfer mode
breaks data into pieces of uniform size, often making data
formatted in asynchronous transfer mode easier to handle than data
formatted in Internet protocol ``packets.'' That is why
asynchronous transfer mode has become a standard format for most
telecommunications carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Data being transmitted using Internet protocol can ride on top
of data formatted in asynchronous transfer mode, meaning that an
e-mail message, formatted in Internet protocol, from Los Angeles to
New York might actually be carried across the continent on a
communications network that uses asynchronous transfer mode.
</P>
<P>
   While Astral Point's products might be more attractive to
communications carriers like regional Bell companies, the gear
developed by Chromatis might be more suitable for Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent already has a strong position selling equipment to
telephone companies, but it has not been as adept at selling
equipment to Internet service providers, which may explain why
Lucent's senior management seems to be pushing the acquisition of
Chromatis.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Nortel, executives from Sycamore Networks Inc. have
expressed interest in Chromatis, according to those close to the
company, but those discussions aren't as advanced as talks with
Lucent, they said.

PUSHING HARD TO MAKE `DETROIT TECHNO' ROCK ... IN DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Canada)   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Carl Craig is an international music star. Every
weekend he is somewhere in the world performing before sold-out
crowds of swooning teen-agers and 20-somethings. In Belgium and
Australia, fans clamor for his autograph and a glimpse of his hazel
eyes. In London and Paris, they wait hours to tell him how his
music has changed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But here in his hometown, the place that spawned the sound known
as Detroit techno, the 30-year-old Craig remains an unknown. For
nearly two decades, the city that set the '60s to music with the
Motown sound, has largely closed its ears to its other musical
offspring, the techno sound.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here barely regard the pulsating electronic drum
beats and synthesized rhythms that is techno as music. Few stores
stock the music, and only loyalists _ a few thousand folks in the
Detroit _ are willing to pay to see Craig, and the half-dozen
others who have made techno famous, behind their turntables,
keyboards and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Techno music has done as much for Detroit as Motown did,''
Craig said. ``People all over the world see Detroit as this
mythological music scene; they kiss the ground when they come here
because it's where it started. They have no idea it's still a
secret here.''
</P>
<P>
   But this holiday weekend, Craig is raising techno's profile by
presiding over the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, a free
three-day outdoor dance party on the city's waterfront. Some say
that holding the festival in Detroit is a gamble, considering the
music's relative obscurity in the city. About 85 percent of the CDs
and 12-inch vinyl singles produced by the more than 25 independent
record labels here are sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, as thousands of baby-toting and droopy
jeans-wearing music lovers endured showers to listen to the first
of 70 international acts performing on four stages, it appeared
that techno might finally become a hit at home.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna Prothero and her husband, Iron, drove two days from
Denver. The couple, in their 30s, discovered the music 11 years ago
while in London. ``You couldn't find a better dance party in
America if you paid for it,'' Prothero said of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Others came from countries like Japan, France, Germany and
Canada. Yosaku Hagiwara, 24, of Osaka, Japan, said, ``To see these
guys for free in the city where it all happened, I think is so
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The media also came. There are TV broadcasters from France,
London and Tokyo, and Canadian national radio is broadcasting
portions of the concert live.
</P>
<P>
   International journalists have not watched Detroit like this
since the 1980s when arsonists celebrated Halloween by torching
abandoned homes. That tradition, called Devil's Night, has since
been extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it out here,'' said DJ Hannah, scanning Saturday's
crowd. Hannah, a 28-year-old disc jockey from Britain, moved here
two years ago and is married to Craig. ``This music has brought the
world to Detroit. Asian, white, black, blue. They're all here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago Kenny Larkin, who is performing this weekend,
postponed his dream of becoming a comedian to play the music he
heard rising out of dark after-hour clubs in the 1980s. Larkin, of
Detroit, says that hometown acclaim is what he has most wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating to have to get on a plane every other
weekend and fly nine, 10 hours away to get respect,'' said Larkin,
32, who owns a record label and plays regularly in Madrid, Berlin
and Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he logged one million frequent flyer miles. Like most
techno artists, he does not discuss how much he makes from his
weekend jaunts or from record sales, which rarely exceed a few
thousand copies for any artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on MTV over there,'' Larkin. ``The record stores give as
much room to Detroit techno as they give to American pop and rock
music. It's sad we can't get people over here to see us as a
legitimate genre of music.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Craig hopes to attract a specific market: young
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   While white teen-agers have made electronic music popular _ and
in some cases infamous because of its association with illegal rave
parties and the drug ecstasy _ black teen-agers have mostly written
it off as suburban noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Techno is faceless,'' said Craig, who is black. ``They don't
know it's black music, that it was created by young black men in
the same way hip-hop was. We were more interested in mastering the
machines and seeing how far the music could go without being
typecast as something that came from the ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the festival succeeds or not, Craig says Detroit affords
techno artists one luxury other celebrities cannot claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jackson and people like Prince dream of going shopping
or out to dinner without someone trying to tear their clothes
off,'' he said. ``Nobody knows who we are. Yet.''

ASIA'S TYCOONS JOIN THE INTERNET RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In this densely packed city, where property is the
coin of the realm, Raymond Kwok is as close as one gets to royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kwok's 46th-floor office looks out on a forest of skyscrapers,
dozens of them built by his family. Across the harbor in Kowloon
are sawtooth rows of apartment houses, also built by the family.
The Kwoks' real estate empire is one of the largest in Asia, making
Raymond, 43, and his two brothers fabulously wealthy, even by Hong
Kong's baroque standards.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Kwok is worried about something that has
little to do with concrete, glass and steel. ``We always follow
closely what is happening in the U.S.,'' he said. ``In America, we
see how technology is changing business, how technology is creating
a lot of new businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet sweeps across the Pacific, Kwok believes
technology will unleash the same frenzy of sudden wealth and
disorienting change in Asia. If his family wants to keep its place
among Hong Kong's commercial elite, he says, it must join the
revolution. So Kwok, a Harvard MBA, has devised one of the most
ambitious Internet strategies of any old-line Asian company,
creating a diverse portfolio of Internet start-ups related to his
family's business.
</P>
<P>
   The Kwoks are one of several families of Asian tycoons who are
determined not to be left behind. From Taiwan to Thailand, the
region's most powerful families have started a blizzard of online
ventures. Whether their core businesses are in property,
telecommunications or banking, Asia's tycoons are seizing on the
Internet in hopes of expanding their reach and making even more
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Internet is transforming the way business is
done here and elsewhere in East Asia. With its emphasis on speed,
openness and collaboration, the Net is challenging traditional
Asian values of prudence and family control. Decisions, which used
to be made by the patriarch behind a veil of secrecy, are being
pushed down the ranks as Asian companies embrace Silicon
Valley-style management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic Asian family dynasty probably isn't the best
suited to succeed on the Internet,'' said Peter Yip, the chief
executive of Chinadotcom, one of Asia's first publicly traded
Internet companies. ``But I've been amazed by how quickly they've
learned the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sanguine. Despite their chameleonlike
adaptability, Asia's tycoons may have trouble making the leap into
cyberspace, critics say. For the last quarter-century, the tycoons
rode a wave of double-digit growth. In countries like Indonesia,
Thailand and Malaysia, cozy ties with governments sheltered them
from market forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys think the Internet will bring them prosperity for
the next 25 years,'' said Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong publisher who is
putting his media properties online and starting an Internet
shop-from-home service. ``But to unlearn the lessons of the last 25
years is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Lai (pronounced lie) predicts, the culture of the
Internet will erode the dominance of family dynasties in Asian
commerce. By making information widely available, the Web will
gradually devalue the networks of personal contacts _ known in
Chinese as guanxi _ amassed over decades.
</P>
<P>
   Kwok, though, thinks he can ride the technology tidal wave. He
spent much of 1999 in the United States, roaming around conferences
and quizzing entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered some online businesses that play to the strengths
of property owners. One is providing specially outfitted office
space to house computer servers. Another is creating Internet
sites, including chat rooms and bulletin boards, for the residents
of the apartment complexes owned by the Kwok family's company, Sun
Hung Kai Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Kwok packaged his collection of start-ups into a holding
company, Sunevision, which went public on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. While Kwok is the chairman, he has recruited an outside
executive to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind-set of a technology company is very different from a
property company,'' Kwok said. ``We needed to remove a lot of
baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jeffrey Koo Jr., the challenge was persuading his elders
that the Internet was more than a fad. Koo, 35, is a
fourth-generation member of a family that controls a vast empire in
banking, telecommunications, cement and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   In talking with classmates from the Wharton School in 1997, Koo
became convinced that his family had to lash its future to the
Internet. As president of the family's Chinatrust Commercial Bank,
Koo began taking baby steps online. But his father turned down his
first request for $10 million to finance an Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and his brothers were against me doing this because
they thought of it as a form of gambling,'' Koo said. ``When I
would talk excitedly about a new venture, they would look at me
blankly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Koo's case, the elders came around when Microsoft bought a 10
percent stake in his start-up, Gigamedia, a broadband entertainment
and information service. Earlier this year, Gigamedia became the
first Taiwan Internet company to go public on the Nasdaq exchange.
Although it was caught in Nasdaq's downdraft, it is still worth
well over $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Koo is developing online banking and a regional e-commerce
service to complement the family's 75 percent stake in Gigamedia.
Less than two years after his father gave the Internet the cold
shoulder, Jeffrey Jr. said, he now talks constantly about the
cyberworld.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   To some students of Asian business, this is merely a new chapter
in an old story. Ethnic Chinese families have traditionally
prospered by adapting to new circumstances. Kwok Tak-seng, the
patriarch of the Kwok family, started as a trader in southern
China. By the 1950s, he had migrated to Hong Kong and become the
local agent for the YKK zipper company of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing more opportunity in property than zippers, Kwok began
building apartment houses. By the 1980s, he was a leading real
estate developer. Kwok died in 1990, but under his three sons, Sun
Hung Kai grew into a conglomerate with interests in toll roads,
cargo handling and mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing about old-economy companies is that they have
profits and cash flow,'' said Raymond's older brother, Thomas, who
oversees Sun Hung Kai's real estate business. ``But old-economy
companies need new-economy ideas to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their rock-solid stature, however, Asia's tycoons face
challenges from a host of upstarts. Lai, the publisher and a
self-styled maverick, offers himself as an example. Last year, he
started a venture that lets customers order groceries and other
goods by phone or over the Internet. The company, adMart, delivers
from its warehouses, cutting out the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the middleman for many of these goods is Li
Ka-shing, a billionaire who owns one of the two local supermarket
chains. When Lai's delivery business began to pinch Li's stores, he
canceled his company's advertising in Apple Daily and Next
magazine, the outspoken newspaper and weekly magazine at the heart
of Lai's company.
</P>
<P>
   For Lai, the lost revenue has hurt. But after years of tweaking
Hong Kong's establishment in his newspaper, Lai relishes mounting a
frontal assault on its most powerful local businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never take on Li Ka-shing before,'' Lai said. ``But if
I'm riding on the back of a huge market force like the Internet,
then even he can't stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Internet is the second revolution to rumble
through Asia recently. In 1997 and 1998, the regional financial
crisis brought many family empires to the brink of ruin. Even in
Hong Kong, property prices plunged by more than half, and are only
now recovering.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, many Asian governments took steps to clean up
their banks, tighten commercial regulations and force companies to
improve their disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the crisis, Asian firms regarded financial disclosure
and minority shareholders as a necessary irritant,'' said Peter
Churchouse, the co-head of research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in Hong Kong. ``Now they know they can't get away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Asia's tycoons were humbled, the crisis did not dull
their entrepreneurial instincts. Watching start-ups like Amazon.com
and Ebay become sensations in America, the tycoons saw a chance to
make a quick score. Virtually every conglomerate rushed out an
Internet unit.
</P>
<P>
   Li Ka-shing started e-commerce ventures through his two
companies, Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings. He also
backed a Chinese-language portal, Tom.com, which prompted a
near-riot among investors when it went public last February.
Tom.com tumbled in the global sell-off of technology stocks. But
thanks to Li's gold-plated reputation, it still trades above its
offering price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hand it to the conglomerates, they've maintained
their position in a radically different economy,'' said Mark Duff,
the founder and chief executive of Boom.com, an online
stock-trading company here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Duff and other independent entrepreneurs fear that the
tycoons are colonizing Asia's cyberspace. They say that the family
companies can soak up money and talent that could have gone to more
daring ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the tycoon-backed ventures are often
unimaginative. Sunevision's concept of providing warehouses for Web
servers was pioneered in the United States by Exodus. Tom.com
promoted itself as a mega-portal for Chinese audiences around the
world. When it went public, its Web site consisted of a home page
and links that went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the initiatives in Asia are extremely shallow,'' Duff
said. ``But the brand names of the families are so strong that it
doesn't matter. They get funded.''
</P>
<P>
   A few executives are trying to force deeper changes in Asian
culture. Richard Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, is building an office
park here. The 64-acre complex, known as Cyberport, is supposed to
offer tenants like Microsoft, IBM and Softbank a campus-like
environment where ideas can be swapped and new businesses hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Just 33 years old, Li is the brashest Internet entrepreneur in
Hong Kong and a symbol of Asia's headlong flight into cyberspace.
His two-year-old company, Pacific Century Cyberworks, recently won
a $36 billion takeover battle for Hong Kong's main telephone
company. Li is also building a satellite-delivered Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   Li epitomizes the contradiction in Asia's version of the
Internet. A scion of the Li dynasty, he has created a cyber-age
company crackling with the energy of employees hoping to strike it
rich on stock options. The company's latest conquest has been
likened to America Online's acquisition of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Li would never have triumphed unless the Bank of China
arranged a $12 billion syndicated loan to finance the deal. And
analysts agree that Li would never have landed such a loan without
his father's connections.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise with the Cyberport. It may plant the seed for a fertile
technology culture in Hong Kong. Yet rivals of the Li family have
criticized the project because it was awarded to Pacific Century by
the Hong Kong government in a back-room deal.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the tycoons stop short of extolling Asian values,
but they make no apologies for their privileges. ``There's a blend
of Western and Asian elements here,'' said Alex Arena, Li's top
lieutenant. ``It's not a question of being like the U.S. It's a
question of cherry-picking from the U.S.''

FOR STARS, IT'S ALL ABOUT RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Dallas Stars will never forget their
first trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, but they wouldn't have missed
this one for the respect.
</P>
<P>
   Their first Stanley Cup was for fun. This one is for a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the respect of winning a second championship that
everybody that wins two gets,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``There's a great feeling when you win two or three years or
whatever. ... You don't just want to be a flash in the pan. Nobody
likes to be a one-hit wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the dance now for sure. We've given ourselves an
opportunity. We're relatively healthy, and now we're four wins away
from reaching our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the playoffs started April 12, the Stars have been
counting down the number of victories it takes to win the Stanley
Cup. They began with 16 written on a drawing board in their
dressing room at Reunion Arena. After Saturday night's 3-2 victory
against the Colorado Avalanche in Game 7 of the Western Conference
Finals, the Stars' magic number is four.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Stars have lived up to their battle cry of ``The Cup
Stays Here.'' Yesterday, the Stars left for New Jersey, where they
will play the Devils in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals tomorrow
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we wanted to do at the start of the year _
reach the Stanley Cup,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``We're
one more step closer. We're at the final stage, the final series.
It's something that we were gunning for, something we wanted to do,
and we're there now. Now, obviously, we're there to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup is overflowing with repeat winners, but since
1985, there have been only three. Edmonton won in 1987 and '88.
Pittsburgh took the Cup in 1991 and '92, and Detroit was a
back-to-back winner in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are out to leave their mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance that very few people have the ability to say
they accomplished,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``Pittsburgh
and Detroit did it in the '90s, and we fought hard and put
ourselves in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, for the second consecutive year, the Stars won the
Presidents' Trophy for the NHL's best regular-season record,
posting a franchise-high 114 points. Dallas followed that with a
16-7 postseason record, including beating the Buffalo Sabres in six
games in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was anything fluky about it last year. We
were the No. 1 team in the league all year long and won in the
playoffs,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``It's a relief to
get back to this point. No doubt about it; you see these teams in
the Western Conference so much all season long and to be standing
alone after it's over is a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were expected to win the Stanley Cup last year. This
year, no one was even sure they would make it through the regular
season still standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of injuries, and a lot of people didn't think
we'd make the playoffs at the beginning of the year,'' Stars
defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``But we knew in the end we would be
a good team. A lot of what we are playing for now is respect.''
</P>
<P>
   This season was filled with turbulence. The Stars lost 395
man-games to injury, and four teams finished with more points than
Dallas' 102.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is same time, this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were on a mission,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau
said. ``There was nothing that could stop us. Every game was great
games for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I guess we just keep going from what we did in the
season _ lots of injuries, the pressure of winning the Cup last
year. We've had a lot of ups and downs. ... We didn't play our best
game every game, but we found ways to win games. That's what good
teams do.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues won the Presidents' Trophy, and the
Avalanche was the hottest team entering the playoffs with a 12-2-1
regular-season record after acquiring veteran defenseman Raymond
Bourque from Boston. Still, it was the Stars that won the Campbell
Bowl as Western Conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars disposed of the Edmonton Oilers and the San Jose
Sharks in five games each, then shook the Avs in the seventh game
Saturday night. Dallas jumped to a 3-0 lead early in the second
period, and then hung on for a one-goal victory when Bourque's shot
deflected off Adam Deadmarsh and clanked off a post and out of
harm's way with 12 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought we'd fold,'' Stars forward Mike Keane
said. ``This team hasn't folded up all year. With the injuries
we've had to our big guns, we still kept winning games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of people gave us any credit, so we bore
down and won the game, and now we're in the final two, and that's
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who won the Cup in 1995, want what the Stars have.
The Stars want what the Canadians and the Islanders and others
have. In the NHL, once is not enough for a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that not many players in their career have an
opportunity to win back-to-back Cups, and we have an opportunity
here to do something really special as a group. That's the goal,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``Years from now, you can say we had a group of
guys here who won the Stanley Cup again.''

FALSE BIRTH CERTIFICATES LET IMMIGRANTS OUTWIT SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Texas, Ky.)  By RENWICK McLEAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After making it safely to the United States, Hans
Peter Bieri faced the same problem that millions of illegal
immigrants have faced over the years. He had to convince employers,
government agencies and others that he was here legally.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before Bieri discovered the little secret that
for years has helped some illegal immigrants stay in the United
States: In some states, like California, it is possible to adopt
the identity of aU.S. citizen by simply walking into the right
government office and paying a few dollars for someone's birth
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   So Bieri, a Swiss citizen, found a California native close to
him in age and, knowing little more than his name and birth date,
got a copy of his birth certificate from the local county clerk's
office. Then, using the birth certificate as identification, Bieri
got a California driver's license and later, during a visit to
Hawaii, a U.S. passport.
</P>
<P>
   Now he had three documents backing up his claim to U.S.
citizenship, and he began building a new life. He married, became a
father and settled near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It all fell apart last October _ 11 years after Bieri arrived in
the country _ when the State Department's Diplomatic Security
Service acted on a call from the man whose identity Bieri had
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bieri was caught, his case showed why experts
considered the birth certificate to be the soft underbelly of
America's interior defenses against illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service says it seizes dozens
of fraudulent birth certificates every day, either counterfeit
copies or valid ones acquired by impostors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth certificate is really the document of choice'' for
illegal immigrants, said James R. Hesse, chief intelligence officer
at the agency's Forensic Document Laboratory. ``It shows both
identity and nationality, and that's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Hesse said, the birth certificate can open the
door to other documents coveted by illegal immigrants, like Social
Security cards, driver's licenses and passports. The birth
certificate is the document most frequently presented as evidence
of U.S. citizenship by first-time applicants for a passport, the
State Department says.
</P>
<P>
   California, home to 40 percent of the 5 million to 6 million
illegal immigrants that the immigration service estimates live in
the United States, is particularly vulnerable to birth certificate
fraud. An official at the Ventura County recorder's office said
that to get a certified copy of someone's birth certificate, ``you
just need to know the name on the birth certificate and the date of
birth.'' The cost is $12, and the wait about 15 minutes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The process is even easier in other counties. The Web site for
Butte County in Northern California simply says to ``give as much
information as possible'' along with the $12 fee when requesting a
birth certificate, which can be done by mail.
</P>
<P>
   While studying the issue as a member of the Commission on
Immigration Reform, a bipartisan group formed by Congress in 1990
to study U.S. immigration policy, Michael Teitelbaum was so shocked
to hear how easy it was to get someone's birth certificate in
California that he decided to try it himself.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the county clerk-recorder's office in Orange County
and requested the birth certificate of someone he knew who was born
in the area. Within 15 minutes, he had a certified copy of the
person's birth certificate. ``I basically walked out of there
shaking my head in disbelief,'' said Teitelbaum, now a program
director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a nonprofit
philanthropic institution in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now that office says that people asking for birth certificates
in person may be asked to show picture identification. But all that
is needed by mail is ``the person's full name, date of birth, and a
credit card number,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   California is not the only state with such loose restrictions on
access to birth records. An official at the Office of Vital
Statistics in Frankfort, Ky., said that a name and birth date were
enough to get a copy of a Kentucky native's birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, however, the full names of both parents,
including the mother's maiden name, must be provided to get a birth
certificate. But critics say that the system is only as strong as
its weakest link, because a birth certificate from a state with
loose restrictions can be used to establish residency and
employment eligibility in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the strictest states, the information required for
obtaining a birth certificate can often be found easily, critics
say. One way is to scan the obituary pages of a local newspaper and
write down the background information on a person of the
appropriate age. Since most states do not match death and birth
records, or do so slowly, experts say, illegal immigrants assuming
the identity of the recently deceased face little risk of
detection.
</P>
<P>
   The fraudulent acquisition of valid birth certificates is only
part of the problem. The INS says that birth certificates are
vulnerable to counterfeiting, largely because there is no single
national standard. Instead of one version, thousands of different
but valid birth certificates flow from the more than 7,000 local
and state agencies authorized to issue them.
</P>
<P>
   That makes detection of counterfeits difficult, Hesse said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Commission on Immigration Reform recommended that
the federal government adopt one standard design for all certified
copies of birth certificates. Almost six years later, no such
design exists.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also recommended a nationwide system for matching
birth and death records, limiting the types of birth certificates
accepted by federal agencies, standardized application forms for
birth certificates and computerized storage of birth records by
each state. None of those recommendations have been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Hill, the head of the commission, said the
``foot-dragging'' by Congress and the Clinton administration on
birth certificate reform was ``indicative of a sort of attitude of
neglect for overall reform'' that would prevent unauthorized
employment of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the INS, under prodding from Congress, has been
meeting with state and local officials during the last year to
determine how to regulate the issuance of birth certificates. Susan
Martin, the director of the Institute for the Study of
International Migration at Georgetown University, said that if
Congress expected to achieve real reform, it needed to provide more
financial support for the agency. The movement toward reform has
begun, she said, and ``now it's an issue of putting serious
resources into it.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   POLTAVA, Ukraine _ The rolling
farmland that unfolds in all directions from here is so famous for
its rich, black soil that the Germans carted some of it home during
World War II.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This land was also the battlefield on which Russia's Peter the
Great stunned Europe's monarchs by defeating the fabled Swedish war
machine of Charles XII.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a burly agronomist with a Cossack's mustache is gaining a
reputation for doing what many Communist overlords of agriculture
repeatedly failed to do in the 20th century _ making money by
farming this land.
</P>
<P>
   Across a landscape of collapsing state farms that are the most
prominent feature of post-Soviet agriculture, a small number of
entrepreneurial private farmers, like Vasily T. Sluga, are taking
advantage of the sporadic land reforms in Ukraine to show others
the way to a more productive future.
</P>
<P>
   Their success is by no means certain in a country the size of
France where the official economy has contracted by half in a
decade, where the population is producing less food and importing
more, and where much the transition economy is impossible to
measure or predict because it occurs outside government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Just to borrow money for seeds and diesel fuel for farm
equipment, Sluga must entice credit from local oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sluga says there are dozens, if not hundreds, of new
entrepreneurial farmers like him in central Ukraine. In the
capital, Kiev, Western officials say that anecdotal data is
trickling in to suggest that private agriculture is developing, if
not yet flourishing, on the fertile land that was once the
breadbasket of the Russian empire.
</P>
<P>
   Sluga, 43, has no special business training for the life he is
carving out for himself in the wreckage of 70 years of Soviet
collectivization of Ukrainian farming. He receives no investment
from Western tycoons, no grants from aid organizations, and no
advice from Western agriculture experts. But nearly a decade ago,
Sluga said he realized that Ukraine's state farms were doomed and
would not survive the transition from Communism, and he undertook a
plan to build a private farming business with brawn and wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life forces us to find ways,'' Sluga said recently in an
interview in his small brick home in the village of Chutovo, about
30 miles east of here. ``Under the conditions of agriculture today,
no one is left to give orders from above and so everything depends
on the individual farmer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sluga began to run things himself in April 1993 after the first
tentative land reforms in Ukraine allocated 5 acres to each member
of the country's farm collectives swamped with debt and unable to
pay wages and pensions on time, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Today Sluga has 1,730 acres under production, with 20 employees
and a fleet of tractors, combines and a harvester, all of which he
parks in the garage of the bankrupt ``Soviet Ukraine'' collective
farm, the leaders of which have been only too happy to sell off
their equipment and buildings as Sluga needs them.
</P>
<P>
   The state farm's best foreman, Nikolai V. Ogiyko, is now Sluga's
foreman. ``People realize now that they work for themselves,'' said
Ogiyko, ``that we are on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sluga bought the state farm's harvester, he also recruited
its 72-year-old driver, Ivan Nimchin, who remains an avowed
Leninist, but who now contributes his harvesting skills to Sluga's
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the old system was better,'' said Nimchin, ``but it is
nice to get a paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sluga pooled his 5 acres of land with the plots from
five of his friends, and together they planted 30 acres with sugar
beets and potatoes. A second land reform decree from Ukraine
national government that year ordered state farms to make up to 10
percent of their land available for private farmers. Again pooling
his land with several friends, Sluga had more than 350 acres ready
for planting by the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lands that were given out were usually the worst lands
on the commune, on the slopes or far away from the town, but we
were lucky,'' said Sluga. ``The land we got was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fledgling private farming cooperative had no money for
seeds or equipment, and borrowed about $10,000 from a regional
farmers' organization at interest rates of more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The farming venture might have ended then, but for additional
assistance from a now defunct government fund to support farmers,
and deft management. With the loan, the farmers bought a harvester,
two new tractors, one second-hand tractor, fuel and seeds. They
planted winter wheat that fall, and in the spring of 1994, barley,
rye, corn, millet, sunflower seeds and sugar beets. With their
first harvest they paid off their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Sluga's business plan was relentlessly simple: eliminate
overhead costs, hire employees with multiple skills, reinvest all
profits in the business and handle negotiations and contracts
himself. The farm's office is a closet-size room in Sluga's modest
brick home. His wife raises chickens, rabbits and three pigs in a
muddy courtyard strewn with farm equipment and guarded by a
boisterous German shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is angry at me because I have not finished my own
house yet,'' he said. ``All our money goes to the business.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sluga's first year of farming for himself, Ukraine's economy
was in free fall, with hyperinflation that reached 10,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was surviving in his own way,'' Sluga said, ``and
somehow we managed to stay afloat,'' by bartering crops for fuel
and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   As he had learned in agricultural school, Sluga rotated his
crops and invested his profits in herbicides and fertilizers at a
time when state farms were cutting corners, scaling back and
surrendering more and more acreage to weeds. As their yields and
output declined, Sluga's increased.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after his first successful harvest, Sluga split with
his four partners in a disagreement about how to invest their
profits, but within two years, ``some of my former partners rented
their land to me because they could not continue on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Sluga's farm holdings stabilized at about 300 to
400 acres, and although he was making money, his profit margins
were thin.
</P>
<P>
   But last December, President Leonid Kuchma issued the most
sweeping land reform decree to date, privatizing all state farms,
dividing the ownership of the land equally among the farm members
and withdrawing state support. A whole new opportunity opened up
for Sluga's April Farm enterprise, named for the month it was
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that happened was that last winter, the Soviet
Ukraine commune made a proposition for me to become their
chairman,'' he said. ``They wanted me to take over because it was
the worst commune in the whole district and one of the worst in the
region, and they had seen that my farming business was very much in
order.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The former state farm, with 3,700 acres of land and debt of
$360,000, was headed for bankruptcy. So Sluga made a
counterproposal. The farm could fend for itself, he said, but he
would rent land from 120 members, more than 1,200 acres in all, and
he would pay rent to the owners with shares of his harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, he would avoid becoming entangled in the farm's
debts, and probably get all of the farm's land and equipment within
two years.
</P>
<P>
   The farm accepted his offer, in part because no one there had
been paid for five months.
</P>
<P>
   Sluga tripled his holdings to more than 1,700 acres, and in need
of yet more capital in a cash-starved land.
</P>
<P>
   Sluga went to a newly rich oligarch and borrowed more than
$10,000 to buy seeds, fuel and additional farming equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that I am running a very big risk in taking
another loan, because if we don't receive a good harvest all that I
have is not enough to repay this debt. So we have done everything
we could and the rest depends on the weather. If we are lucky, it
will rain.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEMENS NO LONGER IN COMMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The celebrated pitching matchup between Pedro
Martinez and Roger Clemens took place at Yankee Stadium Sunday
night. There was reason, however, for questioning whether it should
have been so celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   The Pedro Martinez half of the matchup in the Boston Red Sox
game with the Yankees was beyond question. The doubt, then, must
have been about Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they want to acknowledge it or not, Clemens has given
the Yankees reason to question his place on the Martinez plateau of
pitching. His 14-10 record and 4.60 earned run average were nothing
to celebrate last season, and the 4-4 record and 4.26 ERA he took
into Sunday night's game had not won any raves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his pitching in a season and a third with the Yankees
has raised more questions than it has provided satisfaction. The
Yankees still aren't certain what to think. Neither they nor anyone
else, though, was prepared to jump to any negative conclusions
about the 37-year-old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Asked, for example, if Clemens had lost something, Mike Stanley,
the Red Sox first baseman Sunday night, said: ``I wouldn't tell him
that. Every time somebody tells him he can't do something, he goes
out and proves them wrong. He was no longer wanted in this
organization and went out and won two Cy Youngs. He almost relishes
the fact that people think he can't do it anymore. I'm going to
give him every ounce of respect that I've ever had for him when he
was at the top of his game because he's still a presence on the
mound and still knows how to get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said he had no intention of underestimating Clemens for
this confrontation. ``You take your `A' game out against Roger,''
he said. ``You go out thinking he's going to be the five-time Cy
Young award winner that he is. You have to put just as much
concentration and effort into your at-bats.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin, the Red Sox third baseman, said he had lost no
respect for the man who was his teammate in Boston for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he's getting a little bit older now, but he is still
throwing 95, 96 miles an hour, still throwing hard,'' Valentin
said. ``I still think he is Roger Clemens. He's still one of the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentin offered an insight into why Clemens might not get
the same results now as he did in his Cy Young years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more than anything he's having trouble with his
command,'' Valentin said. ``That's the only thing I think is
different. When he throws his off-speed pitches, sometimes he
misses and they're up in the zone, and that's when he can get hit.
He falls behind hitters and he walks hitters. He's walking more
hitters these days, I think, than he ever has in his career. I
think that's a very big factor. Why is that happening? I don't have
that answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Red Sox faced Clemens they beat up on him in
the league championship series last October. They knocked him out
one batter into the third inning. Stanley, with a single, was that
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to beat him like we did last year in the
playoffs,'' Stanley said, ``is if he's off. If he's on his game,
then you're scratching to get a couple. He obviously wasn't on top
of his game. I'd hate to sit here and think it was all to our
credit, that he was on top of his game and we were better than he
was. That's not the way it works with a quality pitcher like
Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Clemens was off his game, giving up five early
runs in the park where he had won so many games and before the fans
who had cheered so hard for him for so many seasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also pitched in that celebrated matchup. When he left
the game, after seven innings, he did so on his own terms. He had
allowed the Yankees only two hits and he had struck out 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give hitters a lot of credit,'' Valentin said.
``Roger's been in the league for a long, long time. When hitters
face you year after year, they get to know you a little better in
how you throw your slider, how you throw your split-finger and so
on. Pitchers have to make adjustments. Give hitters credit. They
make adjustments. He's not going to be as dominant as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 50 pitchers who had made eight or more starts entering play
yesterday, Clemens ranked 17th in earned run average and was tied
with eight others for 12th in victories. The batting average his
opponents had compiled against him, .261, was nearly 100 points
higher than the league low of .167 against Martinez. Clemens had
permitted a ratio of 13.8 base runners per nine innings, Martinez
7.8. Clemens, a five-time league leader in strikeouts, including
three recent years in a row (1996-98), had struck out 57; Martinez
had struck out a league-leading 95.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup, then, appeared to be celebrated in names only,
certainly not in results. &QL;

COMMENTARY: DOUBLE-DECKERS' DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whatever happened to zero tolerance?
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday one of the colorful double-decker buses owned by New
York Apple Tours struck and killed a 71-year-old actor who was
crossing the street near his home on West 45th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators said the driver, who was making a turn from
Ninth Avenue onto 45th Street, did not have a license to operate
the bus. They said the victim, Randolph Walker, had the right of
way when he was hit. They said the bus, which was not carrying
tourists, had no right to even be on 45th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the reckless, lawless world of New York Apple Tours.
There are quite a few New Yorkers, including some public officials,
who felt it was just a matter of time before the company's
repeatedly demonstrated contempt for the law would result in a
fatality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, this company needs to be out of business,
off the street,'' said Christine Quinn, a City Council member from
Manhattan. ``It's a complete renegade business. There is no law out
there that they have any respect for. They ignore traffic
regulations. They've ignored the environmental protection laws.
They've been found guilty of switching the license plates on their
buses. They've had numerous violations for drivers driving without
a license, or without the proper license. You name it, they've
broken it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple's pollution-spewing buses have been cited for
many hundreds of violations over the past few years and have been
involved in at least 140 accidents, according to city officials.
Several people have been injured by the buses, which frequently are
operated in a reckless manner. The city's Department of Consumer
Affairs has been trying to revoke the company's license to operate
since October.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints against the company have come in huge waves since it
began operating its popular tours of the city's neighborhoods in
1992. In August 1995 the company paid a $100,000 fine and agreed to
oust a top executive after it was accused of illegally switching
permits at state inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year New York Apple officials admitted to federal
investigators that the company had lied about the ages of its
vehicles to avoid meeting federal safety and environmental
standards. The company agreed to pay an $800,000 fine, but the fine
has not yet been paid.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Thomas Duane, who has been battling Apple Tours for
years, said: ``On this federal thing, the Justice Department had
brought a suit against them because they lied about how old their
buses were, because antique buses are not subjected to the same
emissions standards as newer buses. Then, when we got a ruling
against them, the way they tried to cure that was by installing
even older engines in their newer buses. Hello. I think what the
Department of Environmental Protection wanted was for them to
upgrade to less polluting engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean everything they do, they just scam and lie _ they're
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews Quinn and Duane expressed outrage over an
illegal maintenance operation that Apple Tours set up a few years
ago next to an elementary school in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were storing noxious liquids and running blow torches
outside the school windows,'' Duane said. ``They didn't have the
necessary permits. It was completely illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They eventually had to close that down,'' Quinn said. ``But
it's always something with this company. There's the poor, poor
quality of the buses and the amount of pollution that goes out into
the neighborhoods. There's the reckless driving, the constant
violation of the three-minute idling law, the use of streets that
they are prohibited from using, the double- and triple-parking _ it
just kind of goes on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   After Walker was killed the city stepped up its effort to shut
down Apple Tours. Even as this was happening, the company ran into
more trouble. On Tuesday one of its operators was charged with
driving with a suspended license. And on Thursday, just 45 minutes
before the start of a hearing that could lead to the loss of the
company's license, one of its double-decker buses crashed into the
rear of a postal truck.
</P>
<P>
   The time to shut down Apple Tours is now _ before someone else
is killed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert L. Johnson remembers well a scene from his
early days in cable television. In a bar with a number of cable
executives, he was, as usual, the only black person in the group.
An executive, a man Johnson had known for years, told a tasteless
joke about the Ku Klux Klan and the miniseries ``Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscing in his office at his company, BET Holdings Inc.,
Johnson's point in retelling the story was not its questionable
humor. It was how as an African-American in about the upper
echelons of corporate America he often found himself confronted
with a choice. Should he express his hurt or anger at racial
slights? Or should he bury them for the sake of getting ahead?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in business you swallow things that you don't like just
because I'm trying to get this deal,'' he said. ``So, OK, fine.
I'll laugh at your jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So sure, you swallow those kinds of things,'' he continued.
``Sometimes it does go overboard and you've got to decide at what
point do you draw the line, and say this is beyond deal-making;
this is beyond trying to sell your product.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bar that day, Johnson said, he chuckled at the
colleague's joke and told one of his own. If the joke bothered him
he wasn't about to show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't internalize a lot of the kind of stuff that comes at
me from the standpoint of white society,'' he said. ``I've adopted
a saying, `Welcome to the NFL,''' the National Football League.
``In the NFL, if you run into the line, you're going to get hit.
That's why you put on a helmet and shoulder pads. If you're a black
American, expect to get hit, and don't start crying when somebody
comes up and hits you.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy _ keep emotions in check, don't let issues of
race get in the way of the deal _ has helped Johnson, 54, become
one of the country's most successful black entrepreneurs, indeed
one of the most successful business executives of any race. In the
last 20 years he has used his business savvy and his ability to
attract white investors with deep pockets to build Black
Entertainment Television _ and later BET Holdings _ into a
entertainment giant worth, he says, more than $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He also used his corporate connections to place himself in the
position to become one of the few African-Americans ever to own a
commercial airline. As part of the proposed merger between United
Airlines and US Airways, Johnson would acquire a spinoff of US
Airways' operations _ including routes, planes and personnel _ at
Reagan National Airport in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But if Johnson has put his ties with corporate chieftains to
good use, they too may have looked to see what they can glean from
their friendship with him. It was Steven Wolfe, the chairman of US
Airways, who proposed that Johnson acquire the airline's operations
in Washington, which will be called DC Air. Several analysts have
hinted that such a move might make the Justice Department reluctant
to block US Airways' merger with United since that would also mean
blocking an African-American from acquiring an airline.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has also come in for criticism from some black
intellectuals and civil rights advocates who see him as a black
business executive who subordinates racial pride and solidarity to
making a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectuals sometimes grumble that BET, perhaps the most
recognizable African-American brand name since the days of Motown,
is filled with mindless and salacious music videos rather than
meaningful black programming. Johnson is mercilessly skewered in
the black syndicated comic strip ``Boondocks,'' one of whose
characters has described the cable network as not particularly
black and certainly not entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   To Johnson, this is all mere carping. He is filling the market's
demands. If the videos he broadcasts did not bring in an audience,
he would put on what people did want to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that video right there,'' Johnson said, pointing to the
wall of his office where a television screen showed a BET video of
women in skimpy bikinis writhing suggestively. ``I didn't make that
video. I had nothing to do with it. I didn't know that video was
being made. They sent it to us because we have a mutually
beneficial relationship. That artist wants to be seen. I want to
put on programs. Somebody's watching that video right now. And
because somebody's watching, the advertiser's going to put some
money in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Believe me, if they send me videos with no nude
women, if that's all they made, that's all I'd play. I don't pick
up the phone and say, `Hey, give me some more bump and grind.'''
</P>
<P>
   That he can easily shrug off the criticism of black people and
the slights of whites is a testament to what Johnson believes is
his complete comfort and confidence in himself. His background of
growing up in Freeport, Ill., a town that was about 90 percent
white, attending the University of Illinois and Princeton
University has made him comfortable dealing with whites.
</P>
<P>
   Moving between worlds, while at times painful and daunting, is
something he counsels young black people to experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I think in a world that's shrinking every day, the
smartest thing to do is get as much exposure as you can,'' he said.
``If you can interact with other people and other cultures, then do
so. Get to know them; get to know how they think; get to know their
value system, their sense of humor; get to know what motivates them
and what intimidates them. The more you know about people, the more
comfortable you can be with them and the more you can communicate
with them.''

STUDENTS GET EARLY TEACHING EXPERIENCE IN KANSAS CITY CLASSROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In July, aspiring teacher Sarah Michael will
get her degree in education from the University of Missouri-Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   By then she will also have a line on her resume that might say
just as much about her preparation for teaching elementary school:
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience: Fifth-grade teacher, Moore Elementary, Kansas
City, Mo., School District, 1999-2000 school year.''
</P>
<P>
   In an internship program, Michael and almost 30 other college
students have taught full time in the district this year while
taking college classes. All the students are from UMKC except for
two who are from Park University.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Oliver, former dean of the UMKC School of Education,
created the program. He wanted to help solve the district's teacher
shortage and give the college students intense exposure to
classroom teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a whole yearful of experience,'' Michael said.
``You don't get this in a classroom with a professor, or in student
teaching without a whole classroom to yourself. There wasn't
anything better to get experience right now.''
</P>
<P>
   UMKC and district officials have declared the program a success.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for the program, the Kansas City schoolchildren
probably would have had a series of substitute teachers. Instead,
they learned from fresh, motivated college students.
</P>
<P>
   The education students lived the life of a teacher, instructing
and disciplining children, meeting with parents, grading papers and
planning lessons. They were paid $15,000 to $25,000. The higher
salaries went to interns who received specialized state
certification.
</P>
<P>
   The district will hire many of the graduates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   UMKC and the district will continue the program, although with a
couple of changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it work? I think it worked well,'' said Alsia Cunningham,
the district's director of consolidated federal programs, who
oversaw the program. ``Did we have problems? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue was one.
</P>
<P>
   After teaching all day, the interns had to rush to UMKC for
their classes. Then there was homework and lesson planning, which
left little or no free time or family time.
</P>
<P>
   Three participants dropped out early on. UMKC officials are
unsure whether exhaustion caused them to quit, but they say it
probably played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Trasi Pruitt said she initially worried that she would be
overwhelmed by taking classes and teaching 21 fourth-graders at
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, my gosh, this is going to be too much,' '' she
said. ``I've got to have my own classroom and jump into what I've
been going to school for, but the problem was the (UMKC) classes.
But I was loving the kids and coming to (Moore) and teaching. That
kept me motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid problems next year, the interns will take the UMKC
courses in the summer, so they can focus on teaching in the fall.
Then in the spring, when they've settled into the classroom
teaching, they will teach and take a UMKC seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating fall course work also should solve a complaint
principals had. Often the interns had to leave quickly to get to
class, so it was hard to schedule staff meetings everyone could
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Some weaknesses also emerged with the mentoring piece of the
internship program.
</P>
<P>
   Each intern worked with a mentor _ a veteran teacher _ at the
elementary school. In a few cases the mentor and intern team
taught, which allowed a lot of interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, however, the mentor had an entire classroom to run, as
did the intern. The mentor was supposed to observe the intern's
teaching at times, and the intern was to watch the mentor teach,
too. They also were to discuss challenges and share ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Busy classrooms made it hard to do enough observing.
</P>
<P>
   So next year two interns will be assigned to the same mentor.
The mentor's normal class will be split in two, and each intern
will take half the class. Instead of teaching all day, the mentor
will take turns observing and planning with each intern.
</P>
<P>
   That could make the experience look more like what goes on in
the third-grade Paige Elementary classroom of mentor Linda May and
intern Anthony Butler.
</P>
<P>
   They team-teach 29 students; Butler is responsible for preparing
his lesson plans and running the classroom jointly with May.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent school day, Butler began by writing the day's
journal assignment on the chalkboard: ``If you were to come up with
a new holiday, what would it be? Why would you celebrate it?
Explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler likes to get the children thinking and writing. They did
not feel comfortable writing last September, but they do now after
writing in a journal for about 10 minutes every morning.
</P>
<P>
   He has learned that ``the only way to deal with a weakness is to
meet it head on.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, the fifth-grade teacher at Moore, has learned from
being in the classroom that teachers cannot be rigid about what
they believe from reading books.
</P>
<P>
   While studying to be a teacher, she had thought that children
studied quietly most of the time and that giving out rewards _ such
as parties with popcorn and pop _ was bad.
</P>
<P>
   Now she knows better.
</P>
<P>
   After teaching 14 fifth-graders all day every day for a year,
she knows children are noisy. And bribes work.

WORLD WAR II VETERAN REMEMBERS NEIGHBORS WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 CAIT PURINTON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Six decades ago, Kansas City's neighborhoods
sent their sons to liberate Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One of those neighborhoods was the West Side. And one of its
sons was Augustine Cisneros. He returned from World War II, though
with an arm scarred by German shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   Now just months shy of 80, Cisneros reflects on those young men
from the West Side, those who attended Our Lady of Guadalupe
Church, those who went to war and those who never returned.
</P>
<P>
   On this Memorial Day, and for every day of the last couple
years, a memorial in front of Cisneros' Kansas City home pays
tribute to five men from the old neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made me put it up was that nobody was thinking of the
veterans from the West Side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In making sure that passers-by remember, Cisneros did something
usually reserved for governments, foundations and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Vern Pall, spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in
16 years at the VFW, he's never heard of anyone constructing a
memorial on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of refutes what people are saying,'' Pall said. ``The
war is not being forgotten. The veterans aren't being forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' son, Tony, helped build the memorial's brick base and
install a flag pole and lighting. A plaque attached to the front
lists the names of five ``World War II West Side Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   A ceramic angel sits above their names: Ralph Sifuentes, Ted
Orozco, Albert Valdivia, Jesse Marino and Monche Cano.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five, Cisneros was closest to Cano. They went to Army
basic training together and later shipped out for North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While in North Africa, Cisneros, Cano and other soldiers lined
up waiting for their assignments. Cano's name was called to join
the 34th Division. Cisneros' was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said his name, I got out of line and went to hug him
and said, `Oh, I wish I could go with the 34th Division,' &UR; ''
Cisneros said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last time they saw each other. Cano died in North
Africa in 1943, Cisneros said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros went to Italy as part of a machine gun team in the 1st
Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting the war is like going to hell,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``War,'' he said, his voice trailing off, ``it's a terrible
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   His last day in combat was Jan. 5, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   That entire day the Americans fought the Germans in Italy. As it
grew dark, Cisneros said, the Germans burned a nearby train depot
for light.
</P>
<P>
   Then the shriek of a shell sliced the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you heard them scream, you better watch out,'' Cisneros
said. ``It sounded like an alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The shell exploded and hot shrapnel set his coat sleeve on fire
and mangled his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Two medics put him on a stretcher to carry him out of the line
of fire. But when shells began to fall, the medics dropped him and
ran. When they came back, Cisneros asked them how long they had
been in combat. They told him it was their first day.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked them to take him off the stretcher. The medics
hoisted him on their shoulders and Cisneros directed them to a
nearby ravine where they were safe from the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   Later he went to a field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``After sleeping in the foxholes,'' Cisneros said, ``I had never
felt sheets that felt so good as that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return to the United States, he was taken to a hospital
in Springfield, Mo. While in the hospital, he and his girlfriend,
Mary Louise Guerra, were married. Cisneros returned to Kansas City
and became a bartender.
</P>
<P>
   Today their home on Karnes Boulevard is decorated with
photographs of their children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren. And two paintings depicting the medics
carrying Cisneros off the front lines hang in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the paintings came while the couple visited their
daughter in South Dakota. At an art show, Cisneros saw a painting
of a waterfall at night. The colors and mood reminded him of the
day he was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   He got the name of the artist, Robert Bruce, and called him.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce said he jumped at the chance to do the paintings because
he had always been interested in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros mailed Bruce pictures of himself and told Bruce his
story of his last day in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to talking to Gus because he would add
details each time I talked to him,'' Bruce said. ``After talking to
him for a while and reading my notes, the picture just popped in my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears come to Cisneros' eyes now as he sits under the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my mother pray for me,'' he said. ``I was real
respectful to my mother. I think that's why God saved me.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the past few years that Cisneros began to talk
about his days in combat, or the day God saved his life in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cisneros talks proudly about his Purple Heart and two
Battle Stars. And he wants the World War II West Boys remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people forget about those boys who died over there.''

   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Missouri also is struggling with a growing
prison population, despite plans to open three prisons in the next
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Department spokesman Tim Kniest said Missouri's
prison population of 27,212 is only slightly above the operational
capacity of 27,170. But that population is 150 percent of what the
prisons were designed to hold.
</P>
<P>
   To boost capacity, the state has to come up with creative ways
to house the extra inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put beds anywhere you can,'' Kniest said. ``You have
temporary bunks in day rooms or in other secure areas that are
designed for other uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowding is bad enough at several prisons that they are
under court supervision. Kniest said the inmate population at
high-security prisons in Jefferson City, Moberly and Pacific and a
medium-security prison just outside Jefferson City cannot be
expanded without court approval.
</P>
<P>
   To handle new inmates, the state has three prisons under
construction that will boost capacity by nearly 20 percent. A
1,596-bed maximum-security prison is scheduled to open next month
in Licking.
</P>
<P>
   The penitentiary will relieve crowding at prisons designed to
handle the most violent offenders, but it won't solve the overall
problem, Kniest said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't help us handle the overflow at medium-security
prisons,'' he said. ``It's not a matter of just having enough beds.
It's a matter of having enough beds for each class of inmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other prisons _ one medium-security and one high-security _
are under construction. They will house about 3,400 inmates and are
expected to open in the fall of 2001.

NEW YORK LEADS WAY IN REWARDING DEVELOPERS FOR `GREEN' BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state has taken the lead in making
commercial and residential buildings more efficient and more in
harmony with the environment by adopting a ``green building
credit'' against state income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The credit, which was included in the state budget signed into
law by Gov. George Pataki on May 15, is intended to encourage
building owners and developers to use advanced technologies like
fuel cells and photovoltaic panels to generate electricity and to
use materials that improve air quality inside buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge deal,'' said Robert F. Fox Jr., a partner in
Fox &AMP; Fowle Architects, which specializes in environmentally
sensitive design. ``Basically, the state is offering to pay
developers for the excess costs of doing green buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Green buildings are generally defined as those that use energy
more efficiently than those with conventional designs and that
provide workers with well-lighted spaces furnished with an
abundance of clean air. One of the objectives of designing a green
building is to avoid using carpets, paints or other interior
materials that can release harmful chemicals after being installed.
</P>
<P>
   The credit is limited to $25 million for all projects over five
years. It was advocated by an unusual alliance, including the Real
Estate Board of New York, which represents owners, developers and
brokers, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, a major
environmental advocacy group. Similar bills are in the works in
Maryland and California, but New York's law appears to be the
first, according to the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``This collaborative effort is a prototype for other states and
eventually the federal government to follow,'' said Deborah B.
Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation provides a credit of 5 percent of the
capitalized cost of a project _ up to $3.75 per square foot for
interior work and $7.50 per square foot for exterior work _ to
builders who meet energy goals and use nontoxic materials in
construction. To qualify, a building must meet requirements for
energy use, indoor air quality, waste disposal and water use.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a credit equivalent to 10 percent of the cost of
new air-conditioning equipment that uses refrigerants that do not
harm the ozone layer. There are additional credits for tenants who
build their interior space to conform with the goals.
</P>
<P>
   Builders using fuel cells and photovoltaic panels, which produce
electricity without the pollution associated with conventional
power sources, are eligible for special additional credits. Both
technologies also have the potential to produce power more cheaply
than conventional methods, but they tend to be more costly because
they are less developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the legislation is to jump-start industries,''
Ms. Beck said. ``We want to go from custom installations to mass
production. We want to bring more people into the marketplace and
make it more competitive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fuel cells produce electricity by consuming natural gas in a
catalytic process that does not burn the fuel. The only emissions
are carbon dioxide and water, in contrast to the mixture of
chemicals flowing from the stacks of plants burning fossil fuels.
The technology is evolving rapidly, Fox said. ``In five years, fuel
cells will be able to provide power at one-third the current
cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity
with no emissions at all. Although individually they do not produce
much power, they can replace conventional materials in the skin of
a building, and when wired together they can produce usable amounts
of power without any expenditure for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Durst, whose new Conde Nast building in Manhattan
incorporates both fuel cells and photovoltaic panels, welcomed the
legislation, but had some reservations. Because there is a
year-to-year limit on the total tax credits that can be claimed, he
said, there should be a way of preventing one big project from
absorbing most of one year's allotment.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the discussions about the legislation said the
five-year limit of $25 million was inserted to demonstrate fiscal
prudence. But they said the cap might be raised or the time period
extended if the program succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Durst also said a mechanism needs to be developed ``to help
smaller builders who do not know to apply these technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his company, the Durst Organization, would continue to
incorporate green technologies despite a delay in financial
benefits that other developers found unacceptable. ``We are a
family business that is building for the next generation, so we
don't mind long paybacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investments in advanced technology in the Conde Nast building
allow the company to operate it more economically than conventional
structures, Durst said.
</P>
<P>
   William Rudin, whose Rudin Management Co. is building a
headquarters for Reuters in Manhattan, said the building
incorporated technologies included in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the wiring in the building could use power from
fuel cells and photovoltaic panels and that space had been
allocated to install the cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters building also includes filters to improve indoor air
quality and glass that resists ultraviolet rays, reducing the
amount of power needed for cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel R. Tishman, the president of Tishman Construction, which
managed the construction of both buildings, was part of a group of
business leaders and environmentalists that helped draft the tax
credit. ``Since it costs a bit more up front,'' he said, ``we
wanted to design an incentive _ like an investment tax credit _ to
encourage developers and landlords to do what's right for the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the architect for both buildings, said the tax credits
would pay 30 percent of the cost of buying fuel cells, less federal
or state grants. And, he said, they would pay for 100 percent of
the cost of the solar power panels, minus the cost of building
materials that would have been used otherwise.  &QL;

 COUNTDOWN IS ON AS kANSAS PREPARES TO CUT PRISON POPULATION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ Kansas prison officials are doing a lot of number
crunching these days.
</P>
<P>
   So are thousands of convicted felons, whether they're behind
bars or on probation or parole.
</P>
<P>
   All of them are counting down to Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deadline for selecting the hundreds or possibly
thousands of state prisoners who will be set free as part of the
Kansas Legislature's ``corrections megabill.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing a growing prison population, the Legislature this year
approved a package of measures aimed at easing crowding without
sacrificing public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although the moves are expected to create immediate relief for
the state's near-capacity prison system, they are likely to put an
extra burden on local jails and corrections programs. And they
don't do much to address the continuing need for cells to house the
state's most dangerous criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many who work in the Kansas criminal justice system think
the changes are better than alternatives such as cutting prison
sentences across the board or spending millions to build more
cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections did get $6 million for an
additional 100 beds at its Ellsworth Correctional Facility, but it
says more are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this bill in its entirety as a balanced, reasonable
compromise,'' Kansas Secretary of Corrections Charles Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' department is determining which inmates will be set
free. It's a task he said he hopes will be completed by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 800 prison beds will be freed up, according to
initial estimates by the Kansas Sentencing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners who will be freed include burglars, thieves, drug
users, bad-check writers and people who violated technical
conditions of probation or parole.
</P>
<P>
   Those who won't be released include murderers, sex offenders,
armed robbers, drug dealers and those who committed new crimes
while on probation or parole.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 1,200 to 1,500 inmates will be released from
parole, or ``post-release supervision,'' over the next six months
to a year, according to the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reasonable, short-term fix,'' said Johnson County
District Attorney Paul Morrison, a member of the Kansas Sentencing
Commission, which recommended some of the changes. ``But the
reality is that as time goes on, we will need more and more prison
beds for the most dangerous inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   When the state overhauled its sentencing system in 1993, the
intent was to reserve prison space for violent repeat offenders
while offering community-based alternatives for lesser offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Legislature has beefed up the guidelines even
more, in some cases doubling or tripling the sentences for the most
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the guidelines is meeting its goal: Violent
offenders are being locked up longer.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the people who get chances at probation and parole who
are ending up in prison in greater numbers _ not for committing new
crimes, but for basically being irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Last fiscal year, 67 percent of admissions into the state prison
system were parole or probation violators who did not commit new
crimes, according to the Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   They did things such as move without telling their probation
officers, fail to show up for drug tests or miss restitution
payments. Some of them drank alcohol or used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It's that group of conditional violators that this year's
legislation addresses on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the measures adopted:
</P>
<P>
   _ Most of the conditional violators in prison are to be released
and will not be required to be on parole after they get out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probation and parole time that must be served will be cut in
half for those convicted of the lowest-level crimes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conditional probation violators must be sent to local
community corrections programs instead of being sent to prison.
Additional violations could result in prison.
</P>
<P>
   _ Likewise, conditional parole violators first will be sent to
new day-reporting centers before being sent to prison. The
privately operated centers will be established in Kansas City,
Kan.; Topeka; and Wichita to handle a combined 220 offenders. They
will provide an intermediate sanction that is not now available.
Officials hope to have them in operation by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the legislation, officials in community
corrections programs that already are in place across the state
expect to see an increase in the number of offenders they
supervise.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County Corrections Director Michael Youngken said his
department has 565 persons in its intensive supervision program. It
also operates a 208-bed residential work-release facility.
</P>
<P>
   Although his department will have to make do without a
corresponding budget increase, Youngken said the Legislature
initially had looked at slashing local corrections money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the Legislature for the work they did in this
area,'' Youngken said. ``It wasn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said people who commit new crimes while on probation or
parole still will be sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But providing an additional sanction short of prison for
conditional violators is a good way to ``hold their feet to the
fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to punish some of them is to hold them
responsible and make them go to work,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows a conditional violator to be sent directly to
prison if a judge finds that placing him in community corrections
would jeopardize public safety.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the law that is likely to have a significant
effect on local jails is the doubling of jail ``shock time'' that
judges can impose as part of probation. It will be increased from
30 days to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one way to get an offender's attention, particularly a
young offender,'' Morrison said.

TASK FORCE MAKES PROGRESS IN CAPTURING VIOLENT FUGITIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Think things are piling up where you work?
</P>
<P>
   Consider what Tom Nunemaker, the FBI supervisor for the Violent
Crime//Fugitive Task Force, has to face when he goes to work every
morning: at least 6,500 active arrest warrants in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   But Nunemaker's task force _ comprising four FBI agents and two
detectives each from the Kansas City and Kansas City, Kan., police
departments _ is making headway against that tidal wave of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the task force, which was formed in January
1993, chalked up its 2,000th fugitive arrest when FBI agents
captured convicted child abuser Josie Copkney, 26, in a Gladstone,
Mo., apartment building. Copkney quickly was returned to court,
where she was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abusing her
9-week-old daughter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we got a pretty dangerous individual off the street,''
Nunemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The task force focuses only on the most violent local fugitives,
those for whom warrants already have been issued for crimes such as
murder, rape, robbery and burglary. Larry McCormick, the FBI agent
in charge of the Kansas City office, said the key to the squad's
success is the remarkable cooperation it has forged on all levels
of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a partnership designed to make the city a safer place,''
McCormick said. ``The task force has been a tremendous success in
getting violent criminals off the street. The program targets the
most likely to commit additional crime, so it's preventive
maintenance on the criminal element.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police Detective Al DeValkenaere, a member of the
task force, said the diversity of experience on the squad and the
ability to bring both federal and local resources to bear on a
problem accounts for much of the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody brings something to the table,'' DeValkenaere said.
``The FBI has unbelievable resources nationwide. It works because
we have places to go with the information. We can call people in
others cities who do the same kind of work, and because of the
serious nature of the crimes, the information doesn't just sit
around.''
</P>
<P>
   DeValkenaere said the cooperation of fugitives' friends and
family, as well as community resources such as the TIPS Hotline,
also are important to the squad. Assuring relatives that task-force
members just want to bring the fugitive in safely can generate
worthwhile leads and result in significant arrests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes for a very satisfying line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just putting the bad guy in jail,'' DeValkenaere said.
``It's what police work should be.''

FUJIMORI THE VICTOR IN RUNOFF ELECTION; PROTESTERS TAKE TO THE
STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS lede with Fujimori winning, updates estimate of
demonstrators in 4th graf, inserts 6th graf to add percentages with
virtually all of vote counted; minor changes elsewhere; subs
overline.) 
By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ In a runoff vote long on protest but short on
suspense, President Alberto Fujimori swept to victory Sunday
against an opponent who had urged his supporters to abstain because
of what he called vote fraud and an array of campaign
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had hoped for a third landslide victory that would
venerate his successes defeating two terrorist groups and
hyperinflation and making peace with Ecuador after decades of
border tensions. Instead, the 61-year-old leader won a hollow
victory leaving the country badly polarized and facing possible
economic sanctions just as it tries to emerge from recession.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting capped a campaign full of dirty tricks, violent
demonstrations and condemnations from Fujimori's opponent,
Alejandro Toledo, who withdrew on May 18 _ too late to pull his
name off the ballot. The Clinton administration, France, Britain,
Canada, Argentina and Costa Rica echoed Toledo's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Even before voting drew to a close, demonstrations grew more
intense and downtown Lima was filled with the pungent smell of tear
gas. Government helicopters buzzed overhead as a crowd of some tens
of thousands of demonstrators assembled Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Chimbote, a northern port and Toledo's hometown, armored
vehicles rolled through the streets as police broke up
anti-Fujimori demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually all of the vote count- ed, Fujimori had 50.8
percent while Toledo had 16.7 percent, with the rest of the ballots
left blank or nullified.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States released a report last week
saying, ``the Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could
be considered free and fair,'' noting that government funding was
used in the Fujimori campaign, media access was dominated by the
president, and that there was not enough time to inspect new
computer vote tabulation software to assure a fair count.
</P>
<P>
   Before a single vote was cast, election observers from the
Organization of American States and the Carter Center, based in
Atlanta, had withdrawn in disgust after they failed to persuade the
government to postpone the election. Toledo, the only challenger on
the ballot, did not vote and told reporters the election was as
``fraudulent as a soccer game in which the field is tilted and one
side chooses the referees and the reporters who cover the
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's bid for a third term has stirred opposition here ever
since Congress fired three judges more than two years ago for
ruling that a constitutional ban on a third presidential term
prohibited the president from running. Fujimori argued that he
could run since the constitution was written after his first term,
meaning the ban would only apply if he ran for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters appeared to be going through the motion of voting in
an election that lacked drama after Toledo pulled out 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no institution in this country that is free
anymore,'' said Enrique Fernandez, a 48-year-old folk music
promoter, before voting in the working-class neighborhood of Rimac
in order to avoid a $35 fine for not voting or problems with the
police. ``The Justice Ministry and election authorities are totally
controlled and this is all a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a 54-year-old business professor who was educated in the
United States, insisted that Sunday's uncontested election would
hurl Peru into uncharted, turbulent political currents. Once
re-elected to a third term, he said, Fujimori ``will be a permanent
source of political instability that will have permanent economic
consequences. I can assure you he will not last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Toledo predicted that protests around the country will
gather momentum. There have already been strikes and road blockades
in the cities of Iquitos, Cuzco and Chiclayo in recent days, as
well as several violent incidents in Lima, including rock and
firebomb attacks by university students on the presidential palace
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The tainted Peruvian election will dominate a meeting of foreign
ministers of the countries belonging to the Organization of
American States scheduled to meet in Canada this week. The
ministers could ultimately decide on sanctions, although in the
past severe action has been taken only in cases of coup d'etats or
other overt interruptions of democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely sanctions will come from the United States,
where Congress has already passed a joint resolution calling for a
review of all political, economic and military relations with Peru.
Still, it remains doubtful Washington will cut deeply into
assistance that goes toward Peru's efforts at combating terrorism
and narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration pushed hard for Fujimori to hold a
second-round vote during a questionable slow count in the days
following the first-round of balloting on April 9. But in recent
weeks Washington has softened its criticism of Peru and allowed the
Organization of American States, a usually cautious regional
organization, to take the lead in pushing for democratic reform
here.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, President Clinton had strong words for Peru on
Friday, the day after election authorities had already decided to
go ahead with vote. ``Free, fair and open elections are the
foundation of a democratic society,'' he said. ``Without them, our
relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is counting on the United States to go easy on him,
rather than jeopardize the cooperation of the two countries in
economic, anti-terrorism and especially anti-drug programs that
have halved this country's coca plant production in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be terrible if our anti-narcotics collaboration was
upset and we will continue to welcome U.S. investment,'' Fujimori
said. ``These are elements in our relations that will supersede
whatever tensions arise from the election.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori used an assortment of sweet carrots and rather sharp
sticks on his way to a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In a wave of populism, he raised the minimum wage and handed out
land titles to 150,000 peasants during the campaign. But Fujimori
was also besieged by criticism from international election
observers for a range of campaign irregularities. Poor mothers
dependent on government milk and food handouts were pressured to
attend Fujimori rallies, for example, and intelligence agents
followed and harassed opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many tabloid newspapers that have connections to Fujimori's
intelligence service and all television networks save for one cable
television station either did not cover the Toledo campaign or
tilted their coverage toward salacious and unproved allegations of
financial fraud, sexual innuendo and claims that he had an
illegitimate daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, a journalist who said he had videotapes showing
Fujimori's intelligence chief meeting with election officials was
assaulted by three unidentified men. From a hospital bed, he said
the assailants cut his wrist to the bone with a saw as they
demanded he disclose his sources inside the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours following the April 9 vote, cries of fraud arose
when ballots and tally sheets disappeared for several hours.
Election authorities only announced that Fujimori did not receive
the required majority to avert a second round after three days of
heavy international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo ran a strong race in the April first round, promising to
give the poor jobs and to disentangle the courts and congress from
the tight grip of presidential control.
</P>
<P>
   But he appeared to fumble badly when he suddenly sought to drop
out of the race 10 days ago, claiming that he was not willing to
lead his supporters into a fraudulent vote unless the election date
was postponed several weeks to give international observers an
opportunity to audit computer software designed to count ballots.
</P>
<P>
   He slid in a variety of opinion polls, as voters either
expressed disappointment in his apparent surrender or dismay that
he was willing to incite unrest and damage the image of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by Datum Internacional between May 19 and 22,
which only the week before had shown a virtual tie between the two
candidates, showed that 55 percent of voters disapproved of
Toledo's decision to drop out of the race. The poll also showed
Fujimori leading Toledo by a 54-46 percent margin, suggesting that
Fujimori could win a clean, free election anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's argument that he was a victim of fraud was also hurt by
public criticism levied at him by the head of the observation team
from the Organization American States, who said Toledo's
oscillating position on conditions for competing in the runoff made
it more difficult to negotiate a delay in the election date.

MINUTE QUANTITIES OF EVERYDAY MEDICINES APPEAR IN WORLD'S WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MICHAEL MANSUR and JOHN MARTELLARO  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the rivers of America, from which most of
us draw water to drink, something new and seemingly unusual is
being detected _ drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff of your medicine cabinets _ antibiotics, pain
relievers, birth control pills and beta blockers _ is becoming a
common contaminant in the waters of the modern world, passed from
humans to sewage treatment plants, and then discharged into streams
and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these drugs pose a threat to humans is not yet known,
federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Kansas City water department say they have run
new, sophisticated tests on drinking water to see whether it has
been contaminated by these pharmaceuticals and by chemicals from
personal-care products, such as shampoos or suntan oils.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they say, they have not found a trace. But the
Environmental Protection Agency also is looking at the levels of
the contaminants in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of concern. This is the current hot topic,''
said Connie Hull, who oversees the Kansas City water department's
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide studies are under way to determine how many of these
``emerging contaminants'' are in rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest effect will probably be on fish and other aquatic
species that must live today with a little bit of caffeine,
synthetic hormones from birth control pills and other
pharmaceuticals, said Christian Daughton, an EPA researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What little that is known serves to show that rather low
concentrations at least have the potential to exert substantive
effects on aquatic life,'' Daughton wrote in a recent critical
review of research on these new pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, certain anti-depressants can alter the spawning
behavior of shellfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, studies have shown that sewage discharges containing
synthetic or natural sex hormones may be changing the reproductive
organs in fish.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study examined Mississippi River carp below sewage
treatment discharge pipes in the St. Paul, Minn., area and found
that their blood hormone levels were altered, especially compared
with fish in a pristine stream.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. households, pharmaceuticals, perfumes and shampoos are
as common as peanut butter but probably occupy a lot more shelf
space.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is not all flowing out of our households.
High levels of chemotherapy and other drugs have been found
downstream of hospitals. And below the giant new hog farms of the
Midwest, researchers are detecting animal hormones and antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists worry that the increased use of antibiotics may lead
to contamination of the waters, increasing the potential to create
more bacteria strains that are resistant to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Don Wilkison, who works in the U.S. Geological Survey's office
in Independence, routinely finds a wide assortment of
pharmaceuticals and personal-care products in the waters of Brush
Creek and the Blue River:
</P>
<P>
   Acetaminophen. Ibuprofen. Heart medicine. And, of course,
caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   The levels are barely detectable. Even so, they raise a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkison cannot say whether those chemicals, at such minute
levels, pose problems for the creatures that live in the Blue River
or Brush Creek. He noted, however, that a lot of chemicals _
including pesticides and synthetic fertilizers _ already are in the
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Mix it all together, Wilkison said, and ``we really don't know
what's happening in the ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   The human body breaks down some medicines, but other drugs, once
taken, can stay potent after they leave your body. Others are
rendered inert after human consumption but reactivate when mixed
with chemicals during sewage treatment or in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment plants settle out and remove most contaminants, but
not all. Plant managers generally focus on pollutants for which
they must meet federal standards. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals
from personal-care products are not regulated under laws for sewage
or drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceuticals also might be dumped into streams and rivers
in areas, such as Kansas City, that have combined pipes for storm
water and sewage, designed to overflow during heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent years have scientists begun to look for traces of
pharmaceuticals. It is only recently that laboratory analysis
became sophisticated enough to detect such tiny amounts of the
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say much more research will be required to
determine whether they should limit the amount of these pollutants
in sewage discharges.
</P>
<P>
   The first concerns about these contaminants were raised in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 a study found traces of pharmaceuticals below the Big
Blue Sewage Treatment Plant. At the time, that plant treated
three-fourths of Kansas City's sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The study found drugs and the products of their breakdown in the
city's sewage effluent. When it tested drinking water in Kansas
City and St. Charles, it did not find the pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be well to consider further evaluation of public
drinking water supplies for the presence of drugs consumed in large
quantities,'' were the study's final words.
</P>
<P>
   For years little follow-up appeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, however, researchers in Europe were
documenting the same phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Swiss chemists were searching for the levels of an
herbicide in lake water when they found a chemical they could not
identify at first. It turned out to be clofibric acid, a
cholesterol drug in common use there. It was also the same drug
identified in the Kansas City study in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   When the scientists tested other lakes and rivers in Europe,
they found the drug in almost all cases. They could find no
industrial spill to explain such contamination. Their only
explanation: It must come from human wastes.
</P>
<P>
   More recently German scientists expanded the search, finding 30
to 60 drugs in the typical water sample, although at extremely low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, researchers in northern Europe have continued to
find traces of pharmaceuticals in rivers, lakes and the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in the former East Berlin, said Daughton of the EPA,
that traces of pharmaceuticals have been found in public drinking
water supplies. That is probably because treatment plants there are
fairly primitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that if there's going to be a problem,
I don't think drinking water is where it'll be,'' Daughton said
last week. ``It'll be in the aquatic realm.''
</P>
<P>
   But researchers have many more questions to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just starting in this country with the research,''
Daughton said. ``Almost all the research for the last 10 or 15
years has been done in Europe, primarily in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies are required to test new drugs to determine the
toxicity to creatures in the environment. Daughton wonders whether
those tests are adequate to detect the subtle changes that might be
produced by low concentrations of these chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has assessed what happens chemically when these
compounds mix, Daughton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For decades all we've been looking at has been pesticides and
industrial pollutants,'' Daughton said. ``But there's a whole world
of other compounds that get into the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, with so much left to be done before the extent of the
problem can be known, Daughton likes to keep the focus on
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really not the pharmaceutical companies' issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's you and I who consume these things. So it's you and I who
are potentially causing the pollution.''

IN PART OF NEW YORK, THE BOOM REMAINS A BUST 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been over three decades since Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy cast a spotlight on the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn by making it the focus of a bold new economic development
program. The uniting of ``the best of community action with the
best of the private enterprise system,'' he said, could make a
model urban neighborhood rise from the ashes of ``physical decay
and human despair.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the plan worked. Its most visible achievement was
the conversion of an abandoned milk-bottling plant in the heart of
the neighborhood into a shopping plaza and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more: Hundreds of homes were rehabilitated,
thousands of jobs were created, the neighborhood got its first
large supermarket in years, and IBM brought in a computer-cable
production factory that once employed 450 people.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, however, the predominantly black New York
neighborhood that is reaping the benefits of a robust economy is
Harlem, not Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being central to current political and economic plans
for reviving neglected areas, Bedford-Stuyvesant has receded into
the shadows, community leaders say. Some blame the perception of
rampant crime, even though crime is down. Others say Harlem has
more political clout in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But many people both inside and outside Bedford-Stuyvesant also
say that the organization that was intended to help bring
prosperity to central Brooklyn _ Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration
Corp. _ has served as an impediment to progress, an entrenched and
sluggish bureaucracy instead of a spark plug for local
entrepreneurs and nationally known merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning rod for some of the criticism is Roderick B.
Mitchell, the president and chief executive of Restoration for the
last 12 years. His detractors call him prickly and arrogant,
incapable of working cooperatively with other community leaders.
Some local business owners say he has opposed efforts to bring new
jobs to the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell cited several new businesses in Restoration Plaza
and the organization's continuing support of several longstanding
cultural programs, including an art gallery and two theaters. He
also pointed to a $9.8 million project, which is nearing
completion, to make the fortresslike Restoration Plaza more
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration, a nonprofit corporation, oversees 11 subsidiaries.
In its early years, Mitchell said, an estimated 80 percent of the
company's revenue came from government sources, but in more recent
years, it has received most of its money from rent and other
earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's glory days seem to have ended. Once a model
for about 2,000 community development corporations across the
United States, Restoration is now running large deficits ($990,000
this past fiscal year, and $1.6 million the year before).
Restoration-sponsored construction has ceased, and the organization
has managed to attract only a few new businesses to the
neighborhood in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   When IBM moved out in 1993, the company was replaced by an
employee-owned computer-repair business, where only 30 people now
work. During the last fiscal year, Restoration reported that it
spent $2.6 million on its programs, only $130,000 of which was used
for economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bedford-Stuyvesant's problems are apparent on Fulton
Street, the bustling main commercial thoroughfare. It has street
vendors, 99-cent stores, beauty and nail salons, jewelry and liquor
stores, but few essential services like dry cleaners and sit-down
restaurants. There are no movie theaters, bookstores or record
stores.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, many other explanations for the slow pace
of commercial development in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a community of
about 140,000 people. Central Brooklyn, home to about 300,000
people, has no politician to match Charles Rangel, the Harlem
congressman who was instrumental in obtaining hundreds of millions
of federal, state and city dollars for his district. Nor does it
have the high density that many retailers seek.
</P>
<P>
   To out-of-town retail executives (and even many New Yorkers),
Bedford-Stuyvesant is a still a scary place, and even some local
merchants remain fearful.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood could support some of the amenities that are
cropping up in Fort Greene, a predominantly black middle-class area
of Brooklyn _ coffee bars, art galleries and other urban ``eye
candy,'' said Colvin W. Grannum, the chief executive of Bridge
Street Development Corp., a church-affiliated group that has worked
closely with the New York City Housing Partnership to develop
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   But first the community has to advertise its strengths, he said.
``Forty percent of the people are poor, and business people look at
that and say, `There is no way this is going to work,''' Grannum
said. ``But the other 60 percent is solid, working-class families,
and there is even some affluence.''

TWO CHARGED IN WENDY'S KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men facing an avalanche of evidence in a
notorious case that could lead to the death penalty were arraigned
in a Queens court Sunday on murder and robbery charges in last
week's execution-style massacre at a Wendy's restaurant that left
five workers slain and two others shot and left for dead.
</P>
<P>
   As the suspects, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30,
stood silently in a packed courtroom, a prosecutor described in
gripping detail how the victims were bound, gagged and blindfolded
with duct tape, their heads were covered with plastic bags, and
they were shot one by one as they knelt in a freezer room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were marched single file into a big freezer box,'' the
prosecutor, Gregory L. Lasak, told Judge Michael Aloise of Criminal
Court in a voice trembling with emotion. ``They were told to get on
their knees, and they were each shot by the defendants once in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasak, the executive assistant in charge of major cases in the
office of the Queens district attorney, said each of the
defendants, who were arrested on Friday less than 48 hours after
the killings, had made a videotaped confession implicating himself
and his accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions, he said, included a ``calculated plan'' to rob
the Wendy's in Flushing, where Taylor had worked last fall, and to
kill the workers to eliminate witnesses. And they included numerous
details about how the executions were carried out and how $2,400 in
cash was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the confessions, Lasak said, three witnesses, including
one of the surviving victims, have identified the defendants as the
assailants. And the police found in Taylor's possession the gun
used in the crimes and a videotape from Wendy's surveillance camera
showing both suspects, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Lasak described the victims as ``seven hard-working people, and
added: ``The evidence we have to tie these defendants to the case
is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were each charged with 25 counts _ five of
first-degree murder for intentionally killing multiple victims,
five of first-degree murder for the intentional killing of people
during a robbery, 10 of second-degree murder not necessarily
involving intent to kill, two counts of attempted murder, robbery
in the first degree and weapons possession in the second and third
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction of first-degree murder carries a possible death
sentence or life in prison. Under the law, the Queens district
attorney, Richard A. Brown, has 120 days to decide whether to seek
the death penalty. He noted Sunday that he had not yet decided, and
would consider many factors, including the wishes of the victims'
families and what he called the ``callousness, ruthlessness,
character, criminal record and motivation'' of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision that I do not take lightly,'' Brown said at a
news conference, at which he spoke with somber confidence about the
strength of the case, calling the evidence ``overwhelming,'' and
saying he expected a grand jury next month to return indictments on
first-degree murder and other charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taylor has worked at fast-food restaurants in New York in recent
years and, the authorities say, tried to rob five fast-food outlets
last year. He has been a fugitive since November for jumping bail.
Godineaux, who has worked recently as a security guard in a
clothing store, has served three prison terms for robbery and drug
offenses in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects did not enter pleas during the arraignment; that is
customary in hearings when a grand jury has not yet returned an
indictment, especially in potential death-penalty cases. Standing
with their lawyers _ John Youngblood of the state's Capital
Defender Office for Taylor, and Heidi Segal of the Legal Aid
Society's capital defense unit for Godineaux _ they said nothing
during a 20-minute hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, short and heavy-set in a black denim suit, stared
straight ahead, while Godineaux, a tall, rangy man in a black
T-shirt and blue jeans, gazed at the floor. Neither was handcuffed,
but security in the court was tight, with 10 police and court
officers, many of them wearing bulletproof vests, standing by. The
wood-paneled courtroom was crowded mostly with reporters, although
Aloise excluded cameras.
</P>
<P>
   There was little discussion of bail. ``There is no greater risk
of flight than someone who would have this hanging over their
heads,'' Lasak said when the subject came up. Youngblood and Segal
did not pursue it, reserving their bail requests, and Aloise
remanded the suspects for a hearing on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, officials said, will be held in maximum-security cells
at either Rikers Island, the city's sprawling East River prison
complex, or the Brooklyn House of Detention. At Youngblood's
behest, the judge ordered a suicide watch placed on Taylor, who, in
his confession, said that in the hours before his capture he had
thought about killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   While there appeared to be no friends or relatives of Taylor in
the courtroom, there was a handful of supporters of Godineaux, and
as the suspects were being led away after the hearing, a woman
wearing a red sweater over her head shouted: ``I love you Craig''
and broke out in sobs, crying, ``Oh, God!''
</P>
<P>
   Someone else shouted, ``Burn in hell!''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get into the small courtroom, which could hold only
about 75 spectators, more than a dozen friends and relatives of the
victims waited outside in a hallway, many of them with eyes red
from crying and with the toll of grief and anger etched on their
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve what they got coming,'' said Louis Bossler, a
friend of the Wendy's night manager, Jean Dumel Auguste, 27, of
Brooklyn, who had fired Taylor last October and, investigators
said, was the only one of the victims that Taylor acknowledged
shooting with a Bryco .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol that he
bought for $250 earlier this year on a street in Queens.

4 HURT AS ISRAELIS FIRE AT TAUNTING CIVILIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite lede and 7th grafs for greater accuracy. Inserts
new 8th graf on official response of Israeli army.)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Israeli soldiers Sunday fired on Lebanese and
Palestinian civilians who were throwing stones and trying to push
across the border from what was until last week the
Israeli-controlled buffer zone between the two countries. Four
people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Also in southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah fighter killed a Christian
man, and two Lebanese children were killed and seven people wounded
when their car drove over a land mine on a road.
</P>
<P>
   The events underlined the potentially deadly confusion and
tension that still reign in much of southern Lebanon, four days
after Israel abruptly withdrew its forces from the nine-mile-wide
area it occupied for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although a parade of Lebanese government officials have visited
the area and claimed victory over Israel, the Lebanese army has
stayed away, leaving to the Hezbollah militia the work of policing
towns and villages and rounding up abandoned Israeli weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which waged a long war against Israel and its
Lebanese allies in the south, has deployed hundreds of its fighters
in the area to prevent looting, police villages and pursue members
of the South Lebanon army who worked for Israel during the
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim guerrillas have sought in recent days to present
themselves as mere custodians of southern Lebanon, acting as a
temporary force of law and order until the government takes over.
But its ability to act as a civil guard, rather than a militia, has
been sorely tested, as the increasingly unruly scenes at the border
fences between Lebanon and Israel have shown.
</P>
<P>
   At Kafr Kila, where the shooting by Israeli soldiers occurred,
barely 15 yards separate Israeli guards and the throngs of Lebanese
and Palestinians who have come to gawk, shout insults and sometimes
throw stones over the border since the pullout. A Hezbollah
official did not make an appearance until late in the day, hours
after Israeli soldiers had lobbed smoke bombs over the fence and
fired on Lebanese and Palestinian protesters. Once there, he urged
the demonstrators to stop throwing stones and trying to push across
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli force at the scene called repeatedly on the
civilians to leave the area,'' the Israeli army said in a
statement, according to Reuters. ``When they did not obey, the
force responded with a stun grenade and then with shots aimed at
the lower body.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of the militia, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
has said it is to be expected that, after so many years of
occupation and conflict, Lebanese would express anger and hostility
toward the first Israelis many of them have seen.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasrallah also has sought to reassure the Christians who
live in the former security zone, including those who may have had
family members in the South Lebanon army or who may have found work
in Israel during the isolated years of occupation, that Hezbollah
intends to protect all Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   In the south Lebanese village of Qlaia, two of Nasrallah's
deputies, Sheik Naim Qassem and Muhammad Raed, made a point of
publicly reassuring the Maronite Christian residents after their
priest canceled Sunday Mass at his St. George Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who attacks the residents of Qlaia attacks Hezbollah, and
he who violates the people of the south violates the resistance,''
Raed told villagers outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, after meeting with the two Hezbollah representatives
in private, later celebrated Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what led to the killing of a Christian man in
the village of Rmeiche earlier in the day. Some villagers told
reporters that the killer was a Hezbollah fighter who wanted
revenge on the dead man's family, which included members of the
South Lebanon army. Others said the killer had opened fire on a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese police, who have a few hundred men in the south,
called the shooting an ``individual incident,'' and Hezbollah
denied that it had any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 members of the South Lebanon army and their
families fled to Israel during the withdrawal, although the United
Nations brought several busloads of them back to Lebanon Sunday so
they could surrender to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 1,500 former militia fighters had given
themselves up to Hezbollah, which has turned them over to the
Lebanese army for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese now also face the problem of clearing Israeli mines
in the former buffer strip. The U.N. officials who are working
along the border to certify Israel's withdrawal have said mines
threaten their safety and have called on Israel to turn over maps
of the mined areas.

UNCERTAINTY CLOUDS FUTURE OF MOTORPLEX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ Texas Motorplex general manager Elon Werner said
he has heard the rumors about the track losing one of its dates for
2001. He also admitted he does not know what the future of the
Castrol Nationals is, but he has yet to hear anything official from
the National Hot Rod Association about next year's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And that lack of communication is a concern, Werner said.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been much communication between Texas Motorplex
officials and the NHRA over the past few months, Werner said,
adding he has not seen a tentative schedule for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tried to have a number of conversations with the NHRA,
\Rpresident\S Tom Compton and the NHRA hierarchy,'' Werner said.
``We just have gotten nowhere with that. This has not been a
problem that has arisen in the last few weeks. But the realization
is setting in that we have been trying to communicate with \Rthe
NHRA\S and our sponsors have been trying to communicate with \Rthe
NHRA\S, and there has just not been any kind of reciprocal interest
of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorplex president and owner Billy Meyer said Friday that he
would sell the Motorplex if the track did not have two dates next
year. And Werner said Meyer is serious about selling.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider the Motorplex the standard by which all other
drag-racing facilities are judged, with one of the first to have a
wrap-around tower and luxury suites. It cost Meyer around $6
million to build the facility in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a realization of Billy that `I don't want to
fight this anymore,' '' Werner said. ``When Billy says, `Hey,
people are not returning my phone calls and I am trying to get
answers, and no one is getting me answers.' That's a problem. He's
been in this sport for 30 years, and he's seen its low times and
helped it grow.''  &QL; 
One upset, one loss
</P>
<P>
   Reher-Morrison Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen was defeated in the
second round of yesterday's final eliminations by Greg Anderson,
but the Arlington resident said it was a good weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And his first-round victory over No. 1 qualifier Kurt Johnson
may have helped that. Allen, who qualified No. 16, won the race on
the ``hole shot,'' or quicker reaction time at the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's reaction time was 0.408 seconds, while Johnson had a
0.489. Johnson had the quicker ET and speed, but Allen won on the
starting line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our car was a lot faster than 16th, and that was because we
did not make a good run in qualifying this weekend,'' Allen said.
``We made a good run and had a good \Rreaction time\S. \RJohnson\S
made a good run but didn't have a good \Rreaction time\S.''  &QL; 
Tough test
</P>
<P>
   It might have been the toughest test of the all-concrete
quarter-mile Texas Motorplex racing surface since 1986. But after
the final round was over, most praised the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hot and sometimes humid weather this weekend, the
track produced the quickest Funny Car field in NHRA history, and
Gary Scelzi's No. 1 Top Fuel qualifying run was the fastest under
the new 90 percent Nitromethane rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Meyer had intelligence enough to build an all-concrete
racetrack that holds up in this hot weather,'' said Austin Coil,
who is the co-crew chief for nine-time Funny Car champion John
Force. ``The asphalt just does not hold up in this kind of weather.
 &QL; 
Fiery win
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Cannon's first-round upset of Whit Bazemore produced some
fireworks, literally. Cannon won the matchup after Bazemore's Funny
Car suffered a parts failure, but at the finish line Cannon's
Oakley Camaro Z28 caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon escaped the fire, but the car was severely damaged. His
crew fixed the car for the second round against Frank Pedregon, but
Cannon did not leave the starting line after his engine shut down.

TODAY'S FIELD WORTH MUCH MORE THAN A MILLION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ It doesn't take long for jockey Marlon
St. Julien to figure out the event he likes best when he visits
Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the All-Star Jockey Championship because it gives you a
chance to compete against the best riders in the country, a chance
to see how you measure up,'' St. Julien said. ``But this \RLone
Star\S Million Day looks like a pretty good deal.'' In its second
year, Lone Star Million Day appears to placing itself on the banner
of big events at the track. Today's 11-race card features seven
stakes races with purses totaling $1 million. The highlight is the
$300,000 Lone Star Park Handicap, which was regarded well enough by
the North American Graded Stakes Committee that it received a Grade
III status this year. Lone Star officials don't worry that Million
Day will take any of the spotlight from the National Thoroughbred
Racing Association All-Star Jockey Championship, the track's
signature event that will be presented for the fourth year on June
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two different objectives with each event,'' Lone
Star general manager Steve Sexton said. ``With Million Day, we're
trying to get the best horses here for people to bet on. The
objective with the Jockey Championship is to put the riders in the
spotlight and not as much as the horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say this, and we don't always want to be walking around
patting ourselves on the back: This is one of the best if not the
best day of racing in terms of quality racing ever in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Million Day has attracted 61 horses with total
earnings of $15.5 million. Last year, the horses involved had $9.9
million in earnings, so it's an increase of 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Dallas Keen, who has been racing in Texas since the
Class I tracks opened, has graded-stakes winner Allen's Oop in the
Lone Star Park Handicap, and he thinks this is a better group of
horses than the time Skip Away raced in the 1997 Texas Mile the
year before his Horse of the Year campaign and when Real Quiet
raced in the '99 Texas Mile the year after his victory in the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lone Star's always done a good job of getting really good
horses here, at least for the big events,'' Keen said. ``And for
them to have 13 horses in the \RLone Star Park\S Handicap, you
don't see that in a Grade III stakes race.''
</P>
<P>
   The field for the Lone Star 'Cap includes millionaire Classic
Cat trained by Bob Baffert, who also brought Grade III winner
Purely Cozzene for the $200,000 USA Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Luftikus is stabled on the West Coast for trainer Vladimir
Cerin, but he's making a return trip for the Lone Star 'Cap after
racing third in the Texas Mile last month. Luftikus is owned by
Stronach Stable, which also owns Preakness Stakes winner Red
Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton says a return trip by high-profile stables such as
Baffert's and Stronach's is a key toward one day landing a
Breeders' Cup championship at Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting horsemen who operate on the national scale to
come in here,'' Sexton said. ``If we can get them here, we think
they'll return.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's helpful for our chance to get a Breeders' Cup one day.
No horseman on the national scale is going to be comfortable going
to the Breeders' Cup at a track that's foreign to them.''

MONTOYA DOMINATES INDY AND DRINKS HIS MILK 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Storm clouds were about to burst again, but red
rose petals showered first, embracing Juan Montoya in victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled his milk mustache for 400,000 fans, appreciating the
tradition, including the swig of milk, that was the Indianapolis
500, but even more so, he was savoring the moment for what it was:
a dominating victory, regardless of location, regardless of racing
league affiliation, just a Sunday afternoon drive spent looking in
the rear-view mirror and the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya came to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway this year for
the first time, an outsider, from another country, Colombia, but
more significant, from another racing series.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Montoya is the reigning Championship Auto Racing
Teams winner, from the Chip Ganassi team that had won the past four
CART titles but had not competed here since 1996 because of a
political roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   With a mixture of brilliance and assurance, Montoya led the 84th
Indy 500 for an astounding 167 of 200 laps when it finally started
after a 3-hour-9-minute rain delay, and easily finished 7.184
seconds in front of Buddy Lazier. Montoya, who averaged 167.677
miles an hour, won $1,235,690 of the $9,476,505 purse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will take time to realize what I just won,'' he
said. ``I wanted to win here like any other race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazier, the 1996 Indy champion, said: ``When you win this race,
you earn it. He ran a real good race. They've dominated in the
other series. They've won what, 60 percent or something of those
races?''
</P>
<P>
   This year Ganassi decided he would be the first CART team since
1996 to come to Indy, shrugging off the boycott by his league that
began when Tony George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president,
formed the rival Indy Racing League and required different engine
specifications and chassis from CART's.
</P>
<P>
   With the reigning IRL champion, Greg Ray, taking the pole away
from Montoya, race day was already billed as a duel between the
fledgling league and the one with the better-known stars.
</P>
<P>
   John Menard, one of the original IRL team owners, saw Montoya's
overwhelming victory as proof that the newer open-wheel series is
not yet a match for CART.
</P>
<P>
   ``They raised the level of competition to a whole new level,''
said Menard, who fielded cars Sunday for Ray and Robby Gordon.
``It's certainly going to raise some questions about the ability of
the IRL teams to compete with CART. But they were the best of the
best; a very powerful team, a very organized team.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of the IRL drivers saw the race as a duel between the
series, nor did they try to block Montoya and his Ganassi teammate,
Jimmy Vasser. Rather, it was the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was very good sportsmanship,'' Lazier said. ``I was
hoping the IRL guys would stay with each other. But I got hammered
and boxed, and they were all IRL drivers. I wish they didn't have
that good of sportsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, some fans stood and cheered, and a handful of fans
were chanting, ``IRL, IRL'' when Montoya went to victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here like any IRL teams, we weren't here with a CART
flag,'' Montoya said. ``I look at myself and I'm just like any
other driver out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Indy 500 is not just another race, neither is Montoya
just another driver. He won seven poles and seven races last season
in CART. This was his first victory this season, and it came a day
after the Ganassi team had flown to Nazareth, Pa., to run a
225-mile race that was rescheduled from April because of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Although Montoya had the fastest car, he got caught up in
traffic and accident debris and finished seventh on Saturday.
Sunday, he maneuvered through every situation with ease. He started
in second position, and early in the race, when lapping Lyn St.
James, he had to avoid her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyn St. James nearly put me in the grass, that was the closest
call in the race,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 74th lap, St. James and the 19-year-old rookie Sarah
Fisher crashed coming up on Turn 1, cutting short the historical
aspect of having two women starting the race for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya was by that point building his lead. He passed Ray on
Lap 26. Ray crashed on Lap 66, and the two-time Indy winner Al
Unser, Jr. got caught in the debris, which punctured his radiator
and forced an early exit.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya would not be challenged significantly again until Lap
161, following a restart from an accident. Lazier was coming up on
him, sensing an opening and smelling fumes 0.127 seconds behind
Montoya's G Force-Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   By Lap 163, though, Lazier was 0.137 seconds behind. Two laps
later, Montoya edged away again, to a lead of 0.199 seconds. By Lap
171, Montoya led by 2.506 seconds. His teammate, Vasser, was in
second until Lap 195, when he had to make a pit stop for gas.

   ``We tried to stretch the fuel as far as we could,'' Vasser
said. ``It just didn't work out. I'm really happy for Juan. It's
great, the best team won.''

   Montoya became the first rookie to win at Indy since 1966, when
Graham Hill _ another veteran driver but a first-timer in
Indianapolis _ won the race.

   ``Everybody was always interested in political part of things,
but I was not into that,'' Ganassi said. ``This is a big race. I
don't care what car you are in, the outside envelope is that and he
pushed it today.''  &QL;

EVERYTHING COMES UP ROSES FOR THE LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ They strode off the court with wide grins and
wacky statistics, believing that no matter what happened in the
first half, they would prevail against the doomed Portland Trail
Blazers. After cruising to a 103-91 victory Sunday, the Los Angeles
Lakers also believed they had just stolen the Western Conference
finals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Lakers figured on beating the Trail Blazers twice
at the Rose Garden, where the Trail Blazers were 5-0 in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking was as seemingly absurd as Shaquille O'Neal's
making every free-throw attempt, or guard Ron Harper's becoming an
inside force with 18 points and seven rebounds, or Glen Rice's
scorching the Blazers for 21 points, including nine in a row to
start the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But these are once again the ultraconfident Lakers, who toyed
with the Trail Blazers in Game 4 and turned a rugged, evenly
matched series into a lead of three games to one in this best-of-7
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers fell behind by 11 points early, cut the deficit to
five by halftime, outscored Portland by 34-19 in the third quarter
and could wrap up the series at home on Tuesday night in Game 5 at
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gained a lot of confidence coming in here and winning two
games on the road in a pressure situation,'' said Kobe Bryant of
the Lakers, who finished with 18 points after a slow start. ``We
just came out in the third quarter, executed and put it on them.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal led the Lakers with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and he
foiled the Trail Blazers' strategy of fouling him as often as
possible, which began with 5 minutes 53 seconds remaining and the
Lakers ahead by 89-77.
</P>
<P>
   A 52 percent shooter from the line this season, O'Neal made six
consecutive free throws and finished 9 of 9 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, excuse me,'' O'Neal said as he cleared a path
through a crowd of reporters in the Lakers' locker room. ``The big
Maravich coming through,'' he said, referring to Pete Maravich, a
career 82 percent free-throw shooter .
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal added: ``I was talking to my 3-year-old daughter before
the game, and all she said was, `Good luck, Daddy, and bend your
knees.' The first one fell, the second one fell, and I just got in
a rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's mood was as infectious as the Lakers' free-throw
shooting. They made 31 of 34 attempts, including 12 straight late
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neal made his six free throws in a row, the Trail
Blazers also tried to foul Harper, but the veteran also knocked
down six straight.
</P>
<P>
   With his backup Brian Shaw suspended for Sunday's game for
leaving the bench during an altercation in Game 3, Harper was
forced to play 34 minutes. He hit 6 of 12 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably still won't start guarding me,'' Harper said.
``They probably still think I'm not out there. But my teammates
know I can hit shots, and they got me the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked for Portland in the second half. Rasheed Wallace,
who finished with a career playoff-high 34 points, scored 13
straight during the fourth quarter, but all that did was prevent
further embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers shot 29.4 percent (5 of 17) in the third
quarter while the Lakers shot 70 percent (14 of 20).
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have to draw on is that we have the
ability,'' Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``It's not uncharted
territory for us. That's the main thing right now. Our focus has to
be playing one game right now. You don't look at the whole series
unless you're a New Jersey Devils fan. We just have to get one game
and bring the series back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 20 points for Portland. Scottie Pippen, who
was held to 11 points, managed only four in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They broke us down in the second half and we didn't have a
chance to make adjustments on defense,'' Smith said. ``We weren't
that bad in the second half, it's just that they had guys get
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, celebrating his 33rd birthday, started the sudden momentum
swing in the Lakers' favor, sinking his first four shots in the
third quarter. At halftime, the Lakers decided to set more screens
to free Rice for more shots and he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my mind made up I was going to come out and take more
shots and give us a spark,'' Rice said. &QL;

ASIA'S TYCOONS JOIN THE INTERNET RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change age in 2nd graf from 43 to 46.)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In this densely packed city, where property is the
coin of the realm, Raymond Kwok is as close as one gets to royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kwok's 46th-floor office looks out on a forest of skyscrapers,
dozens of them built by his family. Across the harbor in Kowloon
are sawtooth rows of apartment houses, also built by the family.
The Kwoks' real estate empire is one of the largest in Asia, making
Raymond, 46, and his two brothers fabulously wealthy, even by Hong
Kong's baroque standards.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Kwok is worried about something that has
little to do with concrete, glass and steel. ``We always follow
closely what is happening in the U.S.,'' he said. ``In America, we
see how technology is changing business, how technology is creating
a lot of new businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet sweeps across the Pacific, Kwok believes
technology will unleash the same frenzy of sudden wealth and
disorienting change in Asia. If his family wants to keep its place
among Hong Kong's commercial elite, he says, it must join the
revolution. So Kwok, a Harvard MBA, has devised one of the most
ambitious Internet strategies of any old-line Asian company,
creating a diverse portfolio of Internet start-ups related to his
family's business.
</P>
<P>
   The Kwoks are one of several families of Asian tycoons who are
determined not to be left behind. From Taiwan to Thailand, the
region's most powerful families have started a blizzard of online
ventures. Whether their core businesses are in property,
telecommunications or banking, Asia's tycoons are seizing on the
Internet in hopes of expanding their reach and making even more
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Internet is transforming the way business is
done here and elsewhere in East Asia. With its emphasis on speed,
openness and collaboration, the Net is challenging traditional
Asian values of prudence and family control. Decisions, which used
to be made by the patriarch behind a veil of secrecy, are being
pushed down the ranks as Asian companies embrace Silicon
Valley-style management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic Asian family dynasty probably isn't the best
suited to succeed on the Internet,'' said Peter Yip, the chief
executive of Chinadotcom, one of Asia's first publicly traded
Internet companies. ``But I've been amazed by how quickly they've
learned the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sanguine. Despite their chameleonlike
adaptability, Asia's tycoons may have trouble making the leap into
cyberspace, critics say. For the last quarter-century, the tycoons
rode a wave of double-digit growth. In countries like Indonesia,
Thailand and Malaysia, cozy ties with governments sheltered them
from market forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys think the Internet will bring them prosperity for
the next 25 years,'' said Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong publisher who is
putting his media properties online and starting an Internet
shop-from-home service. ``But to unlearn the lessons of the last 25
years is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Lai (pronounced lie) predicts, the culture of the
Internet will erode the dominance of family dynasties in Asian
commerce. By making information widely available, the Web will
gradually devalue the networks of personal contacts _ known in
Chinese as guanxi _ amassed over decades.
</P>
<P>
   Kwok, though, thinks he can ride the technology tidal wave. He
spent much of 1999 in the United States, roaming around conferences
and quizzing entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered some online businesses that play to the strengths
of property owners. One is providing specially outfitted office
space to house computer servers. Another is creating Internet
sites, including chat rooms and bulletin boards, for the residents
of the apartment complexes owned by the Kwok family's company, Sun
Hung Kai Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Kwok packaged his collection of start-ups into a holding
company, Sunevision, which went public on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. While Kwok is the chairman, he has recruited an outside
executive to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind-set of a technology company is very different from a
property company,'' Kwok said. ``We needed to remove a lot of
baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jeffrey Koo Jr., the challenge was persuading his elders
that the Internet was more than a fad. Koo, 35, is a
fourth-generation member of a family that controls a vast empire in
banking, telecommunications, cement and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   In talking with classmates from the Wharton School in 1997, Koo
became convinced that his family had to lash its future to the
Internet. As president of the family's Chinatrust Commercial Bank,
Koo began taking baby steps online. But his father turned down his
first request for $10 million to finance an Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and his brothers were against me doing this because
they thought of it as a form of gambling,'' Koo said. ``When I
would talk excitedly about a new venture, they would look at me
blankly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Koo's case, the elders came around when Microsoft bought a 10
percent stake in his start-up, Gigamedia, a broadband entertainment
and information service. Earlier this year, Gigamedia became the
first Taiwan Internet company to go public on the Nasdaq exchange.
Although it was caught in Nasdaq's downdraft, it is still worth
well over $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Koo is developing online banking and a regional e-commerce
service to complement the family's 75 percent stake in Gigamedia.
Less than two years after his father gave the Internet the cold
shoulder, Jeffrey Jr. said, he now talks constantly about the
cyberworld.

</P>
<P>
   To some students of Asian business, this is merely a new chapter
in an old story. Ethnic Chinese families have traditionally
prospered by adapting to new circumstances. Kwok Tak-seng, the
patriarch of the Kwok family, started as a trader in southern
China. By the 1950s, he had migrated to Hong Kong and become the
local agent for the YKK zipper company of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing more opportunity in property than zippers, Kwok began
building apartment houses. By the 1980s, he was a leading real
estate developer. Kwok died in 1990, but under his three sons, Sun
Hung Kai grew into a conglomerate with interests in toll roads,
cargo handling and mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing about old-economy companies is that they have
profits and cash flow,'' said Raymond's older brother, Thomas, who
oversees Sun Hung Kai's real estate business. ``But old-economy
companies need new-economy ideas to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their rock-solid stature, however, Asia's tycoons face
challenges from a host of upstarts. Lai, the publisher and a
self-styled maverick, offers himself as an example. Last year, he
started a venture that lets customers order groceries and other
goods by phone or over the Internet. The company, adMart, delivers
from its warehouses, cutting out the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the middleman for many of these goods is Li
Ka-shing, a billionaire who owns one of the two local supermarket
chains. When Lai's delivery business began to pinch Li's stores, he
canceled his company's advertising in Apple Daily and Next
magazine, the outspoken newspaper and weekly magazine at the heart
of Lai's company.
</P>
<P>
   For Lai, the lost revenue has hurt. But after years of tweaking
Hong Kong's establishment in his newspaper, Lai relishes mounting a
frontal assault on its most powerful local businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never take on Li Ka-shing before,'' Lai said. ``But if
I'm riding on the back of a huge market force like the Internet,
then even he can't stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Internet is the second revolution to rumble
through Asia recently. In 1997 and 1998, the regional financial
crisis brought many family empires to the brink of ruin. Even in
Hong Kong, property prices plunged by more than half, and are only
now recovering.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, many Asian governments took steps to clean up
their banks, tighten commercial regulations and force companies to
improve their disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the crisis, Asian firms regarded financial disclosure
and minority shareholders as a necessary irritant,'' said Peter
Churchouse, the co-head of research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in Hong Kong. ``Now they know they can't get away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Asia's tycoons were humbled, the crisis did not dull
their entrepreneurial instincts. Watching start-ups like Amazon.com
and Ebay become sensations in America, the tycoons saw a chance to
make a quick score. Virtually every conglomerate rushed out an
Internet unit.
</P>
<P>
   Li Ka-shing started e-commerce ventures through his two
companies, Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings. He also
backed a Chinese-language portal, Tom.com, which prompted a
near-riot among investors when it went public last February.
Tom.com tumbled in the global sell-off of technology stocks. But
thanks to Li's gold-plated reputation, it still trades above its
offering price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hand it to the conglomerates, they've maintained
their position in a radically different economy,'' said Mark Duff,
the founder and chief executive of Boom.com, an online
stock-trading company here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Duff and other independent entrepreneurs fear that the
tycoons are colonizing Asia's cyberspace. They say that the family
companies can soak up money and talent that could have gone to more
daring ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the tycoon-backed ventures are often
unimaginative. Sunevision's concept of providing warehouses for Web
servers was pioneered in the United States by Exodus. Tom.com
promoted itself as a mega-portal for Chinese audiences around the
world. When it went public, its Web site consisted of a home page
and links that went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the initiatives in Asia are extremely shallow,'' Duff
said. ``But the brand names of the families are so strong that it
doesn't matter. They get funded.''
</P>
<P>
   A few executives are trying to force deeper changes in Asian
culture. Richard Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, is building an office
park here. The 64-acre complex, known as Cyberport, is supposed to
offer tenants like Microsoft, IBM and Softbank a campus-like
environment where ideas can be swapped and new businesses hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Just 33 years old, Li is the brashest Internet entrepreneur in
Hong Kong and a symbol of Asia's headlong flight into cyberspace.
His two-year-old company, Pacific Century Cyberworks, recently won
a $36 billion takeover battle for Hong Kong's main telephone
company. Li is also building a satellite-delivered Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   Li epitomizes the contradiction in Asia's version of the
Internet. A scion of the Li dynasty, he has created a cyber-age
company crackling with the energy of employees hoping to strike it
rich on stock options. The company's latest conquest has been
likened to America Online's acquisition of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Li would never have triumphed unless the Bank of China
arranged a $12 billion syndicated loan to finance the deal. And
analysts agree that Li would never have landed such a loan without
his father's connections.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise with the Cyberport. It may plant the seed for a fertile
technology culture in Hong Kong. Yet rivals of the Li family have
criticized the project because it was awarded to Pacific Century by
the Hong Kong government in a back-room deal.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the tycoons stop short of extolling Asian values,
but they make no apologies for their privileges. ``There's a blend
of Western and Asian elements here,'' said Alex Arena, Li's top
lieutenant. ``It's not a question of being like the U.S. It's a
question of cherry-picking from the U.S.''

FRANCE TELECOM REPORTED SET TO ACQUIRE ORANGE FROM VODAFONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to move `$183 billion' from 3rd graf to end of 12th graf,
where it is qualified.)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   France Telecom is planning to announce Tuesday that it has
agreed to acquire Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest wireless
phone operator, from Vodafone AirTouch for more than $37 billion,
executives close to the negotiations said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would conclude one of the most highly anticipated deals
in Europe, which was supposed to attract bidders from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its acquisition of Mannesmann AG, the German
industrial and telecommunications conglomerate, in early February,
Vodafone was required to sell Orange to appease regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies in Europe and even some in the
United States seeking to establish a foothold in Britain's
lucrative wireless market expressed interest in Orange, but the
expected auction never came.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, France Telecom, which had been talking to Vodafone even
before its acquisition of Mannesmann was completed, fired the
first, final and only shot for Orange before its rivals could get
to the table with an offer.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the talks, France Telecom will
pay about 40 billion euros in cash and stock, or $37.4 billion. It
will also assume about 10 billion euros, or $9.4 billion, in debt.
Vodafone, which will announce its 1999 earnings Sunday, will hold
about a 10 percent stake of nonvoting shares in the French company,
though it may eventually have to dispose of its new stake to
placate regulators.
</P>
<P>
   For France Telecom, the acquisition of Orange vaults it into the
upper echelon of European telecommunications competitors, giving it
substantial reach beyond its own borders. Orange has 6 million
customers in Britain plus alliances and other licensing
arrangements across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of Orange, France Telecom would obtain a
``universal mobile telecommunications system'' license to offer
fast Internet access on cellular phones. In April, a British
subsidiary of NTL of New York, backed by France Telecom, withdrew
from the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would put France Telecom in direct competition in
Britain with Vodafone, the largest wireless operator in the world;
British Telecommunications, which operates BT Cellnet; Deutsche
Telekom, which owns One2One; and TIW UMTS Ltd., which is owned in
part by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, another
recent winner of a so-called third-generation wireless license.
Hutchison Whampoa had owned a majority stake in Orange before it
was acquired by Mannesmann in October, which set off this entire
series of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom plans to merge Orange with its own wireless unit,
which includes Itineris, the largest wireless company in France,
with more than 10 million subscribers and operations in Denmark,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. It will
then spin off the combined company within a year, executives close
to the negotiations said, adding that Hans Snook, chief executive
of Orange, would run the new company. Snook had initially been
opposed to selling the company directly to a competitor but has
since become amenable to the deal, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's sale of Orange directly to a rival is a reversal of
its original plan to spin off Orange and sell shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the sale comes as a result of the recent spate of
high-revenue auctions across Europe for the third-generation
wireless licenses _ for mobile phones that may include Web browsing
and video conferences. Vodafone recently paid $9.42 billion for a
license in Britain and is competing for similar licenses across the
Continent. The higher-than-expected license fees have forced
Vodafone to try to raise cash. And amid plunging telecommunications
share prices generally, the company's stock has sharply fallen
since its acquisition of Mannesmann, a deal valued at the time
around $183 billion. On Friday, Vodafone shares closed here at
2.8125 pounds, down from 3.855 pounds in February.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Vodafone said it would sell its entire stake in
Cegetel, a French phone company, to its partner Vivendi. Vodafone
had earlier said it would sell 7.5 percent of Mannesmann's stake in
Cegetel, but it decided to sell the whole stake _ 15 percent _ to
raise more cash. Vodafone also sold Mannesmann's engineering and
automotive unit, Atecs, for 9.6 billion euros to the German
companies Siemens and Robert Bosch in April.
</P>
<P>
   To support its acquisition of Orange, France Telecom is also
going on a selling spree to raise cash. It said on Friday that it
would sell most of its stake in Telefonos de Mexico to raise $1.9
billion. Telmex said it planned to buy the remaining stake for $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is being advised on the deal by Goldman, Sachs;
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette; Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, and UBS
Warburg. France Telecom is being advised by Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, Credit Suisse First Boston and N.M. Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the sale comes as a result of the recent spate of
high-revenue auctions across Europe for the third-generation
wireless licenses _ franchises for mobile phones that may include
Web browsing and video conferences. Vodafone recently paid $9.42
billion for a license in Britain and is competing for similar
licenses across the Continent. The higher-than-expected license
fees have forced Vodafone to try to raise cash. And amid plunging
telecommunications share prices generally, the company's stock has
sharply fallen since its acquisition of Mannesmann,

HALF BAD NOT GOOD FOR BLAZERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The Portland Trail Blazers are convinced they
have it half right.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the other half is killing them. Humbling them before
the home folks, pushing them toward an unexpectedly early stay at
the summer retreat.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in as many home playoff games against the
Los Angeles Lakers, the Trail Blazers saw spirited and crisp play
in the first half dissolve into Paul Allen's worst nightmare this
side of a tech market crash come the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Blazers had a near meltdown in the third quarter
and could never recover, this time falling 103-91 in Game 4 at the
Rose Garden on Sunday to trail the Lakers 3-1 in the best-of-seven
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have outscored the Blazers 61-35 in the third
quarters of the two games in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't played the same way for two halves the last
couple of games,'' Blazers guard Damon Stoudamire said. ``And
that's been the tale of this homestand for us. We haven't been able
to sustain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are uncertain how much to blame themselves for their
second-half troubles, and how much to give the Lakers credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we had played well, if it would have helped
us, as well as they played,'' Blazers forward Scottie Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Lakers stepped up their defense in the third
quarter, holding the Blazers to just 5-of-17 shooting (.294
percent). At the same time, they started converting, hitting 14 of
20 (70.0) to outscore Portland 34-19.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers also turned up the rest of the game, scoring well
in the hustle categories - outrebounding the Blazers 11-5, passing
out 11 assists to their five and blocking three shots to none for
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stepped it up,'' Blazers forward Brian Grant said. ``I
don't want to say we got complacent, but we just didn't step it up
in both halves, and they made us pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a 76-66 lead into the fourth quarter and then
saw the Blazers offense reduced to Rasheed Wallace and four guys in
Portland uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace scored Portland's first 13 points in the period. Another
Blazer didn't score a field goal until Arvydas Sabonis dunked with
2:13 remaining, by then the Lakers were up 101-82.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had started a third-quarter spiral there would be no
escaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third quarter has been our Achilles' heel,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers love to run, but are finding it difficult to get
into a transition game when the Lakers convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming in (at the half) and adjusting,'' Portland
guard Steve Smith said. ``We're missing some shots and they're
making some, where we can't get into transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stoudamire: ``When the ball goes through the hole, that's
going to make it hard for anybody to create anything because then
you have a defense that's set. I think that's what happened in the
third quarter. It was hard for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't figure to get any easier now. Only six teams in NBA
history have come back from a 3-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, we just have to believe in ourselves and know
that we can beat this team,'' Grant said. ``If we don't believe
that, we shouldn't even play on Tuesday. I know the kind of pride
everybody on this team has. We're going to go down to L.A., work
hard on Monday, then go out there on Tuesday and let it all hang
out.''
</P>
<P>
   And they hope, that won't be the half of it.

WNBA EXPANDING INTO THE NEW CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZ ROBBINS  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (A team-by-team look at the now 16-team Women's National
Basketball Association which tips off Monday with the Liberty
playing the Comets, the defending champions. Records and finishes
are for last season.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK LIBERTY (18-12, first in East)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Richie Adubato.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Teresa Weatherspoon, 5-8 G; Vickie Johnson, 5-9 G;
Sue Wicks, 6-3 F; Venus Lacey, 6-5 C.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Last season the Liberty took Houston to three games in
the finals. The center Kym Hampton retired and Rebecca Lobo may not
be available until July, but the reserve center Lacey has been the
biggest surprise of training camp. Crystal Robinson led the league
in 3-pointers last season, and with reliable veterans in
Weatherspoon and Wicks, the Liberty could win a weak conference.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON MYSTICS (12-20, fifth)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Nancy Darsch.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Chamique Holdsclaw, 6-2 F; Nikki McCray, 5-11 G;
Vicky Bullett, 6-3 F.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: This could be the most improved team in the East with
Holdsclaw, the rookie of the year, and McCray, an all-star, joining
Bullett. But they are battling injuries and Bullett is still
playing in Brazil.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO MIRACLE (15-17, tied for third)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Carolyn Peck.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Shannon Johnson, 5-7 G; Nykesha Sales, 6-0 G; Taj
McWilliams, 6-3 C.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: This team has one of the best backcourts in the
conference, with the all-star Johnson and an improved Sales.
McWilliams, who had eight double-doubles last season, brings
leadership. The first-round pick Cintia Dos Santos, a 6-4 center
from Brazil, needs experience but could solidify the frontcourt.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE STING (15-17, tied for second)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: T.R. Dunn, first year.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Dawn Staley 5-6 G; Tracy Reid 6-0 F; Andrea Stinson
(N.C. State '91) 5-10 G.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Charlotte returns most of its core, after trading Vicky
Bullett to Washington, but that core has also been prone to
injuries. The Olympic point guard Staley is recovering from knee
surgery. Reid, the 1998 rookie of the year, is also injury prone
and the lack of height could limit the team.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND ROCKERS (7-25, last)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Dan Hughes, first year.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Eva Nemcova, 6-3 F; Merlakia Jones, 5-9 G; Ann
Wauters 6-3 C; Suzie McConnell Serio, 5-6 G.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Wauters is a 19-year-old who can dunk, but she is
slight and inexperienced. Nemcova is one of the sharpest shooters
and most athletic players in the league, and Jones is a creative
guard. Even though the Rockers might struggle at the point,
Cleveland will be improved.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT SHOCK (15-17, tied for second)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Nancy Lieberman-Cline.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Dominique Canty, 5-9 G; Wendy Palmer, 6-2 F; Edwina
Brown, 5-9 G.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Brown, the first player selected in the draft, is a
versatile addition to a team that lost three Australian players,
who chose to train for their Olympic team instead. But Canty and
Tamicha Jackson, the speedy rookie point guard, will make games
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA FEVER (Expansion team)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Anne Donovan (interim).
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Kara Wolters, 6-7 C; Stephanie McCarty, 5-9 G;
Gordana Grubin, 5-11 G.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Wolters had a strong preseason and will develop with
tutoring from Donovan, the interim coach until the Olympic coach
Nell Fortner arrives next season. McCarty, who won the 1999 NCAA
title with Purdue, will be a draw for fans. But on a down note,
Grubin, one of the best guards in the league last year at Los
Angeles, injured her ankle in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI SOL (Expansion team)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Ron Rothstein. KEY PLAYERS: Marlies Askamp, 6-5 C; Debbie
Black 5-2 G; Sharon Manning 6-3 F.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Askamp, acquired from Minnesota, brings much-needed
help in the paint. Black, the scrappy point guard acquired from
Utah, is recovering from back surgery. The two best players Miami
acquired will not be in uniform: center Elena Baranova blew out her
knee before training camp and Sandy Brodello is training with the
Australian national team.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON COMETS (26-6, WNBA champion)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Cynthia Cooper, 5-10 G; Sheryl Swoopes, 6-0 F, Tina
Thompson, 6-3 F.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Once again, it is the Comets' championship to lose.
Point guard is a small concern, with the former Connecticut star
Jennifer Rizzotti set to split time with the Brazilian Janeth
Arcain.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO MONARCHS (19-13, third).
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Sonny Allen.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Yolanda Griffith, 6-3 F; Ticha Penicheiro, 5-10 G;
Ruthie Bolton-Holifield.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: On paper, the deepest, most talented team in the
league. Griffith is the league's reigning MVP and defensive player
of the year. Adding the former Olympian Katy Steding to an already
explosive offense, the Monarchs have the best shot of dethroning
the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX MERCURY (15-17, tied for fourth)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Cheryl Miller.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Jennifer Gillom, 6-3 C; Tonya Edwards, 5-10 G;
Brandy Reed, 6-1 F
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: The Mercury has been a dominating team in the West
since the league began, and this year should be no different.
Edwards and Reed, coming in a trade with Minnesota as the Lynx's
leading scorers last year, have stepped right in, adding exciting
offense to an already deep team with Gillom and the returning
forward Michelle Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES SPARKS (20-12, second)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Michael Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Lisa Leslie, 6-5 C; DeLisha Milton, 6-1 F; Tamecka
Dixon, 5-9 G.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: An underachieving team that finally broke through last
season, the Sparks could be just as good this year. But four
head-coaching changes in four years have underlined instability in
management. Leslie and Milton are proven leaders in the paint, but
the team might be shaky at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH STARZZ (15-17, tied for fourth)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Fred Williams.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Natalie Williams, 6-2 F; Korie Hlede, 5-9 G; Margo
Dydek, 7-2 C.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: The Starzz are dangerous and capable of finishing as
high as second in the conference, even with point guard Jen Azzi
sidelined until July with a broken hand. With a lot of pure scorers
on this team, Utah could have its first winning season.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA LYNX (15-17, tied for fourth)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Brian Agler.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Katie Smith, 5-11 F; Kristin Folkl, 6-2 F; Andrea
Lloyd-Curry, 6-2 F.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: Agler traded veterans to receive eight draft picks. In
the meantime, Smith, Lloyd-Curry and a fast improving Folkl are all
healthy and will help Minnesota win enough games to stay
competitive in the tough conference.
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND FIRE (Expansion team)
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Linda Hargrove. KEY PLAYERS: Sophia Witherspoon, 5-10 G;
Lynn Pride, 6-2 F; Tari Phillips, 6-1 F
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: The Liberty lost Witherspoon in the expansion draft,
and now she anchors a surprisingly deep team of other WNBA castoffs
and young, versatile players like Pride. Played well in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE STORM (Expansion team) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Lin Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS: Edna Campell, 5-8 G; Kamila Vodichova 6-4 F; Sonja
Henning 5-7 G.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK: This is probably the weakest of the four new
franchises, but Dunn, a veteran coach, should coax some victories
out of her limited talent. Vodichova, from the Czech Republic,
could be the steal of the draft.

SPREWELL IS QUESTIONABLE WITH INJURED LEFT FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ They are reputed to be the kings of adversity,
the team that grows incredibly strong and resilient when its roster
and room for error are chopped short. Whether overcoming the loss
of its star center, making a huge halftime deficit disappear or
ignoring a pronounced height disadvantage to block a jump shot, the
Knicks seem to morph into basketball's version of the little engine
that could whenever necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At Madison Square Garden on Monday, the Knicks will again try to
snuff out long odds in Game 4 of their Eastern Conference
championship series with the Indiana Pacers. With the availability
of the hobbled big men Patrick Ewing and Marcus Camby already in
question, the Knicks received more disheartening news Sunday when a
magnetic resonance imaging test revealed that Latrell Sprewell had
an incomplete fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   It will be decided just before the 5:30 p.m. tip-off whether
Sprewell, who did not practice Sunday, will be able to play. The
availability of Ewing, who missed Game 3 after spraining a tendon
in his right foot on Thursday, and Camby, who sprained the medial
capsule in his right knee on Saturday, will also be game-time
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy, his team down, two games to one, is
preparing as if all three players will miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting any one of them to play,'' he said after
being forced to take the floor so his depleted team could simulate
a five-on-five set at practice. ``I'm watching those guys, and they
have legitimate injuries. I want them to play if they can be
effective. If they can't be effective, then they're going to have
to sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who recorded 32 points and eight rebounds to lead the
Knicks to a 98-95 victory in Game 3 on Saturday, said he injured
himself while diving for a loose ball late in the fourth quarter.
He acknowledged that he could hardly walk Sunday, but disputed Van
Gundy's prognosis and said he planned to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, it didn't feel like much,'' Sprewell said of his
injury. ``Really, it didn't feel like much after the game either.
But this morning it was pretty swollen and pretty stiff. It's
pretty sore. I really can't walk on it good. But I think I'll be
able to play. I'm planning on playing regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who is suffering from acute peroneal tendinitis, said on
Saturday that he would definitely play in either Game 4 or Game 5,
but he was unable to practice Sunday. Before Game 3, he slid into
his warm-ups, got his ankles taped and attempted to jog onto the
floor, but his test run was cut short by the intense pain. He will
go through the same steps Monday and hope for a different result.
</P>
<P>
   Camby, who injured his knee while driving to the basket early in
the second quarter, did not attempt to run or jump on Sunday
either. But he said that if he were a betting man, he would bet on
himself to play Monday. He added that he would force himself to
play if both Sprewell and Ewing were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to be ready to run on it,'' Camby said. ``If I can
run on it and push off, then I'm going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby, who missed 19 games this season because of assorted
right-knee injuries, complained before Game 3 that his subpar play
throughout the playoffs was because of his banged-up body. But he
said there would be no such excuse if he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go out there and lay an egg,'' Camby said.
``I think I can be somewhat effective. I'm going to get something
accomplished if I'm able to go, so it just remains to be seen. I
feel confident. I've been playing with a banged-up knee all season
long, and nothing I think is going to set me back from a confidence
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Knicks have thrived in the face of injury the past two
postseasons, winning four of five games against Indiana without
Ewing, it seems virtually impossible for them to beat the Pacers
with Sprewell, Ewing and Camby on the sidelines. They proved on
Saturday that they could overcome the losses of Ewing and Camby,
who played only five minutes before being injured, but eliminating
Sprewell from the mix may be too much.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the Knicks with just two legitimate scorers in
Allan Houston and Larry Johnson, and Johnson is much less than 100
percent. Halfway through Sunday's practice, Van Gundy pulled him
out because of tightness in his back. Both he and Johnson said he
would play Monday, though.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said he was considering three starting lineups if
Ewing, Sprewell and Camby don't play. He could start Kurt Thomas at
power forward and move Johnson to small forward, start Chris Childs
at shooting guard and move Houston to small forward, or start the
little-used John Wallace at small forward. As he did in Game 3,
Chris Dudley will start if Ewing is absent.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Van Gundy shared a bit of what will certainly
become his pre-game motivational speech with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got to find a way to get even tomorrow,'' he said.
``It doesn't matter how it happens or who plays. The nine that are
left got to be ready to play. You can make all the excuses for
yourself and for your team, and they do absolutely no good. In the
end, no one cares. Instead of making excuses for why they can't,
give them reasons why they can. And I think we have more than
enough reasons why we can, and that's what we've got to focus in
on.'' History is one reason. The others are not so clear.

DEVILS AND STARS TAKE COMMON APPROACH TO CUP FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils consider themselves very
similar to the Dallas Stars, their opponent in the Stanley Cup
finals that begin here Tuesday night. Both teams have proven
goaltenders, solid defenses and explosive forwards. But the Stars
are the defending champions and have more experienced veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas also defeated the Devils the two times they met in the
regular season, but the playoffs are different. Just ask the St.
Louis Blues, who finished the regular season with the best record
in the league and took the first exit in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular season doesn't mean a thing,'' said Alexander
Mogilny, who scored three goals against the Stars as a member of
the Vancouver Canucks before joining the Devils hours before the
trading deadline in March. ``I don't even remember who I scored
against,'' Mogilny said when asked whether he scored against the
Stars' Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great goaltending, mobile defense and guys who can
score,'' Mogilny said. ``I think we have all those things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils finished the regular season with 103 points to 102
for the Stars. They both have playoff records of 12-5. The Devils
eliminated Florida, Toronto and Philadelphia, while the Stars
eliminated Edmonton, San Jose and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Because they finished with one point more than than the Stars in
the regular season, the Devils have the home advantage, but they
have a better record on the road (7-2) than at home (5-3) in these
playoffs. The Stars are 9-1 at home and 3-4 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur's and Belfour's playoff statistics are very
similar. Both have played every minute in goal for their teams in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur has allowed 30 goals to 31 for Belfour, who has the edge
in save percentage, .931 to .923.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has played 125 games in the playoffs and has a record of
73-47.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie is an excellent goalie with a lot of success in his
career,'' Brodeur said. ``He gives his team a chance to win every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the precise words that others use about Brodeur, who
has played 78 games in the playoffs with a record of 46-32. Each
has won the Stanley Cup once, Belfour last year and Brodeur in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   One slight edge the Devils may have against the Stars is an
extra day's rest. The Devils completed their physical seven-game
series against the Flyers on Friday after rallying from a 3-1
deficit, while the Stars edged Colorado in Game 7 Saturday night in
Dallas. The Stars flew to New Jersey Sunday, while the Devils
practiced for an hour Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Devils said they preferred Dallas as an opponent
because of the high altitude they would have had to deal with in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have trouble breathing in Colorado,'' John Madden
said. ``From that standpoint, Dallas is probably better. For us, it
doesn't matter. We have to play our game. We cannot count on Marty
to hold up from beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   When coach Larry Robinson was asked about his Devils' chances
against the Stars, he said, ``Fifty-fifty.'' Most of his players
echoed his sentiment, but some went a little further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry told us that if we put our minds to it we can do it,''
Sergei Brylin said. ``We did it with Philly and we believe we can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' advancement to the finals has been credited in part
to Robinson's tirade after a loss in Game 4 against the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This speech has been blown out of proportion, and I want to
put an end to it,'' Robinson said. ``It's not me who has done
anything here, it's the players on the ice.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The BSD phenomenon traces its roots to the late
1970s, when a group of students and staff at the computer science
department at the University of California at Berkeley began to
develop their own derivative of Unix, the high-powered operating
system developed and at that time owned by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The team was originally led by a grad student named Bill Joy,
who later went on to fame and fortune as a co-founder and chief
scientist of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Though often known simply as Berkeley Unix, their version was
officially called the Berkeley Software Distribution _ BSD. The
university, which held the copyright, sold it for a nominal fee.
From the beginning, it included source code _ the programming
instructions underlying the system _ and users were encouraged to
tinker with it and make their own fixes and enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   The group evolved formal procedures for incorporating
improvements made by others into the core system, and thousands of
programmers worldwide eventually made contributions to the effort.
In effect, the BSD project defined the model later followed _ with
variations _ by other open-source development projects, most
notably Linux.
</P>
<P>
   The differences within the model are important, though. In
particular, Linux's license terms require those who distribute
enhanced versions of the system to make their modified source code
available to all other Linux users, including competitors. That
rule lets everyone benefit from anyone's innovation. But from a
commercial developer's point of view, it also makes it hard to turn
hard work and investment into competitive advantage and profits.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Berkeley license gives developers who build
enhanced products on an open-source base a choice: They can release
the code behind their innovations to the community, but they also
can keep such modifications to themselves, in the form of closed,
proprietary products. Their only obligation is to continue to
credit earlier contributors to the open-source base they built on.
</P>
<P>
   That flexibility allowed some of the original BSD developers to
form Berkeley Software Design and begin selling their own version
in 1991. It has also attracted many developers of ``server
appliances'' _ low-cost, dedicated machines pre-configured for use
as servers _ to pick FreeBSD over Linux; the list of appliance
vendors who've made that choice includes such giants as Intel, IBM,
Hitachi and Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   The whole BSD movement faced a life-threatening legal challenge
in the early 1990s, when AT&AMP;T sued BSDI and then the University of
California, demanding that both stop distributing their operating
systems on the grounds that they violated AT&AMP;T copyrights on Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defense, however, turned the tables on AT&AMP;T by
showing that its version of Unix by then incorporated large chunks
of BSD _ including the crucial code that enabled it to communicate
via standard Internet protocols.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after Novell bought Unix from AT&AMP;T, the case was
finally settled. The BSD developers were required to make only
minor changes, including replacing three files out of a total of
roughly 18,000 in their releases.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the original BSD core group disbanded, but
by then three other teams had already formed to produce new
open-source versions of the system, in addition to BSDI's
commercial version. All three are still active, distributing their
versions of the system online and on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   -- The FreeBSD Project ( &LR; www.freebsd.org &LR; ) concentrates on
standard PC hardware. Not surprisingly, its version is today by far
the most widely deployed BSD release.
</P>
<P>
   -- NetBSD's developers ( &LR; www.netbsd.org &LR; ) focus on porting BSD
to a wide range of hardware platforms, from old Atari game machines
to servers based on Compaq's state-of-the-art Alpha processor.
</P>
<P>
   -- The OpenBSD group ( &LR; www.openbsd.org &LR; ) gives top priority to
security. It has put its software through a rigorous, line-by-line
audit to root out potential holes, and it has built strong
cryptography right into the system.
</P>
<P>
   The history of BSD has been amply documented in print and on the
Web. Two of the best accounts are those by Marshall Kirk McKusick,
a key member of the Berkeley group, at
 &LR; www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html &LR; , and by
journalist Andrew Leonard at
 &LR; www.salon.com/tech/fsp/2000/05/16/chapter2partone/index.html &LR; .

 FREEBSD RIDES THE INTERNET WAVE  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Name an operating system that's distributed
free, maintained by a far-flung network of mostly unpaid
enthusiasts and relied upon by a growing number of Internet service
providers and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you guessed Linux.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that OS has become almost a household word in recent
years, as it has evolved from geek plaything to Internet workhorse
and even (until a few months ago) Wall Street darling.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux wasn't the first freely distributed OS, nor is it the
only one that's caught the Internet wave. An alternative called
FreeBSD and other members of the Unix-derived BSD family arguably
play a more central role on the Internet, even though the general
public has little awareness of them.
</P>
<P>
   The FreeBSD customer roster includes such Internet powerhouses
as Yahoo, the most heavily trafficked site on the Web; Microsoft's
Hotmail, the world's largest e-mail services; MCI WorldCom's UUNet,
a giant provider of Internet services to businesses and to consumer
ISPs; MindSpring, a national ISP that last year ranked No. 1 in
customer satisfaction according to J.D. Power and Associates; and
Verio, a company that says it hosts more than 300,000 Web sites in
170 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has been relying on FreeBSD since 1995, according to
co-founder and Chief Yahoo David Filo. Today, the company has
``well over 1,000'' servers, and about 90 percent of them run the
free OS, he said; the only exceptions are machines Yahoo picked up
by acquiring other companies (most of which will be shifted to
FreeBSD eventually) and a handful running applications that require
other operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started,'' Filo explained, ``it offered more stability
and better performance than anything else we could find, and it's
continued to perform well in those two departments. It's a system
that has always worked for us, and it looks like it's only going to
get better over time.''
</P>
<P>
   So convinced of FreeBSD's merits are Filo and his fellow Yahoos
that they've recently put some of their riches behind an effort to
raise its previously modest profile. In March, Yahoo took an
unspecified equity stake in Berkeley Software Design Inc. (BSDI), a
Colorado Springs, Colo., company that markets a commercial version
of BSD called BSD/OS.
</P>
<P>
   The investment helped BSDI buy Walnut Creek CDROM, the leading
distributor of FreeBSD, and arrange another acquisition that will
be announced within six weeks, according to BSDI spokesman Kevin
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   While it will continue to improve and market its commercial OS,
the beefed-up company also has big plans for the free version: Like
Red Hat, Caldera Systems and other companies that have grown large
by providing added-value services to Linux customers, BSDI plans to
offer professional support, consulting and custom development for
users of FreeBSD.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old company, which already has more than 100
employees and is profitable, also plans to raise additional funds
from venture capitalists to fuel its new ambitions, according to
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Yahoo, the biggest feather in FreeBSD's cap has to be
Hotmail. After all, Microsoft touts its own heavy-duty OSes,
Windows NT and now Windows 2000, as alternatives to Unix, yet it
continues to rely on FreeBSD to manage the mail of Hotmail's 66
million users.
</P>
<P>
   In a revealing message explaining why it hasn't switched to its
home-grown systems, product manager Sarah Lefko said Microsoft is
``committed to providing a stable and high-quality user experience
for Hotmail.''
</P>
<P>
   While the company does plan to switch to Windows 2000 servers
eventually, Lefko noted that such a massive migration can't happen
``overnight.'' She didn't explain why the process hasn't even begun
yet, even though there have been approximately 880 ``overnights''
since the company acquired Hotmail at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Along with FreeBSD and the commercial BSD/OS, the family
includes two other major free versions, NetBSD and OpenBSD, plus
some smaller variants. No one knows for sure how many users the
free versions have, and Stephan Somogyi, a BSD watcher who works as
director of strategic development at a San Francisco startup called
Flying Packets, says, ``I'd distrust anyone who says they have hard
numbers,'' since users can make unlimited copies of the free
versions.
</P>
<P>
   BSDI, however, estimates that more than 100,000 commercial sites
run one or another BSD variant on some 2 million servers. A survey
of major national Internet carriers conducted last fall by
Infonetics, a San Jose, Calif., market research company, found that
roughly three-quarters of these companies' servers ran some form of
Unix, and of these, 15 percent used FreeBSD and 5 percent used the
commercial BSD/OS. By contrast, Sun's Solaris was installed on 45
percent of the Unix servers, but the much-hyped Linux had only a 9
percent share.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, by next fall, the companies Infonetics
surveyed expect to have Linux on 18 percent of their servers and
Solaris on 47 percent; FreeBSD's share is projected to drop to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And a separate survey of smaller service providers, completed by
Infonetics in March, gave Linux a current share of 41 percent of
Unix servers, compared to 26 percent for Solaris, 15 percent for
the older, BSD-based SunOS, 8 percent for FreeBSD and 5 percent for
BSD/ OS. That study also projected that FreeBSD's share would
increase by a quarter, to 10 percent, over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The BSD camp will also get an indirect boost over the next year
as Apple rolls out its next-generation operating system, Mac OS X.
That product is derived from Steve Jobs' old NeXTstep system and,
like NeXTstep, it incorporates a ``layer''' of BSD software, mainly
from the FreeBSD version.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that the BSD camp's prospects are
bright, considering the momentum and ``mind share'' Linux has
acquired and the marketing muscle Microsoft and Sun can put behind
their commercial offerings. Daniel Kusnetzky, vice president of
system software research at International Data Corp., is among the
skeptics. BSD's supporters, he said, ``really have a challenge
ahead of them,'' because their OS is largely unknown to the
information-technology staff at most corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't know about something,'' Kusnetzky said, ``they
won't consider it, and if they won't consider it, they won't buy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   BSDI's Rose, however, is undaunted. Comparing the BSD family to
Linux and even commercial competitors, he said, ``We think we have
a product that's more reliable, scalable and robust for
high-performance, infrastructure-grade computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Filo agrees, noting that his company recently started
rolling out the latest version of FreeBSD, 4.0. Despite all the
competition it faces, he said, ``it seems to have plenty of
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Open source for us has been such a huge benefit, I can't
imagine us moving to a proprietary system,'' he said. ``The only
other alternative is Linux, and I don't see much reason to do that
at this point. As long as FreeBSD continues to give us what we
need, there's no reason to move.''

NEW YORK GOP POLITICKING REVIVES MEDICAID PLAN FOR STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ What a difference a candidate makes.
</P>
<P>
   In state budget talks in April, the New York Legislature was
prepared to have the state join a new program to let thousands of
disabled people stay on Medicaid, the federal health insurance plan
for the poor, even after getting jobs. But Gov. George Pataki's
office balked at the cost, and the plan was dropped, apparently
dead for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it is very much alive again, and state officials and
lobbyists say it stands a good chance of approval. Why? Because its
primary author is U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republicans' new
candidate for the U. S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Lazio was chief sponsor of the bill in Congress that created the
program and set aside $250 million to help states pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican state legislators have said they're aware of the
political value in participating in a bill-signing at which they
would join Lazio, Republican governor and Medicaid beneficiaries,
an opportunity that could prove helpful for campaigning. That
notion, they said, has been enough to sway the governor, a prime
sponsor of Lazio's candidacy, into reconsidering the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the governor's office confirmed that the program
was once again under consideration, but would not say why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the merits _ and we supported it all along _ this
thing is golden politically,'' a Republican state senator said.
``We see that, and the governor sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans, who hold a majority in the state
Senate, may be vulnerable this year and have said they see the U.S.
Senate race as being crucial to their chances in November. George
W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is not
expected to carry New York, so state Republican lawmakers want a
strong U.S. Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That candidate was New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, but he
dropped out after learning that he had prostate cancer. Lazio is
expected to be nominated by the state GOP to run for the U.S.
Senate at his party's state convention in Buffalo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the New York state Senate Republicans assert that Lazio is
just as strong a standard-bearer as Giuliani, they have been eager
to bolster his name recognition among voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicaid effort benefiting people with disabilities seems
made to order, the kind of program more commonly identified with
Democrats. And it contrasts with the image that Clinton is trying
to impose on Lazio _ that of a far-right, ideological conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has noted that she, too, favored the Medicaid
program , emphasizing that it was her husband, the president, who
signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kink, a lobbyist for Housing Works, an advocacy
organization for people with AIDS, said, ``It's pretty clear that
Lazio's entry into the race reignited interest in this.''
</P>
<P>
   In state Legislature conference committees last month, the
Assembly, led by Democrats, and the state Senate agreed to have the
state join the new Medicaid program. But Pataki's budget office
said it would cost the state $24 million a year, twice as much as
estimated by both houses of the Legislature and advocates for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In budget talks, the governor's office insisted that if the
program were to be included in the budget, the Legislature would
have to give up $24 million worth of its pet projects to keep
within the overall spending caps the lawmakers had agreed to. Faced
with that, the Legislature dropped the idea, and the $77.5 billion
budget was approved in early May without the Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past week, as Lazio emerged as his party's
uncontested U.S. Senate candidate, several Republican state
senators _ including two influential Long Island representatives,
Kemp Hannon, the Health Committee chairman, and Dean G. Skelos, the
deputy majority leader _ pushed to resurrect the idea. Officials
say both houses of the Legislature are still willing to approve it,
though that would break the spending cap. The question remains
whether Pataki will go along.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, people lose Medicaid benefits if they get full-time
jobs. Advocates for the poor have urged changing this, so that the
poor do not have to choose between employment and health care,
which they say impedes efforts to move people off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The new program would allow people with disabilities to keep
Medicaid coverage after finding work if they do not earn more than
$45,000 a year. But each state must decide whether to participate
in the program and share in its cost. A disabled person earning
more than about $17,000 a year would have to pay a monthly premium
to stay in Medicaid. The premium would vary depending on income,
ranging from $25 to $333.

ONLINE INVESTING: WHERE TO FIND GUIDELINES FOR CHOOSING AN
ONLINE  BROKER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More and more investors are doing their stock
and mutual fund investing online these days.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why. It's often faster and more convenient, and
it's usually considerably less expensive than calling a broker.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 stockbrokers offering online trading, how do
you pick the broker that best suits your needs?
</P>
<P>
   The choice depends on your investing style. For instance,
lightning-fast trading speed and rock-bottom commissions are the
most important criteria for active traders.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors couldn't care less about those factors.
They look for brokers offering a wide selection of funds with
little or no transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile long-term stock investors often seek out brokers
offering the best research reports.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG PICTURE: The first step in picking an online broker is
getting up to speed on who's out there. The best place to do that
is Gomez ( &LR; www.gomez.com &LR; ). Gomez is in the business of rating
online services of all sorts: airlines, banks, car buying sites,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Brokers under Personal Finance on Gomez' home page to
access their online broker ratings. Gomez ranks brokers both by
categories and by profiles. The six categories include Overall
Score and Ease of Use.
</P>
<P>
   Profiles refer to investing styles and are more useful than the
category ratings. The profiles include:
</P>
<P>
   Hyperactive Trader: Fast trades, low costs and simple operation
are the main criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Serious Investor: Gives most weight to analysis and research
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Life Goal Planner: Most emphasis on mutual fund selection and
retirement planning tools.
</P>
<P>
   One-Stop Shopper: Looks for breadth of offerings and ease of
use.
</P>
<P>
   Start by clicking on the Overall Score category see a list of
Gomez's 20 top-ranked brokers to get an overview of the major
players. When I did, the top five brokers were E-Trade, Charles
Schwab, Fidelity Investments, DLJ Direct and TD Waterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Then click on the each of the profiles to see how Gomez ranks
the brokers according to different investing styles.
</P>
<P>
   From the rankings, click on a broker name for a review of each
broker's offerings, including Gomez's take on their important
benefits and shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   From there you can click on Broker Performance Monitor to see
how fast that broker's site is responding currently and the average
response for the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez includes active message boards for each broker. Click on
``Read what consumers are saying'' to access the message board for
that broker.
</P>
<P>
   The site's ratings are useful for the big picture, but they
aren't the final answer. For one thing, their ratings are too
broad. For instance, their Overall Cost rating combines costs of
stock trades, expenses associated with buying stock on margin and
mutual fund trading charges into a single rating.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt if many mutual fund investors are concerned about margin
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Another downside of relying solely on Gomez's ratings is the
potential for conflict of interest. Gomez sells advertising and
other services to the same brokers it rates.
</P>
<P>
   DETAILED COMPARISON: Take your list of broker candidates to
Xolia.com ( &LR; www.xolia.com &LR; ) for a detailed comparison of broker
features.
</P>
<P>
   Xolia, pronounced ``zoh-LEE-uh'' means ``to choose wisely,''
according to information on the site. Xolia.com allows you to
simultaneously compare more than 80 features of three different
brokers. The site lists just about everything: trading hours,
minimum account balance requirements, stock trading commissions,
options commissions _ you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Find the broker comparison by selecting Broker Decision Center
on their home page, and then click on Comparison Tool. The most
important factors depend on your particulars. Here are some I've
found important.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-In Offices: There are times when conducting business in
person is easier and faster than via the Web or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Cash Minimum: The minimum amount required to open an account
varies widely among brokers. For instance, DLJ specifies no minimum
while Charles Schwab requires $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   IRA Fees: Look for brokers with no annual fees if you plan to
open an IRA account.
</P>
<P>
   Stock Trading Commissions: Some brokers charge different fees
for stocks depending on the exchange where a stock is traded or
whether you place a market or limit (you specify the price) order.
Look for brokers with the lowest ``limit order'' fees if you plan
to be an active trader.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Funds: Mutual fund investors should look for brokers with
the largest selection of funds ( Total Funds). Brokers allow you to
buy and sell a selected group of no-load funds with no commission
(no-fee funds). They charge commissions when you trade other
no-load funds. Give preference to brokers with the largest number
of no-fee funds ( No-Fee Funds) and to brokers with the lowest
commissions for no-load funds with trading commissions (OL No-Load
Commission).
</P>
<P>
   IN THE TRENCHES: Don't even think of opening an account with an
online broker before checking OnLine Investment Services
( &LR; www.sonic.net/donaldj &LR; ) run by Donald Johnson, a retired history
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lists fees and such for each broker, but the most
important information is Johnson's summaries of experiences related
to him by investors actually using the broker's sites. The
information is gritty, down to earth and very relevant to what
you'll experience.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's site isn't elegant and can be confusing to navigate.
The home page starts with a summary of problem brokers and then
lists links to rankings based on several criteria. Select
``Discount Brokers Ranked,'' and then click on ``For an
alphabetical listing ...'' to look up specific brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the home page and then click on ``Help in Choosing a
Discount Stock Broker'' for Johnson's ranking of brokers in
categories such as best for experienced investors, best for less
experienced, best for low commissions and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The information on Johnson's site is updated frequently and is
more current than broker information I've seen elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Internet trading isn't for everyone. It's only suitable for
investors who do their own research and make their own decisions.
You don't get the kind of professional advice that you'll receive
in person from a full service broker.

 TECH 21: WEB GIVES LESSONS IN CIVIC DUTY  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Judging by the Internet ads on TV _ or, for that
matter, the press releases that flood tech reporters' in boxes _
you could be forgiven for concluding that the Internet is all about
e-commerce and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, that's not the whole story. It's also, among other
things, a tool for citizenship: It gives us all unprecedented
opportunities to inform ourselves about public issues, not only
from the thousands of online news and opinion sites, but also
directly from original sources such as government documents and
legal filings.
</P>
<P>
   This week, I want to point out several online documents that
provide interesting background on technology-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Microsoft antitrust case. As you've undoubtedly read,
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson gave clear signals at a hearing last
week that he intends to order the breakup of Microsoft. You may
also have heard that he commended a document submitted by a pair of
computer trade organizations, proposing a three-way split rather
than the two-company solution proposed by the Justice Department,
as ``an excellent brief, excellent brief.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, thanks to the Net you can go read that brief for yourself,
at least if you have Microsoft Word or an Adobe Acrobat reader. As
with most Web adventures, it took a little hunting and a few error
messages, but I finally found a copy that downloaded pretty quickly
at  &LR; www.ccianet.org &LR; , the site of one of the organizations that
submitted the brief, the Computer and Communications Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   As an official  &LR; amici curiae  &LR; brief, it contains a fair bit of
legal mumbo jumbo. But it also lays out pretty clearly the
arguments for giving Internet Explorer to a third new company
rather than, as in the Justice Department plan, to the proposed
applications company.
</P>
<P>
   It also does, in my layman's opinion, a better job than the
Justice Department's six submissions in relating the remedies it
proposes to the facts of the case and the legal precedents.
</P>
<P>
   One passage that caught my attention: In refuting Microsoft's
contention that its abuses cause no harm to consumers, the brief
argues that ``Consumers feel this injury every time another hour is
lost from a crash caused by an operating system that is under no
competitive pressure to improve stability.''
</P>
<P>
   While you're at it, take a peek at another friend-of-the-court
brief posted at  &LR; www.brook.edu/views/papers/litan/20000428.pdf.
 &LR; Submitted by Robert Litan, an economist and lawyer who formerly
served as deputy assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's antitrust division and distinguished
economists from Stanford, Harvard and Yale, this brief makes the
case for a solution that would create three competing
operating-system companies in addition to an applications company.
</P>
<P>
   I'm by no means convinced this would be a better world if we had
three times as many versions of Windows. But the economists make
some interesting arguments, such as the observation that
Microsoft's 88 percent rate of return on its capital and R&AMP;D
investments in 1999 exceeded the average rate of return at other
major corporations by a factor of more than 13.
</P>
<P>
   One red flag: Noting that in many antitrust cases the ``relief''
phase has been treated as an afterthought, the authors urge the
judge to undertake extensive fact-finding and hearings on possible
remedies. Jackson, however, made it clear last week that he has no
intention of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   I understand his impatience, but I'm afraid that in his rush to
remedy, he may miss important considerations and give Microsoft
additional grounds for appeal and obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY ONLINE: If you have any more stomach for legal
documents, I'd also recommend at least skimming through Privacy
Online, a report submitted to Congress last week by the Federal
Trade Commission, which you can find in Acrobat format at
 &LR; www.ftc.gov/os/2000/05/index.htm22. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on a study of 335 Web sites plus 91 of the
100 busiest sites. Its basic argument is that self-regulation, the
approach to privacy protection the high-tech world has advocated
for years, has fallen far short of the industry's promises. In
response, it recommends that Congress enact legislation setting out
basic standards for online information collection and creating a
mechanism to enforce those standards.
</P>
<P>
   True, the FTC found, the percentage of sites that post privacy
policies and various seals of approval from self-styled watchdogs
has grown substantially.
</P>
<P>
   But when the researchers analyzed the content of these posted
policies, the picture looks very different: Only 20 percent of the
busiest sites, for example, have policies that address all four of
the basic principles of privacy the commission recommends.
</P>
<P>
   The principles in question are hardly radical notions. On the
contrary: They're simple ideas _ telling us clearly what
information you're going to collect, how you're going to do so, and
what you're going to do with the data you accumulate, and giving us
some choice about how the information can be used, plus a chance to
correct inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete example: 57 percent of the sites in the random sample
and 78 percent of those in the busiest-sites group allow the
placement of cookies by third parties, typically network
advertising companies, such as the infamous DoubleClick, that use
these bits of software to engage in online profiling. And a large
majority of these sites don't tell their users anything about these
third-party cookies.
</P>
<P>
   I have never considered posted privacy policies an effective
solution _ who reads them anyway, and what guarantee is there that
they reflect what the site actually does? What I want to see are
some simple, straightforward rules _ with the force of law behind
them. It's an approach that seems to work in Europe. Why not here?
</P>
<P>
   After years of supporting industry self-regulation, the FTC has
now come to the same conclusion. Unfortunately, to judge by press
reports, its proposal is going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, ever eager to promote individual rights unless
corporate profits and campaign contributions are at stake, promptly
denounced the report. And the Clinton administration, as usual,
scuttled right along behind, hastily trying to distance itself from
the recommendations of its own appointees.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Republican FTC commissioners filed a vigorous
dissenting opinion to accompany the majority's report. I didn't
think much of his arguments, but I had to chuckle over his name:
Orson Swindle.
</P>
<P>
   NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE: One heartening tech trend during
the past year has been the emergence of ``subscription computing''
_ plans that let small businesses contract with an outside vendor
for a complete package, including hardware, software, local-area
network, high-speed Internet access, tech support and nightly
backup, all for a flat fee per user per month.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, pioneered by Bay Area startups like CenterBeam
( &LR; www.centerbeam.com) &LR;  and Everdream ( &LR; www.everdream.com &LR; ), just
makes all kinds of sense. Few businesspeople would attempt to do
their own plumbing or air conditioning _ why should they waste
their time and talent configuring PCs, tracking down patches and
battling bugs?
</P>
<P>
   The malicious viruses that have wrought havoc in recent months
only strengthen the case for this kind of service, at least for the
vast majority of companies that can't justify the cost of a
dedicated staff to watch for new attacks and make sure everyone's
backed up.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Everdream is announcing a new and welcome addition to its
package: It's putting a series of guarantees behind its promises.
If customers encounter a hardware problem that the company's
technicians can't fix remotely, they promise to FedEx replacement
equipment, with your last data backup already loaded.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a software issue, they pledge never to send you
somewhere else for a solution. And if you're not satisfied with
their response, they say they'll pick up the next month's charge.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, they also promise a month's free service if you're
kept on hold for more than 90 seconds, or they don't reply to
e-mail within four hours. And if you lose a backed-up file and they
can't restore it, you'll be entitled to two months of service
without charge.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, big corporations have exacted such pledges, known
as ``service level agreements,'' from their technology providers.
It's great to see small business at last getting a chance to enjoy
similar benefits.

BIOSCOPE: SOME BIOTECH STOCKS GOT UNFAIRLY TRAMPLED IN
NASDAQ  STAMPEDE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Biotech stocks have been trying to maintain
their momentum, but bearish sell-offs in the broader market keep
dragging the sector down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When investors sour on the Nasdaq, biotech just can't hold its
own,'' said Tom Dietz, a partner with Pacific Growth Equities in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, a 5.5 percent drop in the Nasdaq
wounded biotech issues and spoiled what should have been an upbeat
period for companies fighting the war on cancer. Cancer is the
single-most-important market for biotech remedies, and a steady
stream of positive news emanated from the American Society of
Clinical Oncology meeting in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But investors, spooked by inflation and interest rate concerns,
ignored even the most promising biotech developments.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix Pharmaceutical, for instance, announced positive results
from a Phase III trial of a new chemotherapy drug that kills cancer
cells with fewer side effects. Matrix said it would seek government
approval to sell its new drug.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its stock fell nearly 20 percent last week, to close at
$8.25 Friday. That put the Fremont firm back in the same range
where it was trading in February, when biotech was beginning its
big spring run.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech Inc., which released mixed news on new cancer-fighting
drugs, was punished with a 25 percent drop in its share price
earlier in the week. Genentech plunged after it reported that four
patients had died from a drug designed to slow the spread of cancer
by cutting off the blood supply to tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The stock got hit even though the deaths had been previously
reported and the independent cancer researchers who worked on the
trial said the remedy was so promising _ it added three months to
the lives of people with advanced lung cancer _ they wanted to
continue testing. Analysts were baffled by the market overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out pounding the table for Genentech,'' said Salomon
Smith Barney analyst Meirav Chovav. Genentech recovered some of the
losses, but still ended the week at $102.63, down 19 percent from
the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, Calif., thinks biotech is close to hitting bottom but
said there's no telling how long it will languish at these levels.
Summer is traditionally a slow period for biotech news. The cancer
meeting was supposed to have given biotech stocks a lift to carry
them through the summer doldrums. But that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next six months, biotech could go lower and come back
up or rock along the bottom,'' McCamant said. ``It's all at the
mercy of the larger market trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet biotech retains some positive momentum that doesn't depend
on the Nasdaq or the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, money has continued to flow into biotech mutual
funds, according to Bob Adler, president of AMG Services, which
tracks money flows. The money flow slowed to a trickle by May 17
and may even be negative the next time AMG files a report. But so
far, investors seem to be sticking with the sector.
</P>
<P>
   For all its recent woes, biotech stocks as a whole are still
outperforming the broader markets. One key biotech stock index is
up 11 percent year-to-date, and a second, broader index of 200
issues is down just 2 percent since January. Both measures are
outperforming the Nasdaq, which has slid 21 percent so far this
year, and the S&AMP;P 500, which is down 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If _ and it's admittedly a big if _ the broader equity markets
ever settle down, biotech should be in a position to climb.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the pros advise caution. Dietz, at Pacific Growth
Equities, says this is the time to study the field, look for
big-name companies that have been beaten down from their spring
highs and have started to stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   But since no one can tell whether this is a genuine bottom, or
just a plateau on the way down, don't invest with expectations of a
quick turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick stocks you'd want to own over a three-to-five-year
horizon,'' Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   I'd add my own two cents. Earlier in the year when biotech
stocks were soaring beyond all reason, I warned that the good times
couldn't last. Indeed, the bubble was pricked sooner and with
greater vengeance than anyone had expected.
</P>
<P>
   But now that biotech seems a bit beaten down, it's time to
recall the fundamentals that make this market so attractive over
the long term. The aging of the Baby Boom generation is about to
create the largest market for medicines the world has ever known _
at just the time when biotech firms are showing that they can make
safe and effective remedies from proteins, antibodies and maybe
even gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ when the fickle are looking elsewhere _ is the time for
the disciplined investor to start bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
   STUDY GUIDE: Cynthia Robbins-Roth is one of those people who has
forgotten more about biotechnology than most people will ever know.
Now Robbins-Roth, who runs her own consulting service in San Mateo,
Calif., has put some of her folklore and wisdom into a book, ``From
Alchemy to IPO: The Business of Biotechnology'' (Perseus
Publishing, 253 pages, $26).
</P>
<P>
   The book traces the early days of biotech at Genentech and
Amgen, and leads readers quickly through the technologies _ and
fads _ of the last two decades. The reader will come away
understanding just how long it takes to go from a brainstorm to a
profitable drug.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, for example, scientists got venture capitalists
excited about a new technology called monoclonal antibodies. These
are therapeutic proteins that zero in on specific diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the VCs got Wall Street to embrace the new fad by
taking stock in new monoclonal antibody companies. But during the
long years of proving the new technique, investors lost patience
and interest and the stocks waned in value.
</P>
<P>
   But the story has a happy ending. Monoclonals have finally
started to pay off. Drugs like Herceptin are part of a new wave of
monoclonal antibodies being approved for sale _ fulfilling promises
made a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   With that sense of how long it takes to be successful,
Robbins-Roth surveys the technologies _ like gene therapy, stem
cell research, tissue transplantation _ that are getting people
excited now and may pay off a decade hence.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is energetic, if a bit rambling and prone to
digression, much like a conversation with the author for those who
know her. But for the novice trying to get oriented in a complex
market, ``From Alchemy to IPO'' is like the crib notes of the past
20 years of biotechnology.

EX-MARINE GORMLEY WORKS UP A SWEAT IN CROWDED BUT OBSCURE SENATE
FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ It wasn't much of a spider, but the
pinhead-size critter evidently chose the wrong fist to climb
across.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. William Gormley _ former Marine captain, Villanova
rugby star and jogger before dawn _ was gesticulating over a plate
of fried eggs as he tried to differentiate himself from the three
other Republicans running in New Jersey for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The spider was not helping Gormley make his case. Squish. The
spider was no longer a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   With the June 6 primary nearing, an unwieldy pack of Republican
candidates is struggling against obscurity. More than 50 percent of
potential voters surveyed say they do not even know the Republicans
vying for the seat that Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat, is
trading for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But few homeowners in Chatham who answered a knock on their door
two weekends ago are likely to forget the sight of a sweat-soaked
Gormley bouncing on their thresholds. In his effort to meet as many
voters as possible, Gormley, wearing shorts and sneakers, was
running _ literally _ door to door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this kind of campaigning makes an impression on the
voters,'' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful Atlantic City lawmaker who heads the judiciary
committee in the state Senate, Gormley, 54, is known in Trenton for
his fiery temperament, intense exchanges and ability to strategize
like a military field commander under siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill doesn't bumble or fumble,'' said Sen. Gerald Cardinale, a
Bergen County Republican who is a Gormley supporter. ``When he
focuses on something he wants to get done, it gets done.'' Gormley
has another trait that sets him apart from his primary rivals: a
knack for raising money. So far he has collected $2.4 million; Rep.
Robert Franks of Union County, who is considered the other
front-runner, has raised just under $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that features three moderates _ Gormley, Franks and
James Treffinger, the Essex County executive _ and a former
Libertarian, Murray Sabrin, Gormley's stockpile of cash will buy
the kind of commercials that makes all the difference in a state
that gets its network television from New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As the gatekeeper of legislation affecting Atlantic City,
Gormley has benefited from casino industry largess, prompting some
to question his fund-raising ethics. Over the years he paved the
way for 24-hour gambling and championed another measure allowing
patrons to buy chips with credit cards. He pushed through
legislation that funnels a tax on gambling revenue into casino
expansion, and through his efforts, the state is constructing a
$330 million tunnel that will bring patrons to the doorstep of a
planned casino.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley insists he has never let contributions from gambling
executives influence his legislative work. ``Every vote I've ever
made concerning casinos has been for my constituents,'' he said.
``That's the standard. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of his colleagues in the legislature, both Republican
and Democrat, were critical of his style, no one suggested that
Gormley was under the spell of the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, if Boeing is the largest employer in your town, are
you going to be for them or against them?'' asked Richard Codey,
the Senate minority leader. ``But on the other hand, if he doesn't
agree with the casino people, he'll say so.''
</P>
<P>
   After 23 years in the State House, Gormley is eager to move on.
Not that he has not tried in the past. A 1989 run for governor went
badly (he finished fourth out of four), and in 1994 he lost a
vicious congressional fight against Frank LoBiondo, a conservative
Republican who tried to link him to Gov. Jim Florio and his
unpopular tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley was better financed and better known than his rival, but
in the end he was overwhelmed by conservatives and gun advocates,
who were infuriated by his vote against assault weapons. (In 1991,
a year after that well-publicized vote, Gormley nearly lost his
Senate seat to an unknown Republican whose candidacy was largely
financed by the gun lobby.)
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Gormley has turned his stand on gun control
into a purple heart. At nearly every public appearance, he reminds
people that he was the only Republican to vote for the ban on
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Marine Corps, I fired an M-16, and I've seen
the damage they can do,'' he said. ``I don't think we need these
weapons in New Jersey.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gormley has been around guns and law enforcement officials all
his life. His father was the sheriff of Atlantic County for two
decades, and the family spent most of the year in an apartment
attached to the jailhouse, which is still known as Gormley's Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Local judges would stop by for lunch, and prisoners would
sometimes baby-sit for the Gormley children. For a change of
scenery, the Gormleys would summer at the seaside funeral parlor
where Sheriff Gormley was undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school, Gormley enlisted in the Marine
Corps, where he learned some valuable lessons about the commonweal.
When his commander spotted a package of chocolate chip cookies sent
by his mother, he chastised Gormley for not sharing and forced him
to consume the entire two-pound box as his unit looked on. In
telling the story, Gormley made it clear he was not knocking the
corps. ``I loved being in the Marines,'' he said wistfully, chin
cocked high.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for him to pick up the political baton from
his father, who was also the local Republican ward leader. In 1975,
a week after Gormley's honorable discharge from the military, he
was nominated county freeholder. It was an easy win, and the
Gormley name, he said, did not hurt. ``People down there thought
the world of my father,'' he said. Two years later Gormley was
elected to the General Assembly, and in 1982, he was elected to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Gormley controls all
appointments by the governor and judicial nominations. It is a
powerful post, and colleagues from both parties described Gormley
as fair, someone who rarely holds up appointments for the sake of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But fans and foes agree that Gormley can as graceful as a drill
sergeant. Animated and loud, he has a tendency to bring his face
within six inches of an opponent's in an argument. Often one hand
will grab the other person's arm while his other hand jabs the air
for emphasis. He is the kind of guy who delivers unkind words
through a game-show host smile.
</P>
<P>
   Others say his behavior can be disturbing and self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has a short temper and a long memory,'' said Steve
Salmore, a Republican consultant who worked on LoBiondo's
congressional race against Gormley. ``He's very bright, but he's
very pugnacious and has a tendency to polarize people.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters call his ferocity an asset. ``He's an ex-Marine, what
can I say?'' said his campaign consultant, David Murray. ``He's a
passionate and intense guy. You want a laid-back nice guy who
equivocates, you can have Bobby Franks. But if you want a
risk-taker, someone with courage and character, Bill Gormley's your
guy.''

ALFRED LEVITT, PROLIFIC PAINTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER, DIES AT 105 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfred Levitt, a worldly American painter and
photographer who rubbed shoulders with noted artists in his long
life, died May 25 in Manhattan. He was 105 and lived in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt immigrated to New York from Ukraine in 1911 and became an
artist after serving in the Navy in World War I. In the next 80-odd
years he produced many hundreds of paintings, a score of which are
owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   A Greenwich Village painter friend of his, Michael Usyk,
recalled that Levitt began as a Realist painter, influenced by
Robert Henri, an American artist and teacher, and became intrigued
by Cubism after studying in 1936 in Greenwich Village under the
modernist artist and teacher Hans Hofmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``That introduced Alfred to European Cubist ideas about
painting,'' Usyk said. ``Over the next decade he retained that but
added an American look to his work.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 the art gallery owner and dealer Terry Dintenfass held a
Manhattan exhibition of watercolors that Levitt had painted in the
1940s in Gloucester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levitt was part of a group of painters,'' Dintenfass said at
the time of that show, ``who spent summers in the 1940s
enthusiastically painting in the New England coastal town of
Gloucester. Together they adapted Cubism to American themes and
played a significant role in the Americanization of modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other painters in the group were Milton Avery, George
Constant, Stuart Davis, Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Levitt had one-artist shows in the Ellis Island
Museum in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During his first, hardscrabble years in Manhattan, Levitt
studied art at the Ferrer Art School on East 107th St., where he
modeled nude so he could hear Henri's lectures without paying.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Levitt's career, he recalled last year, ``I met Alfred
Stieglitz when he had the place on Fifth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Georgia O'Keeffe was one of the painters in his
gallery. I met her. We talked about the beauty of art.''
</P>
<P>
   At another time Levitt and the French artist Marcel Duchamp
shared a 14th Street building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a studio over mine,'' Levitt recalled. ``But he was a
queer duck. When he saw me walking up the staircase in the evening,
he'd say, `Good morning.' And if he met me in the morning, he'd
say, `Good evening, Alfred.'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Levitt's artist friends included Marsden Hartley,
David Smith, William Gropper and Everitt Shinn.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II he made frequent visits to Europe and took
hundreds of photographs of prehistoric art on the walls of caves in
France and Spain. For that work he was made a knight of the French
Order of Arts and Letters in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He married Gertrude Horowitz in 1930; she died in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include three nephews, George Neustadt of
Martinsville, N.J.; Jack Levitt of Altamonte Springs, Fla.; and
Harry Neville of Manhattan.

   Richard M. Bloch, a pioneer in the development and design of
digital computers, died of cancer on May 22 in Framingham, Mass. He
was 78 and lived in Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As chief operations officer at Harvard University's Computation
Laboratory in the early 1940s, Bloch helped design and program the
first automatic digital computer, dubbed the Mark 1.
</P>
<P>
   He also invented the procedure for automatic error detection
known as parity check, which is used in almost all computers today.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rochester, N.Y. on June 18, 1921, Richard Milton Bloch
was the son of Harry and Tillie Bloch, who operated a small
printing business. He attended Harvard on a scholarship, graduating
in 1943 and serving in the Navy in World War II. He then returned
to Harvard as a research associate in the university's engineering
division.
</P>
<P>
   Over the succeeding years, Bloch worked in a number of
administrative positions in the rapidly growing computer industry,
including general manager of the computer division of Raytheon,
vice president for technical operations at Honeywell, vice
president for corporate development at the Auerbach Corp. and vice
president of the advanced systems division of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   He was also chairman and chief executive of the Artificial
Intelligence Corp. and the Meiko Scientific Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch is survived by his wife, Ruth, and seven children: Susan
Bloch-Nevitte of Toronto, Charlote Johnson Zembko of Bolton, Mass.,
Lawrence of Belmont, Emily Martin of Bolton, Mass., Debra
Ellingwood of Framingham, Mass., Katheryn Swarts of Houston, and
Richard, of Huntington Beach, Calif. He is also survived by eight
grandchildren. &QL;

THE CONSTANCY OF MEMORIAL DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 29:
</P>
<P>
   This is the first Memorial Day of the 2000s, and thus an
appropriate moment to examine the meaning of past Memorial Days and
to speculate on what Memorial Day, besides its role as summer's
tribune, may mean to us in the future. It is, first and foremost, a
day of remembrance and commemoration, when we honor those who have
fallen in war. It is also a day of reconciliation, and whether we
give credit for inventing the holiday in 1866 to the men of
Waterloo, N.Y., or the women of Columbus, Miss., the original idea
in both places was to honor the war dead from North and South, and
thus heal the wounds of the bitter Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   These two ideas, remembrance and reconciliation, will surely
survive in the century ahead. But there may be subtle changes in
the spirit if not the essential purposes of the holiday, just as
there have been changes in the demography of the marchers. It has
been many years since old men in threadbare gray and blue uniforms
paraded down the nation's main streets.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 20 years at least since we saw more than a few
veterans of World War I. Now the cohort that fought World War II is
diminishing. George Bush, senior, is almost certainly that
celebrated generation's last president.
</P>
<P>
   Our cultural memory is also receding, especially the
recollection of what it was like to have an entire country
mobilized, body and soul, to fight an enemy. The First and Second
World Wars were, to most Americans, unambiguously noble, and so in
its goals of eliminating slavery and saving the union was the Civil
War. But since then our conflicts have become less clear-cut _ most
famously Vietnam, but also to some extent Korea and even Bush's
Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   In this new century, wars are likely to become even more
ambiguous and even less likely to muster automatic support. Indeed,
we already know what it is like to engage in gray wars, rather than
those in black and white _ murky, uncertain yet undeniably
dangerous involvements like those in Somalia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether in such circumstances Americans will
continue to honor their dead as wholeheartedly as they did in the
past. The chances are good that they will. Honor came slowly to the
veterans of Vietnam, but eventually it arrived. Five years ago,
after many delays, a memorial was finally created for the veterans
of Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one questions the validity of a war, it is still
possible to honor individual sacrifice. Indeed, it is obligatory.

CAMPAIGNING ON SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 29:
</P>
<P>
   Social Security has emerged as a critical issue in this year's
presidential campaign, but neither candidate seems prepared to
address the system's long-term financial problems. Instead, Gov.
George W. Bush wants to let individuals invest a small part of
their Social Security contributions in the stock market, where he
thinks they will earn a better return, and Vice President Al Gore
proposes to keep the system largely intact with an infusion of
general tax revenues. Neither proposal will really stabilize the
system in the long run. In truth, though Social Security is
projected to become bankrupt in four decades, the system is not all
that far out of kilter. It would not be hard for bold politicians
to devise a fix.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security may well be, as Bush has said, ``the single most
successful government program in American history.'' It was created
in 1935, during the depths of the depression, to provide a
guaranteed income to retired workers for as long as they lived.
Unlike private pension plans, Social Security benefits keep pace
with inflation and, unlike 401(k)s and other popular private plans,
Social Security benefits do not fluctuate with stock and bond
markets. Social Security provides the majority of income for most
retirees and all the income for about a fifth of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception, the system has taken in payroll taxes from
the working generation and turned almost all of them over to
retirees. At the core of Social Security are the notions of social
insurance (everyone participates in a common plan) and
redistribution (the program tilts in favor of low-paid workers).
The benefits paid to low-paid workers are about 80 percent of their
average lifetime earnings, while benefits for high-paid workers are
about 30 percent of average earnings. The progressive formula has
cut the poverty rate among the elderly by two-thirds, reducing
their poverty to below that of the general population. That is a
remarkable triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The question before voters is whether a program born out of
depression _ when poverty was rampant, few married women worked for
pay and no one had 401(k)s or IRAs to provide for retirement _
needs to be revamped.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for thinking so is the projected bankruptcy _ a
sobering but manageable situation. The system will run surpluses
for the next 15 years, building a large reserve. But in 2010, the
first wave of the baby boomers _ the nearly 80 million people born
between 1946 and 1964 _ will begin to retire and collect retirement
checks. The number of people in the work force for every retiree
will fall from about five today to about three in only 30 years or
so. That, and the fact that people are living longer, will put a
strain on workers to support the retirement needs of the elderly.
The system will begin to run deficits around 2015. By 2037, the
trust fund is expected to be empty.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of bankruptcy, the system is not facing
irreparable financial crisis. Even after 2037, payroll taxes will
cover about 70 percent of promised benefits. Deficits over the next
75 years, the planning horizon for the program, will equal less
than 2 percent of total payrolls _ hardly a catastrophic shortfall.
If the economy were to grow only slightly faster than the actuaries
at the Social Security Administration now project, the deficit
would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   One proposed remedy for financial imbalance is partial
privatization, the approach favored by Bush. Under current law,
workers and employers pay a 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes into
a public trust fund. Under partial privatization, workers could
divert, say, 2 percentage points of that tax to private accounts
that the worker could then invest in stocks and bonds. Workers
would collect less money from the trust fund when they retired,
alleviating financial strain on the system. But they would expect
to more than make up for the loss by drawing from their private
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sketchy proposal fails to answer where he would find the
money to pay retirees as payroll taxes were diverted into private
accounts. But there are other fundamental problems with the
proposal as well.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of private accounts say that investors, based on data
going back to the early 20th century, can expect to earn about 5
percent annually above inflation on a diversified portfolio of
stocks and bonds. By contrast, the taxes they ``deposit'' in the
trust fund will earn an implicit return _ measured in future
retirement benefits _ of only 1 to 2 percent above inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But that comparison is highly misleading. Private accounts
invested in stocks and bonds may well earn less than 5 percent
because the economy is expected to slow over the next several
decades as the population ages and because stock prices are now
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the advantage that proponents cite on behalf of
private accounts is an optical illusion. The trust fund faces the
burden of paying trillions of dollars beyond what payroll taxes
raise over the next 75 years to provide benefits the system is
obligated to pay current and future retirees. The sole reason that
private accounts look like a better investment than the trust fund
is that proponents assume the private accounts would be relieved of
the burden of helping to pay that obligation. But that just
deflects the burden onto someone else, requiring Congress to slash
retirement checks or other government spending, or to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cites as an advantage that private accounts can be invested
in stocks whereas the trust fund by law cannot. But if the law were
changed to let the trust fund itself purchase stocks, as President
Clinton has proposed, it could invest in the markets far more
cheaply than could private accounts. The cost of administering 150
million individual private accounts would be huge, eating away 20
percent or more of workers' deposits. Private accounts could also
subject individuals, including the poor, to unacceptable investment
risk at the most vulnerable time in their lives. Worse, they
undermine the principle of social insurance, setting individuals
off to fend for themselves without looking out for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore proposes to leave the basic system
unchanged and would use general revenues to extend the life of the
trust fund to about 2050. He ducks proposing tax hikes or benefit
cuts that would be needed to solve the system's problems after that
date. Indeed, he does the opposite by proposing new benefits for
stay-at-home mothers and for widows and widowers, thereby
increasing the financial strain on the system.
</P>
<P>
   The wiser solution is for Congress to cut benefits and raise
taxes modestly, which is all that would be needed to close the
system's financial gap. Congress could require all state and local
government workers to join the system, boosting its tax revenues.
Congress could also raise the cap on earnings subject to the
payroll tax, now set at $76,200, to keep pace with the rising
earnings of high-paid workers. It could invest Social Security
surpluses in private, high-paying bonds, or allow the trust fund
itself to invest in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the payroll tax by, say, a half percentage point in 20
or 30 years or transferring a small fraction of general tax
revenues into the trust fund would go a long way toward solving the
problem. If these and similar measures do not close the entire gap,
Congress could hasten the transition to the higher retirement age,
67, that Congress passed in the 1980's. The Social Security
``crisis'' is less drastic than it seems, and can be fixed with
relatively modest changes.
