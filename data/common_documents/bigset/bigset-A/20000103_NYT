   AUSTIN _ For the longest time, the Houston Cougars whirred along
like a sleek, fine-tuned car out for a Sunday drive as they played
on even terms with No. 18 Texas at the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   Then the battery that fires the Cougars _ the senior tandem of
Gee Gervin and Kenny Younger _ went to the sideline in the second
half because of foul problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns used their absence and some inspired defensive
play from reserve William Wyatt to break out of a 57-all tie and
cruise to a 90-80 victory before a crowd of 7,926.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close game,'' said UH coach Clyde Drexler. ``I
thought the difference in the game was the fact that Kenny Younger
was in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that we put in to replace Kenny were not playing at
the same level that everyone else on the floor was. That really
cost us about 10 to 15 points at a stretch in the game that was
really crucial for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although four Longhorns scored in double figures and 7-foot
center Chris Mihm tied his career high and school record with seven
blocked shots, coach Rick Barnes wasn't hesitant about who he felt
was most instrumental in Texas' improving to 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, the most valuable player of this game was William
Wyatt,'' he said of the reserve center who has been injured much of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin and Younger are the fire for the Cougars. But when they
went out, the bulk of the offensive burden fell to George Williams,
who had matched Younger over the first 20 minutes with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt, however, shut down the 6-8 freshman when it counted most.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final 12:22, after a follow tip by Williams tied the
game for the final time at 57, he made just one basket, a jumper at
the 9:59 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role on this team is to play hard and play good defense,''
said Wyatt. ``When I came in, I did what I wanted to do, and that
was to shut down George Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished with a game-high 23 points and 12 rebounds.
Younger had 16 points and Gervin 20 for the Cougars (6-7), who were
held to 38-percent shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Four games ago, Barnes, in an effort to inspire more movement
from the Longhorns, went to a starting lineup that features three
guards, Mihm and forward Gabe Muoneke.
</P>
<P>
   Though it had the desired effect offensively Sunday, Barnes said
it proved detrimental on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have gone to the bigger lineup sooner,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams bedeviled the shorter Longhorns in and around the paint
until Wyatt was summoned from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, meanwhile, got offense from everyone to hit the
floor. Mihm led with 20 points and 13 rebounds, his eighth double
double in 11 games and the 35th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke garnered 17 points while shooting 6-for-10 from the
floor. Backup center Chris Owens (6-for-9 from the field) was good
for 14 points, and guard William Clay added 12.
</P>
<P>
   Texas shot 52.4 percent (54.8 percent in the second half) and
outrebounded the Cougars 46-39.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was upset, however, over a 19-for-30 performance from the
free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured five ties in the first half. And while the
Longhorns were up 36-25 with five minutes left in the half, they
led by only 40-37 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   There were another seven ties over the first seven minutes of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   After the tie at 57, Gervin was called for charging and took a
seat with his third personal foul with 11:17 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Younger was already there, having picked up his fourth personal
at the 15:28 mark.
</P>
<P>
   By the time both returned to the floor, Texas had gone ahead
71-61.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Muoneke broke the final tie. Two free throws by
Mihm with 7:19 left put Texas up 71-61.
</P>
<P>
   A dunk by Darren Kelly (nine points) that finished a fast break
gave Texas a 78-65 lead, and when Muoneke hit two free throws to
make it 82-69 with 2:15 to play, the game was effectively over.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns avenged a 71-69 loss to the Cougars in last year's
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good about the game,'' Gervin said afterward.
``They are a nationally ranked team for a reason. And they play
well. But we have a lot of heart and won't just roll over and die.
We try to play right down to th NO CARRIER

</P>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, CALIF. -- With heartfelt words like ``gentleness,
insight, warmth and love'' readers from all over the country bid
farewell today to ``Peanuts,'' a comic strip with a bunch of
ageless grammar school kids and a grinning, long-snouted dog who
became part of America's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Schulz, after a remarkable run of almost 50 years,
offers his final daily comic strip today. The final edition of
Sunday ``Peanuts,'' which he did in advance, appears Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things I'm going to miss,'' Schulz said
Sunday, his voice cracking with emotion. ``''I've been thinking
about this, and I think what I'm going to miss the most is Lucy
holding the football and looking up and then the big bonk when
Charlie comes down,'' Schulz said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to lighten the weight of what clearly has been the
toughest decision of his life, Schulz said he was coping with his
physical problems ``But the big thing is I lost my job,'' he said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy will be the most sorely missed member of the gang,
judging from more than 350 responses to The Press Democrat's
question, ``Which character will you miss the most?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all I will miss Snoopy -- a dog who was usually
smarter than those humans around him,'' said Laurie Martin of Santa
Rosa. ``Drinking root beer in a World War I tavern or kicking
tumbleweed in a desert or simply waiting for his supper on top of
the doghouse, Snoopy always made me laugh. These are wonderful
memories of characters that have become friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have to hold him back,'' Schulz said. ``Snoopy could
easily take over the strip. I'm sure going to miss all those
guys,'' Schulz said, barely winning a struggle to hold back tears.
</P>
<P>
   For several generations of newspaper readers, today marks the
end of an era. It also is a time for tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Schulz's colleagues pay homage to ``Peanuts'' in today's
comic strips. Garry Trudeau, in ``Doonesbury'' shows Zonker in a
Charlie Brown-style striped shirt, reclining Snoopy-like on top of
a doghouse in an early version of the strip that was rejected as
``too derivative.'' In ``The Norm'' by Michael Jantze, the main
character, drawn as a young kid, stands on a pitcher's mound
watching Charlie Brown heading for the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Although Snoopy gets the most fan mail, readers also identified
with Charlie Brown, Linus, Woodstock, even Lucy, often suggesting
they saw themselves reflected in an emotional mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Simple characters, young forever and rarely swayed by the fad of
the day, spoke to readers' deepest feelings and aspirations. From
Snoopy's rich life of imagination to the dependable frustrations of
round-headed Charlie Brown, Peanuts offered universal truths in
personal, non-threatening portions.
</P>
<P>
   And readers appreciated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have revealed yourself to us over the years and we have
come to love you,'' wrote Jean Langford of Santa Rosa. ``Your
gentleness, your wisdom, your affinity and empathy for the human
condition, your daily interpretation and distillation of universal
problems to a dimension we can understand. What a genius it takes
to transform the philosophy of life and living into Snoopy's words,
and with such humor!''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all larger-than-life praise. Some readers offered
concrete examples of how Peanuts affected their everyday life.
Laurie Brock of Healdsburg remembers how her resemblance to
Peppermint Patty helped her make new friends as a newcomer in the
fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really helped break the ice with the other kids,'' Brock
wrote. ``Thank you Mr. Schulz, for inventing a plain-speaking,
straight haired little girl that looked just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many readers didn't like being asked to choose a favorite
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good grief, Press Democrat! How do you choose which of your
family you'll miss the most? They're all loved,'' wrote Carol Bobst
of Angwin.
</P>
<P>
   Another writer said, ``asking which 'Peanuts' character I will
miss the most is sort of like asking which of my internal organs I
could do without.''
</P>
<P>
   Most letter writers said they understood the need for the comic
strip to end and many sent their prayers for Schulz, 77, who is
battling colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And fans are happy that many newspapers across the country
--including The Press Democrat -- are planning to reprint
``Peanuts'' strips from yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers tried to explain the importance the ``Peanuts''
gang --and in some cases Schulz himself -- has had in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   One letter writer sent money inscribed with inspirational
messages in her get-well wishes for Schulz. One reader wrote the
same letter twice -- on Peanuts stationery -- after evidently
forgetting she had already written and sent it. One woman wrote
that a smile and a wave from Schulz in the rear view mirror of his
car is one of her first and fondest memories of Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers were moved to poetry and a few offered artwork of
their own. Often, letters included descriptions or reproductions of
a ``Peanuts'' strip from decades ago, faded but still attached to
the refrigerator door.
</P>
<P>
   Many letters came from the generation that grew old with
``Peanuts,'' even if their favorite characters didn't. Readers in
their 70s and 80s said losing ``Peanuts'' was like losing an old
friend.
</P>
<P>
   And there were letters from the middle of the timeline. Betsy
Dorsey Schott, 33, of Green Bay, Wis., wrote about her lifelong
love of ``Peanuts'' and her recent ``pilgrimage to Santa Rosa'' to
see where ``my life-long hero lived.'' As he has for so many fans,
Schulz graciously said hello and posed for a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I had imagined, you are a kind and gentle man,'' Schott
wrote. ``I will remember that moment for as long as I live. Thank
you, Mr. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were letters from the youngest side of the timeline as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Fred Matalon of Santa Rosa and his little brother
Jake, 1, collaborated on a letter that says ``We're sad (with a
frowning face). We'll miss the Peanuts. Thank you for the gift of
the Peanuts, Sincerely, Fred.'' (Jake scribbled a little at the
bottom for a signature).
</P>
<P>
   Some writers went so far as to suggest the strip and Schulz are
nothing less than national treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Mansfield of Petaluma wrote: ``In a world of few real
national heros today, you are, Charles Schulz, my hero of moral
character and steadfastness.'' George Lauer is a staff writer for
the Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat.

NEBRASKA BEATS TENNESSEE, 31-21 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ In a game that had the same winner and the same loser
as the 1998 Orange Bowl, if not the same national championship
implications, Nebraska overpowered and wore down Tennessee in the
second half on Sunday night for a 31-21 victory in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After letting a 17-0 lead shrink to 3 points, the No. 3-ranked
Cornhuskers (12-1) pounded out scoring drives of 96 and 99 yards in
the second half and finished the game with 23 consecutive running
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska totaled 321 yards on the ground, led by 108 from Dan
Alexander, who scored Nebraska's first touchdown. Fullback Willie
Miller added 87 yards, quarterback Eric Crouch 64 yards and Correll
Buckhalter 59 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch also completed 9 of 15 passes for 148 yards, including a
13-yard touchdown pass to tight end Aaron Golliday, and was named
the game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally decided to get our power game going,'' Crouch said.
``With our offensive line, we knew we could keep the momentum
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite gaining only 44 yards on the ground, the No. 6-ranked
Volunteers (9-3) put up a determined fight. They scored midway
through the fourth quarter on a 44-yard gimmick pass play to Donte
Stallworth from receiver Cedrick Wilson, who drew the attention of
the Nebraska defense by catching a long lateral from quarterback
Tee Martin. But Nebraska recovered an onside kick and marched
downfield to run out the final 7 minutes 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to spot a good team like that 14 points,''
Tennessee's Coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``When a team goes 99 and 96
yards on you, that's something special. We got another good lesson
tonight. But I'm proud of my kids. They fought to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The game amounted to the national title consolation game between
teams that fell just short of reaching Tuesday night's Sugar Bowl,
which will feature the unbeaten teams Florida State and Virginia
Tech. The Fiesta Bowl also was a rematch of Nebraska's 42-17 Orange
Bowl victory two years ago, which earned the Cornhuskers a share of
the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wore them down a little bit,'' Nebraska Coach Frank Solich
said of Tennessee, which lost six players to injury. ``We're
convinced we have as good a team as anybody. But we go with the
system. We know how it works, and there are two undefeated teams
playing for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   This was virtually a home game for Big 12 champion Nebraska,
whose fans filled three-fourths of Sun Devil Stadium, the site of
Tennessee's national championship victory last year over Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   Field position was the key in the first half, and Nebraska set
the tone with the coin flip. The Cornhuskers won the toss and
elected to kick off, and the strategy worked immediately. Tennessee
went three plays and out, and Bobby Newcombe returned the ensuing
punt 12 yards, setting up Nebraska at the Tennessee 43-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers needed only four plays to take the lead.
Crouch's 30-yard run on a third-and-4 option keeper was followed by
Alexander's 7-yard touchdown run around left end with the game only
3:26 old.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee tried to respond despite a running game that netted
only 25 yards on 18 carries in the first half, advancing to the
Nebraska 17 on the next possession before stalling and coming away
empty when Alex Walls's 45-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide
left.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's Dan Hadenfeld pinned Tennessee at its 5-yard line on
his next punt, and when the Volunteers' drive stalled, Newcombe
dropped back to field David Leaverton's punt. Sixty yards later,
Newcombe had a touchdown return and Nebraska had a 14-0
first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get his club back into the game, Martin was picked off
on consecutive pass attempts in the second quarter, first by Joe
Walker on a tipped pass and then on a difficult leaping grab by
Mike Brown, who wrestled away a deep throw by outjumping
Stallworth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers' kicking game got lucky when Josh Brown's
31-yard field goal banked off the right upright and through the
goalposts to give Nebraska a 17-0 lead. But the ensuing kickoff
went out of bounds, allowing Tennessee to start from its 35 with
1:37 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Martin completed his next six passes, not counting a spike to
stop the clock, and capped the drive with 18 seconds left on a
crisp 9-yard slant touchdown pass to Stallworth.
</P>
<P>
   The defense helped Tennessee on the first play of the third
quarter when Alexander, breaking tackles, was stripped of the ball
by Will Overstreet. Dominique Stevenson recovered at the Nebraska
25 and Travis Henry cashed in with a 4-yard touchdown run as the
Volunteers cut Nebraska's lead to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cornhuskers did not abandon Alexander, who carried on
the first four plays of a nine-play, 96-yard drive that ended with
a 13-yard touchdown pass from Crouch to Golliday. The key play in
the drive was a 47-yard run up the middle by Miller, a junior
blocking back whose previous career-long run was 19 yards.  &QL;

TEMPE, Ariz. _ Dear Mack:
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for last Oct. 23. Thank you very much. Thank you very,
very much.
</P>
<P>
   Regards, Bobby and Frank.
</P>
<P>
   A national champion will be crowned in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday
and, well, sure. The Sears Trophy should belong to the winner of
Florida State-Virginia Tech, at least under the contrived system
that gives college football fans lots of bowls and hype of crowning
a ``true'' champion but in reality offers even more raised
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Seminoles or the Hokies will finish the season
undefeated and claim the title the only way it can be claimed under
the Bowl Championship Series. But calling a single-game national
championship game a ``series'' is like calling Madonna a one-fella
lady.
</P>
<P>
   Play one more at least. Give 12-0 Marshall a chance in a
playoff, for gosh sakes. It earned such a chance as much as
Nebraska or any team that can dust off a midseason loss and turn
itself into a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS only leads to a multitude of questions, not the least of
which was hammered into the collective face of the Tennessee
Volunteers on Sunday night at the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Any time, anyplace.
</P>
<P>
   If another game could be played between the winner of Tuesday's
Sugar Bowl and Nebraska, I take the men of corn.
</P>
<P>
   Under the steady hand of coach Frank Solich, the so-called
Blackshirt defense has proved to be as formidable and unforgiving
as ever. No Big Red news there.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Solich's creative play-calling offensively that won
Sunday night's affair and surely would give the Seminoles or Hokies
a bruising lesson in balance and unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Solich's team tamed the Vols with an assortment of speed and
passing early, then pounded the ball upfield 23 consecutive times
in the second half, slapping the normally tough Vols run defense
with scoring drives of 96 and 99 yards that seemed almost unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols entered the game having given up more than 100 yards
rushing only five times in 11 games. They talked of shutting down
the powerful Nebraska offensive line, even calling the burly lads
``wimps'' for all their chop blocking.
</P>
<P>
   But when it counted most, the Cornhuskers monsters up front
pounded out the kind of yardage counterfeiters would love _ in 10s
and 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers rushed for 321 yards in the game, more than twice
what the Vols had given up in any game this year, and had 469 yards
total. Dan Alexander gained 108 yards on 21 carries, Willie Miller
added 87 yards on eight carries, and Eric Crouch had 64 yards on 17
carries.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vols used the smart passing of Tee Martin to pull
within 10 points with 7:25 remaining, the Nebraska offensive line
squashed Tennessee defensive linemen like it had all night and ate
up the entire clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about playing physical against us,'' Nebraska
wingback Bobby Newcombe said. ``But we were the physical team. We
pretty much dominated the whole game. They really never stopped
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but for a few ill-timed fumbles and an inspired Texas effort
last October ... That 24-20 loss to the Longhorns cost the
Cornhuskers what could have been a fourth national championship in
the decade of the '90s. But that doesn't mean Nebraska isn't the
best team playing football right now.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the sideline in the waning moments of the Cornhuskers'
31-21 win Sunday. There was Huskers guard Russ Hochstein, all 295
muscled pounds of him, dabbing sweat from his brow and shouting
into the camera, ``Hello, everybody! Who's No. 1?''
</P>
<P>
   For the BCS, that question will be answered in New Orleans on
Tuesday night. The rest of us might have gotten the answer Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Hochstein, 300-pound Dave Volk, 295-pound Dominic
Raiola, 300-pound James Sherman, 320-pound Adam Julch and 300-pound
Jon Rutherford sent the normally stingy Tennessee defense sliding
backward all night. It happened only one game after the Nebraska
line did the same to Texas in a 22-6 Big 12 title game rematch of
the October loss that proved to be no match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very physical team,'' Solich said. ``Our guys up front
did a good job of establishing themselves in the second half and
taking over the game. They showed people a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   They showed that given a chance against Florida State or
Virginia Tech, they would do the same thing. Any time, an NO

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ Well, four more victories and the Cowboys are world
champions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, that would require a five-game winning streak,
something Dallas hasn't managed since it last won a Super Bowl four
Januaries ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the first of those wins, the one they needed to have the
opportunity to go forth, is in the bag. The Cowboys gave themselves
at least a chance to atone for a humdrum regular season by
qualifying for the postseason with a 26-18 victory Sunday over a
New York Giants team that had its suitcases packed. Hence, a trip
to Minnesota is in the offing, as is a chance to make history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in a position to do something nobody's ever
done,'' said coach Chan Gailey, who might have put himself in a
position to keep his job after back-to-back losses to the Jets and
the lowly Saints had owner Jerry Jones on the verge of a conniption
fit. Remember, it took a series of correctly falling dominoes the
previous weekend to allow the Cowboys (8-8) to control their
destiny entering Armaggedon/redemption Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of the six previous playoff qualifiers with a
.500-or-worse record has won a game in the NFL's second season _
never mind four in a row. Dallas and Detroit, which revved up for
its own pie-in-the-sky run to Atlanta by losing four in a row,
increase the number of statistically suspect qualifiers to eight.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Cowboys, unlike the disgraced Lions, go in on a
measurable high, although it should be pointed out the Giants
scored 18 points over the last 20{ minutes while contemplating
their pending winter vacation options.
</P>
<P>
   Does Dallas truly deserve its playoff shot? Doesn't much matter.
They got it, what with most of the competition furiously
backstroking out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We earned what we got,'' Gailey said, taking a defiant stance
to a question he interpreted to be hostile. ``Nobody gave it to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, he softened his tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful (to be going to Minnesota),'' he said. ``Now
we're eager to see what we can do with the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Gailey also be personally grateful to remain in Jones'
employ? The owner, as hands-on as they come, was pointedly
defensive of Troy Aikman last week, meaning he blamed the strategic
philosophy rather than the quarterback's on-field interpretation
for Dallas' offensive lethargy of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coach as hard as I can every week,'' Gailey said. ``That's
all I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Aikman insisted the Cowboys always play as hard as they can.
Just some days things fall into place better. Sunday was one of
them. Dallas managed 437 total yards while suffering neither a sack
nor a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   For a half, they were remarkably penalty-free as well, before
committing a more typical seven the rest of the way to maintain
their NFL lead in this dubious-achievement category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play great,'' Gailey said, ``but we played well.
Everybody contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aging war horse Emmitt Smith ran for 122 yards, the same figure
compiled by fresh-faced phenom Jason Tucker's four receptions. Most
conspicuously, Tucker turned an ordinary slant pattern Aikman said
was designed only to give the Cowboys breathing room into a 90-yard
touchdown that put Dallas up by 20 late in the third quarter. And
provided redemption for his dropped TD pass just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of year for the Cowboys. On any given
Sunday, on any given play, you've never been sure of what you would
get, effort- or execution-wise. Dallas hardly resembles Jimmy
Johnson's juggernaut playoff teams, or the one Barry Switzer
baby-sat to a third Super Bowl championship in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their travails, these Cowboys aren't markedly
distinguishable from the 10-6 division champions of a year ago who
lost ignominiously to Arizona at home in the first round. Aikman
endorsed that observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haood (a chance to advance) as we did last season,''
he said. ``The only difference is we're on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this team might have a slightly better chance, never
mind the '99 Vikings' presumed superiority to the '98 Cardinals.
The NFC's surviving six are a flawed lot through and through. That
St. Louis (13-3) could surrender 38 points to the dreadful Eagles
on Sunday _ while claiming these Giants to be the only ``quality''
opponent they beat all season _ proves the Rams' fallibility. It
also sets the most generous curve for the NFC's five other playoff
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys seem closer to being the worst of a bad lot than the
best, but the spectrum is considerably narrower than usual. If 8-8
is ever going to be a good enough springboard for a truly Super NO

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ As impressive as Florida State has been the last 13
seasons, there is something missing _ a shelf full of national
championship trophies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some beautiful numbers and statistics that give many
reason to believe Florida State is the college football team of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive of those numbers are these:
2-3-3-4-4-2-1-4-4-3-3-3.
</P>
<P>
   No football team ever has matched that run of finishes in the
Associated Press rankings. That is 12 consecutive rankings of top
four or better at the end of the season. Florida State is almost
assured of stretching that streak to 13 even if it loses to
Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   During that same stretch, the next-highest number of
top-four-or-better finishes is Miami's six (1987-92).
</P>
<P>
   No other team has more than three in a row, and only two teams _
Notre Dame (1988, '89, '92, '93) and Nebraska (1993, '94, '95, '97)
_ make the ledger with four such finishes in those 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only one national championship (1993) among Florida
State's lottery numbers. So, as close to the prize as Florida State
has been since 1987, No. 2-ranked Virginia Tech can match the
Seminoles in titles with a win Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose, boy, you can bet people will come out with `Ol'
Bowden can't win the big one,''' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden
said. ``I said a long time ago that the only big games are the ones
you lose. Even with all of our wins over great teams, people will
focus on the ones that got away. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the other side of the tracks. I'm not spoiled. I can
live with being No. 2. I want No. 1, but I'm just happy to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden might be trying to convince people that losing this game
would not be that big of a deal, but his players know different.
Finishing near the top is not the same as at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's tough on him because he's had so many wide rights
and wide lefts and he thinks about that,'' senior split end Ron
Dugans said. ``(He thinks about) being in so many national
championship games and not winning them. Being Bobby Bowden and
always being in the top five at the end of the year, I know he's
tired of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to that group of seniors, who as redshirt
freshmen entered the 1997 Sugar Bowl unbeaten and ranked No. 1
before being defeated by Florida in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Junior linebacker Tommy Polley said he thinks this group should
have won another title, as a three-point loss to Florida in the
1997 season finale was the lone blemish for the Seminoles that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State bounced back from an early loss to North Carolina
State last season to make its way to the national title game
against Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl and lost again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team we haven't looked at the game (film) and talked
about it much, but I have watched it 50 times, knowing that we were
there and we killed ourselves with penalties and dumb mistakes,''
Dugans said. ``We're just tired of finishing the season not No. 1.
It hurts when you look at yourself in the mirror and know that
maybe you didn't give it your best or your team didn't give its
best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles said they went into that game unprepared,
overconfident and without the intensity they will bring to the
Superdome on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the main things that got us fired up over the
summer,'' center Eric Thomas said. ``All the seniors made a pact to
get to New Orleans and do whatever it takes to come out with a
national championship. We'll meet again (before the game) to
reflect over the years. It helps (us) focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had an Orange Bowl championship (1996) and a Sugar Bowl
championship (1998), but your career is really judged by whether
you have a national championship ring or not. I don't know about a
lot of programs, but at Florida State if you don't win a national
championship, it's a disappointing year.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, there have been many disappointments for the
Seminoles and Bowden, who has had eight teams finish the season
with only one loss; none has gone unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game will be the third opportunity for the Seminoles'
fifth-year seniors to play in the national title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the other two,'' receiver Peter Warrick said. ``This
is our last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And should they fail, Dugans said there would be only one way to
describe them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one word, I would say underachievers,'' Dugans said. ``That
would mean we were 0-3 in championship ballgames, and that would
hurt coach Bowden, as well as the coaching staff and the team
members, especially the seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very big for me. I am telling guys if we lost, I
wouldn't go back to Tal NO CARRIER

STARS &AMP; STRIPES BEATS PRADA IN CHOPPY SEAS 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Stars &AMP; Stripes is a money boat. The
aged team from San Diego knows when to play it close to the vest
and when to show its cards. In this six-boat semifinal round of the
Louis Vuitton Cup, only two boats will survive, and once again, the
Dennis Conner machine has chosen its moment to play.
</P>
<P>
   With gusty southwesterly winds kicking up a steep chop on
Hauraki Gulf Sunday, Stars &AMP; Stripes showed its mettle in the heavy
stuff by thoroughly thrashing Italy's Prada in boat speed, tactics,
and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 miles of bashing through the chop, Stars &AMP; Stripes
crossed the finish a solid 1 minute 7 seconds ahead of the regatta
favorite, posting its second win in two races, while Prada drops to
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Stars &AMP; Stripes' Ken Read and the Italian Luna Rossa's Francesco
de Angelis mixed it up in a prerace sparring session, with American
tactician Tom Whidden fighting for the left side. Stars &AMP; Stripes
won the left and parlayed it to an advantage all day.
</P>
<P>
   The race started in 18-knot winds, but by the third leg, the big
gusts were busting gear and blowing out sails all over the course
as six boats sailed the same track, staggered by time.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Whidden said, gusts whipped over the 120-foot-high
masthead at 35 knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hairy out there,'' said Whidden. ``I think our
experience in Fremantle (Australia in 1986) helped us out today.
There were times when we were letting out the sails in some of the
puffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars &AMP; Stripes went left immediately and sailed a straight line
until Prada made its first attack from the right, finding itself a
boat length behind. The left was working well early on, as Prada
was forced back to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after split tacks, Prada made another attack from the
right and was content to eventually get in tack behind Stars &AMP;
Stripes, which had developed enough lead to cover only loosely for
the rest of the leg. At the top mark, Stars &AMP; Stripes led Prada by
17 seconds, about 1 1/2 boat lengths.
</P>
<P>
   The first run was the only time the Italians made things
interesting. With their big white spinnaker trying to blanket Stars
&AMP; Stripes, Prada drafted closer and closer, at some points right on
top of the US boat's stern, sometimes jibing into phase nearly
beside Team Dennis Conner.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway down the run, Prada had closed from 120 meters to 50
meters and at the bottom mark, trailed Stars &AMP; Stripes by just 10
seconds. But then Whidden put the blue boat in a groove she
wouldn't slip out of the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Staying left and allowing Prada the whole right side of the
course without covering, Stars &AMP; Stripes turned on the raw speed in
the heavier wind ranges, which is her forte. Halfway up the leg,
Prada's boom vang cracked, though it had little effect on the
outcome, Italian sailors said.
</P>
<P>
   As Whidden capitalized on gains, Prada went looking for
windshifts, then tried to suck the US boat into tacking and jibing
duels. But the margin was too great for these tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the luxury some other programs did, so I think
we built our boat a little more bulletproof than some,'' said
Whidden. ``And Mick Harvey and our shore crew have the gear in good
shape. I think with luck, we're not going to break down. We can
sail in a strong breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' added the 52-year-old president of North Sails
from Essex, Conn., with a chuckle, ``I'm at the age when I don't
need this much breeze to enjoy a day of sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other races, gear breakdown played a big factor. Paul
Cayard led his cross-town rival, Dawn Riley, around the course most
of the day until a snapped halyard tore up a piece of the headfoil
track, and Cayard's crew was unable to raise another headsail.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing his opening, helmsman John Cutler drove the canary yellow
America True past Cayard for an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   On the last course, Japan nearly let Le Defi Francais come back
from its deficit when the jib halyard broke near the fifth mark.
Sending a man up the mast to reeve the halyard as France closed
from astern, it looked as if the race might turn around. But again,
quickness ruled the race, as the Japanese crew fixed its headsail
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The points table now has Stars &AMP; Stripes 2-0, AmericaOne 1-1,
America True 1-1, Prada 1-1, Nippon Challenge 1-1, France 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice for us,'' said Peter Holmberg, Stars &AMP; Stripes
strategist. ``I really like our boat speed. But these are only two
races. We have a lot of racing to go out here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's pairings, the feature match is AmericaOne against
Prada, Stars &AMP; Stripes against France, and America True against
Nippon.

BRUINS FIND THEMSELVES OFF CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins' woeful 2-9-5 slump can be traced to a
number of problems, but none is more significant than the club's
struggle in the faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Jason Allison's wrist injury, the team has one
natural center: Joe Thornton. Everyone else being asked to play the
position is struggling because of the lack of familiarity, which
has led to chaos in the defensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   When you lose faceoffs, you chase the puck virtually the entire
game and the Bruins do it far too often. With Allison out of the
center mix, Dave Andreychuk, Rob DiMaio, and Anson Carter have
attempted to answer the bell, but not one of them is a center, nor
should be playing center.
</P>
<P>
   Penalty killing is a particularly gruesome aspect of the Bruins'
game right now, and that's also tied to losing faceoffs and people
playing out of position.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio, who would crawl through shards of glass on his hands and
knees if he thought it would help his team, seems particularly
stressed at trying to play a position he's not familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very honest, it's tough for me to play there
consistently every night,'' said DiMaio. ``It's just a totally
different position for me and that can be frustrating. And taking
faceoffs, I'm so programmed in my game to be in certain spots at
certain times and to be very effective doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm everywhere and it's just a different responsibility.
To be a good centerman, you have to learn that position real well.
I'm definitely more comfortable on the wing, but as it stands now,
this is what we have and this is what is being asked of me, so I'll
do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge of playing center that is different from
the wing is coverage. Some of the Bruins look particularly
confused, and that leads to opponents being left wide open in front
of the net. As much as he concentrates on playing center, DiMaio
said he finds himself drifting back to the wing out of habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a natural thing to look for my D man and to look for
the responsibility of a winger instead of being in support of our
defensemen in the corner or in front of the net,'' said DiMaio.
``Sometimes I'm a step late in doing that. That gives other teams
opportunities. That's just the frustrating part of it. I guess I'll
get better as time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   In coach Pat Burns's first two seasons, he had a solid checking
combination. Particularly in that first season, P.J. Axelsson, Tim
Taylor, and DiMaio were the most consistent trio and often shut
down opponents' best lines. DiMaio said it's difficult for Burns to
match lines now because of the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a line, the job that we have, I think I'm more
effective being on the wing,'' he said. ``I don't know if Pat
really knows who to put us up against right now, the top lines or
not, just because I'm not in my normal position and we don't have a
set winger on (the right side). There are a lot of question marks.
I have them and I imagine (my linemates) have them also. Hopefully
that works itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio said he believes there has been a bit of a domino effect
because so many forwards are playing out of position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one real natural centerman right now and that's Joe,''
he said. ``And Jason, when he's healthy, but he's not, so he's
playing the wing more or less most of the time. Battling down low
is hard for him. So, it's different positions for all of us. The
penalty killing suffers because of it. Faceoffs are suffering and
time of possession with the puck is suffering because the faceoffs
aren't being won consistently. In that respect, you miss some of
the guys that we had just because of those few reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have played better of late, particularly during
Saturday night's 2-2 tie with New Jersey, but some of their
troubles would be alleviated with the acquisition of a defensive
center. Allison could be facing surgery on his ailing right wrist
soon. But even if he stays and nurses the injury through the
season, he will not be a true center. That leaves the Bruins
hamstrung at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no excuses,'' said DiMaio. ``You're in the position
where you have to do the job, but reality says that somebody
natural in that position is probably going to be more comfortable
and do a better job and make everybody around him that much more
comfortable because you can rely on that. In that respect, I really
feel it's important that guys are comfortable in their positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were trying to remain positive despite their slump.
DiMaio said with the way they've played lately, even though they
are winless in seven games (0-5-2), there are positives,
particularly against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are building toward something, which is good,'' he
said. ``It was a good point to get against a very good team.''

 BOWL-WEINKE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Consider some numbers first. When Chris Weinke
first was being recruited by Florida State back in 1989, his
counterpart at Virginia Tech, Michael Vick, was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When the junior quarterback takes the field in the Superdome
Tuesday night as No. 1 Florida State meets No. 2 Virginia Tech in
the Sugar Bowl for the national championship, Weinke will be 27
years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Weinke,'' said Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, ``is
not a senior. He's a senior citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bowden cuts to the chase. ``Chris Weinke,'' said the
70-year-old Bowden, ``is the best thing going for us. It's his
emotion. His composure. His patience. He has more of an effect on
our team than any one player. Whatever happens out there, he won't
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should he? At 27 _ he reached that milestone last July _
Weinke's story reads like some fantasy camp.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, he was what Vick and most of the players on both
teams are today _ a hotshot teenager with a wish to play big-time
college football.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Florida State with great expectations. But he also
had another itch. Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He was good at it, too. So good the Toronto Blue Jays gave him a
million-dollar contract. He tried it for six seasons. It didn't
work out the way Weinke wanted: with a career in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Weinke had to make a career choice. He could
stick it out for a few more years in baseball, he could give it up,
or he could go back to football _ he still had three years of
eligibility in college.
</P>
<P>
   He chose football, coming back with maturity and money,
something that few college players have when they leave, much less
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Weinke thought his dream would end with a national
championship. Instead, it concluded in midseaason with a
career-threatening herniated disk that not only knocked him out of
last season's title game against Tennessee, but raised doubts about
his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago,'' said Weinke, who is one of the reasons Florida
State is favored to complete its first unbeaten, untied season, ``I
was just wondering if I would ever play again. I didn't know if I
would be healthy again to play for a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Weinke, the Seminoles lost to Tennessee in the Fiesta
Bowl. With him this season, they have won every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him back there,'' said wide receiver Peter Warrick,
``things are different. He reads defenses. He does things. It's
great to have him back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, whose record is 20-1 as a starter, has had a spectacular
season statistically, throwing for 3,103 yards, 255 TDs, and only
14 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Weinke's presence that has made the difference. ``I've
always been a leader,'' said Weinke. ``And I feel I have used that
leadership on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke's tact is matter of fact. He is no wide-eyed college
junior. His relationship with his teammates is based on what
happens on the field. His interests and lifestyle are different
from most of his teammates, who were in grade school during
Weinke's first stint at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke's maturity will be a key factor in Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Weinke is a full-grown man,'' said Florida State
offensive coordinator Mark R`There's not much hair on the
top. He does a super job of staying calm under the pressure
situations. Most kids coming to college have been stars. The first
time they fail, according to fans or the media, they tend not to
respond very well. Chris has been through the bad times in making
the major leagues. He knows how to handle things better than some.
He knows how to handle things he still has to learn. He wants to be
coached. He doesn't act like a kid, so I don't have to treat him as
a kid. He treats everything professionally and that's how we treat
him.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's likely Tuesday's game will be his last, Weinke's
focus is on right now. He has a 12-inch scar down the middle of his
back as a reminder of his athletic mortality. He has the memory of
watching the Seminoles lose a title game a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will approach Tuesday night's game with a degree of
measured excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a human being,'' he said. ``I will be excited. But I have
to control that excitement somewhat to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke is not dismissing what Tech can do to stop him, or what
it can do on offense with Vick to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes the game, the season, and the ultimate moment of
his career are in his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Bowden with a smile, ``is fine with me.''

FULL-STRENGTH CELTICS FOCUS ON DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The last time they played the Cleveland
Cavaliers, the visiting and banged-up Celtics were without Paul
Pierce, Vitaly Potapenko, and Danny Fortson.
</P>
<P>
   They also were without a clue, falling behind, 21-8, eight
minutes into the first quarter, and absorbing a 115-88 pasting Dec.
14.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at the FleetCenter, where Boston will play four of
its next six games, the Cavaliers will see a full cast of Celtics,
who snapped an 11-game road losing streak in their last outing, a
102-94 win at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played great defense against Denver, forcing them to shoot
39 percent after they had shot 53 percent in their previous two
games,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said after Sunday's workout at
HealthPoint. ``We've shown great character at times and now we're
healthy. So now we can get some of our talented players back to go
along with our attitude and become a better basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about anything would be better than what Pitino's team
showed three weeks ago at Gund Arena. ``They just spanked us
big-time,'' said Pitino. ``But we were without Vitaly, Paul, and
Danny, so this time we'll have more strength up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny still isn't in the condition, mentally or physically,
that we need him in, but that's expected after just three games
back, and Paul's ankle is better, but his conditioning will take a
little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino certainly has more options than he did a couple of week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, we're stronger, and we're stronger defensively,''
said the coach. ``What we're trying to do in the new year is become
a different defensive basketball team, where we force the other
team to shoot a low percentage, where we force a team into
turnovers, and where we don't turn it over ourselves. That reaps
the rewards of playing great defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been a major hindrance to us has been our turnovers,
especially in the first quarter. One of the reasons we beat Denver,
very simply put, is that we had only nine turnovers in the game and
we forced them into shooting a low percentage. When you do both of
those things, play great defense and protect the basketball, you
have a great shot at winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker, who has scored at least 20 points in six
straight games, including a 26-point, eight-rebound effort at
Denver, said being more focused defensively is the key for the team
as it tries to make a run at .500 and possibly the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're healthy and we feel like we have a good chance at
putting things together,'' he said. ``We just beat ourselves too
many times earlier this year. The way we beat Denver was a plus for
us, but we know Cleveland can be tough. Shawn Kemp is always tough
and Bobby Sura's been playing very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're feeling more confident and we just had two good days
of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man with more choices is point guard Kenny Anderson,
whose backup, Dana Barros, was sent home from Sunday's practice
with the flu. ``We're deeper now and we'll be more aggressive with
Danny back. He'll help us a great deal,'' said Anderson, who had a
14-point, six-assist game vs. the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, we just have to play some games together and
see what happens. We let four or five games go that should have
been Ws, so hopefully we'll get some of those back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schedule is favorable, but we can't get into a habit of
looking down the road,'' Anderson added. ``Right now, our job is to
beat a very competitive Cleveland team. Our last game with them,
the effort wasn't there. We turned the ball over and they ran us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, who has shot just 14 for 41 in three games since his
return, said while his ankle is heaowly, ``I think I'm
playing better than I expected. But I can always play better. Maybe
the next few games can be the start of something good, for me and
for the team.''

UCONN'S PERFECT RECORD INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
 TECH-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   STORRS, Conn. _ The undefeated University of Connecticut women's
basketball team, which has been atop the national rankings all
season, might have been a little worried Sunday &UR;  &LR; night when No. 3
Louisiana Tech came to town.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the soldout crowd of 10,027 had plenty to cheer about
as the Huskies (10-0) kept their record unblemished and soundly
defeated the Lady Techsters (10-2), 90-63. The crowd cheered when
sophomore Tamika Williams _  been sidelined six weeks with a
stress fracture _ entered the game with 9:20 to go, and practically
gave her an ovation when she scored a basket. They roared more when
bench warmer Christine Rigby came in to play and hit the team's
last 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech, meanwhile, looked nothing like the team that
went to the Final Four last year, or that racked up wins against
Tennessee and defending champion Purdue this season. Instead, coach
Leon Barmore watched sullenly as the Huskies took off on a 16-2 run
and never looked back. By the end of the half, UConn had a 47-30
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did everything a team had to do,'' said Barmore, whose
500th win still eludes him (he is 499-75, and is the all-time
winningest active Division 1 men's or women's coach).
</P>
<P>
   Barmore's team beat up UConn last year, but lost three seniors
to graduation. He acknowledged that even high scorers Betty Lennox
(27 points) and Tamicha Jackson (14) can't pick up all the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not using this as an excuse, but we're a very young
basketball team,'' he said. ``You've got to learn to pass the ball,
to distribute the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributing the ball is what UConn did best, as the team handed
out 26 assists compared with Louisiana Tech's 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting their pressure, and I think we were ready to
play tonight,'' said junior guard Shea Ralph, who had 15 points and
eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   UConn forward Svetlana Abrosimova had 25 points, including three
3-pointers, as she drilled the hapless Tech defense. She said that
if her team had played the way the opponents did, ``coach would
just kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   The UConn defense pressed the Lady Techsters so much that they'd
rush the ball down cour fire away.
</P>
<P>
   UConn made 54.5 percent (18 of 33) of its shots in the first
half to 31 (13 of 42) for Louisiana Tech. For the game, Louisiana
Tech shot just 34 percent from the field, while the Huskies shot 51
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to do it by themselves, but I think we played more
as a team and passed it around,'' Abrosimova said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jackson went down when she attempted to block a
UConn pick. She was helped off the court after a stop in action,
but returned for the final minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Geno Auriemma said he's glad to be No. 1 and
unbeaten, but he tried to put the midseason win in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty good, and I think we're going to get
better,'' he said. ``Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like tonight kind of reinforce the fact that we think
we're pretty good, but we take it with a grain of salt,'' Auriemma
said. ``Sometime down the road, we're going to have to beat this
team again, or somebody like them, so you know, it's one day. We
were better than they were today.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ There are people who fit comfortably into the mold
and others who shatter it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Muggsy Bogues, the 5-3 professional basketball player;
Sonny Bono, the U.S. congressman; Tonya Harding, the trailer-trash
figure skater.
</P>
<P>
   And Sebastian Janikowski, the larger-than-life placekicker.
</P>
<P>
   Much larger.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-2 and 260 pounds, Janikowski looks like he could be a
linebacker. Which is fitting, because that's the position he
jokingly has demanded to play next year to spurn the riches of the
NFL and return for his senior season at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he joking? With Janikowski, it seems, you never can tell.
</P>
<P>
   Back again at the Nokia Sugar Bowl, where his No. 1-ranked
Seminoles have virtually taken up residence in recent years,
Janikowski is a hulking, movable version of Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish-born son of a father who had his own dreams of
becoming a pro soccer player, Janikowski is a combination of the
21st-century American dream, a stand-up comic at open-mike night
and a bar bouncer's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's a party on legs, and the left one in particular
makes most of the noise.
</P>
<P>
   While so much of the attention surrounding the Seminoles'
offense focuses on wide receiver Peter Warrick and quarterback
Chris Weinke, the truth is that the most potent and consistent
weapon in coach Bobby Bowden's arsenal is his slightly
out-of-kilter placekicker.
</P>
<P>
   His accuracy and sheer power make Janikowski, when compared to
most kickers, the same as an atomic warhead measured against a
Civil War cannon. He did not miss a field goal inside 45 yards this
season, while connecting on 23 of 30 overall, going a perfect
47-for-47 on extra points and scoring 116 points.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, an incredible 57 of his 83 kickoffs went into or
out of the end zone for touchbacks, and four of them sailed between
the uprights 75 yards away. Of the 26 kickoffs returned, only four
were carried out past the 24-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makes for a pretty long field for the other guys,'' Bowden
said in his down-home drawl.
</P>
<P>
   One day a couple of special-teamers and assistant coaches got
into a discussion about how much they would have to be paid to take
the place of the football and be on the receiving end of one of
Janikowski's kicks. $100,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it would cost more than that to put the body parts
back together,'' said safety Jean Jeune.
</P>
<P>
   Boom! It is a deafening roar up close and often can be heard in
the stands when Janikowski's left foot connects with the football.
He once broke several of an opponent's ribs with an inadvertent
kick in a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have good time,'' he says with strong traces of his Polish
accent. ``I can kick any ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Boom! It is the roar of life anywhere near Janikowski, who
admits he barely tolerates the school part of going to college and
is always on the lookout for his next good time.
</P>
<P>
   Last season as a sophomore, Janikowski kicked three field goals
in the Noles' 23-12 win at Florida, then turned to the opposing
sideline to mock coach Steve Spurrier and the Gators fans by
opening and closing his arms in a version of the Gators chomp.
</P>
<P>
   He shaves his head and looks like a pro wrestler. He got into a
scrape at a bar last summer and was slapped with a misdemeanor
charge of disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not understand,'' Janikowski said. ``Do not know my
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy,'' said long snapper Clay Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski emigrated from Poland to Florida in 1994 and at age
17 turned down a $2 million offer to play professional soccer in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money isn't everything,'' he said. ``Besides, I just get to
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody showed Janikowski a football. He kicked it. It made the
sound of a shotgun blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can kick football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he told coach Kerry Kramer the day he showed up at
practice at Seabreeze High in Daytona Beach wearing jeans and
sneakers. One look at balls sailing 70 and 80 yards, and Kramer had
himself a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Bowden. A Florida State assistant scouted a game in
which Janikowski boomed a 60-yard field goal and barely missed from
71 yards. The assistant rushed back to Tallahassee with a tape for
Bowden, who insisted he already had his kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just watch, coach,'' the assistant begged.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden did.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing sitting here?'' Bowden soon bellowed. ``Go
sign that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the kid is projected as an early second- or maybe even late
first-round draft choice by NFL expert Mel Kiper Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he can play linebacker?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm going pro,'' Janikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   To break the bank, break records, maybe a few ribs and ce NO

SEAHAWKS FILL OPEN SPACE BETWEEN DOWN AND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They say it doesn't matter how they got
into the playoffs. The Seahawks say what matters is, they're in.
</P>
<P>
   After stinking up the other half of Jersey Sunday in a 19-9 loss
to the New York Jets _ and still making the playoffs, thanks to the
cursed (?) Raiders _ what else can the Seahawks say?
</P>
<P>
   That as one of the coldest teams heading into the postseason,
they'll decline the invitation until they figure out exactly what
Mike Holmgren and the new coaching staff are asking them to do?
</P>
<P>
   That they'll wait until their defense can stop the run? Until
arm tackling is in vogue?
</P>
<P>
   Until Jon Kitna and his many-man catching crew can hook up for
something resembling a touchdown drive?
</P>
<P>
   Until someone can get a play into the huddle before Kitna has to
burn timeouts?
</P>
<P>
   Until Joey Galloway is either a true deep threat or trade bait
for future draft picks whom Holmgren can actually put to work in
his by-the-book West Coast offense?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   They're in, baby. They're in because the Raiders lived by Al
Davis' credo: Just win, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Who ever would have thought that the Seahawks would have warm
and fuzzy feelings for the Raiders' quirky owner?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as luck would have it, the Seahawks get the Dolphins _
the other coldest team in the NFL heading into the first playoffs
of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Da Fish. With Dan Marino wearing more protective gear than
Seattle police during the WTO riots. With Jimmy Johnson so
exasperated that the National Weather Service has issued a warning
for the possible eruption of Johnson's infamous coiffure.
</P>
<P>
   And break out the ``Huard Brothers Reunited'' feature stories,
grandma.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even addressed the ``Kingdome Lives'' theme yet.
</P>
<P>
   But we will.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you know we will.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the real season,'' Chad Brown said after the Hawks
backed into the playoffs like a broken-down Trailways bus limping
into the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preseason is fake and the regular season is just a chance
to see who gets into the real season. And it's a whole different
level of football coming up,'' said the former Steeler, who knows
what it's like when you get to January in the NFL. ``This is what
it's all about. This is why you play football.''
</P>
<P>
   But even knowing what he knows about how tough playoff football
gets, not even Brown was willing to toss this opportunity back like
some undersized steelhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the season, there's only one team out there, and
we now have a chance to be one of those teams,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that would be talk about the road to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And who are we to argue?
</P>
<P>
   Who are we to point out that it was a bit odd, the way the
Seahawks expended more energy cheering when the Raiders beat the
Chiefs in overtime than they did during their own critical game at
the Meadowlands, when their fate was in their own hands?
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the weirdest scenes in recent sporting memory.
</P>
<P>
   After the lackluster game, some Seahawks players dressed and
quickly headed out to the team bus as the Raiders-Chiefs game was
still going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I watch somebody else's game?'' Ricky Watters said
in an angry huff as he exited the locker room before knowing the
Seahawks' fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I watch to see if somebody else is going to lose
when we didn't go out there and take care of our own business?''
</P>
<P>
   In his frustration and anger, Watters was on the right track _
unwilling to accept that the only way the Hawks would make the
postseason is if somebody else did them a favor.
</P>
<P>
   And inside the locker room, as the other half of the team
watched and waited, veteran receiver Mike Pritchard said he was
shocked by the contrast between the Seahawks he saw during the game
and the ones celebrating after the Raiders' hit the game-winning
field goal to beat the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was this energy on the sideline? Where was this energy
during the game?'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have words to describe it but how can this team play
like it did last week against Kansas City and then come out here
today and lay an egg like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this unpleasant moment of truth will have a short
lifespan.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger reality may have been unthinkable without the help of
the Raiders, but the bigger reality is that the Hawks have survived
_ a feat capable of prompting a party mood.
</P>
<P>
   It's been so long since Seattle has had a whiff of a playoff
game, the town's going to have little choice but to go ga-ga over
the first NFL postseason game at the soon-to-be-doomed Kingdome
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Now Seattle can have a little bit of faux New Year's a little
too late, but maybe the city deserves a break.
</P>
<P>
   After the ugliness of the WTO riots and then the threat of
terrorism that forced a frightened Mayor Paul Schell to cancel the
Seattle Center New Year's celebration, maybe this is the payback
Seattle gets for being the world's Y2K sacrificial lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butts kicked,'' Christian Fauria said after the
news was in from Kansas City. ``But I couldn't care less how we got
in.''
</P>
<P>
   They say it doesn't matter how it happened, just that it did.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the Dolphins. Break out the hats and confetti. By the
opening kickoff in the Kingdome next Sunday, no one's going to
remember the Hawks almost didn't make it there.

HUMBLED HAWKS BACK INTO PLAYOFFS, THANKS TO RAIDERS' WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Maybe there is something to this Mike
Holmgren magic stuff after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks had just laid an egg in their 19-9 loss to the New
York Jets Sunday in Giants Stadium, a loss so sorry that it should
have ended Seattle's season.
</P>
<P>
   But right in the middle of offering what was as much an apology
as it was an explanation, quarterback Jon Kitna discovered the
Oakland Raiders had just kicked a field goal in overtime to defeat
the Kansas City Chiefs, 41-38.
</P>
<P>
   The double setbacks gave the Seahawks the AFC West championship
and lifted them into the playoffs for the first time since 1988 _
which also happens to be the last time the Raiders beat the Chiefs
in Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? You go from the depths of despair to
euphoria,'' said Holmgren, who is six days shy of completing his
first year as coach and general manager of a franchise that hadn't
tasted so much as a winning season since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed in how we played today, and I think we're
capable of (playing) better.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how poorly the Seahawks played Sunday, and have
played in dropping five of their final six regular-season games,
they will host the Miami Dolphins in the Kingdome next Sunday. It
will be the Seahawks' first home playoff game since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to control your own destiny,'' Kitna said. ``But on
the other hand, I don't care how we get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna's postgame postmortem was interrupted by shouts and
cheering from the next room, where teammates were watching the
Raiders do them a huge favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was saying,'' offered Kitna, his solemn expression
quickly replaced by a huge grin, ``the next season just started.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is any consolation on this day when the Seahawks were
handed the ultimate consolation prize, the Dolphins also are
entering the playoffs through the back door. Once 7-1, Miami needed
either a loss by the Seahawks or the Chiefs to earn a playoff spot.
The Dolphins' 21-10 loss to the Redskins Sunday also was their
fifth in the past six games and left them 9-7 as well.
</P>
<P>
   That old saying about anything happening once a team makes the
playoffs proved true for the Seahawks and Dolphins when the
Raiders, a team that has struggled with its field-goal kickers all
season, got a 33-yarder from recently signed Joe Nedney to oust the
Chiefs, 41-38.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying, `Please don't let me go in the tank again,'''
said defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy, who will play in the first
playoff game of his 10-year career. ``I've been in the tank 10
years and I was just about to go in the tank again. But the Raiders
pulled me out.''
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Seahawks were not kidding themselves about
being playoff-ready or worthy after the odd twist of events Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly thought things had changed around here. I honestly
thought there was an opportunity to do something special,'' wide
receiver Mike Pritchard said. ``Nobody came to play. People who
were on the field, I don't know if they couldn't figure out the
importance of the game or what it was. But nobody came to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sad to say, but it's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Harsh words to match what was harsh reality for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was shredded by Jets running back Curtis Martin, who
carried the ball 34 times for 158 yards and the only touchdown of
the game and also caught three passes for 45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just small little breakdowns by different guys,'' said
Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown, who finished as the team's leading
tackler for the third consecutive season. ``I definitely had my
share of breakdowns today. I didn't play even what I would call an
average game for me. It was below average. I offer no excuses in
that I didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   More honesty from the leader of a defense that allowed the Jets
to control the ball for 37{ minutes and compile 379 yards _ in part
because Jets quarterback Ray Lucas hit some passes at critical
junctures.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' offense, meanwhile, failed to score a touchdown
for the second time in six weeks, but for only the third time in
the past 32 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming down the stretch, I didn't play well,'' Kitna said
after his 21 of 45, 237-yard performance that included missed
throws and dropped passes. ``We just couldn't make the plays. I
couldn't make the right throws. It just didn't happen at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   More honesty from the leader of an offense who completed 12 of
16 passes in leading the Seahawks on drives to three field goals,
but could generate only 103 yards on the team's other nine
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the sum of these numbers added up to the Seahawks'
first playoff berth since '88, ending the longest postseason
drought in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have gone in kicking through the door
today,'' said Holmgren, who led the Packers into the playoffs in
each of his final six seasons in Green Bay. ``We didn't do that.
But, hey, I'll take it.''

PATRIOTS TRIUMPH, BUT CARROLL STILL MAY GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll will have a breakup meeting
with his players Monday morning and also meet with the Patriots'
management team later in the day. The speculation is that Carroll
will come out of the meetings without his head coaching job, and
that he's headed to either the Washington Redskins or the Seattle
Seahawks to be an assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement was thought to be former Patriots assistant Bill
Belichick, but people close to Jets head coach Bill Parcells said
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night they expect him to retire Monday, handing the Jets
job to Belichick. The Jets and the Patriots both finished 8-8 with
wins Sunday, the Patriots taking a 20-3 victory over the Baltimore
Ravens before a crowd of 50,263. New England finished in last place
in the AFC East, however, because of a poorer division record.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier also
will have his fate decided in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had at least three meetings with owner Robert Kraft
Sunday, one in the morning, one after the game, and another after
his press conference. Carroll described the first two meetings as
``positive and upbeat,'' but the third might have sealed his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots executive vice president Jonathan Kraft wasn't tipping
his hand on what the family would do. Asked if there was a press
conference planned for Monday, he said, ``I don't think so . . .
you'll have to check with Stacey (James, the Patriots' director of
media relations).''
</P>
<P>
   The players were, for the most part, happy about finishing the
season with a win in what was another strong performance by the
defense. Linebacker Ted Johnson forced a fumble by quarterback Tony
Banks that Chad Eaton picked up and ran 23 yards for a
third-quarter score that sealed the victory.
</P>
<P>
   If this was Carroll's last game, he finished his Patriots tenure
with a 28-23 record, a .549 winning percentage, which is second
best in team history to Raymond Berry's 51-41 mark (.554).
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe said he had no feel for whether he
would be playing under a new coach, and yet another offensive
system, next season. ``I don't know what the call is there. I don't
know if anybody has a feeling one way or the other,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was fair that Carroll might be the scapegoat,
Bledsoe said, ``Was it fair? Probably not, but nobody said life is
fair. But I think he understood coming in that it was going to be
difficult. I think he did a good job with this team and we just let
him down on the field. We didn't make the plays. I didn't make the
plays. That's what it boiled down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe surely will be a part of the organization for some time
to come, with a contract extension in the works that should provide
the team some salary cap relief. But one player who may not return
is Lawyer Milloy, New England's top unrestricted free agent, who
will study reasons other than strictly money as to whether he
should come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win,'' said Milloy. ``That's going to be the No. 1
thing that weighs into my decision. I'm a sore loser. I'm not the
best of people to socialize with after I lose, or after a losing
season. A whole lot of scenarios have to be right to be wherever
I'm going to be. Even if I was making Ty Law's money, if I feel
like I feel right now . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Willie McGinest, who made it through 16 games
without injury after some injury-plagued campaigns, said of his
relationship with Carroll, ``I just wanted to play hard for the
guy. I've played hard for all of my coaches. I don't think we ever
quit. It wasn't the coaches that lost it for us. It was technique
and execution by the players. Those guys don't play for us. They
can't go out on the field and get it done. If we don't go out on
the field and execute, we can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it his most frustrating season?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said McGinest. ``Six and 10 (1995). Remember that?''
</P>
<P>
   The offense, minus wide receiver Terry Glenn, who was suspended
for violating team rules, was held to 151 total net yards. The
Patriots excelled on special teams, where Troy Brown continued to
make a case for a big payday in free agency, returning a punt 52
yards and returning kickoffs 54 and 49 yards. Brown had 192 yards
of offense and even threw an incomplete pass on a flea flicker.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Vinatieri kicked field goals of 25 and 51 yards, both in
the second quarter, after last week's debacle against Buffalo in
which he missed a 33-yarder that would have won it in regulation
and also missed a 44-yarder in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots led, 13-3, at the half as Brown's 52-yard punt
return set up the offense at the Ravens 23. The score came on a
1-yard pass from Bledsoe to Mike Bartrum with 5:04 left in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The only scoring of the second half was the Eaton fumble
recovery and run. The defense played without its three top
cornerbacks _ Law (hand), Steve Israel (ankle), and Tebucky Jones
(knee). The Patriots registered seven sacks, Johnson and Henry
Thomas leading the way with two, while Milloy, McGinest, and Ferric
Collons each had one.
</P>
<P>
   As the players left the field, the usually hostile crowd near
the tunnel seemed tame. Carroll slapped the hands of some of the
fans. He was smiling and having fun. As he left, a large sign could
be seen. It said: ``Hey Bob, no re-Pete.''

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll will arrive at Foxboro Stadium
Monday morning not quite sure if he'll be able to unlock the door
to his office.
</P>
<P>
   The Carroll Error came to a close Sunday with a weird 20-3
Patriot victory over the Baltimore Ravens, and Pete was true to the
finish. He was goofy.
</P>
<P>
   He came off the field, escorted by the ubiquitous Frank Mendes,
and went over to the stands to high-five some exuberant fans. He
looked like Carl Yastrzemski taking the victory lap in 1983, or Cal
Ripken Jr. thanking all of America in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Pete (it was always ``Poor Pete'') paid no heed to those
nasty signs in the stands: ``Had the Tuna, but ended up with a
Flounder''; ``Hey Bob, no re-Pete''; and ``Pete's Last Stand,
1-2-2000, R.I.P.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was oblivious. Watching him touching the masses, an
uninformed observer might have wondered, ``When do the playoffs
start? Will the Patriots be playing at home or on the road in the
NFL tournament?''
</P>
<P>
   They will not be playing at all, of course, because they
disgraced their own talent in the second half of this season. But
like their leader, they were clueless to the finish _ dancing in
the end zone and savoring a hollow victory when they should have
worn bags on their heads, pledged to do better, and gone home
quietly after a workmanlike win.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was buoyant at the postgame podium. In PeteSpeak, he was
downright pumped and jacked. He began his remarks with a tribute to
the Patriot defense (remember he is a career defensive coordinator
soon to be in search of a new job), then said, ``Our whole deal was
to have some fun playing today and we did. I want to look at the
moment in front of me and enjoy it to the fullest. That's the way I
am. I'm savoring it. That was a great event and I wanted to make
sure I felt it in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As he began his remarks, Jonathan Kraft, the Pocket Rocket of
the Kraft leadership tandem, walked past the interview room door
without breaking stride. There was no locker room sighting of
tanned owner Robert Kraft. Not long ago, the Krafts enjoyed
standing in the back of the room and listening to their coach's
postgame remarks. Now they scoot away from games like they're
leaving South Boston town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he spoke with Kraft earlier in the day. Routine
stuff. He described the conversations as good and upbeat. That's
what Gov. John Rowland said before Kraft bailed out of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would like to say to the fans, Carroll launched
into a favorite topic: fans who care too much and a negative media
that feeds the beast.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dike to deal with the sports you follow?'' he
asked. ``I get letters, tremendous notes with a lot of positive
things (Red Sox manager John McNamara cited his positive mailbag
right up until he was fired in 1988). Sometimes we get caught up
because of some guy on the radio or a writer who is critical.
Sometimes, in the bitterness, we miss the fun and why we are here
to play the game and to have fun with the game itself. I know our
fans love and support our team. But sometimes we get on a subject
or a topic and it gets so nasty and cynical.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Folks in these parts probably take their sports too
seriously and life is harsh for those who fail to live up to
expectations in the local arenas. Joe Morgan understood this. So
did Bill Parcells. Butch Hobson never got it. Ditto for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe, beaten to a pulp in what had to be the
most trying season of his career, doesn't like the sports zeal of
our region, but has accepted it as a fact of his professional life.
He summed up the three-year Carroll regime as well as anybody:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete walked into an extremely difficult situation. We were a
Super Bowl team, but he was also following one of the biggest and
strongest personalities in sports in a very tough sports town. Was
it fair? Probably not, but nobody said life is fair. We just let
him down.''
</P>
<P>
   They let him down. He messed up; he trusted them. He treated
them like men.
</P>
<P>
   We probably never would have gotten used to Carroll's
sophomoric, Richie Cunningham/boola-boola antics on the sideline.
It seemed ridiculous to see a professional coach hugging his
players just for doing their jobs. But it would have worked if
they'd kept winning.
</P>
<P>
   They did not. The bottom line on the Carroll Error is that he
inherited a young Super Bowl team and rode it into last place
(that's right folks, technically, the Patriots finished behind the
Jets) in three seasons. The win total went from 11 to 10 to nine to
eight. Super Bowl, to one playoff win, to zero playoff wins, to
zero playoffs. There were 10,000 no-shows for the last game of the
Carroll Error and all of Route 1 looked like a special access road
for luxury box owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Carroll looked silly for punishing wide receiver
Terry Glenn when it was too late, and then he got sandbagged by
Bobby Grier, a drowning vice president of player personnel who was
trying to save his own butt.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Pete was a nice guy and that's probably what got him the
inflated five-year contract in the first place. But in the end, he
reaffirmed one of the oldest and cruelest cliches in sports: Nice
guys finish last.

SILENTLY, ARMSTRONG LAID IT ALL ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was the morning after the debacle in
Philadelphia and Bruce Armstrong had a decision to make. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks earlier he had, as he liked to put it, ``popped my
ACL'' in a victory over the Arizona Cardinals. It was the kind of
debilitating knee injury that sends many men to the sideline for
the year the moment that popping is heard. The only place it sent
Armstrong was to the trainer's room a bit more frequently than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Although that pop meant his knee would have to be reconstructed
for the second time later this week, it did not, and it would not,
send him to the sidelines. Not while there was a playoff spot to
fight for and he had a leg to stand on.
</P>
<P>
   And so Armstrong silently played on, soldiering through five
losses in the next six weeks in which he and his offensive line
received more and more criticism for the sacking of Drew Bledsoe.
Through it all, he swore the few people who knew to secrecy until
he chose not to play.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to make that decision. In barely a minute or
two, it was made. Maintain the secret pact through two more
meaningless games. Games that said little for his team but much
about who he is and, perhaps, who some of his teammates are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't I keep playing?'' Armstrong said that day. ``My
father worked every day as a roofer in the sun. You think he wanted
to go to work every day? You think he felt good every day? Maybe he
didn't, but he went to work every day. Days when I didn't want to
go help him he went because it was his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my job. As long as I can do it, I'll do it. It doesn't
matter about the playoffs. We're out, but we still have games to
play. If I can play them, I'll play them.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did. Played every snap until the season ended with a
20-3 victory over the Baltimore Ravens Sunday. Played until there
was nothing left to play for, and then he played some more.
</P>
<P>
   He went down sometimes during those games but he got back up,
often slowly. But he got up.
</P>
<P>
   He was beaten sometimes, including during a long afternoon in
which the Eagles' Mike Mamula used his speed to overpower a man
with one leg who would have buried him if he had two. When that
happened he said nothing. Made no effort to use his injury as an
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   As the criticism of the Patriots' offense in general and the
pass protection in particular mounted, Armstrong took the hits off
the field the way Bledsoe took them on the field. He embraced the
code of silence. He said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He would give up his body to protect his quarterback but he
would not give up his injury to protect himself. That held true
even Sunday when Armstrong left the stadium without saying another
word about either his injury or the surgery he will face this week
because it was over now and there was nothing more to say and no
reason to say it.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong could have thrown in the towel back on Oct. 31 in
Arizona, the day he was injured, and avoided much of what followed.
He could have thrown it in on many other days after that. Certainly
he could have brought his season to an early end _ and his
rehabilitation to a faster beginning _ after the 24-9 loss to the
Eagles because there was nothing more to play for after that.
Nothing more but pride.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that is why he plays. It's why he's been to six Pro
Bowls and survived some of the worst teams in pro football history
with his dignity intact. It's why he will be back next season to
try and do it again.
</P>
<P>
   And it's why Bledsoe could only shake his head in admiration
Sunday and remember the time a year ago when he broke his finger
and knew what he had to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I look Bruce in the eye if I go off the field with a
sore finger?'' Bledsoe said. ``It's inspirational to watch some
guys. Bruce, who has played the last seven games with, I think, the
MCL (actually the more serious ACL, but who's keeping track?) gone
in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody knows that, but he played for seven
games with no MCL in his knee. I don't know if you could find
another guy in the league that would be willing to do that. He put
it on the line for me, to protect my backside. Those are the kind
of things I take with me after a season, regardless of whether it
was a championship season of some sort or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this was a season of a sort but not a championship one,
and when you have put in 13 such seasons and have not yet won that
elusive title, you play with injuries and pain and hope. Hope that
next season will be different. Hope that young players will watch
you play in pain and ignore the flu or a broken finger or a sore
ankle and play to win now as well because there may not be another
time for any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong understands this, which is why he played eight games
with a knee that was falling apart. He did what Shawn Jefferson
understood to be the requirements of a very difficult job,
requirements that frankly not everyone in Foxborough understood
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came into this league my receiver coach was Chris
Palmer,'' Jefferson recalled. ``He taught me a lot and he told me
you do things in this league that don't make sense to other people.
You gut it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce did that. He certainly is a warrior. You hope the
younger players around here see that and learn from it. He's
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember years ago coach (Bobby) Ross asked me to stand up
and define courage. I said it was someone who was brave. He told
me, `No. It's a guy who's scared and hurting but he does what he
has to do anyway.' That's courage. That's what Bruce is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jefferson spoke, Armstrong walked through the locker room
dressed in black from head to toe. He walked to his locker, slipped
on a heavy overcoat, picked up his briefcase, and said nothing
about his knee or his fate or much of anything else, except to
mention he was going to see the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was gone, like this season was gone. All that was left
behind were two hard plastic knee braces hanging in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   Like the player who wore them the past eight weeks, they said
nothing. And like that player, they didn't have to.

IT APPEARS BROWN SOON MAY BE IN GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If the Patriots wish to take care of
important business first, before they hire a coach and/or a general
manager, they should sit down by the side of their most inspiring
offensive player and keep him on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay here,'' said wide receiver Troy Brown time and
again after he Sunday again showed his mates how football should be
played. ``But I can't really answer what's going to happen. But if
all goes well, I'll probably be back here.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brown spoke, tackle Bruce Armstrong came to his locker, next
to Brown's, and sang, ``Troy Brown! . . . Troy Brown! . . . I'd
really like to be Troy Brown right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And not far away, quarterback Drew Bledsoe said, ``I remember my
first training camp when I was talking to my dad and the only
player I mentioned by name was Troy. He was that special. I just
hope he'll continue to be an asset for us . . . and not for
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is held in such high regard by his teammates that more
than a few are looking to see if the Patriots keep him before they
decide how committed New England is to winning. Typical was
defensive lineman Willie McGinest, who still has three years to go
on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy is a very special athlete,'' said McGinest. ``Troy's
definitely the type of guy you want to fight for. It all depends on
Troy, and if they're going to sign him or whatever and whether
they're going to keep guys like Troy, guys who are not going to
quit on you.'' Whether the Patriots sign Brown, McGinest went on,
``will affect the decisions of guys about staying in Foxborough or
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is in ideal position, surviving the huge risk when he
turned down a $1.5 million offer and continued to play this season
for approximately a paltry $450,000, but now sure to receive
lucrative free agent offers. As any Patriot fan could see, Brown is
worth close to his weight in gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous risk I took,'' said Brown, who endured
ankle injuries the last two seasons. ``I had a whole year and a
half to go before I became a free agent and I had a couple of ankle
injuries. I guess that's why I'm a punt returner: It takes guts (to
turn down a contract extension and wait for free agency). What I
did was take a tremendous chance, and it almost backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots' offense an offense in name only the last half
of the season, Brown often was the only player who stepped up to
make huge play after huge play. And Sunday was no different. As the
offense continued its deep hibernation, Brown returned kickoffs 54
and 49 yards and a punt 52 yards; two of those returns led directly
to 10 New England points.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a guy . . . what a guy,'' enthused coach Pete Carroll.
``He makes it look so easy. To put Troy out there and all of a
sudden we're getting 50 yards a pop (on returns). And the other
guys have such a tremendous respect for Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the intangible that Brown _ a small man neither overly
fast nor overly shifty _ brings to the team that makes him so
invaluable. Carroll and vice president of player personnel Bobby
Grier have learned too late that it is this intangible, which Sam
Gash personified, that means as much to a team as size and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it depends on your attitude,'' said Brown, explaining
his credo while trying to pinpoint how and why the Patriots'
offense went so bad this season. `` `You can't be stopped, you
can't be tackled,' is how I approach the game. And, `I'm not going
to be tackled by one guy,' and `I'm not going to go down.' I'm
going to make a play. I'm going to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans chanted his name as Brown was the last player to leave
the field, ``and that was great,'' he said. ``I think it showed
that people appreciate hard work, and that's what I've done since
I've been here: work hard to get better. I'm just looking to create
a special edge for myself. A lot of it depends on what you tell
yourself in your attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   His success and the Patriots' success _ or lack of it _ ``all
goes back to your attitude and what you believe.'' The same will be
said of the Patriots' organization as Brown, and other Patriots,
wait to see what New England does about re-signing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on when the Patriots come to me,'' said Brown of
his prospects of returning. ``I can't sit here and say I'm going to
let (other offers) pass me by while sitting around and waiting.''

RESTRUCTURING OF BLEDSOE DEAL ON TAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After the Patriots sort out their
coaching/management situation in the days to come, one of the first
orders of business will be to restructure Drew Bledsoe's contract,
according to a team official.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots must get Bledsoe's cap number down to ease the $8.6
million hit they're scheduled to take with his current deal next
season, and the $9.8 million whack set for 2001, the final year of
his pact.
</P>
<P>
   New England will have to come up with a huge signing bonus,
likely in the vicinity of $20 million on a four- or five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe fell 15 yards short of his third 4,000-yard season,
going 15 for 25 for only 108 yards, with one touchdown and one
interception. He finished with 19 touchdowns and 21 interceptions
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe played all of Sunday's 20-3 win over the Ravens, ending
speculation that fan favorite Michael Bishop might get a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, it was a very disappointing year for us,'' said
Bledsoe. ``We had high hopes coming in, high hopes after 11 weeks,
and we just couldn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Of coach Pete Carroll's postgame speech to the team, Bledsoe
said, ``He said he was proud of our effort in the game. He wasn't
sure under the circumstances of this team not having much
experience of handling things (while being) out of the playoffs
that the effort would be there. We gave the effort and we won. Last
week we lost in OT, but the effort was there as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he felt exhausted after the game. He was sacked
twice, making it 55 on the season, and was knocked down more than
100 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I'll be fine,'' he said. ``I came out of it
relatively healthy. Mentally, this one's going to take a little
while. Right now, I'm just extremely tired mentally, emotionally,
and physically. I just need to go to sleep for a couple of days and
get rested and then start working toward recharging the
batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe lauded left tackle Bruce Armstrong for playing with a
torn knee ligament for the last seven games and said he wasn't sure
whether Shawn Jefferson, Troy Brown, Tedy Bruschi, or Lawyer Milloy
would be back.
</P>
<P>
   But he was certain about the return of one man _ wide receiver
Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Glenn is going to be back on this team,'' said Bledsoe.

RAVENS DIDN'T HEED BILLICK'S SAGE ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick was
uneasy about Sunday's game a few hours before it started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I was in this stadium, I was coaching with
Minnesota,'' he said. ``We had a (20-3) lead at halftime, and got
beat (26-20, in 1994). They came out and threw something like 62
passes in the game and beat us in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my players that. We have to get them down and keep them
down. We have to stay on top of them all the way. The one thing we
don't want to do _ and I emphasized this with our team _ is turn
the ball over. We don't want to give them the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick's worst fears were realized. His Ravens, who entered
with a four-game win streak, went down in flames as they
disintegrated on special teams and offense.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again his coverage teams were embarrassed by the
brilliance of return man Troy Brown, who gave the Patriots all the
field position they needed.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a great showing on offense by the Patriots by any
means, but their defense and Brown made it easy for them. Their one
touchdown drive went all of 23 yards; their other touchdown came on
defensive tackle Chad Eaton's return of a recovered fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first three quarters, Brown had 173 yards on kick
returns. During the same period, the entire Patriots offense
totaled 153.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Brown, there were two other keys to the New England win.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Patriots got more pressure on Tony Banks than they
had on any other quarterback all year. And Banks eventually folded
in the face of the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots ahead, 13-3, in the third quarter, linebacker
Ted Johnson blitzed up the middle and decked Banks, who fumbled.
Eaton picked up the ball and ran it in.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell seemed to sense
that Baltimore, which had averaged 28 points per game the last
month, was not handling the blitz well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in this game is in interrelated,'' he said.
``Today, we had the chance to get consistent pressure on the
quarterback because we had the lead. Once you get in front and have
a cushion, you can think about stopping the ball and get after it.
You can't always do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pressure today was effective. They ran the ball well,
better than I thought they would, but once they got behind and had
to go with the pass, we had the chance to get some pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our guys before the game that Banks has been bothered
by pressure in the past, and if we could get some hits on him, he
would probably give us a fumble, because he has a history of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Henry Thomas had a big day working on the
inside. He got off the ball fast, making for a better push up the
middle than the Patriots have had all year. Johnson, not usually a
blitzer, had two sacks in the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   On one of those hits Banks was injured, and he had to give way
to Stoney Case. Banks had been sacked four times before he left.
Case was sacked thrice and threw an interception. The Patriots had
seven sacks to the Ravens' two. The Patriots had three penalties to
the Ravens' nine, and the Patriots had one turnover to the Ravens'
four.
</P>
<P>
   In view of everything swirling around the team this week, with
speculation about coach Pete Carroll, the team played remarkably
well.
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Bill Parcells has said over the years that he can
tell how well his team wants to play by how it does on special
teams and in the turnover department. The Patriots' special teams
dominated their counterparts, and New England won the turnover
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore thought it would be able to attack the depleted New
England secondary with the deep ball, but just couldn't get it
done.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Ty Law, Steve Israel, and Chris Carter were out of the
lineup. The top backup, Tebucky Jones, was also injured and
inactive.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had to dress players nobody's ever heard of, such
as Terry Billups, Rico Clark, and Corey Ivy. Two weeks ago, Billups
was selling music videos in Dallas. Clark was just cut by
Cincinnati. Ivy was called up from the practice squad. Free safety
Tony George was starting his first game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Ravens could not take advantage. They ran the ball
extremely well, outgaining New England on the ground, 119-49. But
when they got behind and had to throw, they couldn't get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Banks has a history of being erratic. He was in this game, too,
and because of that took his team out of the big finish it
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Billick told his team: ``You thought you could just
walk in here and win. I told you we couldn't think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for him, his players did.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In four months as Russian prime minister, Vladimir
Putin has gone from a dry and derided nobody to the Russians'
favorite for president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history shows how volatile Russian politics can be, but
if nothing changes between now and the rescheduled presidential
elections next March, we are probably looking at the new master of
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of popularity since launching the second Chechnya
war in September, the 47-year old former spymaster was designated
Friday by outgoing President Boris Yeltsin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin did not run in the parliamentary elections on
Dec. 19, his hard-line policy is seen as having contributed to the
success of a new pro-Kremlin bloc Unity which he endorsed in the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of polling, Russian television showed the black-belt
judo expert throwing an opponent to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is encouraging Russians to feel pride in themselves
owes his sudden rise to an act of expediency by Boris Yeltsin who,
earlier this year, appeared to be in danger of sinking in the mire
of post-communist corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Few now remember the prime minister's ignominious beginning or
stop to reflect that Putin is still linked to the hated Yeltsin
regime. The Russians were ready for a national savior and soon saw
Putin as their avenging angel.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin's blue-eyed protege has exceeded all
expectations and, right across the spectrum, Russian politicians
now find it advisable to express support for Putin. Anyone who
dares criticize him risks being called a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   All it took for Putin, who has never held elected office, to win
Russian hearts was one impassioned outburst.
</P>
<P>
   After terrorist bombs destroyed four apartment blocks in
September, killing Muscovites and other Russians as they slept in
their beds, the prime minister allowed himself the use of vulgar
language: ``We will wipe the terrorists out wherever we find them.
If we find them sitting on the toilet, then that's where we will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That short sentence expressed all the pent-up frustration not
only over Chechnya but over all the failures of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The average Russian responded to this tough guy talk in the same
emotional way he once worshipped Yeltsin for showing that he could
drink vodka as well as the next man.
</P>
<P>
   Russian women seemed to experience an almost sexual thrill _ at
least one woman confessed in a newspaper article that she had
erotic dreams about Putin.
</P>
<P>
   At last, masochistic Russians had what they wanted, a strong
hand and someone else to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Putin's popularity rating soared from the miserable 2
percent of public support he could count on in August when
President Yeltsin appointed him prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Russians were angry that the Kremlin leader,
casting about for a successor he could trust to protect him from
prosecution in retirement, had dumped another perfectly good prime
minister, the youthful and amiable Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   They openly laughed at Putin and laid bets as to how long he
would last. But the promise that the terrorists would get their
comeuppance, even on the toilet, changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   The grey suit _ a man who began his career serving the KGB in
Germany, went on to deputize for the liberal mayor of St.
Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, then helped to run Yeltsin's
administration and headed the Federal Security Service (former KGB)
_ suddenly had character.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that 47 percent of Russians see Putin as
their next president, almost enough for him to win the election in
a single round.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he has done virtually nothing to tackle the
problems of the Russian economy, apart from reassuring investors
that he sees no sense in renationalizing what has been privatized.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he called for a regulated market economy which would
avoid both blind adherence to Western liberalism and a return to
the Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made clear that because of its history, Russia could
not become a Western-style democracy like the United States because
of its history.
</P>
<P>
   Higher world oil prices have cushioned Russia financially during
its latest Chechnya offensive. The financial cost will be felt
later, and perhaps, if the war drags on, there will be a higher
human price for Moscow as well
</P>
<P>
   For the moment Russians feel it is all worth it, because they
are bombing Chechnya, which is not only a place but also a symbol
of all that ails them. And no amount of hand-wringing by the West,
perceived to have given bad advice in the period of ``reforms,''
will stop them. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin astonished the world
and his people Friday by announcing on the last day of the 20th
century that he was stepping down after almost a decade in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing around making their last-minute preparations for the
millennium, Russians were taken completely off guard by his
theatrically timed announcement that he was retiring early and
entrusting the country to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   As the news broke at noon, when the first television channel
broadcast an extraordinary New Year speech from the 68-year old
president, most Muscovites were doing battle in the shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a kind of weightlessness,'' said Masha a trainee
journalist. ``Not the same shock as Russians felt on the death of
Stalin, of course, but a milder version of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know the real motives of the people in the Kremlin.
And we do not know whether for us this means positive change or
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked, I am stunned, I am bewildered,'' said Tamara, a
housewife who was scouring the city for tin foil to decorate her
home for the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say I feel relieved by this news. While the rest of
the world is worrying about computers, we are still living with our
political chaos. People say Putin will be the next president but to
me right now, our future looks quite foggy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attentive Kremlin watchers might have sensed that the
unpredictable and ailing Yeltsin was about to deliver a millennium
surprise because, significantly, he allowed Putin to preside over a
grand New Year party for the political establishment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before that, Yeltsin had also handed over the
presidential prerogative of medal awarding to his prime minister,
hugely popular because of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But most ordinary Russians, tired of politics after the
parliamentary elections on Dec. 19, had taken their eyes off state
affairs to concentrate on their private celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Independent NTV said Yeltsin, who in recent days has sounded
gruff-voiced but otherwise looked well, had made the decision to
retire only on Thursday, when he sent Putin, 47, to the Kremlin
party in his place.
</P>
<P>
   The president's traditional New Year speech, broadcast at
midnight, was re-recorded in haste Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Usually Russians, drinking out the old year with vodka and
drinking in the New Year with champagne, listen to the speech with
about as much attention as sated Britons watch the Queen after
Christmas dinner. But after the sensational news, Russians were
glued to their television sets when the Kremlin clock struck
twelve.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing that he was bowing out to give the younger generation
a chance, Yeltsin apologized to Russians for failing to fulfill
their dreams and take them in one leap from the grey, totalitarian
past into a bright, prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
   Given the disappointments that Russians have suffered through
the Yeltsin years, it was perhaps surprising that more people did
not express joy Friday that the sick, old man they so hated was
finally leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Some did, such as pensioner Nina Alexeyevna, who was selling
eggs and yoghurt from a table protected only by an umbrella on the
snow-swept street. ``I could have had a quiet retirement if it were
not for Yeltsin. As it is, at 61, I have to sit here in the
freezing cold until late afternoon on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good riddance to Yeltsin. I'm glad to see the back of him.''
</P>
<P>
   But others had kind words for the president as he made history
by becoming the first Russian leader to hand over power
voluntarily. ``You have to respect him for having the courage to
admit to himself his own unpopularity. It was a beautiful
gesture,'' said Dasha, an art student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not one of those who has criticized Yeltsin,'' said Vera
Belostatskaya, a doctor who unlike other interviewees was prepared
to give her full name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have supported Yeltsin all along and put my trust in him,''
she said. ``If he has chosen Putin, then now I will vote for him.
But I am sad for Yeltsin. I had hoped to see him finish his term.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Muscovites, while welcoming Yeltsin's decision and his
choice of successor, were annoyed by his timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he have to do it today?'' asked Valentina, a cook. ``Could
it not have waited until after Christmas (Russian Orthodox, from
Jan. 6-7)? To be frank with you, he has spoilt my holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Valery, an artist, saw Yeltsin's resignation as nothing more
than a ``cunning trick'' to give his chosen successor the best
possible springboard for elections which are to be held in March.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians were wandering around Friday in a state of dazed
uncertainty. ``I have mixed feelings,'' said Olga, a secretary.
``At least with Yeltsin, always `working on documents' (the
euphemism when he was ill), there was a kind of stability but now
we are going into the unknown.'' &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin astonished the world
and his people Friday by announcing on the last day of the 20th
century that he was stepping down after almost a decade in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing around making their last-minute preparations for the
millennium, Russians were taken completely off guard by his
theatrically timed announcement that he was retiring early and
entrusting the country to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   As the news broke at noon, when the first television channel
broadcast an extraordinary New Year speech from the 68-year old
president, most Muscovites were doing battle in the shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a kind of weightlessness,'' said Masha a trainee
journalist. ``Not the same shock as Russians felt on the death of
Stalin, of course, but a milder version of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know the real motives of the people in the Kremlin.
And we do not know whether for us this means positive change or
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked, I am stunned, I am bewildered,'' said Tamara, a
housewife who was scouring the city for tin foil to decorate her
home for the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say I feel relieved by this news. While the rest of
the world is worrying about computers, we are still living with our
political chaos. People say Putin will be the next president but to
me right now, our future looks quite foggy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attentive Kremlin watchers might have sensed that the
unpredictable and ailing Yeltsin was about to deliver a millennium
surprise because, significantly, he allowed Putin to preside over a
grand New Year party for the political establishment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before that, Yeltsin had also handed over the
presidential prerogative of medal awarding to his prime minister,
hugely popular because of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But most ordinary Russians, tired of politics after the
parliamentary elections on Dec. 19, had taken their eyes off state
affairs to concentrate on their private celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Independent NTV said Yeltsin, who in recent days has sounded
gruff-voiced but otherwise looked well, had made the decision to
retire only on Thursday, when he sent Putin, 47, to the Kremlin
party in his place.
</P>
<P>
   The president's traditional New Year speech, broadcast at
midnight, was re-recorded in haste Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Usually Russians, drinking out the old year with vodka and
drinking in the New Year with champagne, listen to the speech with
about as much attention as sated Britons watch the Queen after
Christmas dinner. But after the sensational news, Russians were
glued to their television sets when the Kremlin clock struck
twelve.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing that he was bowing out to give the younger generation
a chance, Yeltsin apologized to Russians for failing to fulfill
their dreams and take them in one leap from the grey, totalitarian
past into a bright, prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
   Given the disappointments that Russians have suffered through
the Yeltsin years, it was perhaps surprising that more people did
not express joy Friday that the sick, old man they so hated was
finally leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Some did, such as pensioner Nina Alexeyevna, who was selling
eggs and yoghurt from a table protected only by an umbrella on the
snow-swept street. ``I could have had a quiet retirement if it were
not for Yeltsin. As it is, at 61, I have to sit here in the
freezing cold until late afternoon on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good riddance to Yeltsin. I'm glad to see the back of him.''
</P>
<P>
   But others had kind words for the president as he made history
by becoming the first Russian leader to hand over power
voluntarily. ``You have to respect him for having the courage to
admit to himself his own unpopularity. It was a beautiful
gesture,'' said Dasha, an art student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not one of those who has criticized Yeltsin,'' said Vera
Belostatskaya, a doctor who unlike other interviewees was prepared
to give her full name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have supported Yeltsin all along and put my trust in him,''
she said. ``If he has chosen Putin, then now I will vote for him.
But I am sad for Yeltsin. I had hoped to see him finish his term.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Muscovites, while welcoming Yeltsin's decision and his
choice of successor, were annoyed by his timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he have to do it today?'' asked Valentina, a cook. ``Could
it not have waited until after Christmas (Russian Orthodox, from
Jan. 6-7)? To be frank with you, he has spoilt my holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Valery, an artist, saw Yeltsin's resignation as nothing more
than a ``cunning trick'' to give his chosen successor the best
possible springboard for elections which are to be held in March.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians were wandering around Friday in a state of dazed
uncertainty. ``I have mixed feelings,'' said Olga, a secretary.
``At least with Yeltsin, always `working on documents' (the
euphemism when he was ill), there was a kind of stability but now
we are going into the unknown.'' &QL;

   LONDON _ How do you plan to spend New Year's Day? Well, you
could start the day with a speedball, clock up some mouse miles
reading v-mail and go out in the evening to see your favorite
synthespian in a hotsy film.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose vocabulary is rooted in the Nineties, that means
you'll have a coffee with an extra shot of espresso, spend time at
the computer, check video attachments on your e-mail, then go to
see a box-office hit film with _ what else? _ a computer simulation
of a dead actor.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the future: it is now. English is already
assimilating words that spring from our obsession with the newest
technologies as well as our continuing obsession with drinking
coffee and watching fashionable movies.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicographers say the new century is bringing a new vocabulary.
Inelegant as they may sound, hotsy, synthespian and cleffer are the
new buzz-words for dictionary compilers.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced this year's Encarta World
English Dictionary, has 320 experts in 20 countries keeping watch
on what is fashionable in English _ now spoken by two billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   They have selected a top-10 of words and phrases that are tipped
to become part of our everyday language by next year and which are
to be included in the next edition of the Encarta dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we do speak millennial English, Bloomsbury's research
has also confirmed that many of us cannot spell it.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the new millennium, one of the most commonly
misspelt words is millennium. Many people miss the fact that there
are two l's and two n's.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion, say Encarta specialists (perhaps assuming that a
classical education is more ubiquitous than it is), relates to the
fact that although millennium and millennial have two n's,
millenarian and millenary have only one. This is due to the words'
different Latin origins.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rooney, editor-in-chief of the Encarta, said: ``The
English language is constantly changing and developing, so
Bloomsbury have initiated a worldwide language-monitoring program
to record how words are used, how meanings change and to look out
for new coinages as they appear in books, films, newspapers,
journals and, of course, on the Internet.'' &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It was a sinister place, a small farmyard with two
dirty aystacks and the wind blasting fog through the old wooden
gateway, down from Mount Golesh. Huddled beside a shed, Bajram
Isufi knew the secret of his little farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A KLA man saw the Serb police digging graves here on April 18
and 19,'' he said. ``I don't know who they buried, but I feel very
bad. This is our home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the British Army Land Rover, they had all the tools of
exhumation. Extraction equipment (1 box), bamboo sticks (1 box),
trowels (10), small brushes, picks (2). The tape said ``crime
scene'' and who were we to deny it?
</P>
<P>
   Then it rained: heavy, dark rain that splattered the capes of
the Canadian policemen and the uniform of the American cop from
Wyoming and the British bomb-disposal men _ with their screaming,
whining metal detector _ and the Kosovo Albanian pathologists and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
officials and the guy from the war-crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   This was a joint operation, bringing a fledgling Albanian crime
lab into being, right here in this freezing swamp. And a few
minutes after some local men had hacked away at the mud with
shovels there came forth, from beside the haystack, an evil smell.
</P>
<P>
   We peered into the grave. No one knew who he was, pasty-faced
and dead these seven months, his blue jeans and boots still intact,
just as he had put them on the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanian _ he was perhaps 30 _ had been buried in a
blue-and-grey rug, probably the blanket used to carry his corpse
from the back of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere beneath us in the muck of the farmyard lay another 10
corpses, so the crime men believed. The cop from Wyoming turned to
a colleague. ``Will you ask them to bring up the bone wagon?''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of bone wagons on the move in Kosovo right now.
Though winter is frosting over the mass graves, the U.N. and the
OSCE and war-crimes men and women and the embryonic Albanian
authorities can still open the occasional killing-field _ when the
rain or the sun melts the ice from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Of 500 potential grave sites, 150 have been opened and, no, we
have not found the 100,000 ``missing'' declared by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, or the lower but probably equally preposterous figure
of 10,000 advanced by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and
repeated by the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands still under the ground. &QL;

   When I asked one man from the international war-crimes tribunal
what he thought of the estimate of a Spanish official, who packed
up and went home after finding fewer than 200 corpses _ that there
may not be many more than 2,000 Albanian dead _ he looked at me
contemptuously. ``Bollocks,'' he said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bomb-disposal boys were dipping mugs into a jerry can of
steaming coffee, ignoring the smell that now enveloped us. Another
Bajram, Bajram Krasniqi, head of the Kosovo Albanian ``commission
for war crimes and missing people,'' watched a Briton and an
American lifting the body from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi is a lawyer by profession, and his institution has as
much reason to correctly calculate the number of dead as it has
politically to exaggerate the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi is KLA leader Hashem Thaci's man at the grave sites,
and the statistics pour from him in thunderous announcements, in
the voice of a man who likes talking to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 10,000 photographs of graves, sites and
bodies, and more than 300 hours of video, and we share all our
evidence with the war-crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``From survivors who are giving us testimonies, we calculate
there were 6,000 Kosovo Albanians killed in the three months of the
war and perhaps 2,000 still in Serbian prisons. In the 12 months
before the war, there were 1,000 killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the figures become a little vague. The total of dead
and missing becomes 7,000 rather than 8,000; the figure of pre-war
killings rises from 1,000 to 2,000. Krasniqi explains that the
numbers are not exact because bodies were removed after their
original interment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Izbica during the war,'' he continues, ``the KLA found 147
bodies of civilians killed by the Serbs and they buried them and
videotaped the burials. Then the Serbs came back and dug them up,
and we don't know where the bodies are.''
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, Serb police buried the dead in old
graveyards, Krasniqi said, hoping that they'd remain undiscovered.
``They didn't believe the Yugoslav army would leave Kosovo so
quickly. They originally planned to take the bodies with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this true? Could this possibly be true? Were the Serb
paramilitary and interior ministry cops really planning to haul
thousands of dead Albanians out of Kosovo in trucks while NATO
bombed them from the air?
</P>
<P>
   I am literally shaking my head in disbelief when a war-crimes
investigator motions towards his vehicle. ``I want to show you
something,'' he says, and we bounce over the farm track towards
Glogovac and the old ferro-nickel mine and, just above it, another
rain-soaked, muddy hill. &QL;

   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 50 people are standing amid row after row of graves,
some wearing rubber gloves, searching through plastic bags. The
bags contain the clothes of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   I watch a young girl pulling gently at the belt on a pair of
trousers. And I know what she is thinking: that the dead man
threaded this belt, perhaps only a few hours before he died; that
this was one of his last acts on earth, the mundane, everyday act
of a man who did not expect to die within hours. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 118 bodies here,'' the war-crimes man says to me as
the rain gutters down our faces and clothes. ``We've numbered them
all and matched the clothes in the bags to the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know something very strange? Some of the clothes the
bodies were dressed in didn't match the wounds. We found men with
one bullet wound wearing a shirt with two bullet holes _ and men
with two bullet wounds in clothes with only one bullet hole...''
</P>
<P>
   Why, I asked, would their killers do such a thing? The
war-crimes man shrugged. ``To make it difficult for us?'' he
asked. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 of the dead were executed a few hundred meters away,
on a cliff edge above the water-filled quarries of the mine, then
buried in lines inside an old trench.
</P>
<P>
   They were dug up and brought to the hill of Ciktova e Vjeta
where 68 bodies had already been discovered, and were given
temporary burial here by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was little earth on them, and the dogs came, and the
children in the school over there saw all this, and we helped to
arrange the proper burials today.''
</P>
<P>
   I look at the girl again, and she is shaking her head slowly.
Then a small man with a rough beard approaches us. ``The clothes in
my relative's grave do not belong to him,'' he says. Another man
makes the same complaint. The war-crimes man insists that all the
clothes were matched with the correct bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The previous night, it seems, some of the bodies may have been
disturbed, and the awful thought crosses my mind: why, after all,
would anyone disturb a mass grave? Had someone thought there might
be a few Deutschmarks in the pockets of the long-dead, I ask? The
war crimes man looks harshly out the window of our vehicle. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Across this great, damp land, on the other side of Pristina,
they are digging in an old graveyard, and I see poor Azemina Mirena
staring through the drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   She is 52 and last saw her husband, Ismet, on April 21. The
Serbs came into our house at Nakarada on that day and took him away
_ some of the Serbs were our neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wore masks, but I recognized some by their voices... They
put Ismet and the others on military trucks. Since the end of the
war, I've gone to lawyers, the Red Cross. They know nothing. Some
Kosovo journalists said he might be here.'' Mrs. Mirena looked
blankly through the rain at the men digging in the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 minutes before an American pathologist walked up to
us. ``We have found two small pieces of bone,'' she said. ``They
were old.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ismet Mirena is not here. Nor are the other men his wife saw
loaded into the green military truck on April 21. The yellow
``crime scene'' tape is taken down; the bomb-disposal men put their
little screaming machine into their Land Rover.
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd moment, an army of investigators simply abandoning
an old graveyard to look for another. What was it Krasniqi said to
me? Seven thousand? Eight thousand? Perhaps only 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   And I recall how _ debating these terrible figures in Belgrade _
a Serb woman admonished me. ``You cannot say `only' when you are
counting even 2,000. In that context,`only' is an obscene word.'' &QL;

   They were dug up and brought to the hill of Ciktova e Vjeta
where 68 bodies had already been discovered, and were given
temporary burial here by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was little earth on them, and the dogs came, and the
children in the school over there saw all this, and we helped to
arrange the proper burials today.''
</P>
<P>
   I look at the girl again, and she is shaking her head slowly.
Then a small man with a rough beard approaches us. ``The clothes in
my relative's grave do not belong to him,'' he says. Another man
makes the same complaint. The war-crimes man insists that all the
clothes were matched with the correct bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The previous night, it seems, some of the bodies may have been
disturbed, and the awful thought crosses my mind: why, after all,
would anyone disturb a mass grave? Had someone thought there might
be a few Deutschmarks in the pockets of the long-dead, I ask? The
war crimes man looks harshly out the window of our vehicle. &QL;

   Across this great, damp land, on the other side of Pristina,
they are digging in an old graveyard, and I see poor Azemina Mirena
staring through the drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   She is 52 and last saw her husband, Ismet, on April 21. The
Serbs came into our house at Nakarada on that day and took him away
_ some of the Serbs were our neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wore masks, but I recognized some by their voices... They
put Ismet and the others on military trucks. Since the end of the
war, I've gone to lawyers, the Red Cross. They know nothing. Some
Kosovo journalists said he might be here.'' Mrs. Mirena looked
blankly through the rain at the men digging in the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 minutes before an American pathologist walked up to
us. ``We have found two small pieces of bone,'' she said. ``They
were old.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ismet Mirena is not here. Nor are the other men his wife saw
loaded into the green military truck on April 21. The yellow
``crime scene'' tape is taken down; the bomb-disposal men put their
little screaming machine into their Land Rover.
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd moment, an army of investigators simply abandoning
an old graveyard to look for another. What was it Krasniqi said to
me? Seven thousand? Eight thousand? Perhaps only 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   And I recall how _ debating these terrible figures in Belgrade _
a Serb woman admonished me. ``You cannot say `only' when you are
counting even 2,000. In that context,`only' is an obscene word.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ It was a sinister place, a small farmyard with two
dirty aystacks and the wind blasting fog through the old wooden
gateway, down from Mount Golesh. Huddled beside a shed, Bajram
Isufi knew the secret of his little farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A KLA man saw the Serb police digging graves here on April 18
and 19,'' he said. ``I don't know who they buried, but I feel very
bad. This is our home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the British Army Land Rover, they had all the tools of
exhumation. Extraction equipment (1 box), bamboo sticks (1 box),
trowels (10), small brushes, picks (2). The tape said ``crime
scene'' and who were we to deny it?
</P>
<P>
   Then it rained: heavy, dark rain that splattered the capes of
the Canadian policemen and the uniform of the American cop from
Wyoming and the British bomb-disposal men _ with their screaming,
whining metal detector _ and the Kosovo Albanian pathologists and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
officials and the guy from the war-crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   This was a joint operation, bringing a fledgling Albanian crime
lab into being, right here in this freezing swamp. And a few
minutes after some local men had hacked away at the mud with
shovels there came forth, from beside the haystack, an evil smell.
</P>
<P>
   We peered into the grave. No one knew who he was, pasty-faced
and dead these seven months, his blue jeans and boots still intact,
just as he had put them on the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanian _ he was perhaps 30 _ had been buried in a
blue-and-grey rug, probably the blanket used to carry his corpse
from the back of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere beneath us in the muck of the farmyard lay another 10
corpses, so the crime men believed. The cop from Wyoming turned to
a colleague. ``Will you ask them to bring up the bone wagon?''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of bone wagons on the move in Kosovo right now.
Though winter is frosting over the mass graves, the U.N. and the
OSCE and war-crimes men and women and the embryonic Albanian
authorities can still open the occasional killing-field _ when the
rain or the sun melts the ice from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Of 500 potential grave sites, 150 have been opened and, no, we
have not found the 100,000 ``missing'' declared by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, or the lower but probably equally preposterous figure
of 10,000 advanced by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and
repeated by the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands still under the ground. &QL;

<P>
   When I asked one man from the international war-crimes tribunal
what he thought of the estimate of a Spanish official, who packed
up and went home after finding fewer than 200 corpses _ that there
may not be many more than 2,000 Albanian dead _ he looked at me
contemptuously. ``Bollocks,'' he said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bomb-disposal boys were dipping mugs into a jerry can of
steaming coffee, ignoring the smell that now enveloped us. Another
Bajram, Bajram Krasniqi, head of the Kosovo Albanian ``commission
for war crimes and missing people,'' watched a Briton and an
American lifting the body from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi is a lawyer by profession, and his institution has as
much reason to correctly calculate the number of dead as it has
politically to exaggerate the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi is KLA leader Hashem Thaci's man at the grave sites,
and the statistics pour from him in thunderous announcements, in
the voice of a man who likes talking to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 10,000 photographs of graves, sites and
bodies, and more than 300 hours of video, and we share all our
evidence with the war-crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``From survivors who are giving us testimonies, we calculate
there were 6,000 Kosovo Albanians killed in the three months of the
war and perhaps 2,000 still in Serbian prisons. In the 12 months
before the war, there were 1,000 killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the figures become a little vague. The total of dead
and missing becomes 7,000 rather than 8,000; the figure of pre-war
killings rises from 1,000 to 2,000. Krasniqi explains that the
numbers are not exact because bodies were removed after their
original interment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Izbica during the war,'' he continues, ``the KLA found 147
bodies of civilians killed by the Serbs and they buried them and
videotaped the burials. Then the Serbs came back and dug them up,
and we don't know where the bodies are.''
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, Serb police buried the dead in old
graveyards, Krasniqi said, hoping that they'd remain undiscovered.
``They didn't believe the Yugoslav army would leave Kosovo so
quickly. They originally planned to take the bodies with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this true? Could this possibly be true? Were the Serb
paramilitary and interior ministry cops really planning to haul
thousands of dead Albanians out of Kosovo in trucks while NATO
bombed them from the air?
</P>
<P>
   I am literally shaking my head in disbelief when a war-crimes
investigator motions towards his vehicle. ``I want to show you
something,'' he says, and we bounce over the farm track towards
Glogovac and the old ferro-nickel mine and, just above it, another
rain-soaked, muddy hill. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 50 people are standing amid row after row of graves,
some wearing rubber gloves, searching through plastic bags. The
bags contain the clothes of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   I watch a young girl pulling gently at the belt on a pair of
trousers. And I know what she is thinking: that the dead man
threaded this belt, perhaps only a few hours before he died; that
this was one of his last acts on earth, the mundane, everyday act
of a man who did not expect to die within hours. &QL;

<P>
   ``There are 118 bodies here,'' the war-crimes man says to me as
the rain gutters down our faces and clothes. ``We've numbered them
all and matched the clothes in the bags to the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know something very strange? Some of the clothes the
bodies were dressed in didn't match the wounds. We found men with
one bullet wound wearing a shirt with two bullet holes _ and men
with two bullet wounds in clothes with only one bullet hole...''
</P>
<P>
   Why, I asked, would their killers do such a thing? The
war-crimes man shrugged. ``To make it difficult for us?'' he
asked. &QL;

   At least 50 of the dead were executed a few hundred meters away,
on a cliff edge above the water-filled quarries of the mine, then
buried in lines inside an old trench.
</P>
<P>
   They were dug up and brought to the hill of Ciktova e Vjeta

and the statistics pour from him in thunderous announcements, in
the voice of a man who likes talking to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 10,000 photographs of graves, sites and
bodies, and more than 300 hours of video, and we share all our
evidence with the war-crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``From survivors who are giving us testimonies, we calculate
there were 6,000 Kosovo Albanians killed in the three months of the
war and perhaps 2,000 still in Serbian prisons. In the 12 months
before the war, there were 1,000 killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the figures become a little vague. The total of dead
and missing becomes 7,000 rather than 8,000; the figure of pre-war
killings rises from 1,000 to 2,000. Krasniqi explains that the
numbers are not exact because bodies were removed after their
original interment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Izbica during the war,'' he continues, ``the KLA found 147
bodies of civilians killed by the Serbs and they buried them and
videotaped the burials. Then the Serbs came back and dug them up,
and we don't know where the bodies are.''
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, Serb police buried the dead in old
graveyards, Krasniqi said, hoping that they'd remain undiscovered.
``They didn't believe the Yugoslav army would leave Kosovo so
quickly. They originally planned to take the bodies with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this true? Could this possibly be true? Were the Serb
paramilitary and interior ministry cops really planning to haul
thousands of dead Albanians out of Kosovo in trucks while NATO
bombed them from the air?
</P>
<P>
   I am literally shaking my head in disbelief when a war-crimes
investigator motions towards his vehicle. ``I want to show you
something,'' he says, and we bounce over the farm track towards
Glogovac and the old ferro-nickel mine and, just above it, another
rain-soaked, muddy hill. &QL;

   Perhaps 50 people are standing amid row after row of graves,
some wearing rubber gloves, searching through plastic bags. The
bags contain the clothes of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   I watch a young girl pulling gently at the belt on a pair of
trousers. And I know what she is thinking: that the dead man
threaded this belt, perhaps only a few hours before he died; that
this was one of his last acts on earth, the mundane, everyday act
of a man who did not expect to die within hours. &QL;

   ``There are 118 bodies here,'' the war-crimes man says to me as
the rain gutters down our faces and clothes. ``We've numbered them
all and matched the clothes in the bags to the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know something very strange? Some of the clothes the
bodies were dressed in didn't match the wounds. We found men with
one bullet wound wearing a shirt with two bullet holes _ and men
with two bullet wounds in clothes with only one bullet hole...''
</P>
<P>
   Why, I asked, would their killers do such a thing? The
war-crimes man shrugged. ``To make it difficult for us?'' he
asked. &QL;

   At least 50 of the dead were executed a few hundred meters away,
on a cliff edge above the water-filled quarries of the mine, then
buried in lines inside an old trench.
</P>
<P>
   They were dug up and brought to the hill of Ciktova e Vjeta
where 68 bodies had already been discovered, and were given
temporary burial here by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was little earth on them, and the dogs came, and the
children in the school over there saw all this, and we helped to
arrange the proper burials today.''
</P>
<P>
   I look at the girl again, and she is shaking her head slowly.
Then a small man with a rough beard approaches us. ``The clothes in
my relative's grave do not belong to him,'' he says. Another man
makes the same complaint. The war-crimes man insists that all the
clothes were matched with the correct bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The previous night, it seems, some of the bodies may have been
disturbed, and the awful thought crosses my mind: why, after all,
would anyone disturb a mass grave? Had someone thought there might
be a few Deutschmarks in the pockets of the long-dead, I ask? The
war crimes man looks harshly out the window of our vehicle. &QL;

   Across this great, damp land, on the other side of Pristina,
they are digging in an old graveyard, and I see poor Azemina Mirena
staring through the drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   She is 52 and last saw her husband, Ismet, on April 21. The
Serbs came into our house at Nakarada on that day and took him away
_ some of the Serbs were our neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wore masks, but I recognized some by their voices... They
put Ismet and the others on military trucks. Since the end of the
war, I've gone to lawyers, the Red Cross. They know nothing. Some
Kosovo journalists said he might be here.'' Mrs. Mirena looked
blankly through the rain at the men digging in the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 minutes before an American pathologist walked up to
us. ``We have found two small pieces of bone,'' she said. ``They
were old.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ismet Mirena is not here. Nor are the other men his wife saw
loaded into the green military truck on April 21. The yellow
``crime scene'' tape is taken down; the bomb-disposal men put their
little screaming machine into their Land Rover.
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd moment, an army of investigators simply abandoning
an old graveyard to look for another. What was it Krasniqi said to
me? Seven thousand? Eight thousand? Perhaps only 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   And I recall how _ debating these terrible figures in Belgrade _
a Serb woman admonished me. ``You cannot say `only' when you are
counting even 2,000. In that context,`only' is an obscene word.'' &QL;

   PRISTINA _ American aircraft used so much depleted uranium
ammunition during the NATO bombardment of Serbia that U.S.
officials are now claiming _ to the disbelief of European bomb
disposal officers _ that they have no idea how many locations may
be contaminated by the radioactive dust left behind by their
weapons during the war.
</P>
<P>
   British and other ordnance officers ordered to defuse live
ammunition in Kosovo have been fobbed off by the U.S. military with
``security'' objections _ and then with statements that no record
was kept of depleted uranium (DU) munitions use during the Kosovo
war.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of doctors and scientists suspect that an
explosion of cancers in southern Iraq is caused by the American use
of depleted uranium tank and aircraft munition warheads during the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   British and American doctors have suggested that it may also be
a cause of the Gulf War ``syndrome'' that has caused the death of
up to 400 veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these fears, NATO this summer refused to assist a U.N.
team investigating the use of depleted uranium munitions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But information given to the ``Independent'' by European
military sources in Kosovo demonstrates just why NATO should be so
reluctant to tell the truth about the anti-armor ammunition _ a
waste product of the nuclear industry which burns on impact and
releases a toxic and radioactive waste when it explodes.
</P>
<P>
   For it transpires that DU was used by A-10 ``tankbuster''
aircraft for more than a month in at least 40 locations in Kosovo,
many of them ``fake'' military targets erected by the Serbs to lure
pilots away from their tanks and artillery positions.
</P>
<P>
   More tragically, A-10 aircraft used DU ammunition in two attacks
against Kosovo Albanian refugees, the first on April 14 on the main
road between Djakovica and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of civilians were wounded in these attacks, carried out
when NATO pilots _ flying at more than 15,000 feet to avoid any
injury to themselves _ bombed refugee columns in the belief that
they were military convoys.
</P>
<P>
   The British Ministry of Defense admits that ``ingestion'' of DU
dust at the time of the explosion ``could present a health risk.''
But NATO has made no attempt to trace the Albanian survivors of
these attacks or check their health.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have KFOR troops in southern Kosovo been informed that A-10
aircraft used DU-penetrator ammunition on targets around a road at
Gradis _ west of Prizren _ and on a bridge east of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Italian KFOR troops now manning a checkpoint only a few feet
from the craters of a NATO DU bombing at Bistrazin have no idea
that depleted uranium dust was scattered over the ground around
them seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sources in Kosovo say that DU was also used in the warheads
of some Cruise missiles targeted at hardened silos and bunkers
around major Serbian towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials say they have no record of depleted uranium
in Kosovo because of their army's hurried withdrawal in June _ but
claim that DU ammunition was used by NATO in areas around Vranje,
Bujanovac, Ostojnik Mountain and on the Montenegran peninsula of
Lustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the Americans lots of time where they used this
stuff,'' a British ordnance officer told me. ``First _ you know the
Americans _ they said they couldn't tell us for `security reasons.'
Then they said that their A-10s used DU and fired the ammunition
whenever they came across Serb armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that because these were `targets of opportunity,'
they kept no record of the location or dates of firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give three pieces of advice to my men if they think they are
near DU munition explosions: stay away, stay away and stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   The same officer said he had found the remains of only 13 Serb
tanks in Kosovo _ precisely the same figure for destroyed tanks
given by the Serbs after the war and 83 tanks fewer than General
Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO commander, claimed his aircraft had
destroyed. But NATO pilots were fooled by wooden models of tanks
and armor into attacking hundreds of other locations.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview in the Belgrade press last month, Colonel
Dr. Milan Misovic, a specialist in radioactive protection in the
Belgrade military medical school, claimed that the consequences of
DU use by NATO may be small on the present generation but that
``we'll have to check everything for the next 100 years.'' &QL;

   PRISTINA _ American aircraft used so much depleted uranium
ammunition during the NATO bombardment of Serbia that U.S.
officials are now claiming _ to the disbelief of European bomb
disposal officers _ that they have no idea how many locations may
be contaminated by the radioactive dust left behind by their
weapons during the war.
</P>
<P>
   British and other ordnance officers ordered to defuse live
ammunition in Kosovo have been fobbed off by the U.S. military with
``security'' objections _ and then with statements that no record
was kept of depleted uranium (DU) munitions use during the Kosovo
war.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of doctors and scientists suspect that an
explosion of cancers in southern Iraq is caused by the American use
of depleted uranium tank and aircraft munition warheads during the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   British and American doctors have suggested that it may also be
a cause of the Gulf War ``syndrome'' that has caused the death of
up to 400 veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these fears, NATO this summer refused to assist a U.N.
team investigating the use of depleted uranium munitions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But information given to the ``Independent'' by European
military sources in Kosovo demonstrates just why NATO should be so
reluctant to tell the truth about the anti-armor ammunition _ a
waste product of the nuclear industry which burns on impact and
releases a toxic and radioactive waste when it explodes.
</P>
<P>
   For it transpires that DU was used by A-10 ``tankbuster''
aircraft for more than a month in at least 40 locations in Kosovo,
many of them ``fake'' military targets erected by the Serbs to lure
pilots away from their tanks and artillery positions.
</P>
<P>
   More tragically, A-10 aircraft used DU ammunition in two attacks
against Kosovo Albanian refugees, the first on April 14 on the main
road between Djakovica and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of civilians were wounded in these attacks, carried out
when NATO pilots _ flying at more than 15,000 feet to avoid any
injury to themselves _ bombed refugee columns in the belief that
they were military convoys.
</P>
<P>
   The British Ministry of Defense admits that ``ingestion'' of DU
dust at the time of the explosion ``could present a health risk.''
But NATO has made no attempt to trace the Albanian survivors of
these attacks or check their health.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have KFOR troops in southern Kosovo been informed that A-10
aircraft used DU-penetrator ammunition on targets around a road at
Gradis _ west of Prizren _ and on a bridge east of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Italian KFOR troops now manning a checkpoint only a few feet
from the craters of a NATO DU bombing at Bistrazin have no idea
that depleted uranium dust was scattered over the ground around
them seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sources in Kosovo say that DU was also used in the warheads
of some Cruise missiles targeted at hardened silos and bunkers
around major Serbian towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials say they have no record of depleted uranium
in Kosovo because of their army's hurried withdrawal in June _ but
claim that DU ammunition was used by NATO in areas around Vranje,
Bujanovac, Ostojnik Mountain and on the Montenegran peninsula of
Lustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the Americans lots of time where they used this
stuff,'' a British ordnance officer told me. ``First _ you know the
Americans _ they said they couldn't tell us for `security reasons.'
Then they said that their A-10s used DU and fired the ammunition
whenever they came across Serb armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that because these were `targets of opportunity,'
they kept no record of the location or dates of firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give three pieces of advice to my men if they think they are
near DU munition explosions: stay away, stay away and stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   The same officer said he had found the remains of only 13 Serb
tanks in Kosovo _ precisely the same figure for destroyed tanks
given by the Serbs after the war and 83 tanks fewer than General
Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO commander, claimed his aircraft had
destroyed. But NATO pilots were fooled by wooden models of tanks
and armor into attacking hundreds of other locations.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview in the Belgrade press last month, Colonel
Dr. Milan Misovic, a specialist in radioactive protection in the
Belgrade military medical school, claimed that the consequences of
DU use by NATO may be small on the present generation but that
``we'll have to check everything for the next 100 years.'' &QL;

<P>
   DJAKOVICA _ A day after NATO forces entered Kosovo last June, I
discovered an abandoned Serb Orthodox church in a field ten miles
north of Prizren. It was a small, box-like building and its doors
were open. I gingerly walked through a steel gate and into the
small field in which it stood and entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   It had been left in haste, its doors unlocked, its priest's
clothes thrown over a bible stand. Icons of Jesus and his saints
stared down at me in a passion of expression and color.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas were strolling past
the church in the company of German KFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how we leave their churches untouched _ after all that
they did to us?'' a middle-aged Kosovo Albanian woman asked me
later in the city. I was suitably impressed. ``They burned our
mosques. But we protect their churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Not any more, they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I drove down the same road to Prizren and sought out
the same church. I found the field and steel gate. But the church
was a ruin. A single wall, behind the altar, still stood. The rest
was pulverized stone.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, then, to the icons and the saints with the staring
eyes. Goodbye to Jesus. Goodbye to the Serb Orthodox church.
</P>
<P>
   All across Kosovo I found identical scenes, places of worship _
sometimes 600 years old _ leveled with explosives and hammers, the
very identity of Serb history turned to dust amid fields and
hillsides by NATO's Kosovo Albanian allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb church has issued its own list of destroyed or
partially demolished buildings. Between June 13 _ when NATO troops
entered Kosovo _ and Oct. 20 this year, they say, 74 churches have
been turned to dust or burned or vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th-century Monastery of the Holy Trinity above Musutiste,
begun in 1465, has been leveled with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery of the Archangel near Vitina, also built in the
14th century, has been looted and burned.
</P>
<P>
   So has the church of the Archangels in Gornje Nerodimlje. And
the church of Saint Paraskeva near Pec. And the Church of St.
Nicholas in Prekoruplje, now razed to the ground, its 17th-century
censer lost along with its nine 16th-century icons which include
the Apostle Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The rubble of Orthodox churches across Kosovo stands as a
monument to Kosovo Albanian vandalism and to NATO's indifference or
_ at the least _ incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring that Kosovo must remain a ``multi-ethnic
society,'' 40,000 troops from KFOR cannot, it seems, look after
Kosovo's historical heritage against the violence of those whom its
spokesmen treated as allies in the war against Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic only six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   True, KFOR soldiers are now billeted beside Orthodox and
Catholic churches across the province. Floodlights haunt the
sepulchres of ancient keeps, and in the Serb town of Gracanica
Swedish troops order Kosovo Albanians to strip off the least
offensive bumper sticker advocating independence for the province.
Two soldiers from north of Stockholm guard the entrance to Kosovo's
most famous monastery.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, religious desecration is NATO's shame.
</P>
<P>
   When I turned up in the center of Djakovica to find its Orthodox
basilica blown up by bombs, Italian troops _ now guarding the
rubble from anyone idiotic enough to try to demolish the wreckage _
instructed me to put down my camera. They were under orders from
their superiors to prevent all pictures being taken, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Back I went to Pristina, to KFOR's local office, to an Italian
officer who said that, yes, I could return to Djakovica and take
any pictures I wished. And back I went. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Italians were now courtesy itself. They even wished me to
identify correctly the Italian tank _ a Centaur _ that stands
outside the demolished church. And I could take all the pictures I
wanted of KFOR troops guarding the integrity and sanctity of a
church that had already been blown apart by explosives.
</P>
<P>
   This time the soldiers were more than friendly. Watch out for
the dangerous, cracked walls, they warned me. Would I like a
picture of the soldier in front of the tank with the destroyed
church in the background?
</P>
<P>
   What on earth was going on? Now I truly believe that Italian
peacekeepers in Kosovo, like their opposite numbers in Beirut in
1982, are among the best peacekeepers on our planet. But this
demolition cannot be just ``revenge'' _ NATO's usual excuse for the
destruction under its auspices.
</P>
<P>
   You don't just fill with rage and spend days gathering
explosives to blow up churches. This is vandalism with a mission. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside Klina, I came across another blasted church, blown to
pieces just four months ago. Its shattered dome lay over walls and
crosses and iconstasis. And wandering amid the rubble was a Kosovo
Albanian, Ymer Qupeva by name.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth was he doing here, I asked? Sympathizing with the
Serb worshippers? ``I have come to view the professionalism of the
destruction,'' Qupeva said. ``They did very well _ they planted
explosives against all four walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Qupeva, it turned out, was a graduate of ``pyrotechnics'' at the
University of Zagreb and wanted to make sure the Kosovo Albanian
boys had done their job well.
</P>
<P>
   It was, he said, a ``Karic'' church _ the Karic brothers in
Belgrade are reputed mobsters _ and one of many built across
Kosovo. ``They used the stones from the Klina Partisan memorial to
build the walls,'' Qupeva said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs claimed someone had a dream that they should build a
church next to the old tree by the road. The men with the
explosives did a very good job.'' And blowing up the church? Did he
agree with that? ``It was good,'' he said bleakly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the church is finished. Blown up with great professionalism.
And _ for good measure _ so has the old tree beside it. &QL;

   This time the soldiers were more than friendly. Watch out for
the dangerous, cracked walls, they warned me. Would I like a
picture of the soldier in front of the tank with the destroyed
church in the background?
</P>
<P>
   What on earth was going on? Now I truly believe that Italian
peacekeepers in Kosovo, like their opposite numbers in Beirut in
1982, are among the best peacekeepers on our planet. But this
demolition cannot be just ``revenge'' _ NATO's usual excuse for the
destruction under its auspices.
</P>
<P>
   You don't just fill with rage and spend days gathering
explosives to blow up churches. This is vandalism with a mission. &QL;

   Outside Klina, I came across another blasted church, blown to
pieces just four months ago. Its shattered dome lay over walls and
crosses and iconstasis. And wandering amid the rubble was a Kosovo
Albanian, Ymer Qupeva by name.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth was he doing here, I asked? Sympathizing with the
Serb worshippers? ``I have come to view the professionalism of the
destruction,'' Qupeva said. ``They did very well _ they planted
explosives against all four walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Qupeva, it turned out, was a graduate of ``pyrotechnics'' at the
University of Zagreb and wanted to make sure the Kosovo Albanian
boys had done their job well.
</P>
<P>
   It was, he said, a ``Karic'' church _ the Karic brothers in
Belgrade are reputed mobsters _ and one of many built across
Kosovo. ``They used the stones from the Klina Partisan memorial to
build the walls,'' Qupeva said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs claimed someone had a dream that they should build a
church next to the old tree by the road. The men with the
explosives did a very good job.'' And blowing up the church? Did he
agree with that? ``It was good,'' he said bleakly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the church is finished. Blown up with great professionalism.
And _ for good measure _ so has the old tree beside it. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   DJAKOVICA _ A day after NATO forces entered Kosovo last June, I
discovered an abandoned Serb Orthodox church in a field ten miles
north of Prizren. It was a small, box-like building and its doors
were open. I gingerly walked through a steel gate and into the
small field in which it stood and entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   It had been left in haste, its doors unlocked, its priest's
clothes thrown over a bible stand. Icons of Jesus and his saints
stared down at me in a passion of expression and color.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas were strolling past
the church in the company of German KFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how we leave their churches untouched _ after all that
they did to us?'' a middle-aged Kosovo Albanian woman asked me
later in the city. I was suitably impressed. ``They burned our
mosques. But we protect their churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Not any more, they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I drove down the same road to Prizren and sought out
the same church. I found the field and steel gate. But the church
was a ruin. A single wall, behind the altar, still stood. The rest
was pulverized stone.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, then, to the icons and the saints with the staring
eyes. Goodbye to Jesus. Goodbye to the Serb Orthodox church.
</P>
<P>
   All across Kosovo I found identical scenes, places of worship _
sometimes 600 years old _ leveled with explosives and hammers, the
very identity of Serb history turned to dust amid fields and
hillsides by NATO's Kosovo Albanian allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb church has issued its own list of destroyed or
partially demolished buildings. Between June 13 _ when NATO troops
entered Kosovo _ and Oct. 20 this year, they say, 74 churches have
been turned to dust or burned or vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th-century Monastery of the Holy Trinity above Musutiste,
begun in 1465, has been leveled with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery of the Archangel near Vitina, also built in the
14th century, has been looted and burned.
</P>
<P>
   So has the church of the Archangels in Gornje Nerodimlje. And
the church of Saint Paraskeva near Pec. And the Church of St.
Nicholas in Prekoruplje, now razed to the ground, its 17th-century
censer lost along with its nine 16th-century icons which include
the Apostle Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The rubble of Orthodox churches across Kosovo stands as a
monument to Kosovo Albanian vandalism and to NATO's indifference or
_ at the least _ incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring that Kosovo must remain a ``multi-ethnic
society,'' 40,000 troops from KFOR cannot, it seems, look after
Kosovo's historical heritage against the violence of those whom its
spokesmen treated as allies in the war against Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic only six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   True, KFOR soldiers are now billeted beside Orthodox and
Catholic churches across the province. Floodlights haunt the
sepulchres of ancient keeps, and in the Serb town of Gracanica
Swedish troops order Kosovo Albanians to strip off the least
offensive bumper sticker advocating independence for the province.
Two soldiers from north of Stockholm guard the entrance to Kosovo's
most famous monastery.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, religious desecration is NATO's shame.
</P>
<P>
   When I turned up in the center of Djakovica to find its Orthodox
basilica blown up by bombs, Italian troops _ now guarding the
rubble from anyone idiotic enough to try to demolish the wreckage _
instructed me to put down my camera. They were under orders from
their superiors to prevent all pictures being taken, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Back I went to Pristina, to KFOR's local office, to an Italian
officer who said that, yes, I could return to Djakovica and take
any pictures I wished. And back I went. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Italians were now courtesy itself. They even wished me to
identify correctly the Italian tank _ a Centaur _ that stands
outside the demolished church. And I could take all the pictures I
wanted of KFOR troops guarding the integrity and sanctity of a
church that had already been blown apart by explosives.
</P>
<P>
   This time the soldiers were more than friendly. Watch out for
the dangerous, cracked walls, they warned me. Would I like a
picture of the soldier in front of the tank with the destroyed
church in the background?
</P>
<P>
   What on earth was going on? Now I truly believe that Italian

1982, are among the best peacekeepers on our planet. But this
demolition cannot be just ``revenge'' _ NATO's usual excuse for the

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   PRISTINA _ The postwar ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo's Serbs
appears to be nearing completion as armed Albanians continue to
murder and kidnap the tiny minority of Serbs who remain in the
province more than six months after NATO troops arrived _ in the
words of its U.N. mandate _ ``to ensure public safety and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Pristina's 40,000 Serb population, only 400 are left.
Statistics drawn up by the Serb church and a human-rights group in
Pristina suggest that as many as 316 Serbs have been murdered and
another 455 kidnapped, many of them killed, since NATO's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   If these figures bear any relation to reality _ and most are
accompanied by names and dates _ then the number of Serbs killed in
the six months since the war's end comes close to that of Albanians
murdered by Serbs in the same period before NATO began its
bombardment last March.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of Serb victims died in the first two months
after NATO's entry, house-burning and murder continues in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent deaths was that of a Serb restaurant
worker employed _ by a supreme irony _ at the Pristina office of
the International War-Crimes Tribunal. The murder of Radovan Kukalj
in his hometown of Obilic on Oct. 29 went virtually unreported
outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by the NATO-led KFOR force in Kosovo appear
to be woefully inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   They give the number of Serbs murdered since mid-June as only
125 _ despite detailed lists from the Serb Orthodox Diocese of
Raska and Prizren that include at least 184 named Serbs as murder
victims and another 104 kidnapped between June 13 and Aug. 22
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Files at the Serb-administered ``Center for Peace and
Tolerance'' in Pristina _ which includes Albanian victims in its
statistics _ say that at least 48 Albanians as well as 455 Serbs
have been kidnapped since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the true figure was closer to KFOR's statistic, not
one of the brutal Serb killings is being investigated by members of
the International War-Crimes Tribunal working in Kosovo _ not even
the death of their own restaurant worker, Kukalj.
</P>
<P>
   For while tribunal investigators are still hoping to bring
charges against the murderers of Albanians killed before the war,
they are prevented by the tribunal's mandate from carrying out any
detective work on the postwar murder of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate states that it can investigate crimes committed
``during the armed conflict in Kosovo.'' But since neither NATO nor
KFOR will admit that a conflict continues under their control in
Kosovo _ albeit a largely one-sided one in which the Serbs are the
principal victims _ war-crimes tribunal officials cannot
investigate the killing of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   This means that their murderers have only the largely impotent
U.N. police force to reckon with. No wonder, then, that minority
groups continue to flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-strong Croat community at Lecnice were preparing to
celebrate their 700th anniversary in the province but left en masse
in October for Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
   And in late November, the president of the tiny Jewish community
of Cedra Prlincevic, in Kosovo's capital city of Pristina, left for
Belgrade after denouncing ``a pogrom against the non-Albanian
population.'' He had left Kosovo, he said, ``with only the
Talmud.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid workers in Kosovo insist that KFOR is now making a
huge effort to protect minorities after NATO General Sir Michael
Jackson's defeatist response to the killings _ ``we can only do so
much,'' he said several times _ appeared to encourage the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are large numbers of Royal Irish Rangers in the Gjilane
and Stimle areas trying to defend the small number of Serbs
there,'' a European human-rights worker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just east of Pec, some Serbs are returning from Montenegro at
the rate of 40 a week and KFOR is putting enormous resources into
reestablishing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish troops have virtually surrounded the Serb monastery town
of Gracanica, even ordering Albanians to strip Kosovo independence
posters from their cars if they are driving in the Serb streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the same aid official, who spends much of his time on
emergency work in Pristina, admitted to me that ``every single
Serbian here has been intimidated _ verbally in the street, on the
telephone, physically.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove this, I was confronted a few hours later by a
64-year-old Serb woman, Milunka Josic, who had just spent the night
trying to keep Albanian youths from breaking down her front door.
Her right hand was covered in bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the young men who were shouting at me,'' she said.
``They were beating on the door and screaming `(Expletive) your
mother' and `Go back to Serbia.'''
</P>
<P>
   In its efforts to minimize the ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Serbs
of Kosovo, KFOR has even produced graphs which compare the province
favorably to cities which include Pretoria and Moscow _ a
meaningless performance since these are among the crime capitals of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But human-rights teams of the OSCE _ who work with the U.N.
police force _ say they are investigating ``an increasing number of
murders, attacks and harassment of elderly Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   An OSCE official reports that in Zupa, a 96-year-old Serb man
was found bound and gagged with a gunshot wound to the head. He had
been gathering food for a small community of Serbs who were too
frightened to visit the local Albanian-run grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   In Kamenica, an 82-year-old Serb woman, who had been previously
threatened and ordered to move from her house, was found burned to
death in her home. Earlier, Serbs reported that a 90-year-old
woman, Ljubica Vujovic, had been held down in her bathtub and
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly Kosovo Albanians also complain that Albanian families
burned out of their original homes by Serbs are trying to evict
them. Witnesses, say the OSCE, are too fearful to help the U.N. and
KFOR investigate these crimes. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid this anarchy, the question has to be asked: can the
shameful campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' and murder of Serbs that
continues under KFOR's eyes still be explained away as revenge
attacks, as retaliation for the mass atrocities committed against
Albanians by Serb forces before and during the Kosovo war?
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Albanian intellectuals _ including several
courageous journalists on the daily ``Koha Ditore'' newspaper _
fear that the murders and dispossession of Serbs are now being
organized.
</P>
<P>
   By whom? By KLA cells which never disbanded under KFOR orders?
By groups coming across the border from Albania?
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, of course, still remember a British minister saying
during the Kosovo war that he wanted ``Serbs Out, NATO in, Refugees
back.'' George Robertson later claimed this was merely a
``distillation'' of the G8 demands.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Serbs Out'' has almost been accomplished. Robertson is now
head of NATO. &QL;

   PRISTINA _ The postwar ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo's Serbs
appears to be nearing completion as armed Albanians continue to
murder and kidnap the tiny minority of Serbs who remain in the
province more than six months after NATO troops arrived _ in the
words of its U.N. mandate _ ``to ensure public safety and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Pristina's 40,000 Serb population, only 400 are left.
Statistics drawn up by the Serb church and a human-rights group in
Pristina suggest that as many as 316 Serbs have been murdered and
another 455 kidnapped, many of them killed, since NATO's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   If these figures bear any relation to reality _ and most are
accompanied by names and dates _ then the number of Serbs killed in
the six months since the war's end comes close to that of Albanians
murdered by Serbs in the same period before NATO began its
bombardment last March.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of Serb victims died in the first two months
after NATO's entry, house-burning and murder continues in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent deaths was that of a Serb restaurant
worker employed _ by a supreme irony _ at the Pristina office of
the International War-Crimes Tribunal. The murder of Radovan Kukalj
in his hometown of Obilic on Oct. 29 went virtually unreported
outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by the NATO-led KFOR force in Kosovo appear
to be woefully inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   They give the number of Serbs murdered since mid-June as only
125 _ despite detailed lists from the Serb Orthodox Diocese of
Raska and Prizren that include at least 184 named Serbs as murder
victims and another 104 kidnapped between June 13 and Aug. 22
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Files at the Serb-administered ``Center for Peace and
Tolerance'' in Pristina _ which includes Albanian victims in its
statistics _ say that at least 48 Albanians as well as 455 Serbs
have been kidnapped since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the true figure was closer to KFOR's statistic, not
one of the brutal Serb killings is being investigated by members of
the International War-Crimes Tribunal working in Kosovo _ not even
the death of their own restaurant worker, Kukalj.
</P>
<P>
   For while tribunal investigators are still hoping to bring
charges against the murderers of Albanians killed before the war,
they are prevented by the tribunal's mandate from carrying out any
detective work on the postwar murder of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate states that it can investigate crimes committed
``during the armed conflict in Kosovo.'' But since neither NATO nor
KFOR will admit that a conflict continues under their control in
Kosovo _ albeit a largely one-sided one in which the Serbs are the
principal victims _ war-crimes tribunal officials cannot
investigate the killing of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   This means that their murderers have only the largely impotent
U.N. police force to reckon with. No wonder, then, that minority
groups continue to flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-strong Croat community at Lecnice were preparing to
celebrate their 700th anniversary in the province but left en masse
in October for Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
   And in late November, the president of the tiny Jewish community
of Cedra Prlincevic, in Kosovo's capital city of Pristina, left for
Belgrade after denouncing ``a pogrom against the non-Albanian
population.'' He had left Kosovo, he said, ``with only the
Talmud.''
   Foreign aid workers in Kosovo insist that KFOR is now making a
huge effort to protect minorities after NATO General Sir Michael
Jackson's defeatist response to the killings _ ``we can only do so
much,'' he said several times _ appeared to encourage the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are large numbers of Royal Irish Rangers in the Gjilane
and Stimle areas trying to defend the small number of Serbs
there,'' a European human-rights worker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just east of Pec, some Serbs are returning from Montenegro at
the rate of 40 a week and KFOR is putting enormous resources into
reestablishing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish troops have virtually surrounded the Serb monastery town
of Gracanica, even ordering Albanians to strip Kosovo independence
posters from their cars if they are driving in the Serb streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the same aid official, who spends much of his time on
emergency work in Pristina, admitted to me that ``every single
Serbian here has been intimidated _ verbally in the street, on the
telephone, physically.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove this, I was confronted a few hours later by a
64-year-old Serb woman, Milunka Josic, who had just spent the night
trying to keep Albanian youths from breaking down her front door.
Her right hand was covered in bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the young men who were shouting at me,'' she said.
``They were beating on the door and screaming `(Expletive) your
mother' and `Go back to Serbia.'''
</P>
<P>
   In its efforts to minimize the ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Serbs
of Kosovo, KFOR has even produced graphs which compare the province
favorably to cities which include Pretoria and Moscow _ a
meaningless performance since these are among the crime capitals of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But human-rights teams of the OSCE _ who work with the U.N.
police force _ say they are investigating ``an increasing number of
murders, attacks and harassment of elderly Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   An OSCE official reports that in Zupa, a 96-year-old Serb man
was found bound and gagged with a gunshot wound to the head. He had
been gathering food for a small community of Serbs who were too
frightened to visit the local Albanian-run grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   In Kamenica, an 82-year-old Serb woman, who had been previously
threatened and ordered to move from her house, was found burned to
death in her home. Earlier, Serbs reported that a 90-year-old
woman, Ljubica Vujovic, had been held down in her bathtub and
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly Kosovo Albanians also complain that Albanian families
burned out of their original homes by Serbs are trying to evict
them. Witnesses, say the OSCE, are too fearful to help the U.N. and
KFOR investigate these crimes. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid this anarchy, the question has to be asked: can the
shameful campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' and murder of Serbs that
continues under KFOR's eyes still be explained away as revenge
attacks, as retaliation for the mass atrocities committed against
Albanians by Serb forces before and during the Kosovo war?
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Albanian intellectuals _ including several
courageous journalists on the daily ``Koha Ditore'' newspaper _
fear that the murders and dispossession of Serbs are now being
organized.
</P>
<P>
   By whom? By KLA cells which never disbanded under KFOR orders?
By groups coming across the border from Albania?
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, of course, still remember a British minister saying
during the Kosovo war that he wanted ``Serbs Out, NATO in, Refugees
back.'' George Robertson later claimed this was merely a
``distillation'' of the G8 demands.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Serbs Out'' has almost been accomplished. Robertson is now
head of NATO. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ You wouldn't think, looking at the great road bridges
drooping into the Danube, that they could be so powerful a
financial weapon in the hands of Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The tarmac surface and neat white lines and railings finish in
the dark, powerful green billows of one of Europe's major
waterways, a grim tribute to the American Cruise missiles that
destroyed them in April.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the way they are going to stay until Europe shows
its remorse; because as long as the Danube remains blocked, Serbia
has a steel grip on the jugular of Europe. Special friends
excepted.
</P>
<P>
   Europe bombed the bridges _ so now it will have to pay the
price. And it will be a high one.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Serbs, German investors in Hungary are losing
billions of Deutschmarks because of the river's continued closure.
Which may be why an Austrian mission turned up with a proposal to
clear the Danube and build a temporary pontoon for cars on the
piles of the blasted Austro-Hungarian bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs promptly told the Austrians they could rebuild all the
bridges _ or none.
</P>
<P>
   Then the International Danube Commission, under EU pressure,
offered to rebuild all the bridges. And Belgrade turned down the
expanded offer. It would accept no such generosity, the Serbian
government said, until Yugoslavia was readmitted to all
international organizations, including the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a painful beauty in all this. Europe closed
the Danube River, so now it can stay closed _ except for a chosen
few.
</P>
<P>
   For by extraordinary chance, the Austro-Hungarian engineers who
long ago drained the great lakes of Vojvodina, constructed a canal
system around Novi Sad _ a waterway whose road and rail bridges
NATO never thought to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   And along these gentle rivers, Russian and Ukrainian vessels are
now moving through Serbia, bypassing Novi Sad and keeping open
their maritime passage down through the Iron Gates to the Black
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The canal system is a national channel, so ships need Belgrade's
permission to travel on it. Only Serbia's friends _ and those from
whom she needs gas and oil through the winter _ need apply.
</P>
<P>
   It seems bleak compensation for the loss of Kosovo. Indeed,
Serbia's frontiers seem to grow steadily closer each year. But the
Serbs understand _ as many Europeans do not _ that time is as long
as a river and lasts longer than a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have Kosovo at the beginning of the century. And
they certainly don't have it at the end.
</P>
<P>
   This mood of longevity seems to pervade Belgrade, where Europe's
embarrassment on the Danube is light relief compared to the
historical loss of Serbia's supposed ``heartland.'' But as Radomir
Diklic says, the Serbs will wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll wait one or two centuries for Kosovo if necessary,''
the editor of the independent Betanews agency insists. ``We waited
five centuries. And when trouble comes at some point in the future,
when they feel strong, the Serbs will strike back.''
</P>
<P>
   Diklic is not a bloody-minded man. But he has no illusions, and
seems to enjoy Europe's predicament on the Danube. Without Serbia,
he says, there can be no peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a democratic Serbia. But mention the political
opposition to President Milosevic and there comes from Diklic a
choking sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, the opposition here had a unique opportunity,''
he says. ``People were very angry _ they are still very unhappy and
disappointed _ but they are unable to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Diklic is right. On Republic Square each evening,
ever-diminishing groups of young people call for the departure of
the man NATO couldn't kill.
</P>
<P>
   The police watch and smoke cigarettes and look bored. The
speakers tell the people how poor their country has become, how
destitute, how terrible the winter will be. Not, of course, how
atrociously the Albanians of Kosovo were treated during the war.
</P>
<P>
   And early each morning a thick, brown fog lies clammy over
Belgrade, a powerful mixture of wood smoke and untreated diesel
that drifts through the frosty streets.
</P>
<P>
   The dinar is still falling _ you need 18 to buy a single
Deutschmark, the currency to which it was originally pegged _ and
the Serbs with money to spend in Belgrade's restaurants come from
northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a closed little world with not a single foreign newspaper
on sale, with only government exhortations to rebuild _ Milosevic
remains a master of ``people's struggle'' rhetoric _ and a largely
deserted international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single plane flies to Europe, and the United States has
tried to dissuade other nations from allowing JAT, the pariah
national carrier, from landing. So Russia, China, Tunisia, Libya
and, interestingly, Israel _ where Washington apparently has no
leverage on such matters _ are among the few countries to receive
flights from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns and villages of Serbia, they are opening memorial
books containing the names of all those who died in NATO's air
bombardment _ civilians first, soldiers afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   There are marble memorial slabs in town squares and large wooden
billboards to cover up the bomb sites. The highway bridges on the
road to Macedonia have been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Even the railway bridge at Gurdulice _ where NATO bombed a
passenger train into the Morava River _ has been reconstructed. A
single incinerated railway car lies below the girders as a reminder
of the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But the only bridges that matter are the ones still unrepaired

<P>
   BELGRADE _ In the last days of the Paris peace talks on
Yugoslavia last March, something extraordinary happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb delegation _ after agreeing to a political resolution
in Kosovo _ were presented with a military appendix to the treaty
which demanded the virtual NATO occupation of all Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs turned it down and NATO went to war. Yet 79 days
later, NATO _ which had refused to contemplate a change in the
military document _ lost all interest in the annex and at the final
dramatic meetings on the Macedonian border was content with a force
only inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Official obfuscation and confusion has ever since surrounded
this all-important, last-minute addition to the Paris ``peace''
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Was it presented by the Americans in order to force President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to reject the whole peace package and
permit NATO to bomb Serbia?
</P>
<P>
   NATO sources claim the Serbs would anyway never have abided by
the Kosovo political accords _ in which case, why did the West
negotiate with Belgrade in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Even the text of the military appendix was not known to
journalists reporting the two sets of ``peace'' talks in
Rambouillet and Paris. The Serbs say they denounced it at their
last Paris press conference _ an ill attended gathering at the
Yugoslav Embassy at 11 p.m. on March 18, too late for that day's
television news and the next day's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Although a summary of an early draft of the peace treaty was
placed in the House of Commons library on March 1, the full treaty
and the military annexes together were not put in the House library
until April 1 _ the first day of the parliamentary recess and a
week after NATO's bombing campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   The full annexes demanded NATO rights of road, rail and air
passage across all of Yugoslavia, the use of radio stations, even
the waiving of any claims of damages against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   For any state _ even one as grotesque as Serbia _ this would
have amounted to occupation.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vidrine says that the military
appendix was similar to that used by NATO when it moved troops into
Bosnia and that NATO forces needed access to Kosovo through
Belgrade. But he has never explained why this supposedly essential
part of the treaty was abandoned once NATO troops moved into the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Komnenic, who was the Yugoslav Federal information
minister and a member of Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement
(then in government but soon to be in opposition), was in Paris
during the talks and has become preoccupied with the military
annex.
</P>
<P>
   He is writing a book about the negotiations entitled: ``The Trap
of Rambouillet.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, bespectacled figure with a reputation for intelligence
and integrity _ he admits that atrocities were carried out by Serbs
in Kosovo _ he says he still does not understand why the war
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know when the Russians found out about paragraphs 6,
7 and 8 of the annex. Igor Ivanov (the Russian foreign minister)
claimed the Russian side didn't know about the annex at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise is that besides the Americans, no one knew about
the annex. We were given it one day before the end of the Paris
talks _ at `a minute before midnight.' Before that, we heard only
rumors about the implementation of the political agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Komnenic, U.S. negotiator Christopher Hill and the
Austrian diplomat at the talks, Boris Petritsch, insisted on the
annex while Boris Mayorski, the Russian negotiator _ who later
refused to attend the Kosovo Albanian signing of the ``peace''
agreement _ abstained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hill and Petritsch were `for' the annex and (British Foreign
Secretary Robin) Cook and Vidrine apparently agreed with a version
_ not identical to the final annex _ which was called an
`explanation' of the political agreement and which said there could
be no implementation with a NATO presence only in Kosovo,''
Komnenic adds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore in January Komnenic
says, the Hill plan was published without annex B. ``And Hill gave
Mr. Draskovic and myself a copy of the plan in February _ calling
for a military presence in Kosovo but not in all of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then in Paris, Hill opened his bag and put annex B on the
table _ one day before the collapse. I don't even know if our side
knew till then about the Annex... But when we realized the danger
of war was threatening, we `de facto' accepted the political
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the Americans were surprised by our acceptance of
the agreement. So they were preparing their trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the military annex became widely known, western leaders
have either tried to explain it away as a routine addendum to any
peace implementation or an essential mechanism to get NATO into
Kosovo. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cook has adopted both tactics. Replying to Sir Peter Emery in
the Commons foreign affairs committee on April 28 _ when the NATO
bombardment had been going on for more than a month while half the
Albanian population of Kosovo was being ``ethnically cleansed'' by
the Serbs _ Cook stated that: ``The proposal for a military
presence in Kosovo was one confined to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would require a ``force agreement'' with the
Yugoslav government ``that may (sic) be the text which has
appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, he went on, had never been raised by the Serb
delegation ``which suggests to me that there is something deeply
false about the idea that this is now the basis on which talks
broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the military annex was the ``casus belli'' was a
``canard.''
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a minister in Milosevic's government and a close
friend of the president, says that the European Contact Group
designed the political framework for the Rambouillet talks and that
at one meeting the Russians refused to discuss the political and
military annex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the end of the second week of March, our delegation
received the paper which contained the military annex,'' Matic
says. The Contact Group had managed to present the paper without
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our delegation, together with Mayorski, decided to withdraw
acceptance of the paper because it wasn't produced by all the
Contact Group. For this reason, we said the paper was only
`informal.' But the Americans were trying to `legalize' the paper _
which wasn't acceptable to the Russians. Mayorski put in a written
objection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to accept the political solution of the Kosovo
problem and U.N. troops to regulate the implementation, but not
NATO troops in occupation,'' Matic says. ``United Nations Security
Council resolution 1244 (which ended the conflict) could have been
accepted before the bombing.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In any event, when NATO commanders met the Serbs for the
``military-technical agreement'' at the end of the war _ after
thousands of Kosovo Albanians had been murdered by Serb forces and
as many as 1,500 Serb and Albanian civilians slaughtered by NATO
bombs _ the supposedly crucial military annex was never mentioned
by the victors.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, NATO _ with 40,000 troops to move into the
province (10,000 more than originally envisaged at Rambouillet) _
no longer needed appendix B. Not a single NATO soldier moved north
of Kosovo into the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains: ``What was the real purpose of NATO's
last-minute demand? Saving the peace? Or Sabotage? &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE _ In the last days of the Paris peace talks on
Yugoslavia last March, something extraordinary happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb delegation _ after agreeing to a political resolution
in Kosovo _ were presented with a military appendix to the treaty
which demanded the virtual NATO occupation of all Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs turned it down and NATO went to war. Yet 79 days
later, NATO _ which had refused to contemplate a change in the
military document _ lost all interest in the annex and at the final
dramatic meetings on the Macedonian border was content with a force
only inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Official obfuscation and confusion has ever since surrounded
this all-important, last-minute addition to the Paris ``peace''
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Was it presented by the Americans in order to force President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to reject the whole peace package and
permit NATO to bomb Serbia?
</P>
<P>
   NATO sources claim the Serbs would anyway never have abided by
the Kosovo political accords _ in which case, why did the West
negotiate with Belgrade in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Even the text of the military appendix was not known to
journalists reporting the two sets of ``peace'' talks in
Rambouillet and Paris. The Serbs say they denounced it at their
last Paris press conference _ an ill attended gathering at the
Yugoslav Embassy at 11 p.m. on March 18, too late for that day's
television news and the next day's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Although a summary of an early draft of the peace treaty was
placed in the House of Commons library on March 1, the full treaty
and the military annexes together were not put in the House library
until April 1 _ the first day of the parliamentary recess and a
week after NATO's bombing campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   The full annexes demanded NATO rights of road, rail and air
passage across all of Yugoslavia, the use of radio stations, even
the waiving of any claims of damages against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   For any state _ even one as grotesque as Serbia _ this would
have amounted to occupation.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vidrine says that the military
appendix was similar to that used by NATO when it moved troops into
Bosnia and that NATO forces needed access to Kosovo through
Belgrade. But he has never explained why this supposedly essential
part of the treaty was abandoned once NATO troops moved into the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Komnenic, who was the Yugoslav Federal information
minister and a member of Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement
(then in government but soon to be in opposition), was in Paris
during the talks and has become preoccupied with the military
annex.
</P>
<P>
   He is writing a book about the negotiations entitled: ``The Trap
of Rambouillet.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, bespectacled figure with a reputation for intelligence
and integrity _ he admits that atrocities were carried out by Serbs
in Kosovo _ he says he still does not understand why the war
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know when the Russians found out about paragraphs 6,
7 and 8 of the annex. Igor Ivanov (the Russian foreign minister)
claimed the Russian side didn't know about the annex at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise is that besides the Americans, no one knew about
the annex. We were given it one day before the end of the Paris
talks _ at `a minute before midnight.' Before that, we heard only
rumors about the implementation of the political agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Komnenic, U.S. negotiator Christopher Hill and the
Austrian diplomat at the talks, Boris Petritsch, insisted on the
annex while Boris Mayorski, the Russian negotiator _ who later
refused to attend the Kosovo Albanian signing of the ``peace''
agreement _ abstained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hill and Petritsch were `for' the annex and (British Foreign
Secretary Robin) Cook and Vidrine apparently agreed with a version
_ not identical to the final annex _ which was called an
`explanation' of the political agreement and which said there could
be no implementation with a NATO presence only in Kosovo,''
Komnenic adds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore in January Komnenic
says, the Hill plan was published without annex B. ``And Hill gave
Mr. Draskovic and myself a copy of the plan in February _ calling
for a military presence in Kosovo but not in all of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then in Paris, Hill opened his bag and put annex B on the
table _ one day before the collapse. I don't even know if our side
knew till then about the Annex... But when we realized the danger
of war was threatening, we `de facto' accepted the political
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the Americans were surprised by our acceptance of
the agreement. So they were preparing their trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the military annex became widely known, western leaders
have either tried to explain it away as a routine addendum to any
peace implementation or an essential mechanism to get NATO into
Kosovo. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cook has adopted both tactics. Replying to Sir Peter Emery in
the Commons foreign affairs committee on April 28 _ when the NATO
bombardment had been going on for more than a month while half the
Albanian population of Kosovo was being ``ethnically cleansed'' by
the Serbs _ Cook stated that: ``The proposal for a military
presence in Kosovo was one confined to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would require a ``force agreement'' with the
Yugoslav government ``that may (sic) be the text which has
appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, he went on, had never been raised by the Serb
delegation ``which suggests to me that there is something deeply
false about the idea that this is now the basis on which talks
broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the military annex was the ``casus belli'' was a
``canard.''
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a minister in Milosevic's government and a close
friend of the president, says that the European Contact Group
designed the political framework for the Rambouillet talks and that
at one meeting the Russians refused to discuss the political and
military annex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the end of the second week of March, our delegation
received the paper which contained the military annex,'' Matic
says. The Contact Group had managed to present the paper without
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our delegation, together with Mayorski, decided to withdraw
acceptance of the paper because it wasn't produced by all the
Contact Group. For this reason, we said the paper was only
`informal.' But the Americans were trying to `legalize' the paper _
which wasn't acceptable to the Russians. Mayorski put in a written
objection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to accept the political solution of the Kosovo
problem and U.N. troops to regulate the implementation, but not
NATO troops in occupation,'' Matic says. ``United Nations Security
Council resolution 1244 (which ended the conflict) could have been
accepted before the bombing.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In any event, when NATO commanders met the Serbs for the
``military-technical agreement'' at the end of the war _ after
thousands of Kosovo Albanians had been murdered by Serb forces and
as many as 1,500 Serb and Albanian civilians slaughtered by NATO
bombs _ the supposedly crucial military annex was never mentioned
by the victors.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, NATO _ with 40,000 troops to move into the
province (10,000 more than originally envisaged at Rambouillet) _
no longer needed appendix B. Not a single NATO soldier moved north
of Kosovo into the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains: ``What was the real purpose of NATO's
last-minute demand? Saving the peace? Or Sabotage? &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   PRISTINA _ When gunmen tried to murder the local Serb leader
Momcilo Trajkovic in Pristina in October, the daily Kosovo Albanian
newspaper, Koha Ditore _ with a circulation of around 20,000 _ put
his picture on page one.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that day alone, we lost 5,000 readers _ just because we put
his picture on the front,'' one of the paper's journalists says.
``Our readers wouldn't buy our paper because they saw Trajkovic's
photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``forgiveness'' which U.S. President Bill
Clinton recently asked of the Albanians in his best supermarket
style. No wonder Koha Ditore lost readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a debate over what to do,'' the young journalist told
me. ``Do we carry on reporting the news as we wish and lose
thousands of readers? Or do we wait until public opinion changes
before we do something like this again?''
</P>
<P>
   Over at one of Pristina's numerous human-rights groups, there
are no doubts about the template of Kosovo Albanian opinion.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to a man who has witnessed as much carnage in the Middle
East as many Albanians have seen here. ``Can you imagine what these
people felt in the camps in Macedonia when they listened to some of
the stories I heard there?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a man telling of how a Serb paramilitary had pulled a
girl off a truck and cut out her eyes and then left her lying on
the road. Two hours later, he came back and killed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we took evidence from a man who'd seen seven Albanians
tied to a haystack; after they were tied, the haystack was set
alight.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were atrocities. Many of the paramilitaries, it
seems, were on hard drugs _ how else could a man put out the eyes
of a fellow human? _ but NATO let them leave Kosovo untouched.
</P>
<P>
   I recall last June standing by the roadside in Kosovo Polje
beside a British armored vehicle whose soldiers were watching with
amusement as a truckload of Serb gunmen, threading its way through
a Yugoslav army column, passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were wearing shades _ one of them wore a hood _ and
several were swigging from brandy bottles. They had painted ``F___
(expletive) the Shipters'' (Albanians) on their truck along with
crudely drawn pictures of skulls and they were making ``V'' signs
at us. But the NATO boys did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Potential war criminals could leave with the Yugoslav army if
that meant a peaceful NATO entry into Kosovo. That, minus the
diplomatic phrases, was part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the war-crimes officials here would like the
names and identities of the Serb gunmen whose departure NATO did
nothing to prevent. But without the evidence of these men, their
admissions, their defense, there will be precious few arrests. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And atrocity stories are almost as easy to deny as they are to
be believed. ``There was another story I heard,'' the human-rights
official said. ``And I'm not certain it's true. I was told that a
man was put in the bucket of a JCB truck _ the kind you use to
hoist electricity workers up to mend power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I was told the Serbs put an Albanian in the bucket and
then, using the vehicle, tossed him onto high-tension power lines
where he burned to death. But it was a story, third-hand. We could
find no witnesses.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is still no code of law in Kosovo and no
real police force. A constabulary is being trained, it's true _
Serbs as well as Albanians _ but the U.N. police are coming under
constant abuse. Several of their vehicles have been stoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to make crime enquiries when everything you say
has to go through a third party, the interpreter,'' the
human-rights worker says. ``People don't want to talk. There's a
lot of intimidation. And the Albanian mafia is working hard here.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right. At night, the sleek guys from Tirana turn up to
drink cappuccino and brandy in the revamped coffee shop of the
ghastly old Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Their fingers are dripping rings, their hair damp over velvet
collars, their creepy bodyguards working mobile phones at the next
table. They are collecting taxes from the shopkeepers (Deutschmarks
only), deciding who should run the growing street market of
vegetable, meat and CD stalls.
</P>
<P>
   They don't even bother to look at the U.N. cops cruising the
streets in their little red cars. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 28 the Kosovo Albanians celebrated a 15th-century
Albanian uprising against Ottoman rule, and the 1912 declaration of
Albanian independence. In the early hours of the following day, a
mob in Pristina hauled three elderly Serbs from their car, shot the
man dead and assaulted the two women. And outside, in the
countryside, houses still burn. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real flaw not to have police coming in here with
KFOR,'' the human-rights official says. ``There is going to have to
be some form of international law to cover the interim period after
a war. These are topics for a major debate in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, NATO blames the U.N. for not putting more
policemen into Kosovo more quickly. But when NATO was at war, it
didn't want any United Nations involvement. It didn't want to talk
about policemen with the bureaucrats on Manhattan's East River.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the war was over, when it needed cops, did NATO expect
the U.N. to snap to attention and provide a ready-made police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, with the last gypsies herded into camps _ there
are 740 in a camp at Pristina and another 460 in Macedonia _ the
West's determination to maintain an Albanian-Serb society in the
province appears futile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, KFOR _ with its British, American, Turkish, Emirate,
German and other peacekeeping contingents _ is now the only
multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. &QL;

   PRISTINA _ When gunmen tried to murder the local Serb leader
Momcilo Trajkovic in Pristina in October, the daily Kosovo Albanian
newspaper, Koha Ditore _ with a circulation of around 20,000 _ put
his picture on page one.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that day alone, we lost 5,000 readers _ just because we put
his picture on the front,'' one of the paper's journalists says.
``Our readers wouldn't buy our paper because they saw Trajkovic's
photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``forgiveness'' which U.S. President Bill
Clinton recently asked of the Albanians in his best supermarket
style. No wonder Koha Ditore lost readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a debate over what to do,'' the young journalist told
me. ``Do we carry on reporting the news as we wish and lose
thousands of readers? Or do we wait until public opinion changes
before we do something like this again?''
</P>
<P>
   Over at one of Pristina's numerous human-rights groups, there
are no doubts about the template of Kosovo Albanian opinion.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to a man who has witnessed as much carnage in the Middle
East as many Albanians have seen here. ``Can you imagine what these
people felt in the camps in Macedonia when they listened to some of
the stories I heard there?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a man telling of how a Serb paramilitary had pulled a
girl off a truck and cut out her eyes and then left her lying on
the road. Two hours later, he came back and killed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we took evidence from a man who'd seen seven Albanians
tied to a haystack; after they were tied, the haystack was set
alight.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were atrocities. Many of the paramilitaries, it
seems, were on hard drugs _ how else could a man put out the eyes
of a fellow human? _ but NATO let them leave Kosovo untouched.
</P>
<P>
   I recall last June standing by the roadside in Kosovo Polje
beside a British armored vehicle whose soldiers were watching with
amusement as a truckload of Serb gunmen, threading its way through
a Yugoslav army column, passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were wearing shades _ one of them wore a hood _ and
several were swigging from brandy bottles. They had painted ``F___
(expletive) the Shipters'' (Albanians) on their truck along with
crudely drawn pictures of skulls and they were making ``V'' signs
at us. But the NATO boys did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Potential war criminals could leave with the Yugoslav army if
that meant a peaceful NATO entry into Kosovo. That, minus the
diplomatic phrases, was part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the war-crimes officials here would like the
names and identities of the Serb gunmen whose departure NATO did
nothing to prevent. But without the evidence of these men, their
admissions, their defense, there will be precious few arrests. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And atrocity stories are almost as easy to deny as they are to
be believed. ``There was another story I heard,'' the human-rights
official said. ``And I'm not certain it's true. I was told that a
man was put in the bucket of a JCB truck _ the kind you use to
hoist electricity workers up to mend power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I was told the Serbs put an Albanian in the bucket and
then, using the vehicle, tossed him onto high-tension power lines
where he burned to death. But it was a story, third-hand. We could
find no witnesses.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is still no code of law in Kosovo and no
real police force. A constabulary is being trained, it's true _
Serbs as well as Albanians _ but the U.N. police are coming under
constant abuse. Several of their vehicles have been stoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to make crime enquiries when everything you say
has to go through a third party, the interpreter,'' the
human-rights worker says. ``People don't want to talk. There's a
lot of intimidation. And the Albanian mafia is working hard here.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right. At night, the sleek guys from Tirana turn up to
drink cappuccino and brandy in the revamped coffee shop of the
ghastly old Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Their fingers are dripping rings, their hair damp over velvet
collars, their creepy bodyguards working mobile phones at the next
table. They are collecting taxes from the shopkeepers (Deutschmarks
only), deciding who should run the growing street market of
vegetable, meat and CD stalls.
</P>
<P>
   They don't even bother to look at the U.N. cops cruising the
streets in their little red cars. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 28 the Kosovo Albanians celebrated a 15th-century
Albanian uprising against Ottoman rule, and the 1912 declaration of
Albanian independence. In the early hours of the following day, a
mob in Pristina hauled three elderly Serbs from their car, shot the
man dead and assaulted the two women. And outside, in the
countryside, houses still burn. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   ``It was a real flaw not to have police coming in here with
KFOR,'' the human-rights official says. ``There is going to have to
be some form of international law to cover the interim period after
a war. These are topics for a major debate in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, NATO blames the U.N. for not putting more
policemen into Kosovo more quickly. But when NATO was at war, it
didn't want any United Nations involvement. It didn't want to talk
about policemen with the bureaucrats on Manhattan's East River.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the war was over, when it needed cops, did NATO expect
the U.N. to snap to attention and provide a ready-made police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, with the last gypsies herded into camps _ there
are 740 in a camp at Pristina and another 460 in Macedonia _ the
West's determination to maintain an Albanian-Serb society in the
province appears futile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, KFOR _ with its British, American, Turkish, Emirate,
German and other peacekeeping contingents _ is now the only
multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. &QL;

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A colleague of mine _ a normally decent, thoughtful,
rational man _ went completely bonkers in the run-up to the 1991
Gulf War. It was a moral war, he kept exclaiming.
</P>
<P>
   We were not trying to liberate Kuwait because of its oil wealth
but because of the West's moral mission to stand up to dictators.
If we didn't fight Saddam Hussein, he insisted, it would be Munich
all over again. Anyone who wanted peace now was an appeaser.
</P>
<P>
   And when the press corps _ thousands and thousands of them _
turned up en masse at the Grand Hotel in Pristina in the wake of
NATO's army last June, it wasn't difficult to spot those of our
colleagues who had been taken over by events.
</P>
<P>
   Two gentlemen of the press arrived in full military costume and
floppy camouflage hats; another _ presumably unable to shake off
his Gulf War experiences _ marched into the cockroach-infested
hotel in desert fatigues, having not noticed that the Balkans are
covered in trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, there arrived, too, the ``frothers,'' those
journalists who had convinced themselves of the justice of this war
and of the wickedness of the opposing side.
</P>
<P>
   Even before NATO's advance, David Chater of Britain's Sky TV _ a
courageous journalist who was seriously injured in Croatia at the
start of the Yugoslav war _ was lecturing us on the ``moral'' cause
behind the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached Djakovica and Pec in advance of Italian
troops, he was announcing that ``there's a sense of fear and a
smell of evil... this evil... is still going on and I doubt that
anyone is doing anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm always a bit skeptical of people who ``smell'' evil.
Evil may be palpable and it's possible to smell the awful results
of evil _ in the case of Kosovo, hundreds of murdered Albanians _
but I suspect that people who think they can actually smell
wickedness need a vacation. Or at least a reminder that they have
not taken holy orders. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the flip side of this moralizing can be extremely
unpleasant. In Belgrade, for example, a CNN reporter astounded one
of his English colleagues after NATO had bombed a narrow road
bridge in the Yugoslav village of Varvarin, killing dozens of
civilians, many of whom fell to their death in the River Morava.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll teach them not to stand on bridges,'' he roared. This
was not the kind of language he used on air, of course, where CNN's
report on the bridge killings was accompanied by the remark that
there had been civilian casualties ``according to the Serb
authorities'' _ all this when CNN's own crew had been there and
filmed the decapitated corpse of the local priest.
</P>
<P>
   But does any of this matter when CNN's cryptic warning about its
own Belgrade reports being subject to ``certain restrictions''
effectively destroyed the credibility of its journalists?
</P>
<P>
   Serb restrictions there were aplenty for the TV boys _ but was
NATO allowing journalists to wander on to the Aviano air base to
interview its returning pilots?
</P>
<P>
   Were there not a few ``restrictions'' in our reporting of NATO
and all its works? Not that you'd need them in Brussels, for most

   There were a few exceptions _ Christopher Dickey of Newsweek
comes to mind _ but most of the other members of the press allowed
themselves to be used as a mouthpiece for the military, ``sheep''
who bleated appropriately when NATO boasted of the bombing sorties
over Serbia or who passed on NATO's regrets when it killed
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   By the time American jets had destroyed an entire hospital at
Surdulica, they gave up, failing to challenge NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea even when he claimed _ untruthfully _ that the hospital was a
barracks.
</P>
<P>
   For challenging authority is part of a journalist's job. And
challenging one's own representatives in time of war is a duty,
albeit a difficult one, in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Serb journalists were largely too fearful _ or too servile _ to
criticize Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. But that doesn't
mean we have to behave like them.
</P>
<P>
   Not a soul among the NATO press corps attempted to question the
extraordinary claims of military success against the Yugoslav Third
Army in Kosovo _ claims which now turn out to have been a pack of
lies. (The Serbs, interestingly enough, say they lost 19 tanks _
but NATO officials now privately think they only destroyed 13!).
</P>
<P>
   Is there not a lesson in all this for Matthew Chance of CNN or
the BBC's Mark Laity who has shown himself, when talking to
generals, to be a sheep in sheep's clothing?
</P>
<P>
   Even NATO's language went unchallenged. It exhumed that dreadful
old Gulf War phrase ``collateral damage''; and the use of ``air
campaign'' for NATO's bombardment _ as if hundreds of MIG 29s were
attacking our brave bomber pilots _ went unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   But why shouldn't it when information about the war _ for the
first time in recent history _ was directed almost entirely at a
tabloid audience? &QL;

   NASA's Jamie Shea could quote Hobbes and Shakespeare, but it was
his smug references to the turning off of Belgrade's lights and his
illusion to Milosevic as Al Capone that caught the flavor of his
media approach.
</P>
<P>
   This was a war for the bloke in the street and the more vividly
Shea expressed his horror at all the mass graves to be found in
Kosovo the more simple the conflict appeared to be.
</P>
<P>
   The message was simple. NATO would bomb Serbia until Milosevic's
``murder machine'' ended its ``genocide'' against the Albanians and
allowed the refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most of the refugees were alive and in their homes
when NATO began the war _ the fact that Shea's lip smacking exposes
of mass graves proved that NATO had totally failed to protect the
people for whom it had supposedly gone to war _ was totally
ignored. &QL;

   NATO's bombing brought a kind of peace to Kosovo _ but only
after it had given the Serbs the opportunity to massacre or
dispossess half the Albanian population of the province, caused
billions of dollars in damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure,
killed hundreds of Yugoslav civilians, destabilized Macedonia and
gravely damaged relations with China. And the media called this a

   As usual, the Second World War was trundled out. Milosevic was
Hitler, the Serbs were no better than the Nazis, and the persecuted
Albanians became the Jews of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Most editorials followed a familiar theme: we could not appease
the tyrants of Belgrade. And now another line is appearing in
editorials; that the mass graves prove that the Serbs really were
wicked (shades of Chater ``smelling'' evil) and that everything
that NATO did _ including the killing of all those Serb civilians _
was justified.
</P>
<P>
   What no newspaper picked up was the critical difference between
the ``peace'' agreement which Serbia refused to sign in March,
which would have allowed NATO troops free movement throughout all
of Serbia and given the Albanians a three year opt-out clause for
independence _ and the watered down version which ended the war,
which restricted NATO to Kosovo and insisted that Kosovo remained
part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Not one journalist asked the obvious question: if the world had
offered this to the Serbs in the first place, might they have
accepted? Might we have avoided war?
</P>
<P>
   For some reporters, the excitement of Kosovo's ``liberation'' _
we shall see if the K.L.A. really believes this is the right word _
proved too much.
</P>
<P>
   As cheering Albanians flung roses at British troops entering
Pristina last June, my old friend Robert Fox of the London Evening
Standard, began bawling in my ear: ``Fascist Irish Guards Oppress
Fleeing Serbs,'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   I was glad to note he had observed the fleeing Serbs. But what
was he talking about? ``I've just given you your `intro' for
tonight,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably I had not joined in the bestialization of the Serbs.
Perhaps I had not supported the ``morality'' of NATO's war. I wish
he had been around to help protect my Albanian interpreter's family
from Serb gunmen the night before. &QL;

   Amid the ``frothers'' and the ``sheep,'' however there were a
few steady hands and - pain me though it does to say this of a
Murdoch show - Sky TV's coverage seemed by far the most
independent-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Thompson's polite sergeant major approach to all
interviewees had Serb killer Arkan squirming in his shoes while
Keith Graves _ a wolf in wolf's clothing _ well and truly shafted
NATO when he found French troops controlling the flow of Albanian
looters through the streets of Graca.
</P>
<P>
   I should also add that when my Albanian interpreter's family
were threatened by Serb paramilitaries, the only television
reporter who was prepared _ at great risk to himself _ to come to
their home with a crew to try to protect them was Jim Clancy of
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another CNN story _ not involving Clancy _ that
still needs explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before NATO bombed the Serb television headquarters in
Belgrade, CNN received a tip from its Atlanta headquarters that the
building was to be destroyed. They were told to remove their
facilities from the premises at once, which they did.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Serbian information minister Aleksander Vucic
received a faxed invitation from the ``Larry King Live'' show in
the U.S., to appear on CNN. They wanted him on air at 2:30 in the
morning of April 23 and asked him to arrive at Serb Television half
an hour early for makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Vucic was late _ which was just as well for him since NATO
missiles slammed into the building at six minutes past two. The
first one exploded in the makeup room where the young Serb
assistant was burned to death.
</P>
<P>
   CNN calls this all a coincidence, saying that the Larry King
show, put out by the entertainment division, did not know of the
news department's instruction to its men to leave the Belgrade
building.
</P>
<P>

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A colleague of mine _ a normally decent, thoughtful,
rational man _ went completely bonkers in the run-up to the 1991
Gulf War. It was a moral war, he kept exclaiming.
</P>
<P>
   We were not trying to liberate Kuwait because of its oil wealth
but because of the West's moral mission to stand up to dictators.
If we didn't fight Saddam Hussein, he insisted, it would be Munich
all over again. Anyone who wanted peace now was an appeaser.
</P>
<P>
   And when the press corps _ thousands and thousands of them _
turned up en masse at the Grand Hotel in Pristina in the wake of
NATO's army last June, it wasn't difficult to spot those of our
colleagues who had been taken over by events.
</P>
<P>
   Two gentlemen of the press arrived in full military costume and
floppy camouflage hats; another _ presumably unable to shake off
his Gulf War experiences _ marched into the cockroach-infested
hotel in desert fatigues, having not noticed that the Balkans are
covered in trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, there arrived, too, the ``frothers,'' those
journalists who had convinced themselves of the justice of this war
and of the wickedness of the opposing side.
</P>
<P>
   Even before NATO's advance, David Chater of Britain's Sky TV _ a
courageous journalist who was seriously injured in Croatia at the
start of the Yugoslav war _ was lecturing us on the ``moral'' cause
behind the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached Djakovica and Pec in advance of Italian
troops, he was announcing that ``there's a sense of fear and a
smell of evil... this evil... is still going on and I doubt that
anyone is doing anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm always a bit skeptical of people who ``smell'' evil.
Evil may be palpable and it's possible to smell the awful results
of evil _ in the case of Kosovo, hundreds of murdered Albanians _
but I suspect that people who think they can actually smell
wickedness need a vacation. Or at least a reminder that they have
not taken holy orders. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the flip side of this moralizing can be extremely
unpleasant. In Belgrade, for example, a CN reporter astounded one
of his English colleagues after NATO had bombed a narrow road
bridge in the Yugoslav village of Varvarin, killing dozens of
civilians, many of whom fell to their death in the River Morava.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll teach them not to stand on bridges,'' he roared. This
was not the kind of language he used on air, of course, where CNN's
report on the bridge killings was accompanied by the remark that
there had been civilian casualties ``according to the Serb
authorities'' _ all this when CNN's own crew had been there and
filmed the decapitated corpse of the local priest.
</P>
<P>
   But does any of this matter when CNN's cryptic warning about its
own Belgrade reports being subject to ``certain restrictions''
effectively destroyed the credibility of its journalists?
</P>
<P>
   Serb restrictions there were aplenty for the TV boys _ but was
NATO allowing journalists to wander on to the Aviano air base to
interview its returning pilots?
</P>
<P>
   Were there not a few ``restrictions'' in our reporting of NATO
and all its works? Not that you'd need them in Brussels, for most
of the journalists at NATO headquarters were so supine, so utterly
taken in by NATO's generals and air commodores that their questions
might have been printed out for them by NATO in advance. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A colleague of mine _ a normally decent, thoughtful,
rational man _ went completely bonkers in the run-up to the 1991
Gulf War. It was a moral war, he kept exclaiming.
</P>
<P>
   We were not trying to liberate Kuwait because of its oil wealth
but because of the West's moral mission to stand up to dictators.
If we didn't fight Saddam Hussein, he insisted, it would be Munich
all over again. Anyone who wanted peace now was an appeaser.
</P>
<P>
   And when the press corps _ thousands and thousands of them _
turned up en masse at the Grand Hotel in Pristina in the wake of
NATO's army last June, it wasn't difficult to spot those of our
colleagues who had been taken over by events.
</P>
<P>
   Two gentlemen of the press arrived in full military costume and
floppy camouflage hats; another _ presumably unable to shake off
his Gulf War experiences _ marched into the cockroach-infested
hotel in desert fatigues, having not noticed that the Balkans are
covered in trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, there arrived, too, the ``frothers,'' those
journalists who had convinced themselves of the justice of this war
and of the wickedness of the opposing side.
</P>
<P>
   Even before NATO's advance, David Chater of Britain's Sky TV _ a
courageous journalist who was seriously injured in Croatia at the
start of the Yugoslav war _ was lecturing us on the ``moral'' cause
behind the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached Djakovica and Pec in advance of Italian
troops, he was announcing that ``there's a sense of fear and a
smell of evil... this evil... is still going on and I doubt that
anyone is doing anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm always a bit skeptical of people who ``smell'' evil.
Evil may be palpable and it's possible to smell the awful results
of evil _ in the case of Kosovo, hundreds of murdered Albanians _
but I suspect that people who think they can actually smell
wickedness need a vacation. Or at least a reminder that they have
not taken holy orders. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the flip side of this moralizing can be extremely
unpleasant. In Belgrade, for example, a CNN reporter astounded one
of his English colleagues after NATO had bombed a narrow road
bridge in the Yugoslav village of Varvarin, killing dozens of
civilians, many of whom fell to their death in the River Morava.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll teach them not to stand on bridges,'' he roared. This
was not the kind of language he used on air, of course, where CNN's
report on the bridge killings was accompanied by the remark that
there had been civilian casualties ``according to the Serb
authorities'' _ all this when CNN's own crew had been there and
filmed the decapitated corpse of the local priest.
</P>
<P>
   But does any of this matter when CNN's cryptic warning about its
own Belgrade reports being subject to ``certain restrictions''
effectively destroyed the credibility of its journalists?
</P>
<P>
   Serb restrictions there were aplenty for the TV boys _ but was
NATO allowing journalists to wander on to the Aviano air base to
interview its returning pilots?
</P>
<P>
   Were there not a few ``restrictions'' in our reporting of NATO
and all its works? Not that you'd need them in Brussels, for most
of the journalists at NATO headquarters were so supine, so utterly
taken in by NATO's generals and air commodores that their questions
might have been printed out for them by NATO in advance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were a few exceptions _ Christopher Dickey of Newsweek
comes to mind _ but most of the other members of the press allowed
themselves to be used as a mouthpiece for the military, ``sheep''
who bleated appropriately when NATO boasted of the bombing sorties
over Serbia or who passed on NATO's regrets when it killed
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   By the time American jets had destroyed an entire hospital at
Surdulica, they gave up, failing to challenge NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea even when he claimed _ untruthfully _ that the hospital was a
barracks.
</P>
<P>
   For challenging authority is part of a journalist's job. And
challenging one's own representatives in time of war is a duty,
albeit a difficult one, in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Serb journalists were largely too fearful _ or too servile _ to
criticize Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. But that doesn't
mean we have to behave like them.
</P>
<P>
   Not a soul among the NATO press corps attempted to question the
extraordinary claims of military success against the Yugoslav Third
Army in Kosovo _ claims which now turn out to have been a pack of
lies. (The Serbs, interestingly enough, say they lost 19 tanks _
but NATO officials now privately think they only destroyed 13!).
</P>
<P>
   Is there not a lesson in all this for Matthew Chance of CNN or
the BBC's Mark Laity who has shown himself, when talking to
generals, to be a sheep in sheep's clothing?
</P>
<P>
   Even NATO's language went unchallenged. It exhumed that dreadful
old Gulf War phrase ``collateral damage''; and the use of ``air
campaign'' for NATO's bombardment _ as if hundreds of MIG 29s were
attacking our brave bomber pilots _ went unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   But why shouldn't it when information about the war _ for the
first time in recent history _ was directed almost entirely at a
tabloid audience? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Jamie Shea could quote Hobbes and Shakespeare, but it was
his smug references to the turning off of Belgrade's lights and his
illusion to Milosevic as Al Capone that caught the flavor of his
media approach.
</P>
<P>
   This was a war for the bloke in the street and the more vividly
Shea expressed his horror at all the mass graves to be found in
Kosovo the more simple the conflict appeared to be.
</P>
<P>
   The message was simple. NATO would bomb Serbia until Milosevic's
``murder machine'' ended its ``genocide'' against the Albanians and
allowed the refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most of the refugees were alive and in their homes
when NATO began the war _ the fact that Shea's lip smacking exposes
of mass graves proved that NATO had totally failed to protect the
people for whom it had supposedly gone to war _ was totally
ignored. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing brought a kind of peace to Kosovo _ but only
after it had given the Serbs the opportunity to massacre or
dispossess half the Albanian population of the province, caused
billions of dollars in damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure,
killed hundreds of Yugoslav civilians, destabilized Macedonia and
gravely damaged relations with China. And the media called this a
successful war. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 325 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Second World War was trundled out. Milosevic was
Hitler, the Serbs were no better than the Nazis, and the persecuted
Albanians became the Jews of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Most editorials followed a familiar theme: we could not appease
the tyrants of Belgrade. And now another line is appearing in
editorials; that the mass graves prove that the Serbs really were
wicked (shades of Chater ``smelling'' evil) and that everything
that NATO did _ including the killing of all those Serb civilians _
was justified.
</P>
<P>
   What no newspaper picked up was the critical difference between
the ``peace'' agreement which Serbia refused to sign in March,
which would have allowed NATO troops free movement throughout all
of Serbia and given the Albanians a three year opt-out clause for
independence _ and the watered down version which ended the war,
which restricted NATO to Kosovo and insisted that Kosovo remained
part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Not one journalist asked the obvious question: if the world had
offered this to the Serbs in the first place, might they have
accepted? Might we have avoided war?
</P>
<P>
   For some reporters, the excitement of Kosovo's ``liberation'' _
we shall see if the K.L.A. really believes this is the right word _
proved too much.
</P>
<P>
   As cheering Albanians flung roses at British troops entering
Pristina last June, my old friend Robert Fox of the London Evening
Standard, began bawling in my ear: ``Fascist Irish Guards Oppress
Fleeing Serbs,'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   I was glad to note he had observed the fleeing Serbs. But what
was he talking about? ``I've just given you your `intro' for
tonight,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably I had not joined in the bestialization of the Serbs.
Perhaps I had not supported the ``morality'' of NATO's war. I wish
he had been around to help protect my Albanian interpreter's family
from Serb gunmen the night before. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid the ``frothers'' and the ``sheep,'' however there were a
few steady hands and - pain me though it does to say this of a
Murdoch show - Sky TV's coverage seemed by far the most
independent-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Thompson's polite sergeant major approach to all
interviewees had Serb killer Arkan squirming in his shoes while
Keith Graves _ a wolf in wolf's clothing _ well and truly shafted
NATO when he found French troops controlling the flow of Albanian
looters through the streets of Graca.
</P>
<P>
   I should also add that when my Albanian interpreter's family
were threatened by Serb paramilitaries, the only television
reporter who was prepared _ at great risk to himself _ to come to
their home with a crew to try to protect them was Jim Clancy of
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another CNN story _ not involving Clancy _ that
still needs explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before NATO bombed the Serb television headquarters in
Belgrade, CNN received a tip from its Atlanta headquarters that the
building was to be destroyed. They were told to remove their
facilities from the premises at once, which they did.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Serbian information minister Aleksander Vucic
received a faxed invitation from the ``Larry King Live'' show in
the U.S., to appear on CNN. They wanted him on air at 2:30 in the
morning of April 23 and asked him to arrive at Serb Television half
an hour early for makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Vucic was late _ which was just as well for him since NATO
missiles slammed into the building at six minutes past two. The
first one exploded in the makeup room where the young Serb
assistant was burned to death.
</P>
<P>
   CNN calls this all a coincidence, saying that the Larry King
show, put out by the entertainment division, did not know of the
news department's instruction to its men to leave the Belgrade
building.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 2, 2,000, have moved.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the 2000 presidential primary
season begins, there seems to be a consensus among political
leaders and academics that the primary system as it has developed
has produced the opposite of what had been intended. Instead of a
process that engages voters, the ever-shortening calendar is more
apt to disenfranchise them, with its early finish and narrow window
within which to consider the candidates. Instead of assuring big
states a big voice in the final nominee, the calendar dilutes their
influence, since so many of them have crowded their primaries onto
the same two early Tuesdays. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-IMMIG-REVIEW (United Nations) _ In a few decades, say
demographers, Europe will face an American-style phenomenon more
unsettling than any superficial cultural symbol or business
intrusion. To survive economically and socially, Europe may have to
lower its bars to immigration and change its racial and ethnic face
through mass migration of labor from around the world. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CANNIBALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cannibalism has been in the news
as rival experts try to get this bizarre but revealing topic into
focus. The issue is whether cannibalism was once a routine part of
human social behavior or is merely a myth designed to justify
advanced nations' domination over primitive and allegedly
anthropophagous peoples. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   BOOT-CAMPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Boot camps for juvenile offenders
may be an idea whose time came and went. A number of states have
closed their boot camps and begun rethinking how their penal laws
treat young offenders. All in all, it is a remarkable turn of
events for an idea that was once greeted as a breakthrough in the
fight against juvenile crime. There is increasing evidence that
boot-camps never worked. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   PLAIN-LANGUAGE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A cottage industry of
plain-language consultants has sprung up in recent years. They aim
to wage war on the business buzzwords, governmental verbosity and
turgid legalese that make many public documents impossible to
understand. Some samples of the consultants' work.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-CAPSULE-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``We choose freedom because it
gives us the power to live, learn, and love,'' wrote students from
an elementary school in the Northern Mariana Islands. Their essay,
along with Ray Charles' sunglasses, photos of Earth from space, a
Twinkie, Corningware, a computer chip, the Bill of Rights, a World
War II helmet, a cell phone and a piece of the Berlin Wall will be
among the items sealed this summer in the National Millennium Time
Capsule until 2100. By Kari Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-YELTSIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Boris Yeltsin announced
his resignation on Dec. 31, 1999, he used the word ``power'' five
times. When Lenin issued his famous call to revolution on Oct. 24,
1917, he also used the word ``power'' five times. Lenin was about
to seize power and create the totalitarian system that Yeltsin
later toppled before relinquishing power. Yet power, and the thirst
for it, is the connection between two Russian leaders who only a
few years ago symbolized opposite extremes. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ALGERIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ During World War II, Americans
knew the strategic importance of Algeria. But that may have been
the last time they really focused their attention on it. Today,
amid fears of a new kind of warfare, Algeria is once again
thrusting itself onto America's consciousness, now that figures
linked to its Islamic underground have been accused of carrying
their terrorist war into the U.S. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-ATROCITIES-REVIEW (Nairobi) _ The violence in Africa's
Great Lakes region _ Burundi, Rwanda and eastern Congo _ makes it
one of the world's most grim and complicated places, one where
well-meaning outsiders periodically wonder whether, and how, they
might step in to halt the violence. The question comes down to
this: Are these spasms of killing the result of old hatreds, or are
they grotesque products of political manipulation? By Ian Fisher.

   A Rough Night on the Town
</P>
<P>
   Sean ``Puffy'' Combs has the indisputable ability to attract
attention. The rap impresario throws lavish parties, drapes himself
in furs and jewelry, dates movie star Jennifer Lopez and all but
begs people to look his way. Some say this is a job requirement for
a hip-hop star; others find it a tad excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Combs, 30, attracted more attention _ the unwanted
kind _ when he was arrested after an early-morning shootout in a
Manhattan nightclub. The arrest led to inevitable newspaper
photographs depicting Combs skulking away from a police station.
</P>
<P>
   Police say a club patron taunted Combs by throwing a wad of
money at the multimillionaire. Combs and a young protege pulled out
guns, they say, but only the protege pulled his trigger. Three
bystanders were shot and wounded in the confusion that ensued,
while Combs and Ms. Lopez fled in a sports-utility vehicle that ran
11 red lights before being pulled over.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found a gun in the car that had not been fired,
but it was loaded _ and stolen. Combs, his driver and his bodyguard
were charged with criminal possession of a weapon, while his
protege was charged with attempted murder. Combs later held a news
conference to strongly deny having anything to do with the shootout
or with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the episode resurrected doubts about the rap star's
judgment. In April, for example, Combs and two associates beat up a
record executive who had angered him; he later pleaded guilty to a
violation. The arrest also comes at a time when record sales for
his Bad Boy Entertainment empire have slipped.
</P>
<P>
   As for questions about Combs' performance as a role model, his
friend and business colleague, Andre Harrell, said, ``When you
judge Sean against his peers, he's not doing such a bad job.''

   A Cold War Relic Signs Off
</P>
<P>
   For schoolchildren in the 1950s or '60s, there were few sounds
more terrifying than the wail of an air raid siren. No matter that
it was only a test: The sound will forever conjure up visions of
Soviet jets and mushroom clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But 50 years after cities from coast to coast installed the
early warning systems, the sirens have become little more than
annoying relics of the Cold War. This year, Baltimore will become
the latest city to abandon the system and its tests of 122 sirens
that blared from speakers around town each Monday at 1 p.m. A new
network of radio-controlled sirens, which do not require routine
testing, will be installed to alert people to impending natural
disasters or terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have put the old systems to similar use.
Tornado-prone Omaha tests its system once a month, and San
Francisco, which is prone to earthquakes, runs a test every Tuesday
at noon. But why anyone would need a siren to tell them that there
had been an earthquake is an open question.

   China Sentences 4 Members Of Spiritual Group
</P>
<P>
   Sending a harsh message to followers of the Falun Gong spiritual
movement, Chinese authorities gave prison sentences ranging from 7
to 18 years to three men and a woman who were said to be top
organizers. Last summer the government declared the group an ``evil
cult'' after 10,000 members mounted an illegal demonstration in
Beijing.
</P>

   McCain took in $6.1 million and Bradley received $8 million,

   Prosecutors have started a criminal investigation into secret
bank accounts used by former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
collect and distribute at least $1 million in allegedly illegal
political contributions during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation marks a low point for Kohl, who was chancellor

   Anyone who was once a Beatle, even the ``quiet'' one, can never
fade away and live a simple life _ no matter how big the mansion,

   A Rough Night on the Town
</P>
<P>
   Sean ``Puffy'' Combs has the indisputable ability to attract
attention. The rap impresario throws lavish parties, drapes himself
in furs and jewelry, dates movie star Jennifer Lopez and all but
begs people to look his way. Some say this is a job requirement for
a hip-hop star; others find it a tad excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Combs, 30, attracted more attention _ the unwanted
kind _ when he was arrested after an early-morning shootout in a
Manhattan nightclub. The arrest led to inevitable newspaper
photographs depicting kulking away from a police station.
</P>
<P>
   Police say a club patron taunted Combs by throwing a wad of
money at the multimillionaire. Combs and a young protege pulled out
guns, they say, but only the protege pulled his trigger. Three
bystanders were shot and wounded in the confusion that ensued,
while Combs and Ms. Lopez fled in a sports-utility vehicle that ran
11 red lights before being pulled over.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found a gun in the car that had not been fired,
but it was loaded _ and stolen. Combs, his driver and his bodyguard
were charged with criminal possession of a weapon, while his
protege was charged with attempted murder. Combs later held a news
conference to strongly deny havihing to do with the shootout
or with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the episode resurrected doubts about the rap star's
judgment. In April, for example, Combs and two associates beat up a
record executive who had angered him; he later pleaded guilty to a
violation. The arrest also comes at a time when record sales for
his Bad Boy Entertainment empire have slipped.
</P>
<P>
   As for questions about Combs' performance as a role model, his
friend and business colleague, Andre Harrell, said, ``When you
judge Sean against his peers, he's not doing such a bad job.''

   A Cold War Relic Signs Off
</P>
<P>
   For schoolchildren in the 1950s or '60s, there were few sounds
more terrifying than the wail of an air raid siren. No matter that
it was only a test: The sound will forever conjure up visions of
Soviet jets and mushroom clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But 50 years after cities from coast to coast installed the
early warning systems, the sirens have become little more than
annoying relics of the Cold War. This year, Baltimore will become
the latest city to abandon the system and its tests of 122 sirens
that blared from speakers around town each Monday at 1 p.m. A new
network of radio-controlled sirens, which do not require routine
testing, will be installed to alert people to impending natural
disasters or terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have put the old systems to similar use.
Tornado-prone Omaha tests its system once a month, and San
Francisco, which is prone to earthquakes, runs a test every Tuesday
at noon. But why anyone would need a siren to tell them that there
had been an earthquake is an open question.

   China Sentences 4 Members Of Spiritual Group
</P>
<P>
   Sending a harsh message to followers of the Falun Gong spiritual
movement, Chinese authorities gave prison sentences ranging from 7
to 18 years to three men and a woman who were said to be top
organizers. Last summer the government declared the group an ``evil
cult'' after 10,000 members mounted an illegal demonstration in
Beijing.

   Huge Storm Damage in France
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back storms with gale force winds that reached 120 miles
per hour ripped through France and other parts of Europe. The
French Ministry of Culture and Communication said it would take
more than $60 million just to repair damage to historic monuments
like Notre Dame Cathedral, Ste.-Chapelle and the palace at
Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   The storms tore off roofs, toppled thousands of trees and caused
flooding and avalanches that killed at least 130 people throughout
Europe, 78 of them in France. More than a quarter of Frances
electric grid was damaged. One insurance company said the cost of
repairing damages from the storms would reach $5 billion.

day later, a military junta announced a coup, the first in the
country's history.

<P>
   The company called every customer who had ordered the products
over the Internet and through its catalog _ a total of 3,576 calls.

   Bail Is Denied For Los Alamos Scientist

scientist accused of mishandling sensitive nuclear secrets at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, were simple. Lee sought to be
released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   He was refused bail a second time, but not before the hearing
was turned into a mini-trial of both Lee and the security at
government weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called Lee devious in his efforts to bypass security
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, however, showed that Lee had downloaded the secret
data easily onto computer tapes, had left evidence in the open and
had even called the lab to ask how to delete some files. The last
was an act that prosecutors called especially nefarious.

   &UR; ERRATA: An Examined Life &LR;  By George Steiner. Yale University,
$11.95. In this memoir, the scholar, author and literary critic
portrays himself as a polyglot polymath who has rarely received the
respect he deserves. ``Steiner worships smartness,'' Anthony
Gottlieb wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1998. ``The
book is primarily a tour of ideas, not of places or people.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TESSERACT &LR;  By Alex Garland. Riverhead, $13. The author's
follow-up to his hugely popular first novel, ``The Beach,'' is a
four-part narrative mosaic, set in the Philippines, that unfolds
through the points of view of many unrelated characters, including
a young, paranoid Englishman, a murderous gangster, his driver and
an innocent family stung hard by sudden disaster. All of them are
haunted by events they can't see coming that utterly change their
lives. Last year the reviewer Elizabeth Schmidt called this a
``complex, virtuosic'' book highlighted by ``cinematic, poetic,
terrifyingly precise'' passages.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCING NAKED IN THE MIND FIELD &LR;  By Kary Mullis. Vintage, $13.
The eccentric winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
chronicles his invention of ``DNA fingerprinting'' and his
unorthodox theories about the ozone layer, HIV, global warming and
other issues. ``This is a darkly joyous work, an autobiography of
the nervous system of an extraordinary chemist,'' Dick Teresi wrote
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; WHAT REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED: Mapping the Secrets of the
Universe, the Origins of Life, and the Future of the Human Race &LR; ,
by John Maddox (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15), the former
editor in chief of the British journal Nature reviews the major
scientific breakthroughs so far and sets forth an agenda for
mathematics, physics, climate research and other fields. ``Maddox
makes a persuasive case that science has far to go,'' Paul Raeburn
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE INTUITIONIST &LR;  By Colson Whitehead. Anchor, $11.95. In a
skewed parallel universe, two rival factions struggle for control
of the Department of Elevator Inspectors: the Empiricists and the
Intuitionists, who sense psychic vibrations rather than examine
machines. Last year the reviewer Gary Krist called this a ``starkly
original first novel'' and ``an ambitious, wide-ranging exploration
of racial struggle and the dynamics of social progress.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOHANNES BRAHMS: A Biography &LR;  By Jan Swafford. Vintage, $18.
This meticulous portrait shows Brahms (1833-97) as the first (and
perhaps last) truly bourgeois composer and the first Western
composer to feel humbled by the achievements of those before him.
``Swafford retains the genre's requisite wonder ... tempered with a
skeptical imagination,'' Edward Rothstein wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SHADOW OF KILIMANJARO: On Foot Across East Africa &LR;  By Rick
Ridgeway. Owl/Holt, $14. A celebrated adventurer chronicles his
three-week, 300-mile trek from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro
through Kenya to the Indian Ocean. ``Ridgeway is a graceful and
engaging companion, and East Africa ... teems with danger,
challenge and excitement,'' Bill Bryson wrote in 1998. In addition,
he ``deftly weaves compact and absorbing interludes'' about the
history of conservation, big-game hunting and colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SILENT THUNDER: In the Presence of Elephants &LR; , by Katy Payne
(Penguin, $13.95), describes a different kind of journey, that of a
scientist into the world of elephant communication. Her research
among the free-ranging herds of Africa awakened her to the animals'
rich lives and to the horrors of ``culling'' populations. ``Payne
offers the opportunity for a rare experience ... that will change
our view of ourselves, elephants and all living things,'' Roger
Fouts wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUNGER: A Novella and Stories &LR;  By Lan Samantha Chang. Penguin,
$12.95. This graceful collection tracks the mixed fortunes of
Chinese-American families from Iowa to Brooklyn. The result is ``a
delicately calculated balance sheet of the losses and gains of
immigrants whose lives are stretched between two radically
different cultures,'' Claire Messud wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRIAGE &LR;  By Scott Anderson. Scribner, $12. This first novel
explores the unlikely bond between an American war-zone journalist
paralyzed by guilt and his girlfriend's grandfather, who worked for
Franco during the Spanish Civil War. ``It is a story of war, the
photographers who cover it and the people they leave behind,''
Christopher Dickey wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SILENT DUCHESS &LR;  By Dacia Maraini. Feminist Press/City
University of New York, $14.95. Set in 18th-century Sicily, this
novel revolves around an aristocrat's daughter who is rendered deaf
and mute by a childhood rape. The result is ``a story of grace and
endurance,'' Kathryn Harrison wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN AMERICAN KILLING &LR;  By Mary-Ann Tirone Smith. Fawcett Crest,
$6.99. This thriller about a true-crime writer investigating the
death of a congressman with whom she was having an affair probes
the chilling neighborliness of modern evil. ``Smith paces herself
perfectly and takes the time to ferret beneath the surface of
character and incident,'' Ellen Feldman wrote in 1998.

<P>
   When Boris Yeltsin unveiled his millennium surprise on New
Year's Eve, he used the word ``power'' five times in his brief
retirement speech.
</P>
<P>
   When Lenin issued his famous call to revolution on Oct. 24,
1917, he also used the word ``power'' five times. Lenin was getting
ready to seize it. Yeltsin, who will go down in history as the man
who toppled the totalitarian system Lenin wrought, said he was
relinquishing it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet power, and the thirst for it, is the connection between two
Russian leaders who only a few years ago symbolized opposite
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   As was clear from the moment he mentioned his anointed
successor, Vladimir Putin (``I have no doubt what choice you will
make at the end of March 2000'' ), Yeltsin left office not to
protect the fragile democracy that brought about his election in
1992 but to preserve the power that his administration came to
revere above all else.
</P>
<P>
   As political theater, it was a classic Yeltsin move _
unpredictable but shrewd. Yeltsin no doubt realized that Putin's
surge in popularity, based on public support for a military
crackdown in Chechnya, might not last until June, when elections
were supposed to take place. By then, enough soldiers will have
come home in body bags to contradict the promise of a clean, easy
victory _ as they did the last time Yeltsin tried to impose Russian
might on the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hold on to power for another six months?'' Yeltsin said,
with a straight face. ``No, this is not me, this is not in my
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding on to power, against all odds, has been the one steady
feature of Yeltsin's remarkably inconsistent tenure as president.
And that too is not all that surprising. Power has been the driving
force of Russian politics since the time of the czars, through the
Soviet Union and beyond. For all the mistakes and misjudgments that
Yeltsin conceded and regretted, he never lost sight of what matters
in Russia. Russians have been so broken for so long that they have
learned to respond only to an iron fist, and Yeltsin played to that
instinct again and again, taking on the role of the autocrat as
nimbly as he had turned himself into a democrat when the Soviet
Empire began to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the West has mainly seen Yeltsin
through the prism of news clips, embarrassing shots of him toppling
over at official ceremonies, frugging at a rock concert or
recovering from heart surgery in a government dacha. Russians have
also seen him act out rituals that date to the czars, shaking his
finger at quaking local bureaucrats, ordering them to raise wages
that Moscow had already cut back.
</P>
<P>
   He came to public notice in the late 1980s as a populist who
rode public buses and hectored party officials, but he seamlessly
recast himself as an age-old Kremlin ruler, surrounded by
sycophants and bodyguards, allowing corruption to flourish at the
highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   During the coup of 1991, when Yeltsin stood on a tank to defy
the old Soviet guard into history, he created one of the most
electrifying moments in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took over, he ruled by contradiction. He fired
scores of advisers, rehired many and fired them again _ and again.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister who is viewed by
the West as the last guarantor of free-market rules, was kicked in
and out of power. So was Boris Berezovsky, the crafty tycoon who
symbolizes the entrenched business interests that want to impose
their own rule on the Russian market. Yeltsin deserves credit for
seeking to introduce real economic freedom in a country that never
experienced it, but he will also be remembered as the ruler who
oversaw the birth of Russia's plutocracy.
</P>
<P>
   He will get credit for leaving the Kremlin voluntarily,
something no one in Russian history had ever done, except Mikhail
Gorbachev _ at a time when Yeltsin had the upper hand and had left
him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not like a broken Lyndon Johnson refusing to run
for a second term. Yeltsin wants to be succeeded by someone whose
loyalty will last and will not hound him in retirement with
criminal charges, financial restraints or just lese majeste. Putin
remains unproven as a leader. For now, he mainly represents
Yeltsin's desire to keep his grip on Russia's future _ and preserve
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Lenin put it in 1917, ``the seizure of power is the
business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear
after the seizure.''

learned to respond only to an iron fist, and Yeltsin played to that
instinct again and again, taking on the role of the autocrat as
nimbly as he had turned himself into a democrat when the Soviet
Empire began to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the West has mainly seen Yeltsin
through the prism of news clips, embarrassing shots of him toppling
over at official ceremonies, frugging at a rock concert or
recovering from heart surgery in a government dacha. Russians have
also seen him act out rituals that date to the czars, shaking his
finger at quaking local bureaucrats, ordering them to raise wages
that Moscow had already cut back.
</P>
<P>
   He came to public notice in the late 1980s as a populist who
rode public buses and hectored party officials, but he seamlessly
recast himself as an age-old Kremlin ruler, surrounded by
sycophants and bodyguards, allowing corruption to flourish at the
highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   During the coup of 1991, when Yeltsin stood on a tank to defy
the old Soviet guard into history, he created one of the most
electrifying moments in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took over, he ruled by contradiction. He fired
scores of advisers, rehired many and fired them again _ and again.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister who is viewed by
the West as the last guarantor of free-market rules, was kicked in
and out of power. So was Boris Berezovsky, the crafty tycoon who
symbolizes the entrenched business interests that want to impose
their own rule on the Russian market. Yeltsin deserves credit for
seeking to introduce real economic freedom in a country that never
experienced it, but he will also be remembered as the ruler who
oversaw the birth of Russia's plutocracy.
</P>
<P>
   He will get credit for leaving the Kremlin voluntarily,
something no one in Russian history had ever done, except Mikhail
Gorbachev _ at a time when Yeltsin had the upper hand and had left
him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not like a broken Lyndon Johnson refusing to run
for a second term. Yeltsin wants to be succeeded by someone whose
loyalty will last and will not hound him in retirement with
criminal charges, financial restraints or just lese majeste. Putin
remains unproven as a leader. For now, he mainly represents
Yeltsin's desire to keep his grip on Russia's future _ and preserve
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Lenin put it in 1917, ``the seizure of power is the
business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear
after the seizure.''

RECONSIDERING CANNIBALISM: IF YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT ... 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(For release Sunday, Jan. 2)

<P>
   Do you eat human flesh?
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not a very polite question. But perhaps the horror it
arouses reflects a guilty desire, some dark instinct buried in the
atavistic limbo of the mind, to crush one's enemy, savor his flesh
and absorb his qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Cannibalism has been in the news as rival experts try to get
this bizarre but revealing topic into focus. The issue is whether
cannibalism was once a routine part of human social behavior or is
merely a myth designed to justify advanced nations' domination over
primitive and allegedly anthropophagous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the survivors of desperate expeditions will sometimes
resort to eating their companions if no other food is available.
The companions, one hopes, died of natural causes, though this
cannot always be assumed. ``Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold, And
the mate of the Nancy brig, And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,
And the crew of the captain's gig,'' the sole survivor laments of
his consumed shipmates in W.S. Gilbert's ``Yarn of the Nancy
Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   This consumption in extremis is known as survival cannibalism, a
practice that is not in doubt. The debate concerns the practice of
ritual cannibalism, like the headhunting of enemies, the Aztecs'
sacrifice of war captives or the eating of dead relatives as part
of beliefs about recycling and regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Human myth and folklore are shot through with man-eating ogres
and cyclopes. The central sacrament of Christianity is the symbolic
eating of transubstantiated flesh and blood. It is hard not to
suspect a lot of anthropophagy in the closet of the human past. But
the modern reporting of cannibalism has been beset by a bout of
extreme revisionism.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1979 book, ``The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and
Anthropophagy,'' Dr. William Arens of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook dismissed as circumstantial and unconvincing
all reports of ritual cannibalism. Arens even challenged the widely
accepted finding that kuru, a human form of mad cow disease seen
among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea, was spread by the eating
of human brains.
</P>
<P>
   Arens' position has influenced anthropologists who believe
primitive peoples were often maligned by missionaries and others
intent upon their moral improvement. ``There is no reliable
evidence to support the claim that Australian Aboriginal societies
engaged in institutionalized cannibalism,'' writes Michael
Pickering, of the Museum of Victoria in Australia, in ``The
Anthropology of Cannibalism'' (Bergin &AMP; Garvey, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   This tide of skepticism doubtless washed away many fanciful
accounts but has been dismaying for archaeologists who found their
evidence for cannibal feasts summarily dismissed. Cracked and
burned human bones have been turned up for decades in Anasazi ruins
in the American Southwest. Despite suggestions first made a century
ago that these might represent cannibalism or ritual sacrifice, the
remains were delicately referred to as ``mass burials.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading advocate of Anasazi cannibalism is Dr. Christy
Turner of Arizona State University. He met only disbelief when he
proposed in 1970 that the cut, burned and defleshed bones of 30
American Indians in Polacca Wash in Arizona were the remains of an
ancient cannibal repast. ``In the 1960s, the new paradigm about
Indians was that they were all peaceful and happy. So, to find
something like this was the antithesis of the new way we were
supposed to be thinking about Indians,'' Turner told Science
magazine in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Critics attributed the cuts on the grisly remains like these to
animal scavengers, funerary practices, the roof falling in _
anything but anthropophagy. After 30 years of work and the study of
15,000 skeletons, Turner is now convinced that cannibalism was
practiced by the Anasazi as a method of social control. The
cannibals' base of operations seems to have been the great house in
Chaco Canyon, N.M., from which they terrorized people within a
100-mile radius between 900 and 1700 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's findings have been supported by a paleoanthropologist,
Dr. Tim White of the University of California at Berkeley, who from
human bones at an Anasazi site dated to 1150 A.D. noted the macabre
phenomenon of ``pot polish.'' The tips of the bones had shiny
patches, as if rubbed smooth against the walls of a cooking pot.
White showed that deer bones cooked in an Anasazi pot acquired the
same polish marks.
</P>
<P>
   Cannibalism is sometimes said to be a phenomenon of the
agricultural revolution of 10,000 years ago, after which human
populations first became quite numerous. But a clear case of
cannibalism was reported last October among Neanderthals who lived
100,000 years ago by the Rhone river in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   From a cave, French archaeologists recovered 78 pieces of bone
that seemed to belong to about six people. Cuts on the skulls show
the chewing muscles were stripped off and, in one case, the tongue
cut out. The leg bones were broken to remove the marrow. As no
other human species inhabited Europe at the time, this is the
strongest evidence that the Neanderthals, close human relatives who
became extinct 30,000 years ago, practiced cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, this horrid propensity for human flesh lies not so
deep beneath the surface. After World War II, a Japanese nurse was
found guilty of having participated in eating the liver of a U.S.
airman executed at Kyushu University, writes historian John Dower
in his new book ``Embracing Defeat.'' Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa I
of the Central African Republic possessed an oversized refrigerator
and oven, which his accusers said were used for the culinary
preparation of his countrymen. And Americans have Jeffrey Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Western Europe, that cradle of civilization, consider
the strange use of food names for former adversaries. The French,
for example, call the English les bifteks (beefsteaks), while the
English sometimes refer to the French as frogs (for frog legs) and
the Germans as krauts (cabbage). These jocular epithets are
doubtless anthropophagous echoes of a forbidden taste from our
Paleolithic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Do you eat human flesh? Of course not. But not so long ago, your
ancestors did.

   A cottage industry of plain-language consultants has sprung up
in recent years. They aim to wage war on the business buzzwords,
governmental verbosity and turgid legalese that make many public
documents impossible to understand.
</P>
<P>
   These experts also seek to instill some of the basics of good

to make a document easier to read.
</P>
<P>
   Before: Marketing is a creative, analytic and integrative
effort. We need to work hand-in-hand with the field to get their
perspective and to draw on their experiences. And there are plenty
of ideas around the rest of the company, too. Marketing will draw
on your cumulative ideas and experiences and integrate them with
other business parts into a synergistic whole, which is bigger than
the sum of its parts.

   _ At times more words, not fewer, are needed to decode
particularly turgid passages. Here's one example cited by Lutz,
with a suggested revision.
</P>
<P>
   Before: When business processes are automated, employees are
careful not to fall into the trap of applying new technology to
old, inefficient work procedures. Instead, a needs assessment is
completed to identify system requirements, and then automated
systems are designed to accomplish these goals.
</P>
<P>
   After: Computers don't improve the way you do business, if you
simply do business the same old way using the computers. So, before
we installed a new computer system in the Purchasing Department, we
asked ourselves if there were a better way to do what this
department does. After talking to the people in Purchasing and to
our suppliers, we came up with a completely new way to run this
department. Then we asked the computer people to design the
computer systems we needed to make our new approach work.
</P>
<P>
   _ And then there are the hopeless causes that force even the
most fervent plain-language disciples to throw up their hands.
Consider this financial document, provided by Lutz, which comes in
at a breathtaking 374 words. He said he still hasn't come up with a
revision:
</P>
<P>

<P>
   _ At times more words, not fewer, are needed to decode
particularly turgid passages. Here's one example cited by Lutz,
with a suggested revision.
</P>
<P>
   Before: When business processes are automated, employees are
careful not to fall into the trap of applying new technology to
old, inefficient work procedures. Instead, a needs assessment is
completed to identify system requirements, and then automated
systems are designed to accomplish these goals.
</P>
<P>
   After: Computers don't improve the way you do business, if you
simply do business the same old way using the computers. So, before
we installed a new computer system in the Purchasing Department, we
asked ourselves if there were a better way to do what this
department does. After talking to the people in Purchasing and to
our suppliers, we came up with a completely new way to run this
department. Then we asked the computer people to design the
computer systems we needed to make our new approach work.
</P>
<P>
   _ And then there are the hopeless causes that force even the
most fervent plain-language disciples to throw up their hands.
Consider this financial document, provided by Lutz, which comes in
at a breathtaking 374 words. He said he still hasn't come up with a
revision:

BOOT CAMPS: AN IDEA WHOSE TIME CAME AND WENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Five years ago, responding to an increase in serious juvenile
crime, the state of Maryland initiated one of the nation's largest
boot camp programs for teen-age criminals. The program, called the
Leadership Challenge, quickly became the model for other states.
But last week, after reviewing a task force report that documented
instances of physical abuse at their camps, Maryland officials
appeared on the verge of conceding that the current initiative was
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland experience, together with problems in other states,
has already led some states to close their boot camps and even to
rethink how their penal laws treat young offenders. All in all, it
is a remarkable turn of events for an idea that was once greeted as
a breakthrough in the fight against juvenile crime
</P>
<P>
   There is increasing evidence that boot-camps never worked. A
national study last year by the Koch Crime Institute, a public
policy group in Topeka, Kan., showed that recidivism among boot
camp attendees ranged from 64 percent to 75 percent, slightly
higher than for youths sentenced to adult prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Wells, a senior research associate at the Koch Institute,
said of the report, ``The shocking parts are the allegations of
abuse, but the more alarming parts are the failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Research has also shown, according to Wells and other penal
justice experts, that these camps were grounded in a false and
unexamined assumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought boot camps shaped up a lot of servicemen during
three wars,'' Wells added. ``But just because you place someone in
a highly structured environment with discipline, does not mean once
they get home, and are out of that, they will be model citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Boot camps have their roots in the 1970s, with the advent of
large, well-organized and extremely violent street gangs. In
response to these groups, many states began to imprison more young
people.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, as the number of repeat juvenile offenders rose to
record levels, it became clear that prison sentences were not
working. In 1994, nearly 10,000 juveniles were charged with
criminal offenses, an all-time high. More than 2,300 of them were
charged with murder, compared with fewer than 1,000 in 1980,
according to the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention. On any given day, about 105,000
children were in custody on criminal charges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend began exploring the potential of boot camps.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being elected with Gov. Parris Glendening in 1994,
Ms. Townsend, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the
Clinton administration, said she considered boot camps ``a
cost-effective, intermediate punishment'' and included them among
her priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Townsend has said the idea came from visiting a juvenile
boot camp in Ohio. By then, a handful of states, including Georgia,
Louisiana, West Virginia and Ohio, had begun well-publicized,
promising experiments with juvenile camps.
</P>
<P>
   The camps, modeled after similar programs that popped up in
England in the 1970s, were designed for juveniles who had committed
moderately serious crimes, such as auto theft, with the goal of
interceding before they moved to more serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, more than 27,000 teen-agers were passing through 54
camps in 23 states annually.
</P>
<P>
   The people who ran the real boot camps, were quite skeptical.
``The key reason we are successful is that we have a clientele down
here that chose to be here on their own,'' said Sgt. Maj. Ford
Kinsley, who oversees drill instructors at U.S. Marine Corps'
recruitment base in Parris Island, S.C. ``They are not here because
a judge said you should go here. Our population comes with a lot
more positive attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when ``a kid graduates from Parris Island, he is
just beginning a four- or five-year enlistment in the Marine Corps.
It is not like they spend 11 months here and we just throw them out
onto the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the Marines traditionally chooses the best of its
noncommissioned officers as boot camp instructors. By contrast,
state standards vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors began to surface of beatings at Maryland's boot camps
last August, and Ms. Townsend ordered an end to all inappropriate
physical contact. But news reports in December suggesting such
violations had continued led Ms. Townsend and Glendening to launch
an investigatory task force chaired by former Baltimore Police
Commissioner Bishop Robinson, who also spent 10 years in charge of
the state's prison system.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, the task force released a report that accused guards
of routine and brutal beatings of inmates, and Glendening and Ms.
Townsend suspended the state's camps and dismissed the top five
juvenile justice officials.

   Similar accusations have led state and local officials in
Colorado, North Dakota, and Arizona to drop their programs, while
Florida and California are scaling back theirs. In Georgia,
officials revamped their program after a Justice Department
investigation concluded that the state's ``paramilitary boot camp
model is not only ineffective, but harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts regard the entire boot camp experiment as a cynical
political maneuver. ``Boot camps were just another knee-jerk
reaction, a way to get tough with juveniles that resonated with the
public and became a political answer,'' said Dr. David Altschuler,
a juvenile justice expert at the Institute for Policy Studies at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some believe the programs, in some form, can be useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tough kids, with tough problems, they need good
education and drug treatment and they also need to learn respect,
self-respect, discipline and a new way of conducting themselves in
society,'' Ms. Townsend said. ``Facilities that provide structure
and discipline can be run effectively and have a role in our fight
after juvenile crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts disagree, citing the expense of running such
programs properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a budget issue,'' said Doris Mackenzie, a University of
Maryland criminology professor. ``They are popular in the public,
people feel we should treat these kids tough, and everyone can get
onto the bandwagon,'' she said. ``But when it comes to this extra
expense of doing the follow-up, we find, the money is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, juvenile crime has been falling since 1994, after
an overall drop in the nation's juvenile population. This will make
it highly unlikely, say political observers, that voters will agree
to pay for individualized rehabilitation. Much more likely, they
say, is that the 27,000 young people who once went to boot camp
each year will instead be sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as boot camps have proven to be, Wells added, ``once you
start incarcerating kids, you have lost. But unfortunately, that is
where we seem headed.''

EUROPE STARES AT A FUTURE BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(For release Sunday, Jan. 2) 
(bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Europeans, it often seems, spent the last
decade building resentments of American fast food, pop culture,
corporate callousness and an unchallenged military machine _ when
they weren't importing or trying to emulate them. They ended the
century thinking they had staked out the parameters of
Americanization and could now concentrate on erecting barricades
around their traditional larders, languages and societies. But some
demographers have a big surprise in store.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new millennium is a few decades old, these
demographers say, Europe will be face to face with an
American-style phenomenon more profoundly unsettling to many of
them than any superficial cultural symbol or business intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, these experts say, is this: To survive
economically and socially, Europe may have to lower its bars to
immigration and change its racial and ethnic face through mass
migration of labor from around the world. In other words, it may
find itself debating moves toward a social structure that looks
more like America.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that however much they share in
democratic values, Europeans and Americans still differ on one
fundamental: In America, the whole idea of citizenship is that
anyone from anywhere can become naturalized. In Europe, on the
other hand, the idea of citizenship in most places is still linked
to ethnic heritage, or at least to language and culture. True,
Americans have restricted immigration and Europeans have invited
foreign workers to take jobs in their economies. But large-scale
immigration and naturalization is still an American ideal, while
Europeans cling to a linguistic and racial basis for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming decades, U.N. experts say, demographics indicate
that many European countries (and Japan) will have more older
people and fewer babies than ever before. This seems to foretell
severely shrunken labor forces and swollen ranks of pensioners. If
Europeans want to keep their economies and social services running,
they will be tempted to look far afield for qualified workers of
all kinds _ not just the semi-skilled or unskilled workers who have
traditionally been invited to fill gaps in their work forces.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Chamie, the director of the U.N. population division,
says there is a logical response: what he calls replacement
migration. ``These countries in Europe will face the wall,'' he
said. ``They either bring in migrants, or they are going to decline
in size. The model that the United States has _ and Canada and
Australia _ is increasingly becoming attractive to some of the
thinkers in those countries.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. experts now preparing a report to be published this year
say that their early projections show that Italy would have to add
about 9 million immigrants by 2025 _ about 300,000 a year _ to keep
its population at 1995 levels, Germany would need to import 14
million people _ 500,000 a year _ France 2 million and the European
Union as a whole about 35 million. If the Europeans wanted to keep
their ratio of older people to active workers at the 1995 levels,
the union would need 135 million immigrants by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus labor, some of it very highly skilled, is waiting in the
third world, and the pressure for migration out of overpopulated
countries will be growing as the European societies shrink. A group
of developing countries is calling for a U.N. conference that would
have the freer movement of labor on its agenda. India, for example,
has a labor force larger than that of the European Union. A lot of
its computer geniuses are already sought by Silicon Valley. Will
Europe soon have to compete for them? And will it let them migrate?
</P>
<P>
   If migration is the answer, and the numbers are large enough,
Europe may well find itself under a challenge to make these and
other immigrants full citizens in every sense. Today, Germany
tolerates Turkish ``guest workers,'' as France allows Algerian
migrants, but in both cases these minorities have become lightning
rods for nationalist resentments.
</P>
<P>
   As always when projections are made, there are dissenting
voices. Michael Teitelbaum, program director of the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation in New York and the co-author with Jay Winter of ``A
Question of Numbers: High Migration, Low Fertility and the Politics
of National Identity'' (Hill and Wang, 1998), points out that some
European countries are already quite culturally and racially
diverse. That aside, he says, he does not believe that large-scale
migration is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything inevitable about anything when
it comes to demography, and I am a demographer,'' he said. And, he
said, European nations may not see the American example as worth
emulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what your goals are,'' he said. ``If your goals
are to maximize your gross domestic product then you probably don't
want a labor force that is slowly declining in numbers, even if
their productivity is rising fast. If your goal is not GDP but GDP

equilibrium, a kind of agreeable quality of life in your society,
then you may not care as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum is saying, in effect, that the challenge may be what
Chamie predicts, but that Europeans may decide the cost of meeting
it is too high. He points to European feelings about American-style
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many Europeans who hear Americans say how triumphant
the American economy is and how wonderful and prosperous it is and
they look at it and say, `Gee, we don't want to be like that,'''
Teitelbaum said. ```It's really two societies with the kind of
underclass that's getting worse and worse off, more and more
marginalized.'''

EUROPE STARES AT A FUTURE BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(For release Sunday, Jan. 2)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Europeans, it often seems, spent the last
decade building resentments of American fast food, pop culture,
corporate callousness and an unchallenged military machine _ when
they weren't importing or trying to emulate them. They ended the
century thinking they had staked out the parameters of
Americanization and could now concentrate on erecting barricades
around their traditional larders, languages and societies. But some
demographers have a big surprise in store.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new millennium is a few decades old, these
demographers say, Europe will be face to face with an
American-style phenomenon more profoundly unsettling to many of
them than any superficial cultural symbol or business intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, these experts say, is this: To survive
economically and socially, Europe may have to lower its bars to
immigration and change its racial and ethnic face through mass
migration of labor from around the world. In other words, it may
find itself debating moves toward a social structure that looks
more like America.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that however much they share in
democratic values, Europeans and Americans still differ on one
fundamental: In America, the whole idea of citizenship is that
anyone from anywhere can become naturalized. In Europe, on the
other hand, the idea of citizenship in most places is still linked
to ethnic heritage, or at least to language and culture. True,
Americans have restricted immigration and Europeans have invited
foreign workers to take jobs in their economies. But large-scale
immigration and naturalization is still an American ideal, while
Europeans cling to a linguistic and racial basis for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming decades, U.N. experts say, demographics indicate
that many European countries (and Japan) will have more older
people and fewer babies than ever before. This seems to foretell
severely shrunken labor forces and swollen ranks of pensioners. If
Europeans want to keep their economies and social services running,
they will be tempted to look far afield for qualified workers of
all kinds _ not just the semi-skilled or unskilled workers who have
traditionally been invited to fill gaps in their work forces.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Chamie, the director of the U.N. population division,
says there is a logical response: what he calls replacement
migration. ``These countries in Europe will face the wall,'' he
said. ``They either bring in migrants, or they are going to decline
in size. The model that the United States has _ and Canada and
Australia _ is increasingly becoming attractive to some of the
thinkers in those countries.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. experts now preparing a report to be published this year
say that their early projections show that Italy would have to add
about 9 million immigrants by 2025 _ about 300,000 a year _ to keep
its population at 1995 levels, Germany would need to import 14
million people _ 500,000 a year _ France 2 million and the European
Union as a whole about 35 million. If the Europeans wanted to keep
their ratio of older people to active workers at the 1995 levels,
the union would need 135 million immigrants by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus labor, some of it very highly skilled, is waiting in the
third world, and the pressure for migration out of overpopulated
countries will be growing as the European societies shrink. A group
of developing countries is calling for a U.N. conference that would
have the freer movement of labor on its agenda. India, for example,
has a labor force larger than that of the European Union. A lot of
its computer geniuses are already sought by Silicon Valley. Will
Europe soon have to compete for them? And will it let them migrate?
</P>
<P>
   If migration is the answer, and the numbers are large enough,
Europe may well find itself under a challenge to make these and
other immigrants full citizens in every sense. Today, Germany
tolerates Turkish ``guest workers,'' as France allows Algerian
migrants, but in both cases these minorities have become lightning
rods for nationalist resentments.
</P>
<P>
   As always when projections are made, there are dissenting
voices. Michael Teitelbaum, program director of the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation in New York and the co-author with Jay Winter of ``A
Question of Numbers: High Migration, Low Fertility and the Politics
of National Identity'' (Hill and Wang, 1998), points out that some
European countries are already quite culturally and racially
diverse. That aside, he says, he does not believe that large-scale
migration is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything inevitable about anything when
it comes to demography, and I am a demographer,'' he said. And, he
said, European nations may not see the American example as worth
emulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what your goals are,'' he said. ``If your goals
are to maximize your gross domestic product then you probably don't
want a labor force that is slowly declining in numbers, even if
their productivity is rising fast. If your goal is not GDP but GDP
per capita or the equitable distribution of GDP and a kind of
equilibrium, a kind of agreeable quality of life in your society,
then you may not care as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum is saying, in effect, that the challenge may be what
Chamie predicts, but that Europeans may decide the cost of meeting
it is too high. He points to European feelings about American-style
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many Europeans who hear Americans say how triumphant
the American economy is and how wonderful and prosperous it is and
they look at it and say, `Gee, we don't want to be like that,'''
Teitelbaum said. ```It's really two societies with the kind of
underclass that's getting worse and worse off, more and more
marginalized.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, not everybody has the same definition of
multiculturalism. ``The French think that what they call the
Anglo-Saxon model is a multicultural model of integration in which
everybody speaks their own language and doesn't necessarily learn
the common language _ and they don't really become British or
Canadian or American. They simply live in those countries and the
political system sort of stitches together compromises between
these groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The French image is quite different, but not xenophobic at
all,'' he said, recalling the numbers of Poles, Russians and others
who have settled over the century. Their model, he said, is ``that
anybody of any race, national origin or whatever can become French,
but they've got to really become French _ French defined in French
terms.'' Germany, with an ethnically based view of citizenship, has
had a different debate about immigration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Policies and programs to overcome hurdles like language barriers
are scant in much of Europe because cultural homogeneity has been
deeply valued, citizenship has often been defined ethnically or
linguistically, and the naturalization process that has made
Americans out of millions of foreigners does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while Britain may now be the most racially diverse
and integrated nation in Europe, restrictions on immigrants from
outside the European Union remain. Skinhead violence against
non-Europeans has erupted from Scandinavia into Central and Eastern
Europe. In Denmark, a right-wing nationalist leader proposed
recently that all Muslims should be rounded up and put in camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have European governments that continue to deploy the most
sophisticated forms of immigration control,'' said Arthur C.
Helton, an international lawyer who is now a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations. ``Yet European societies thirst ever
more for new blood and labor, which will come from outside of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   How to manage that? Helton said the example of the United States
is instructive. Immigration there ``has not only inspired but
enforced a set of ways to manage conflict that Europeans are going
to have to either borrow or invent,'' he said. ``There is a
profound recognition by most Americans that this a country more
about change than about status. Europeans had better get ready for
change.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, protection of minorities is often seen as enough.
``But people don't want to be beneficiaries of minority rights
arrangements,'' Helton said. ``So there is a dilemma. Immigrants
want to preserve their language and culture but do not wish to be
stigmatized as second-class citizens. That's a delicate balance
that often is missed, and it leads to intolerance, discrimination,
backlash, race riots and the lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum says that this is where political leadership comes
in, and that is as difficult to predict as anything else. With the
combination of low fertility and high immigration, he said, ``you
can have everything from prosperous peace and comity to disastrous,
disintegrative civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot,'' he said, ``depends on the actions of political
leaderships, to either exploit fears or to try to deal with them.''

ALGERIA: WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(For release Sunday, Jan. 2)

<P>
   High above the sparkling blue sweep of the Bay of Algiers, with
panoramic views over whitewashed colonial palaces and palm-treed
gardens that still make the city one of the jewels of the
Mediterranean, there is a magnificent hostelry.
</P>
<P>
   Once a palace, it became, at the height of France's 130 years of
colonial rule in Algeria, the St. George's Hotel. On an upper
floor, with a balcony scented in the springtime with mimosa
blossoms, there is a suite with a brass plaque at the door
recording the fact that General Dwight D. Eisenhower occupied the
suite for several months in 1942 and 1943, when U.S. and allied
troops were pushing German forces eastward along the north African
coast during World War II. Everyone knew, in that dark winter, the
strategic importance of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   But that moment, during the climactic war of the 20th century,
may have been the last time the American public really focused its
attention on Algeria. Today, amid fears of a new kind of warfare _
far less intense but nonetheless frightening _ Algeria is once
again thrusting itself onto America's consciousness, now that
figures linked to its Islamic underground have been arrested while
seemingly intent on bringing their terrorist war into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, an utterly different Algeria. Today, the St.
George's is the El-Djazair Hotel, state-owned like much else in
independent Algeria, its lobby re-done in the over-marbled,
socialist-modern style familiar from visits to communist Eastern
Europe. The armchairs by the front door are occupied 24 hours a day
by the slim-hipped, chain-smoking watchdogs of the Algerian
security police, without whose guardianship no trip outside the
hotel by foreigners is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Americans hardly ever come. They have been warned off by nearly
40 years of military-dominated government since independence, by
socialist economic policies that have all but wrecked the economy,
and above all by an eight-year civil war. The conflict has been one
of the most savage anywhere since Algeria's previous conflict, the
one from 1954 to 1962 in which the French colonial army fought
fruitlessly to stave off independence. About a million people died
in that earlier fighting, and so far about 100,000 have died in the
current carnage. Many of the new victims have died at the hands of
a shadowy guerrilla movement known, by its French initials, as the
GIA _ the Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
   If a visitor wants to know something about the GIA, or about the
wider conflict in which it has been fighting for an extreme form of
Islamic rule, there are few better places to venture than up the
hill from the El-Djazair, to one of the grandest U.S. embassies
anywhere, set in breathtakingly lovely grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Here, amid graceful inner courtyards and arches, U.S. diplomats
have a command of the political and economic miseries beyond the
embassy's high walls. The view is all the more impressive for the
fact that the Algerian security police, and the State Department's
own rules, make venturing out of the compound about as easy as
heading out from a cavalry fort in Indian country. The current
ambassador, Cameron Hume, a man of formidable charm and intellect,
has defied the security rules to travel about more than most
ambassadors, but even he would not exactly claim to be a denizen of
the place.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may go some way to explain why, two weeks ago, many
Americans were puzzled to learn that an Algerian man had been
arrested while driving off a car ferry from Canada at Port Angeles,
Wash., with, U.S. customs officials allege, enough bomb-making
material in the trunk of his car to blow up almost any building.
Suddenly there were headlines across America about Ahmed Ressam and
the wider terrorist threat he has been thought to represent. But
what of the country he hails from, and why might he have wanted to
bomb a target in the United States? Above all, what is it that
Americans must now begin to understand about Algeria?
</P>
<P>
   The plain fact is that Algeria, however distant it has grown to
Americans since it made headlines for them during World War II,
remains of enormous strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it the largest country on the African continent, in
terms of area; it also has vast oil and gas reserves that have kept
American oilmen barracked at remote sites in the Sahara desert for
30 years or more. Today, they are in fact the most numerous
Americans in Algeria, even if for the most part they pass swiftly
through Algiers and the other major cities, and have little contact
with the larger society.

</P>
<P>
   As significant as its resources, Algeria fills a long stretch of
the southern Mediterranean, and thus is of compelling military and
political significance. And what happens is Algeria is of profound
significance to many of America's key allies in Western Europe.
Algiers is only an overnight ferry journey from Marseilles and even
closer to Spain, allowing Algeria's enfeebled economy to send at
least 3 million Algerians to Europe as immigrant workers in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the war, and how it may have led to Ressam
driving off that ferry in Washington state. In this, perhaps more
than anything else, Algeria matters to Americans these days.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of modern Islamic radicalism, two countries have
played pivotal roles _ Iran toward one end of the so-called
``crescent'' of Muslim nations that reaches from Morocco and
Mauritania in the west to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east, and
Algeria toward the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Iran mesmerized the world with its mullahs'
revolution, with its seizure of U.S. diplomats and their embassy in
Tehran and, later, with the religious decree that urged the killing
of the novelist Salman Rushdie. Algeria, in 1992, lit fires of
equal intensity among Islamic radicals when its secular government
called parliamentary elections, the first more-or-less free ones in
the country's history, but canceled them at the last minute when an
Islamic party, the Islamic Salvation Front, was on the verge of
victory. The army generals had thought canceling the elections was
a good idea; their reward was the rise of the G.I.A., a breakaway
from the Islamic Salvation Front. Rather than try again for a
generally moderate form of Islamic government, this group espoused
worldwide holy war, going well beyond the Salvation Front
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict that resulted brought to Algeria a ghastliness that
has been stunning, even by the standards of a country that knew
extraordinary savagery, on both the French and the Algerian sides,
during the independence war. The GIA, propagating among its
fighters the belief that the triumph of Islam justifies the killing
of anybody who does not actively support them, has gone into
villages and towns and slaughtered hundreds of civilians at a time,
often by cutting throats.
</P>
<P>
   The army has responded in kind, setting up militias called
``Patriotes'' and other shadowy units; these are believed to have
taken a leaf from France's counter-insurgency tactics in the 1950s,
when ``rogue'' units set up to look like fighters of the
independence guerrillas went about massacring villagers. Several
thousand people have disappeared after being arrested by the army
and police, and cemeteries in Algiers and elsewhere are strewn with
gravestones carrying the sinister marking ``X Algerien,'' often
meaning that the person buried there was killed in custody and
buried anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   From this background have sprung faceless battalions of the GIA
in Europe, and from among them, investigators believe, came Ressam.
So if he is another kind of ``X Algerien'' to Americans, it may be
time to strip away that anonymity, to learn more about him and his
country and their tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades ago, a U.S. general in Room 1101 at the St. George's
Hotel learned at first hand why Algeria mattered; it is a lesson
that it may be time to relearn.

<P>
   As significant as its resources, Algeria fills a long stretch of
the southern Mediterranean, and thus is of compelling military and
political significance. And what happens is Algeria is of profound
significance to many of America's key allies in Western Europe.
Algiers is only an overnight ferry journey from Marseilles and even
closer to Spain, allowing Algeria's enfeebled economy to send at
least 3 million Algerians to Europe as immigrant workers in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the war, and how it may have led to Ressam
driving off that ferry in Washington state. In this, perhaps more
than anything else, Algeria matters to Americans these days.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of modern Islamic radicalism, two countries have
played pivotal roles _ Iran toward one end of the so-called
``crescent'' of Muslim nations that reaches from Morocco and
Mauritania in the west to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east, and
Algeria toward the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Iran mesmerized the world with its mullahs'
revolution, with its seizure of U.S. diplomats and their embassy in
Tehran and, later, with the religious decree that urged the killing
of the novelist Salman Rushdie. Algeria, in 1992, lit fires of
equal intensity among Islamic radicals when its secular government
called parliamentary elections, the first more-or-less free ones in
the country's history, but canceled them at the last minute when an
Islamic party, the Islamic Salvation Front, was on the verge of
victory. The army generals had thought canceling the elections was
a good idea; their reward was the rise of the G.I.A., a breakaway
from the Islamic Salvation Front. Rather than try again for a
generally moderate form of Islamic government, this group espoused
worldwide holy war, going well beyond the Salvation Front
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict that resulted brought to Algeria a ghastliness that
has been stunning, even by the standards of a country that knew
extraordinary savagery, on both the French and the Algerian sides,
during the independence war. The GIA, propagating among its
fighters the belief that the triumph of Islam justifies the killing
of anybody who does not actively support them, has gone into
villages and towns and slaughtered hundreds of civilians at a time,
often by cutting throats.
</P>
<P>
   The army has responded in kind, setting up militias called
``Patriotes'' and other shadowy units; these are believed to have
taken a leaf from France's counter-insurgency tactics in the 1950s,
when ``rogue'' units set up to look like fighters of the
independence guerrillas went about massacring villagers. Several
thousand people have disappeared after being arrested by the army
and police, and cemeteries in Algiers and elsewhere are strewn with
gravestones carrying the sinister marking ``X Algerien,'' often
meaning that the person buried there was killed in custody and
buried anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   From this background have sprung faceless battalions of the GIA
in Europe, and from among them, investigators believe, came Ressam.
So if he is another kind of ``X Algerien'' to Americans, it may be
time to strip away that anonymity, to learn more about him and his
country and their tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades ago, a U.S. general in Room 1101 at the St. George's
Hotel learned at first hand why Algeria mattered; it is a lesson
that it may be time to relearn.

SLAUGHTER IN AFRICA: NOT AS SIMPLE AS ANCIENT HATREDS 
</HEADLINE>

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Distrust of ethnic strangers runs so deep in
Burundi that there is a special insult _ ``ikimenabanga'' _ for the
person within a group who says too much, the one who breaks the
secret. It is safer to stay quiet, to keep to one's own kind.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a great distance between that kind of simple
suspicion and the hatreds that seem to have exploded in the last
decade with relentless regularity in Burundi, Rwanda and eastern
Congo _ the Great Lakes area of Africa. Documented genocide
occurred there in 1994, when Hutu extremists in Rwanda meticulously
slaughtered at least half a million ethnic Tutsi. The fighting
continued in the form of a rebellion within Rwanda and spilled into
Congo _ then known as Zaire _ helping to shatter that country in
1997. Burundi has been rent by civil warfare that started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994 are preying there
again, in a war that has dragged in at least eight other nations.
And in Burundi, Rwanda's southern twin, the Tutsi elite who rule
the country have herded into hillside camps 350,000 people, most of
them Hutu farmers, to separate them from Hutu guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   All of this fighting makes Africa's Great Lakes region one of
the most grim and complicated places on earth, one where
well-intentioned outsiders periodically wonder whether, and how,
they might step in to halt the violence. Each time, the question
comes down to this: Are these spasms of killing the result of old
hatreds, or are they grotesque products of political manipulation?
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders ``ancient tribal hatreds'' has been the
formula easiest to accept, since it lends a patina of logic to
indifference _ to saying that there is little that outsiders could
do, even if they were willing. That is a position that underlay the
outside world's inaction during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what most experts on Africa say. The hatreds are
real, the experts say, but they are not ancient at all _ and are
not really different from ethnic conflicts anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In broad outline, the conflicts in Africa are quite like those
in the Balkans: Ancient divisions, even animosities, exist, but it
takes a political elite to seize on them and transform them into
something far more violent as politicians seek power for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is not ancient ethnic or tribal hatred,'' said
Filip Reyntjens, a professor at the Universities of Antwerp and
Leuven and a leading scholar of the Great Lakes region. ``That is a
vision many Europeans and North Americans have because it is an
easy way to explain what happens in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars generally agree on the ethnic shape of the Great Lakes
before the colonists _ first Germans, then Belgians _ arrived in
the late 19th century. There were three distinct groups of people:
the Hutu, who tended to be farmers (more than 80 percent today);
the Tutsi, who arrived on the land later as nomads and tended to
raise cattle (about 15 percent); and the Twa, or pygmies (perhaps 1
percent). There were rivalries, even animosities, but none of the
episodes of ethnic killing that have scarred the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Twa _ who were truly discriminated against _ the
lines between Hutu and Tutsi were not always firm. The monarchies
in pre-colonial Rwanda and Burundi were led by Tutsi but high court
officials were often Hutu. Intermarriage was common, even if there
were tensions between ruler and ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the European colonists, who imposed their own ideas
about race and superiority, and tended to put one group officially
in power over the others. They preferred the Tutsi, who were viewed
as taller, thinner, smarter (and thus more like the Europeans).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Batutsi were meant to reign,'' wrote one Belgian
administrator in the 1920's, according to the French author Gerard
Prunier in his authoritative book on the genocide, ``The Rwanda
Crisis''(Columbia University Press, 1995). ``Their fine presence is
in itself enough to give them a great prestige vis-a-vis the
inferior races which surround. It is not surprising that those good
Bahutu, less intelligent, more simple, more spontaneous, more
trusting, have let themselves be enslaved without ever daring to
revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   What the colonists did, said Alison Des Forges, a historian and
consultant for Human Rights Watch, ``was take this system that was
relatively fluid and turned it into something very rigid and
hierarchical.''
</P>
<P>
   B Y the time the Belgians were preparing to withdraw from Rwanda
and Burundi in the late 1950s, many experts argue, the lines
between Hutu and Tutsi were firmly drawn, and resentment among the
Hutu was strong.
</P>
<P>
   First, in Rwanda, Hutu clamoring for power killed many Tutsi in
1959; partly in response, the Tutsi elite in Burundi hardened their
control. (The Rwanda fighting also created a group of Tutsi exiles
whose children would become the guerrillas who took control in
1994.) In Burundi, a unifying figure, Prince Louis Rwagasore, arose
among the Tutsi but was assassinated in 1961.

   After independence came to both nations in 1962, the
polarization in both only increased with round after round of
ethnic slaughters. People were killed merely for belonging to one
ethnic group or the other, something that had never happened in
either country.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, that cycle came to a crisis under the presidency of
Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu whose administration demonized all
Tutsi as supporters of rebels fighting to oust him. His death in a
plane crash in April 1994, in which the Burundian president also
died, set off the 100 days of slaughter of Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   Now the problems continue with the war in Congo and the
seemingly intractable battles between the Hutu rebels and Tutsi
leadership in Burundi. There is not a great deal of hope among most
experts that the problems will be settled soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that we are now in a situation where fear has
become the most powerful spur to violence,'' Ms. Des Forges said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these experts believe there is room for the outside world
to become engaged. The ideal for beginning to rebuild trust, Ms.
Des Forges said, is that outside nations find a way to guarantee
that there will be no more ethnic slaughters in either country For
Rwanda, she added, the international community could show
evenhandedness not only by continuing to bring the Hutu killers to
justice but by not ignoring abuses committed by the Tutsi leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Burundi, Jan van Eck, a consultant with the Center for
Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, said that each party must have a
place at the negotiating table _ an approach that seems to have
been adopted by the new mediator to the conflict, Nelson Mandela,
who has some experience as a uniting force in his own country,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, van Eck pointed out, the amount of blood already spilled
may at this point become an argument for ending the violence. In
Burundi, for example, so many people have blood on their hands _
Hutu and Tutsi alike _ that their own mutually awful pasts may
offer an opening for starting anew. ``They always said: Hang all
the people who committed crimes, or shoot them,'' van Eck said.
``But now there is a realization that there might be too many.''

WHAT A GREAT PRIMARY CAMPAIGN WE JUST HAD! 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(For release Sunday, Jan. 2) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   For much of the American public, the 2000 election for the White
House starts at the beginning of January. The holidays have passed
and in a presidential election year that means that the country is
ready to attend to what the candidates are doing and saying.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, done and said. The truth is that most people are
tuning in rather late. In all likelihood, the Democratic and
Republican contests will be settled in just nine weeks, if not by
the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, more and more states have inched their primaries
back to the starting line, competing to assure their influence over
the nominee. It has been a haphazard process, following no grand
plan of either party, if countenanced by some Republican and
Democratic leaders who believe that avoiding an intramural primary
struggle is the recipe for a strong general election nominee. The
result, though, is that nearly 75 percent of the delegates will be
chosen by the middle of March, even as the primaries continue
through June 6.
</P>
<P>
   But is that progress? As the primary season begins in earnest,
there seems to be a consensus among political leaders and academics
that it is not: that this constant tinkering with the political
calendar has produced the opposite of what had been intended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a nominating process that engages voters, the
ever-shortening calendar is more apt to disenfranchise them, with
its early finish and narrow window within which to consider the
candidates. Instead of assuring big states a big voice in the final
nominee, the calendar dilutes their influence, since so many of
them have crowded their primaries onto the same two early Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of producing formidable general election
standard-bearers, the process turns out nominees who might, come
the tumult of the fall campaign, wish they had devoted more time to
what is the political equivalent of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being rushed to judgment,'' said William Galvin,
the Massachusetts secretary of state and the chairman of the
Committee on Presidential Primaries of the National Association of
Secretaries of State. ``It's become a candidate death watch,
instead of an effort at finding out who these people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: well before January, a series of presumably
credible candidates for president _ among them, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander and and former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole _ had already quit the race, largely because they
could not figure out how to surmount the political calendar. The
exhausting schedule of cross-country primaries that awaits the
field on March 7 and March 14 has put a premium on the
candidate-as-fund-raiser, in order to raise the money to finance
travel and multistate advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, that suffocates the long-shot candidate, like Paul
Tsongas in 1992 or Bruce Babbitt in 1988, who had once put
excitement into American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are, of course, supposed to drop out if they do badly
in New Hampshire and Iowa. But not to even make it to the startling
line? ``This is the first year that I can remember where a whole
lot of candidates dropped out before a single vote was cast,'' said
William G. Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeast
University and co-author of ``The Modern Politics of Presidential
Selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowans and New Hampshirites, long used to being the first judges
of candidates' credentials and ideas, may be excused for feeling a
little rushed. As big states have shouldered to the front of the
primary line, New Hampshire and Iowa have edged back to protect
their historic first-in-the-nation status. The New Hampshire
primary is now Feb. 1, or 20 days earlier than it was in 1996, a
long time in retail politics.
</P>
<P>
   Political campaigns remain engaging and meaningful to many
Americans in part because voters are so unpredictable _ especially
in New Hampshire and Iowa. That said, most analysts believe the
nominees will be known by the close-of-polls on March 7, by which
time 43 percent of the elected Republican delegates and 37 percent
of the Democratic delegates will have been selected. And if not
then, certainly by the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like 75 percent of the delegates have been selected by
the middle of March, which is faster than last time,'' said Barbara
Norrander, professor of political science at the University of
Arizona. ``And last time it was faster than the time before.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is conceivable that the race could be over on Feb. 1,
especially on the Republican side. If Sen. John McCain fails to
defeat Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire, after waging a
spirited campaign there, his own supporters have trouble seeing how
he could survive.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a number of Democrats question how long former Sen.
Bill Bradley can continue if he does not make a strong showing
against Vice President Al Gore there (presumably a victory, though
a near-victory has done the trick for candidates in the past).
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are both examples of the type of candidates
who have historically flourished in New Hampshire: slightly
insurgent and underfunded. But even if both should win there, the
calendar works against them pushing on to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Democratic primaries until March 7, but there are
16 contests on that day, from New York to California. It is worse
for McCain. Before March 7, he faces contests in South Carolina,
Arizona and Michigan. That schedule could not be more problematic
for an underfunded candidate running outside of the establishment.
Nor could it be more accommodating for Bush, who spent much of last
year raising money to prepare himself precisely for this moment.

the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, more and more states have inched their primaries
back to the starting line, competing to assure their influence over
the nominee. It has been a haphazard process, following no grand
plan of either party, if countenanced by some Republican and
Democratic leaders who believe that avoiding an intramural primary
struggle is the recipe for a strong general election nominee. The
result, though, is that nearly 75 percent of the delegates will be
chosen by the middle of March, even as the primaries continue
through June 6.
</P>
<P>
   But is that progress? As the primary season begins in earnest,
there seems to be a consensus among political leaders and academics
that it is not: that this constant tinkering with the political
calendar has produced the opposite of what had been intended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a nominating process that engages voters, the
ever-shortening calendar is more apt to disenfranchise them, with
its early finish and narrow window within which to consider the
candidates. Instead of assuring big states a big voice in the final
nominee, the calendar dilutes their influence, since so many of
them have crowded their primaries onto the same two early Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of producing formidable general election
standard-bearers, the process turns out nominees who might, come
the tumult of the fall campaign, wish they had devoted more time to
what is the political equivalent of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being rushed to judgment,'' said William Galvin,
the Massachusetts secretary of state and the chairman of the
Committee on Presidential Primaries of the National Association of
Secretaries of State. ``It's become a candidate death watch,
instead of an effort at finding out who these people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: well before January, a series of presumably
credible candidates for president _ among them, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander and and former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole _ had already quit the race, largely because they
could not figure out how to surmount the political calendar. The
exhausting schedule of cross-country primaries that awaits the
field on March 7 and March 14 has put a premium on the
candidate-as-fund-raiser, in order to raise the money to finance
travel and multistate advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, that suffocates the long-shot candidate, like Paul
Tsongas in 1992 or Bruce Babbitt in 1988, who had once put
excitement into American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are, of course, supposed to drop out if they do badly
in New Hampshire and Iowa. But not to even make it to the startling
line? ``This is the first year that I can remember where a whole
lot of candidates dropped out before a single vote was cast,'' said
William G. Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeast
University and co-author of ``The Modern Politics of Presidential
Selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowans and New Hampshirites, long used to being the first judges
of candidates' credentials and ideas, may be excused for feeling a
little rushed. As big states have shouldered to the front of the
primary line, New Hampshire and Iowa have edged back to protect
their historic first-in-the-nation status. The New Hampshire
primary is now Feb. 1, or 20 days earlier than it was in 1996, a
long time in retail politics.
</P>
<P>
   Political campaigns remain engaging and meaningful to many
Americans in part because voters are so unpredictable _ especially
in New Hampshire and Iowa. That said, most analysts believe the
nominees will be known by the close-of-polls on March 7, by which
time 43 percent of the elected Republican delegates and 37 percent
of the Democratic delegates will have been selected. And if not
then, certainly by the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like 75 percent of the delegates have been selected by
the middle of March, which is faster than last time,'' said Barbara
Norrander, professor of political science at the University of
Arizona. ``And last time it was faster than the time before.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is conceivable that the race could be over on Feb. 1,
especially on the Republican side. If Sen. John McCain fails to
defeat Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire, after waging a
spirited campaign there, his own supporters have trouble seeing how
he could survive.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a number of Democrats question how long former Sen.
Bill Bradley can continue if he does not make a strong showing
against Vice President Al Gore there (presumably a victory, though
a near-victory has done the trick for candidates in the past).
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are both examples of the type of candidates
who have historically flourished in New Hampshire: slightly
insurgent and underfunded. But even if both should win there, the
calendar works against them pushing on to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Democratic primaries until March 7, but there are
16 contests on that day, from New York to California. It is worse
for McCain. Before March 7, he faces contests in South Carolina,
Arizona and Michigan. That schedule could not be more problematic
for an underfunded candidate running outside of the establishment.
Nor could it be more accommodating for Bush, who spent much of last
year raising money to prepare himself precisely for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain and Bradley have had enormous breaks in this race _ and
it's still uphill for them,'' said Charles E. Cook Jr., the editor
of a Washington-based political report. ``They still have to thread
a needle.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the present primary system reduce the chance of an
outsider winning a nomination, it will likely force them out of the
race sooner, thus reducing the chance that they will help shape the
positions of their party or their nominee. This, in turn, may leave
their supporters feeling shut out of and disinterested in
participating in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional view among party professionals is that the
system produces a good result for the party: an early nominee.
`It's a bad thing to keep going: you'd rather get it out of the
way,'' said James Carville, the consultant to President Clinton.
``Find one fighter that likes to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   As the primary season grows shorter each cycle, that
once-dominant view holds less and less sway. ``It's bad for the
candidate because you don't get the same feel for the country,''
said Paul Begala, who worked with Carville in running Clinton's
1992 campaign. ``I traveled with Bill Clinton to 48 states, by my
count. You learn a lot. You see a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Less time campaigning also means less examination of a
candidates' record, experience and past. And there are tactical
complications posed by becoming the candidate too early.
</P>
<P>
   How does a candidate fill the long months between winning the
nomination and the summer convention? How do they compete with the
Reform Party's likely candidates, notably Donald Trump, who may
have the stage largely to himself in the spring? How do the
campaigns hold on to the voters' attention, or do they at all?
Witness what happened with Bob Dole in 1996, as he struggled to
distance himself from congressional Republicans pushing policies
that played against his own campaign interests.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with few exceptions, no one is happy with the way the
system has evolved, and both the national Republican and Democratic
committees have set up commissions to examine how or if to change
it. ``If the front-loading does result in people believing they do
not play the role they would otherwise, we have to do something
about it,'' said Joe Andrew, the national Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bond, the former national Republican chairman, offered a
more fundamental concern about the process. ``I'm a gray-hair now,
and the gray-hairs of the Republican Party think it's better to
have a primary than not,'' Bond said. ``Because your guy gets
tested. A feverish contest that would resolve early enough is the
prescription for success.''

<P>
   ``We choose freedom because it gives us the power to live,
learn, and love,'' wrote students from Tanapag Elementary School in
the Northern Mariana Islands. Their essay, along with Ray Charles'
sunglasses, photos of Earth from space, a Twinkie, Corningware, a
computer chip, the Bill of Rights, a World War II helmet, a cell
phone and a piece of the Berlin Wall will be among the items sealed
this summer in the National Millennium Time Capsule until 2100.
</P>
<P>
   The time capsule prototype was unveiled Friday by President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of American History. The prototype stands 4 feet high, 6
feet long, 2 feet deep, carved out of wood in an American flag
motif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We developed 25 different designs, all shapes,'' said Jim
Biber, an architect from Pentagram who collaborated with Robert
Brunner, an industrial engineer, to design the piece. ``But the
flag was chosen because it is an obvious symbol of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The official chest will be fabricated in three metals. The white
strips will be formed in stainless steel, embodying America's
industrial past; the red strips will be formed in silicon bronze,
symbolizing communication, and blue stars will be crafted out of
titanium, a metal with space-age properties, representing America's
future.
</P>
<P>
   The items were solicited by the White House Millennium Council
from almost 400 congressional and presidential medalists and 56
recipients of the National Teacher of the Year award. James Watson,
director and president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, submitted
a CD-ROM of the human genome project and said in his accompanying
written explanation that ``it will be biology's most important gift
ever to human society, being the instruction book for human
development and functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Louis Gates, director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute
for Afro-American Research and W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of the
Humanities at Harvard, sent in another CD-ROM, titled Encarta
Africana. ``At the beginning of the twentieth century,'' he
explained, ``W.E.B. Du Bois announced that the most effective way
to fight anti-black racism would be the publication of a
comprehensive encyclopedia of the black world. . . . Ninety years
later, some 400 scholars finally banded together to produce this
encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   The 85-letter Cherokee alphabet was submitted by Wilma
Mankiller, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, a winner of the
Medal of Freedom. She called it ``the language that has survived on
this land since time immemorial. It is hope for the future that the
Cherokee language will still be spoken 100 or even 500 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwright August Wilson suggested a recording by Bessie Smith
of ``Nobody in Town Can Bake a Sweet Jellyroll Like Mine'' because
the first time he heard the song, ``the universe stuttered and
everything fell to a new place. . . . It was a birth, a baptism, a
resurrection, and a redemption all rolled up into one. . . . The
ideas of self-determination, self-respect, and self-defense . . .
are still very much a part of my life as I sit down and write''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bell, executive director of Young Audiences, chose ``a
simple drawing or song created by a child. I believe this would
convey our commitment to future generations while at the same time
honoring the cultural legacy that sustains all Americans today.''
</P>
<P>
   The artistic director of the Steppenwolf Theatre Co. and Medal
of Arts winner Martha Lavey submitted ``Grapes of Wrath,'' saying:
``This novel captures a profound and constitutive experience in the
composition of the American psyche and culture. This is a nation
defined by the courage and fortitude of a citizenship seeking a
better, fairer, and more generous life.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Gregory Peck, among others, suggested ``a reel of a film
showing Neil Armstrong's landing on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House Millennium Council plans to use all the objects
submitted. The submissions, or replicas of large items, will
ultimately be placed in smaller stainless steel capsules that can
fit in compartments, and essays will be placed in the lower
drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald R. Ford wrote: ``Amidst all that is new,
however, may we never discard those ancient values _ courage and
compassion, integrity and reverence for things seen and unseen _
that have made America a historic refuge for the world's oppressed.
Our fondest hope for the new millennium is that we realize the
promise, older than the republic itself, of a land without limits,
as generous as it is inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 students taught by recipients of the national
teacher of the year award submitted individual and collective
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Preacher's fourth grade class in Oklahoma made an eagle out
of construction and origami paper, saying the eagle ``represents
our country and has many of the same traits of the U.S. It is
smart, brave, mighty and stands for freedom. . . . In America we
have rights that people do not have in other countries, and we
should be thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   The council has not received all contributions, and will
continue to accept submissions until the official capsule is
completed. Until then, the prototype will remain on display at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. The
actual time capsule is expected to be completed by early summer.
That capsule will be on display in the rotunda at the National
Archives until the end of the year, then be relocated to a more
secure, climate-controlled area for future generations, to open in
100 years.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: U.S. needs to reclaim its borders
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Jan. 5, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ No sooner had the calendar flipped to a new year,
century and millennium than the same old dilemma was upon us again.
</P>
<P>
   A shabby wooden vessel carrying 411 Haitians, Dominicans and
Chinese ran aground just off the Miami area. None of the passengers
had gone through the formal process of immigration to the United
States, and authorities suspect professional smugglers had a hand
in their voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard followed its instructions and shipped them back
from whence they came. This act brought out the ethnic protesters
on the first day of the new millennium. They paraded around Coast
Guard headquarters and at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service building, their placards calling on the U.S. to let in all
411, or give immigrant Haitians the same justice as the U.S. gives
to Cubans fleeing their island.
</P>
<P>
   Any Cuban who makes it to shore gets to stay, but the permission
is not extended to Haitians or others. The deal the U.S. has with
Cuba is for the legal migration of 20,000 Cubans to the U.S.
annually. If 150 come in illegally on rafts, they don't count
against the number.
</P>
<P>
   With Miami so heavily populated with Cuban and Haitian refugees,
it is difficult to enforce U.S. immigration laws. A case in point
is the little boy who came floating in on Thanksgiving Day after
his mother died at sea. He's still here, being exploited by his
guardians and TV cameras, while his father _ in Cuba _ calls for
his return. Whether or not the father is a communist should not be
the basis for legal judgment. His father is the child's living
parent.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the illegal refugee situation is one fought in the
streets and on the airwaves. ``Let 'em all in,'' would be the cry
of those who entered before them, many illegally.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner or later, the U.S. has to put a cap on who gets here.
The first thing that ought be done is to differentiate between the
words ``legal'' and ``illegal.'' Illegal means they skipped the
process, violated U.S. immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Should they be afforded the same welcome as those who went
through the process, likely waiting years for the paperwork to
clear?
</P>
<P>
   When the Lyndon Johnson administration first made it possible
for Cubans to flee Fidel Castro for Miami, it was because the
refugees truly were political refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But now, things are different. Cubans, Haitians, Mexicans and
others from Latin America don't necessarily come here because they
fear for their lives based on politics _ i.e., political asylum _
but because they want to earn money, buy food, have a roof over
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that these are people in need, but does that
also mean that everyone who feels like coming to the U.S. can set
out tomorrow? These are not political refugees; they are economic
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   INS is caught in a vise. So is the Coast Guard. They both are
subject to erratic policy decisions and alterations by whomever is
occupying the White House. Remember Jimmy Carter's Mariel boatlift
policy, which he kept changing every six hours as more than 100,000
Cubans shuttled across the Straits of Florida in just a couple of
weeks?
</P>
<P>
   I believe that Americans truly want to reach out and help the
unfortunate others. But it's got to be done in an orderly (legal)
fashion. Those who have reached this country from elsewhere, either
legally or illegally, have got to understand that the situation is
out of control, and that their protests against U.S. agencies for
enforcing existing laws are obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Often, when dealing with our immigrant history, reference is
made to those 19th and early 20th century days when immigrants from
Italy, Ireland, Germany, Poland, etc., sailed for Ellis Island in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between that traffic and what we now are enduring
is that the earlier refugees came in legally. To me, that's a
distinction with a huge difference.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: One last volley in Kosovo conflict
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps no great harm will have been done if U.N. prosecutors
quickly dispose of the tendentious charges that NATO committed war
crimes in Serbia and Kosovo and go back to the tribunal's serious
business.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, investigators then could say they'd shown
even-handedness by reviewing the representations, making the
investigation and sustained charges against virtually self-evident
war criminals all the more credible.
</P>
<P>
   But if this farce is allowed to drag on _ or, worse, if charges
actually are extruded from the thin goods agenda-driven complainers
have brought to the tribunal _ then the U.N. will have effectively
given future license to the crudest human-rights abusers. For who
will oppose them if errors in the opposition are accounted crime?
</P>
<P>
   The details are few and the waters murky around this part of the
investigations by the war-crimes tribunal, but apparently the
claims against NATO have been pressed by a group of Russian
legislators, a Canadian law professor and one or more human-rights
advocacy organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Cited are the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, air
attacks on s and roads that killed civilians, and civilian
casualties incidental to the bombing of military sites and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The hit on the embassy was clearly the result of miscalculation,
not calculation, freely admitted by Washington and compensated for
in a negotiated, bilateral agreement. It is simply impossible to
know whether civilians are interlaced with military convoys or to
time an attack on a bridge so that missiles will arrive only when a
military train is crossing.
</P>
<P>
   And would war-crime investigators care to validate the ploy of
putting strategic facilities in civilian areas as a way to immunize
them from attack? If so, then the United Nations would be in the
very odd business of encouraging even more eventual civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Look, wars are distinctly nasty affairs. There can be righteous
ones but there are no pretty ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO went to elaborate lengths to minimize collateral damage _
in lives and property _ as it forced Serbia to end its mass murders
of Muslim Kosovars and its expulsions of the survivors from their
homes. But not even the newest, neatest gee-whiz weapons can seine
combatants from noncombatants or culpable policymakers from mere
bureaucrats where they are muddled together.
</P>
<P>
   Further, there is simply no moral equivalency _ none, zero,
zilch _ between atrocities committed with calculated malice in the
service of deliberated policy and inadvertent casualties that occur
in resisting atrocity. Even self-defense doesn't allow for
retributive warfare, but surely neither victims nor their defenders
are obliged to defer to abuse lest their resistance go awry.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, is
downplaying her NATO investigation, suggesting it is marginal. But
now that it has surfaced, in the name not just of justice but of
simple sanity, it needs to be definitively retired.

 &HT;    Resolving to find a husband
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My friend Alice called early this morning to
fill me in on her New Year's resolution. It's pretty
straightforward. ``I'm going to be married before the end of the
year,'' is exactly what she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still dark out,'' I mumble rolling over to see if I can
detect a glimmer of anything on the horizon. Still a bit groggy, it
takes me a minute to catch on to the giant star I see rising in the
east and remember it's the one on top of the grain elevator a block
away, lighted for the holidays. ``Who's the guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Alice admits she hasn't met him yet but she knows he will be
tall, handsome, and a professional man more concerned with
character than beauty. I tell her I have just the guy for her. She
isn't really interested, which is probably a good thing since all I
have to go on is a ``Brides Wanted'' classified page ripped from a
1998 edition of The Hindu, an English language newspaper from
Chennai, India, that I found stuffed in a toiletries kit I'd
ordered from an in-flight shopping magazine.
</P>
<P>
   I fish the rumpled paper out of my night table drawer and read
it to her anyway: ``Settled, handsome, well-employed professional,
seeking homely girl above 160 cms, preferably software
professional. Send horoscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice remarks, almost indifferently, that she has never thought
of herself as homely, only plain. I suggest that possibly we're
misinterpreting the intent of the word and that maybe in India it
means a girl who'll be willing to hang around the house and stir
the curry. ``So why the `software professional' stipulation?'' she
asks. I confess ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how tall is 160 cms anyway?'' We play with that one for a
while until Alice remembers that old cigarette commercial _ the one
that advertised ``just a silly millimeter more'' and decides what
he means is that anyone taller than a Virginia Slim might apply.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Alice hasn plan for snagging a mate. First thing
Monday morning she's calling some lady in New York to sign up for a
276-hour, $9,600 course designed to put her psyche on the fast
track to a more man-receptive mind set. ``A consultant will even
come to my house and show me how to make my closets `man-ready'.''
</P>
<P>
   My timing stinks, but I can't help it. A chuckle breaks loose as
I tell Alice I can handle that from here and for free. She dares
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just throw away the hangers and nail the closet door shut,'' I
tell her. ``All any man really needs is enough open floor for his
dirty underwear and adequate chair space to accommodate his suits
until you get around to taking them to the cleaners.'' She suggests
those are pretty loose words coming from a woman who's been single
for over 20 years. I remind her I'm not the one in the market for a
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thing,'' she wisecracks, explaining that no sensible man
would consider spending the rest of his life with a woman who lies
in bed eating dry Cheerios and listening to Edward Gibbon's ``Fall
of the Roman Empire'' on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Alice is deadly serious about going to New York and investing a
pot full of money in an attempt to render herself (and her closets)
husband-ready. I suggest that first she try a new hairdo and some
lacy Victoria's Secret stuff. She says she likes her hair ne
and it's the wrong time of year for flimsy undies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice,'' I begin sternly, deciding to get down and dirty
before my old friend reaches for her checkbook, ``you've had three
husbwo died, and one you didn't even like. Don't you think
it's time you forgot marriage and took up kayak portaging or whale
blubber rendering? Just think, maybe you could chew your own
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice giggles politely but insists married is the only way she
wants to be and this time she's looking for a young one who won't
up and die on her. I make a joke about starting a family (she's 63)
and she tells me not to sweat the details.
</P>
<P>
   Gotta' love her attitude.

 &HT;    Dentist's tool attacks bad breath at source
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ According to dentist Clifford Yudelman, 90
percent of bad breath originates in the crevices at the back of the
tongue, not in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Yudelman says he invented the Breath-So-Fresh Tongue
Cleaner, a device that uses a scraping tool and gel to clean debris
from the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue cleaners have been around since 100 A.D. and were
common until the turn of the century,'' Yudelman said. ``People are
just starting to rediscover the benefits of cleaning the back of
the tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Price, D.M.D., a spokesman for the American Dental
Association, agreed that cleaning the tongue is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad breath is caused by anaerobic bacteria that settle on the
tongue,'' Price said. ``Living at the back of the tongue where they
can be coated by post-nasal drip is like a trip to Club Med for
anaerobic bacteria. Scraping the tongue exposes them to air and
kills them.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said any device that allows the user to scrape the back of
the tongue without causing too much of a gagging reflex is helpful.
He said a toothbrush works for some people, but because a
toothbrush sits up high on the tongue it causes some people to gag.
</P>
<P>
   The Breath-So-Fresh is shaped like a miniature tennis racket
frame. To use it, you place some of the breath gel that comes with
the product into the frame and pull the cleaner gently forward from
the back of the tongue to the front.
</P>
<P>
   The product sells for about $5 and should be available at Target
stores.

 &HT;    Online security fears exaggerated, but use common sense
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If people worried as deeply and constantly about the
security of their homes as they do about online security, most
burglars would be in the unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   The same folks who go to a restaurant and happily hand a credit
card over to a waiter they've never seen before worry about using
the same credit card to order from Amazon.com. People who fear that
some 13-year-old genius will invade their e-mail to Aunt Sally live
in houses with plastic unlocked mailboxes in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a new threat that makes it seem more
important than the old one.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dangers online, and they are gradually getting
worse. They may someday even catch up with the hysterical fears _
fanned nicely by newspapers, television and magazines _ of the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at some of the ways you can protect yourself online.
</P>
<P>
   Passwords: Think of the password as the direct equivalent of
your house key. Once someone has that password _ or guesses it _
you are, in technical terms, dog meat. But many people figuratively
leave that password hanging on a string by the front door. Ask any
computer network administrator ... way too many people, worried
about forgetting their passwords, use the name of a spouse, their
birthday or telephone number as a password.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Use ord that is a combination of numbers and
letters. Some automated hacking programs use words in the
dictionary and _ with the endless patience of a computer _ can
eventually find the right password if it is listed there.
Especially on AOL, you are likely to get e-mail or a chat message
that purports to be from AOL itself asking for your password, or
asking you to sign on a Web site using the AOL password. Don't.
Also, make sure that you change your password every couple of
months. Don't use the same password for all your online accounts.
Don't tell anyone your password. And don't _ as I've seen happen _
write your password down and paste it to your computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards online: The fear is that some young person will
intercept your credit card number and retire happily to a life of
leisure on Maui. Like a lot of fears, there is an element of truth
here. There have been times when academic computer experts have
discovered holes in even the best encryption. But if you look for
merchants that advertise ``secure servers,'' the chances of someone
breaking in are on a par with lightning striking your car as you
drive to work.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Deal with trusted and recognized ``brand name''
companies on the Web. Then stop worrying so much. Your credit card
number is much more vulnerable in the real world. One of the
least-risky ways to conduct business on the Net is by using a
credit card since the credit card company itself will reimburse
most if not all your losses from fraud or theft.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail: Even if you aren't a spy or a crook, you probably don't
want some hacker reading your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Like many crimes, you are most vulnerable from those
who know you. Frankly, strangers probably have very little interest
in your mail. So if others share your computer, don't use the
option offered by many e-mail programs of saving your password.
Also, if you use e-mail at work, log off the system before leaving
your desk for any extended period. Keep in mind, too, that any
saved e-mail messages are stored on your hard disk and easily
accessible _ without a password _ to anyone who has access to your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Attachments: Many viruses _ including some that will forward the
e-mail in your outbox to the addresses it finds in your e-mail
program _ arrive as an attachment to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Discourage attachments. Don't open e-mails with an
attachment when it comes from a stranger. Use an anti-virus program
to scan attachments, even when it is one that you requested. Manses are transmitted unwittingly from person to person, so your
friend may not even realize he's sending an infected file.
</P>
<P>
   All these precautions are worthwhile. But once you've covered
the obvious bases, do something that will really improve your
security. Buy good deadbolt locks for the doors of your home.

 &HT;    Web a resource for home theater
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is more than one way to be a couch potato, eyes
glued to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   With a good home theater system, you'll have another way _
besides the computer and Internet _ to avoid moving more than your
eyeballs for hours at a time. The Web can help you get started if
you would like to assemble or improve a home theater system.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is a page called Audio Ideas Guide: Audio
and Home Theater Links at www.audioideas.on.ca/links
</P>
<P>
   .html. This is a page filled with links to literally dozens of
sites on the Internet that offer advice on setting up a home
theater as well as sites that sell equipment and DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of a page like this _ whether you are researching
home theaters or beekeeping _ is that you are able to keep most of
your useful links in one easily accessible place, rather than
accumulating your own list of bookmarks. Since the links are
organized by topic, you can hop right over to the area that
interests you most _ whether you're looking for tips on the actual
assembly of a home theater or on buying the latest movie on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every field there is a site that is a ``must stop''
whether you are a beginner or a longtime enthusiast. When it comes
to home theater and audio, AudioVideoNews at www
</P>
<P>
   .audiovideonews.com/ stands out. The key word here is news.
You'll find out the latest developments in equipment and also
gossip and news about what movies you can expect to see on DVD.
When visited in late December, the site was reporting that
``although George Lucas' much-ballyhooed `Episode I: The Phantom
Menace' will find its way to video through VHS on April 4, 2000,
there will be no DVD release.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the stories on this site have been reported
elsewhere (the ``Star Wars'' story was broken by The Hollywood
Reporter, for instance), it's a great place for people who don't
read a dozen trade magazines to keep up with what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   The next site, Best Home Theater at www.besthometheater
</P>
<P>
   .com/, takes a little explaining.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find equipment here _ arranged in groups of receivers,
TVs, amplifiers, accessories and speakers, and several other
categories. Click on a group title, and you'll be taken to a
listing of various products in that category complete with selling
price. Click on the specific product (let's say it's the Klipsch
Synergy System 6 speaker), and you'll be able to read the
specifications and copy extolling the virtues of the product.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy products here, but that's not the virtue of the
site. Instead, think of it as a way to quickly compare several
different speaker systems or receivers. Any enthusiast, whether a
grower of roses, a lover of high-fidelity equipment or a
woodworker, spends hours dreaming and shopping using a catalog.
Think of this site as a way to pre-shop, to compare systems
side-by-side and then make your own decision and buy the products
where you get the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Our final stop is an e-zine, a magazine that appears only
online. This one is called SoundStage and is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .sstage.com/. This is a highly professional magazine that holds
up nicely against the audio and home theater magazines you'll find
at the newsstand. The content and presentation is top-notch. But
there is a major difference that makes this a magazine you'll want
to read. It's free.

 &HT;    Spell Catcher 8 a universal standout
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine if you could have one dictionary, spell
checker and thesaurus that worked in every program, whether
QuarkXPress or Microsoft Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind Casady &AMP; Greene's Spell Catcher 8. It's a
systemwide utility that consolidates most text-editing features
into one place, one interface.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most programs today, whether Microsoft Word or
Netscape Navigator, have some text-editing features, such as
spell-checking.
</P>
<P>
   But Spell Catcher trumps them all on two counts: Its
dictionaries and thesauruses are bigger than those of other
programs, and it lets you keep one list of expandable glossary
terms rather than many.
</P>
<P>
   With Spell Catcher, you no longer have to type a new expandable
glossary term into each dictionary on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a quick look at each of Spell Catcher's main
features. The first thing you'll notice is that Spell Catcher
automatically inserts itself into every program after installation.
It appears as a green check mark in the menu bar. You can turn
Spell Catcher off for any program through its preference dialogue
box, easily available from the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher watches as you work. It knows lots of words,
recognizing 1,166 common misspellings, which the program corrects
as you type.
</P>
<P>
   For misspellings it doesn't recognize, Spell Catcher will either
flash or beep, depending on your preference.
</P>
<P>
   When beeped, you just pull down the Spell Catcher menu under the
green check mark. You can do it via the mouse or through a key
command, which you can set. In fact, you can assign key commands to
almost any feature in Spell Catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher presents a dialogue box that lists suggested
spellings. You can pick one, choose to add the word to Spell
Catcher's dictionary or hear the word pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   You can do much more than check spelling with Spell Catcher. It
includes a dictionary with 102,000 definitions. To look up a
definition, highlight the word and then choose the ``look up''
command from the dialogue box.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word, of course, doesn't include a dictionary. The
only Mac word processor that does is Nisus Writer, and that
dictionary is not as extensive as Spell Catcher's.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher also includes a thesaurus with 550,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   One of Spell Catcher's most powerful features is its glossary.
Type in an abbreviation for a word, phrase or passage, and it will
expand as you write it in any program.
</P>
<P>
   Other text-editing features include sentence capitalization,
adding smart quotes and eliminating extra tabs and other spaces.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite extra feature is the ability to convert text grabbed
from Web pages into formatted paragraphs in a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   If Spell Catcher has any weakness it is this: The program comes
without a detailed bound manual, a shortcoming unfortunately common
to most software today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Spell Catcher will not work with older Mac
operating systems. You need at least OS 8.1 and 2 megabytes of
available system memory, or RAM.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Spell Catcher online or in most computer stores that
sell Macs. The program retails for about $50 in a box and costs $10
less if you download it. An upgrade from an earlier version costs
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Casady &AMP; Greene keeps the latest versions and free demos of
Spell Catcher at its site, which you'll find at www.spellcatcher
</P>
<P>
   .com/8/default.html.

 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``I tried to use that Internet thing,'' my father
would say. ``But I kept hearing this buzz-buzz-buzz noise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called a busy signal, Daddy,'' I'd say. ``You hear it
all the time when you use the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but why do I get it when I use the Internet thing?''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to explain, but in the end I just gave up. I
surrendered. I bailed out on trying to teach my father about the
wonders of the Internet. Our little ``tech support'' sessions would
have made a MindSpring service rep cringe. I was impatient, cranky
and maybe just a tad condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean you can't see the `You've got mail' thing?''
I'd shout. ``It looks like a mailbox, Dad!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty million people have no trouble at all finding that
mailbox, but not my dad. He could have found it, but I think he had
absolutely no interest in the wonders of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   My dad's lack of interest in the Web was odd, because he always
took such interest in the ever-changing world around him.
</P>
<P>
   I also want to say that he was definitely not a technophobe. He
couldn't get through a day without entering something into his
electronic organizer. He once cooked an entire Thanksgiving dinner
in the microwave _ including the turkey _ and everything was
delicious.
</P>
<P>
   We were the classic early adopters. My parents had a
remote-control TV when they got married in the early '60s. My dad
was a big fan of the 20th century and every time-saving gizmo the
century had to offer, from electric garage door openers to cordless
phones and VCRs. No matter what it was, if you could plug it in, we
had one.
</P>
<P>
   My father, who died in October, was a 20th century man. The
Internet, I think, is really a 21st century utility. It wasn't
until the very end of the century that the Internet caught on big
with ordinary people, who would use it to buy presents, invest in
the stock market, read the newspaper or check the weather.
</P>
<P>
   My dad preferred the cable version of the Weather Channel. If he
wanted a book, he would go out and buy one (or better yet, ask me
if I could get it for him _ from my computer). I think he thought
the idea of buying a screwdriver or a bottle of wine from a PC
rather ridiculous when you could just hop into the car and go get
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is about saving time, about getting things done
faster and quicker. My best friend Janet, who has an incredibly
demanding television job, talks about ``multitasking'' when she
describes juggling work and family responsibilities. Another friend
spent Christmas week sending electronic greeting cards during her
lunch hour. She didn't have the time to sit and write out Christmas
cards like my mother did 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I can still see my mom with her well-worn address book,
carefully turning pages, checking off names and crafting personal
notes to her family and friends. I desperately want to be like her,
but I just don't have the time. It's so much easier to send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   My father and I had many things in common. We both loved
baseball, old movies, Groucho Marx and Janis Joplin. There wasn't
much of a generation gap between us. The only thing that separated
us was the Web. I loved it, while he couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   I used to tell my dad that one day, like it or not, he was going
to have to learn how to click the mouse on that little blue
mailbox. I promised I would personally drag him kicking and
screaming into the next century. He'd humor me. He'd say he'd try,
if he didn't keep getting that buzz-buzz-buzz noise whenever he
tried to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   I miss my father, but as I head off into a new century without
him, I'm starting to think he knew where that mailbox was all
along.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my dad knew that Web mastery wasn't something he was going
to need. He knew there was lots of information online, and maybe he
was happy knowing his daughter would be happy to find it for him.
</P>
<P>
   He was fine with passing the technology torch to the next
generation. And Daddy, wherever you are, I want you to know that
whatever newfangled gizmos come along in this century, if you can
plug it in or log on to it, my family is definitely going to have
one.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, we'll probably order it over that Internet thing.

 &HT;    A simple pager shouldn't cause this much anxiety
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Giving the false impression that your table will
come up any faster than if they just called your name out, this
week's annoying gadget is the restaurant ``your table is ready when
your pocket starts vibrating'' pager. Our least favorite are the
pagers tacked onto huge hunks of plastic, bringing the eloquence of
the gas station restroom key to our fine-dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   While this high-tech innovation in restauranteering is a boon to
busy hosts, restaurant pagers are just more likely to produce
anxiety than patience among diners. How many times have you been
waiting on a restaurant page with a large group? Invariably, people
will ask ``have they paged us yet?'' ``Is it vibrating?'' ``How do
we know if they paged us?'' ``Did we miss the page?'' ``Are the
lights supposed to flash?'' ``What if the pager batteries are
dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Causing more pain than it's worth, the restaurant pager is the
least appetizing technology of late.

 &HT;    Global Internet centers highlighted
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is more than a phenomenon of Silicon
Valley. It is creating new winners worldwide. Read about the new
centers of the Internet economy in the January issue of Business
2.0. The magazine names among those centers Finland, home of Nokia.
And what about Ireland, which has become Europe's hottest site for
the headquarters of new tech companies? Another surprise on the
list is Iceland, which has the highest Internet penetration in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Interactive has started a new line of kids software
called Clue Jr. SpyGlass Mysteries. Based loosely on the board game
``Clue,'' the first game in the series features a search for a
stolen artifact in a museum. Players use a special spyglass to
examine five diffengs of the museum. The game, designed for
ages 5 and up, retails for about $30. It is available only for PCs
with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more popular shoot-'em-up games is Microprose's
MechWarrior series. The company has released an expansion pack
called ``Pirate's Moon.'' It includes 20 new missions, six new
BattleMechs and five new weapons. Players need MechWarrior 3 to
make use of ``Pirate's Moon.'' The expansion pack is for players
ages 15 and older. It retails for about $30 and is available only
for PCs with Windows 95 and higher.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust Survivors is a history site that presents this
terrible event through words and pictures. You can read the stories
of survivors, hear those stories spoken and see pictures of the
people telling the stories. There's also a photo gallery of the
camps and their locales. This is a disturbing and moving site but
one not to be missed by those interested in the Holocaust. You'll
find the site at www.holocaustsurvivors.org/.

 &HT;    It's time for the tardy to shop
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you famous for being a belated gift-giver? The
holidays are over. But, assuming you're not reading this amid the
post-apocalyptic ruins of your living room, there is still time to
shop. Blame the late package on all the people who bought their
stuff from Web sites and clogged the system.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site scours the Internet for places that sell odd and
interesting stuff and links you to them. The site, www
</P>
<P>
   .giftcrap.com, even divides the gifts into categories, to make
the shopping easier.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a glutton on their list, try forkchops, ``the
Swiss army knife of flatware.'' The chops are available at
www.forkchops.com. The combination knife, fork and chopsticks sell
for $3.95 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can offer one share of Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock, a chance to
own a piece of the company that brings so much joy to so many.
Shares of that company and others are available at www
</P>
<P>
   .oneshare.com.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the ultimate gift for gluttons is the picture
cookie. The cookie is edible, assuming you consider shortbread
edible, and comes with a picture of yourself right in the frosting.
A box of 18 sells for about $34. Picture cookies are available at
www.pix.com.

<P>
   FUNDS FOR BLACK STUDENTS
</P>
<P>
   Are you a black student interested in attending a historically
black college and think you might qualify for a scholarship?
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.am-blk-coll.com, America's Black Collegians,
hopes to be the middleman between scholarship money and aspiring
students.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of the America's Black Collegians program.
Originally the group tried to raise money to offer scholarships for
the estimated 300,000 students at 115 black colleges and
universities. In 1998, the plan was broadened to include any black
student interested in pursuing a college education.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships are funded by fees generated by the sale of
products and services provided by the group's marketing partners.
For example, fees from the Black Colleges Visa card are allocated
to the scholarship fund. Similar programs include business credit
cards, communications, Internet sales, travel, insurance and
long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to is tap into some of the estimated $500 billion spent
each year by black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING PETS FEEL AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   Cats and dogs pretty much dominate whatever home they occupy.
Rugs are playing fields, televisions become grooming pedestals and
furniture becomes hairy.
</P>
<P>
   So why not buy your pet its own furniture? One Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .beastlyfurnishings.com, offers a wide selection of furniture
for cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Dog couches, chaise lounges and daybeds don't come cheap. A sofa
runs between $350 and $475, depending on the size. The couches come
with a slipcover, cushion and two accent pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The Omaha, Neb.-based company will also do custom work.
</P>
<P>
   HIBERNATION ON CAMERA
</P>
<P>
   First came the Panda Cam. Now there's the Bear Cam.
</P>
<P>
   An article on the PC World Web site, www.pcworld.com, tells of
an infrared camera focused on a bear sleeping in a cave. The images
will be broadcast on www.discovery.com. The purpose, according to
the article, is to shed light on the mystery of bear hibernation.
Bears, theoretically, spend the winter sacked out in caves.
</P>
<P>
   The camera will sit in a plastic tube and record the cave
goings-on of a female black bear in Minnesota named Whiteheart.
Part of the footage will be used in a documentary on bear
hibernation that will air in January 2001 on the Animal Planet
cable television channel. The images will be updated on the Web
site until the bear wakes up in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery.com is home to other cams, including Puppy Cam, Kitty
Cam, Bird Feeder Cam, Shark Cam, Sun Cam, Loch Ness Cam and Las
Vegas Wedding Cam.

 &HT;    Thinking small: Programs to tackle narrow missions
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let us today consider small things, little programs
aimed at solving specific problems.
</P>
<P>
   First comes Aladdin System's DragStrip, another in that long and
noble line of attempts to build the better mousetrap for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   DragStrip really does nothing for you that you can't already do
with a couple of extra mouse clicks. But it's a neat little
program, and I imagine a lot of users will like it.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the idea is to let you call up other applications or
documents without leaving the application or document you are in.
It saves a couple of clicks. The tradeoff is having this little
strip of iconated (if I may coin a nasty little word) buttons
hanging about on your screen.
</P>
<P>
   You can accomplish the same thing by clicking on the little
desktop icon to the right of the start button to jump out of the
current application and go to the desktop, if the program you wish
to open is on the desktop. If it's not, then there's always the
Start button, followed by the Programs button.
</P>
<P>
   I've put my Internet connection, my mail program, my browser,
Windows Explorer, Word, WordPad and the little calendar that comes
with DragStrip on my applications bar. On the Documents bar I put a
project I'm working on. There's also a folders bar, but I can't
imagine what I'd want to put there.
</P>
<P>
   You can put frequently visited Web pages on DragStrip, and if
you have your Internet connection established it will summon your
browser and take you there forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   DragStrip won me over with the inclusion of the calendar. It's
just a calendar; you can't keep track of appointments with it. But
a calendar is essential.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to use it, at least for a while. The only question is
whether its presence will become annoying while I'm working on a
full-screen document. There's not much point in using DragStrip
unless it's kept in the ``always on top'' mode.
</P>
<P>
   But for $20, it's hard to go wrong. For more information, go to
www
</P>
<P>
   .aladdinsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, published by a firm with the hectic name of
WinWhatWhere, is a rather sinister piece of work that nonetheless
might be of interest to parents who want to monitor their
children's computing activities. It would be of even more interest
to employers who want to spy on their workers, I suppose, but I'd
rather not think about that.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, once installed and set up, can be made pretty much
invisible. I think someone with good computer skills who suspected
it was there could find it, but children probably wouldn't suspect
it.
</P>
<P>
   It monitors activity in programs you choose, including Internet
browsers and mail readers. You can see what Web sites and
newsgroups are being visited, although unless keyboard activity is
involved, you won't be able to tell what exactly went on there.
</P>
<P>
   There is even an option to send a ``stealth message,'' invisible
to anyone using the computer, to any selected e-mail address at
specified times reporting usage, which is displayed in a
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   It does not appear to monitor the activity of programs running
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, which might more accurately have been named Big
Brother, can be installed across a network as well as on a single
machine. More information is available at www.winwhatwhere.com.

 &HT;    Dentist's tool attacks bad breath at source
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ According to dentist Clifford Yudelman, 90
percent of bad breath originates in the crevices at the back of the
tongue, not in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Yudelman says he invented the Breath-So-Fresh Tongue
Cleaner, a device that uses a scraping tool and gel to clean debris
from the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue cleaners have been around since 100 A.D. and were
common until the turn of the century,'' Yudelman said. ``People are
just starting to rediscover the benefits of cleaning the back of
the tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Price, D.M.D., a spokesman for the American Dental
Association, agreed that cleaning the tongue is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad breath is caused by anaerobic bacteria that settle on the
tongue,'' Price said. ``Living at the back of the tongue where they
can be coated by post-nasal drip is like a trip to Club Med for
anaerobic bacteria. Scraping the tongue exposes them to air and
kills them.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said any device that allows the user to scrape the back of
the tongue without causing too much of a gagging reflex is helpful.
He said a toothbrush works for some people, but because a
toothbrush sits up high on the tongue it causes some people to gag.
</P>
<P>
   The Breath-So-Fresh is shaped like a miniature tennis racket
frame. To use it, you place some of the breath gel that comes with
the product into the frame and pull the cleaner gently forward from
the back of the tongue to the front.
</P>
<P>
   The product sells for about $5 and should be available at Target
stores.

 &HT;    Online security fears exaggerated, but use common sense
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If people worried as deeply and constantly about the
security of their homes as they do about online security, most
burglars would be in the unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   The same folks who go to a restaurant and happily hand a credit
card over to a waiter they've never seen before worry about using
the same credit card to order from Amazon.com. People who fear that
some 13-year-old genius will invade their e-mail to Aunt Sally live
in houses with plastic unlocked mailboxes in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a new threat that makes it seem more
important than the old one.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dangers online, and they are gradually getting
worse. They may someday even catch up with the hysterical fears _
fanned nicely by newspapers, television and magazines _ of the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at some of the ways you can protect yourself online.
</P>
<P>
   Passwords: Think of the password as the direct equivalent of
your house key. Once someone has that password _ or guesses it _
you are, in technical terms, dog meat. But many people figuratively
leave that password hanging on a string by the front door. Ask any
computer network administrator ... way too many people, worried
about forgetting their passwords, use the name of a spouse, their
birthday or telephone number as a password.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Use a password that is a combination of numbers and
letters. Some automated hacking programs use words in the
dictionary and _ with the endless patience of a computer _ can
eventually find the right password if it is listed there.
Especially on AOL, you are likely to get e-mail or a chat message
that purports to be from AOL itself asking for your password, or
asking you to sign on a Web site using the AOL password. Don't.
Also, make sure that you change your password every couple of
months. Don't use the same password for all your online accounts.
Don't tell anyone your password. And don't _ as I've seen happen _
write your password down and paste it to your computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards online: The fear is that some young person will
intercept your credit card number and retire happily to a life of
leisure on Maui. Like a lot of fears, there is an element of truth
here. There have been times when academic computer experts have
discovered holes in even the best encryption. But if you look for
merchants that advertise ``secure servers,'' the chances of someone
breaking in are on a par with lightning striking your car as you
drive to work.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Deal with trusted and recognized ``brand name''
companies on the Web. Then stop worrying so much. Your credit card
number is much more vulnerable in the real world. One of the
least-risky ways to conduct business on the Net is by using a
credit card since the credit card company itself will reimburse
most if not all your losses from fraud or theft.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail: Even if you aren't a spy or a crook, you probably don't
want some hacker reading your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Like many crimes, you are most vulnerable from those
who know you. Frankly, strangers probably have very little interest
in your mail. So if others share your computer, don't use the
option offered by many e-mail programs of saving your password.
Also, if you use e-mail at work, log off the system before leaving
your desk for any extended period. Keep in mind, too, that any
saved e-mail messages are stored on your hard disk and easily
accessible _ without a password _ to anyone who has access to your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Attachments: Many viruses _ including some that will forward the
e-mail in your outbox to the addresses it finds in your e-mail
program _ arrive as an attachment to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The fix: Discourage attachments. Don't open e-mails with an
attachment when it comes from a stranger. Use an anti-virus program
to scan attachments, even when it is one that you requested. Many
viruses are transmitted unwittingly from person to person, so your
friend may not even realize he's sending an infected file.
</P>
<P>
   All these precautions are worthwhile. But once you've covered
the obvious bases, do something that will really improve your
security. Buy good deadbolt locks for the doors of your home.

 &HT;    Web a resource for home theater
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is more than one way to be a couch potato, eyes
glued to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   With a good home theater system, you'll have another way _
besides the computer and Internet _ to avoid moving more than your
eyeballs for hours at a time. The Web can help you get started if
you would like to assemble or improve a home theater system.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is a page called Audio Ideas Guide: Audio
and Home Theater Links at www.audioideas.on.ca/links
</P>
<P>
   .html. This is a page filled with links to literally dozens of
sites on the Internet that offer advice on setting up a home
theater as well as sites that sell equipment and DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of a page like this _ whether you are researching
home theaters or beekeeping _ is that you are able to keep most of
your useful links in one easily accessible place, rather than
accumulating your own list of bookmarks. Since the links are
organized by topic, you can hop right over to the area that
interests you most _ whether you're looking for tips on the actual
assembly of a home theater or on buying the latest movie on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every field there is a site that is a ``must stop''
whether you are a beginner or a longtime enthusiast. When it comes
to home theater and audio, AudioVideoNews at www
</P>
<P>
   .audiovideonews.com/ stands out. The key word here is news.
You'll find out the latest developments in equipment and also
gossip and news about what movies you can expect to see on DVD.
When visited in late December, the site was reporting that
``although George Lucas' much-ballyhooed `Episode I: The Phantom
Menace' will find its way to video through VHS on April 4, 20ere will be no DVD release.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the stories on this site have been reported
elsewhere (the ``Star Wars'' story was broken by The Hollywood
Reporter, for instance), it's a great place for people who don't
read a dozen trade magazines to keep up with what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   The next site, Best Home Theater at www.besthometheater
</P>
<P>
   .com/, takes a little explaining.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find equipment here _ arranged in groups of receivers,
TVs, amplifiers, accessories and speakers, and several other
categories. Click on a group title, and you'll be taken to a
listing of various products in that category complete with selling
price. Click on the specific product (let's say it's the Klipsch
Synergy System 6 speaker), and you'll be able to read the
specifications and copy extolling the virtues of the product.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy products here, but that's not the virtue of the
site. Instead, think of it as a way to quickly compare several
different speaker systems or receivers. Any enthusiast, whether a
grower of roses, a lover of high-fidelity equipment or a
woodworker, spends hours dreaming and shopping using a catalog.
Think of this site as a way to pre-shop, to compare systems
side-by-side and then make your own decision and buy the products
where you get the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Our final stop is an e-zine, a magazine that appears only
online. This one is called SoundStage and is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .sstage.com/. This is a highly professional magazine that holds
up nicely against the audio and home theater magazines you'll find
at the newsstand. The content and presentation is top-notch. But
there is a major difference that makes this a magazine you'll want
to read. It's free.

 &HT;    Spell Catcher 8 a universal standout
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine if you could have one dictionary, spell
checker and thesaurus that worked in every program, whether
QuarkXPress or Microsoft Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind Casady &AMP; Greene's Spell Catcher 8. It's a
systemwide utility that consolidates most text-editing features
into one place, one interface.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most programs today, whether Microsoft Word or
Netscape Navigator, have some text-editing features, such as
spell-checking.
</P>
<P>
   But Spell Catcher trumps them all on two counts: Its
dictionaries and thesauruses are bigger than those of other
programs, and it lets you keep one list of expandable glossary
terms rather than many.
</P>
<P>
   With Spell Catcher, you no longer have to type a new expandable
glossary term into each dictionary on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a quick look at each of Spell Catcher's main
features. The first thing you'll notice is that Spell Catcher
automatically inserts itself into every program after installation.
It appears as a green check mark in the menu bar. You can turn
Spell Catcher off for any program through its preference dialogue
box, easily available from the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher watches as you work. It knows lots of words,
recognizing 1,166 common misspellings, which the program corrects
as you type.
</P>
<P>
   For misspellings it doesn't recognize, Spell Catcher will either
flash or beep, depending on your preference.
</P>
<P>
   When beeped, you just pull down the Spell Catcher menu under the
green check mark. You can do it via the mouse or through a key
command, which you can set. In fact, you can assign key commands to
almost any feature in Spell Catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher presents a dialogue box that lists suggested
spellings. You can pick one, choose to add the word to Spell
Catcher's dictionary or hear the word pronounced.ou can do much more than check spelling with Spell Catcher. It
includes a dictionary with 102,000 definitions. To look up a
definition, highlight the word and then choose the ``look up''
command from the dialogue box.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word, of course, doesn't include a dictionary. The
only Mac word processor that does is Nisus Writer, and that
dictionary is not as extensive as Spell Catcher's.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher also includes a thesaurus with 550,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   One of Spell Catcher's most powerful features is its glossary.
Type in an abbreviation for a word, phrase or passage, and it will
expand as you write it in any program.
</P>
<P>
   Other text-editing features include sentence capitalization,
adding smart quotes and eliminating extra tabs and other spaces.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite extra feature is the ability to convert text grabbed
from Web pages into formatted paragraphs in a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   If Spell Catcher has any weakness it is this: The program comes
without a detailed bound manual, a shortcoming unfortunately common
to most software today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Spell Catcher will not work with older Mac
operating systems. You need at least OS 8.1 and 2 megabytes of
available system memory, or RAM.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Spell Catcher online or in most computer stores that
sell Macs. The program retails for about $50 in a box and costs $10
less if you download it. An upgrade from an earlier version costs
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Casady &AMP; Greene keeps the latest versions and free demos of
Spell Catcher at its site, which you'll find at www.spellcatcher
</P>
<P>
   .com/8/default.html.

 &HT;    Daddy loved technology, but Net was too much
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``I tried to use that Internet thing,'' my father
would say. ``But I kept hearing this buzz-buzz-buzz noise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called a busy signal, Daddy,'' I'd say. ``You hear it
all the time when you use the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but why do I get it when I use the Internet thing?''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to explain, but in the end I just gave up. I
surrendered. I bailed out on trying to teach my father about the
wonders of the Internet. Our little ``tech support'' sessions would
have made a MindSpring service rep cringe. I was impatient, cranky
and maybe just a tad condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean you can't see the `You've got mail' thing?''
I'd shout. ``It looks like a mailbox, Dad!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty million people have no trouble at all finding that
mailbox, but not my dad. He could have found it, but I think he had
absolutely no interest in the wonders of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   My dad's lack of interest in the Web was odd, because he always
took such interest in the ever-changing world around him.
</P>
<P>
   I also want to say that he was definitely not a technophobe. He
couldn't get through a day without entering something into his
electronic organizer. He once cooked an entire Thanksgiving dinner
in the microwave _ including the turkey _ and everything was
delicious.
</P>
<P>
   We were the classic early adopters. My parents had a
remote-control TV when they got married in the early '60s. My dad
was a big fan of the 20th century and every time-saving gizmo the
century had to offer, from electric garage door openers to cordless
phones and VCRs. No matter what it was, if you could plug it in, we
had one.
</P>
<P>
   My father, who died in October, was a 20th century man. The
Internet, I think, is really a 21st century utility. It wasn't
until the very end of the century that the Internet caught on big
with ordinary people, who would use it to buy presents, invest in
the stock market, read the newspaper or check the weather.
</P>
<P>
   My dad preferred the cable version of the Weather Channel. If he
wanted a book, he would go out and buy one (or better yet, ask me
if I could get it for him _ from my computer). I think he thought
the idea of buying a screwdriver or a bottle of wine from a PC
rather ridiculous when you could just hop into the car and go get
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is about saving time, about getting things done
faster and quicker. My best friend Janet, who has an incredibly
demanding television job, talks about ``multitasking'' when she
describes juggling work and family responsibilities. Another friend
spent Christmas week sending electronic greeting cards during her
lunch hour. She didn't have the time to sit and write out Christmas
cards like my mother did 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I can still see my mom with her well-worn address book,
carefully turning pages, checking off names and crafting personal
notes to her family and friends. I desperately want to be like her,
but I just don't have the time. It's so much easier to send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   My father and I had many things in common. We both loved
baseball, old movies, Groucho Marx and Janis Joplin. There wasn't
much of a generation gap between us. The only thing that separated
us was the Web. I loved it, while he couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   I used to tell my dad that one day, like it or not, he was going
to have to learn how to click the mouse on that little blue
mailbox. I promised I would personally drag him kicking and
screaming into the next century. He'd humor me. He'd say he'd try,
if he didn't keep getting that buzz-buzz-buzz noise whenever he
tried to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   I miss my father, but as I head off into a new century without
him, I'm starting to think he knew where that mailbox was all
along.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my dad knew that Web mastery wasn't something he was going
to need. He knew there was lots of information online, and maybe he
was happy knowing his daughter would be happy to find it for him.
</P>
<P>
   He was fine with passing the technology torch to the next
generation. And Daddy, wherever you are, I want you to know that
whatever newfangled gizmos come along in this century, if you can
plug it in or log on to it, my family is definitely going to have
one.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, we'll probably order it over that Internet thing.

 &HT;    A simple pager shouldn't cause this much anxiety
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Giving the false impression that your table will
come up any faster than if they just called your name out, this
week's annoying gadget is the restaurant ``your table is ready when
your pocket starts vibrating'' pager. Our least favorite are the
pagers tacked onto huge hunks of plastic, bringing the eloquence of
the gas station restroom key to our fine-dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   While this high-tech innovation in restauranteering is a boon to
busy hosts, restaurant pagers are just more likely to produce
anxiety than patience among diners. How many times have you been
waiting on a restaurant page with a large group? Invariably, people
will ask ``have they paged us yet?'' ``Is it vibrating?'' ``How do
we know if they paged us?'' ``Did we miss the page?'' ``Are the
lights supposed to flash?'' ``What if the pager batteries are
dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Causing more pain than it's worth, the restaurant pager is the
least appetizing technology of late.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   You gotta pay attention when the guys who mad e the super-freaky
``Neverhood'' come out with a game. That's why I have met
Southpeak's Boombots ($40, www.southpeak.com) with so much
excitement. The game is simple, alien cats are poised to take over
the world and you must fight your way through a myriad of Boombots
(of which you are one) and fight Mandu, the king of the cats. The
game is funny, twisted and a blast to play. But what else would you
expect from the guys from the Neverhood?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of fighting games, have you seen Sega's Dynamite Cop
($50, www.dreamcast.com)? What a game! Based heavily on the arcade
game (with a few extras), you take on the role of a commando in
search of the president's daughter. But what do you use to take on
a boatload of bad guys? Whatever you have. In Dynamite Cop, you can
fight with anything from a bazooka to a missile launcher to a
frozen fish. And fight you do. This game totally pumps the adrenal
gland and leaves you breathless as you fight man after man, woman
after woman, weird creature after weird creature.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   For action game fans, the wait is over _ Id Software has finally
unleashed Quake III Arena ($55, www.quake3arena.com) on a
death-matching public. But is it too little, too late? The
excellent, recently released Unreal Tournament offers a bigger
variety of game modes and a greater variation of levels. Quake III,
unfortunately, is still stuck in its brown, gothic corridor motifs.
But, lest you think Quake III is a disappointment, Id Software has
packed the game with incredible new player models, some innovative
space levels, better and faster online play and gorgeous curved
surfaces. And with a huge community of gamers who will add their
own levels and modifications, the game will only get better with
time. So who wins the Unreal Tournament vs. Quake III battle? Who
cares _ if you like first-person shooters, you should have both.
</P>
<P>
   Theme Park, a game that addicted many a gamer by enticing us
with the ability to create our own roller coasters, has gotten a
facelift with Electronic Arts' SimTheme Park ($40, www.
simthemepark.com), an addictive and playful playground. Here, you
create and monitor an amusement park, hiring employees, building
rides and sending janitors to clean up vomit and trash. Best of
all, you can take a ride on any of your roller coasters, or sit
back and hope the cash rolls in.
</P>
<P>
   The minutely detailed terrain of the Pacific Northwest makes
Flight Unlimited III ($40 for the PC, www.flight3.com) a great
flight simulator for sightseeing _ challenging enough for hard-core
sim fans who savor the nuances of navigation and flight modeling
while providing a detailed tutorial for the newcomer. The look of
the airplanes, however, is not up to the standards of Jane's, the
bible of plane illustrations. And the program, when set for
detailed graphics, clicks by slowly on anything but the fastest
machine. That said, there's a lot here to love: Fly a dozen planes,
from Fokker tri-plane to Beechjet luxury craft, through a wide
range of programmable _ and great-looking _ weather patterns and
seasons, or tackle dozens of challenges from volcano-top landings
to James Bond-style boat chases, plus problems such as turbulence,
wind sheers and crowded airports. The cityscapes, notably Seattle,
are detailed and fun while the sounds, from engine noise to radio
chatter, are first-rate. On the downside, the game has no
multiplayer options.

   ATLANTA _ The Internet is more than a phenomenon of Silicon
Valley. It is creating new winners worldwide. Read about the new
centers of the Internet economy in the January issue of Business
2.0. The magazine names among those centers Finland, home of Nokia.
And what about Ireland, which has become Europe's hottest site for
the headquarters of new tech companies? Another surprise on the
list is Iceland, which has the highest Internet penetration in the
world.

   Hasbro Interactive has started a new line of kids software
called Clue Jr. SpyGlass Mysteries. Based loosely on the board game
``Clue,'' the first game in the series features a search for a
stolen artifact in a museum. Players use a special spyglass to
examine five different wings of the museum. The game, designed for
ages 5 and up, retails for about $30. It is available only for PCs
with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more popular shoot-'em-up games is Microprose's
MechWarrior series. The company has released an expansion pack
called ``Pirate's Moon.'' It includes 20 new missions, six new
BattleMechs and five new weapons. Players need MechWarrior 3 to
make use of ``Pirate's Moon.'' The expansion pack is for players
ages 15 and older. It retails for about $30 and is available only
for PCs with Windows 95 and higher.

   Holocaust Survivors is a history site that presents this
terrible event through words and pictures. You can read the stories

 &HT;    It's time for the tardy to shop
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you famous for being a belated gift-giver? The
holidays are over. But, assuming you're not reading this amid the
post-apocalyptic ruins of your living room, there is still time to
shop. Blame the late package on all the people who bought their
stuff from Web sites and clogged the system.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site scours the Internet for places that sell odd and
interesting stuff and links you to them. The site, www
</P>
<P>
   .giftcrap.com, even divides the gifts into categories, to make
the shopping easier.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a glutton on their list, try forkchops, ``the
Swiss army knife of flatware.'' The chops are available at
www.forkchops.com. The combination knife, fork and chopsticks sell
for $3.95 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can offer one share of Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock, a chance to
own a piece of the company that brings so much joy to so many.
Shares of that company and others are available at www
</P>
<P>
   .oneshare.com.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the ultimate gift for gluttons is the picture
cookie. The cookie is edible, assuming you consider shortbread
edible, and comes with a picture of yourself right in the frosting.
A box of 18 sells for about $34. Picture cookies are available at
www.pix.com.

<P>
   One Web site, www.am-blk-coll.com, America's Black Collegians,
hopes to be the middleman between scholarship money and aspiring
students.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of the America's Black Collegians program.
Originally the group tried to raise money to offer scholarships for
the estimated 300,000 students at 115 black colleges and
universities. In 1998, the plan was broadened to include any black
student interespursuing a college education.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships are funded by fees generated by the sale of
products and services provided by the group's marketing partners.
For example, fees from the Black Colleges Visa card are allocated
to the scholarship fund. Similar programs include business credit
cards, communications, Internet sales, travel, insurance and
long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to is tap into some of the estimated $500 billion spent
each year by black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING PETS FEEL AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   Cats and dogs pretty much dominate whatever home they occupy.
Rugs are playing fields, televisions become grooming pedestals and
furniture becomes hairy.
</P>
<P>
   So why not buy your pet its own furniture? One Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .beastlyfurnishings.com, offers a wide selection of furniture
for cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Dog couches, chaise lounges and daybeds don't come cheap. A sofa
runs between $350 and $475, depending on the size. The couches come
with a slipcover, cushion and two accent pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The Omaha, Neb.-based company will also do custom work.
</P>
<P>
   HIBERNATION ON CAMERA
</P>
<P>
   First came the Panda Cam. Now there's the Bear Cam.
</P>
<P>
   An article on the PC World Web site, www.pcworld.com, tells of
an infrared camera focused on a bear sleeping in a cave. The images
will be broadcast on www.discovery.com. The purpose, according to
the article, is to shed light on the mystery of bear hibernation.
Bears, theoretically, spend the winter sacked out in caves.
</P>
<P>
   The camera will sit in a plastic tube and record the cave
goings-on of a female black bear in Minnesota named Whiteheart.
Part of the footage will be used in a documentary on bear
hibernation that will air in January 2001 on the Animal Planet
cable television channel. The images will be updated on the Web
site until the bear wakes up in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery.com is home to other cams, including Puppy Cam, Kitty
Cam, Bird Feeder Cam, Shark Cam, Sun Cam, Loch Ness Cam and Las
Vegas Wedding Cam.

 &HT;    Thinking small: Programs to tackle narrow missions
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let us today consider small things, little programs
aimed at solving specific problems.
</P>
<P>
   First comes Aladdin System's DragStrip, another in that long and
noble line of attempts to build the better mousetrap for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   DragStrip really does nothing for you that you can't already do
with a couple of extra mouse clicks. But it's a neat little
program, and I imagine a lot of users will like it.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the idea is to let you call up other applications or
documents without leaving the application or document you are in.
It saves a couple of clicks. The tradeoff is having this little
strip of iconated (if I may coin a nasty little word) buttons
hanging about on your screen.
</P>
<P>
   You can accomplish the same thing by clicking on the little
desktop icon to the right of the start button to jump out of the
current application and go to the desktop, if the program you wish
to open is on the desktop. If it's not, then there's always the
Start button, followed by the Programs button.
</P>
<P>
   I've put my Internet connection, my mail program, my browser,
Windows Explorer, Word, WordPad and the little calendar that comes
with DragStrip on my applications bar. On the Documents bar I put a
project I'm working on. There's also a folders bar, but I can't
imagine what I'd want to put there.
</P>
<P>
   You can put frequently visited Web pages on DragStrip, and if
you have your Internet connection established it will summon your
browser and take you there forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   DragStrip won me over with the inclusion of the calendar. It's
just a calendar; you can't keep track of appointments with it. But
a calendar is essential.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to use it, at least for a while. The only question is
whether its presence will become annoying while I'm working on a
full-screen document. There's not much point in using DragStrip
unless it's kept in the ``always on top'' mode.
</P>
<P>
   But for $20, it's hard to go wrong. For more information, go to
www
</P>
<P>
   .aladdinsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, published by a firm with the hectic name of
WinWhatWhere, is a rather sinister piece of work that nonetheless
might be of interest to parents who want to monitor their
children's computing activities. It would be of even more interest
to employers who want to spy on their workers, I suppose, but I'd
rather not think about that.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, once installed and set up, can be made pretty much
invisible. I think someone with good computer skills who suspected
it was there could find it, but children probably wouldn't suspect
it.
</P>
<P>
   It monitors activity in programs you choose, including Internet
browsers and mail readers. You can see what Web sites and
newsgroups are being visited, although unless keyboard activity is
involved, you won't be able to tell what exactly went on there.
</P>
<P>
   There is even an option to send a ``stealth message,'' invisible
to anyone using the computer, to any selected e-mail address at
specified times reporting usage, which is displayed in a
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   It does not appear to monitor the activity of programs running
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, which might more accurately have been named Big
Brother, can be installed across a network as well as on a single
machine. More information is available at www.winwhatwhere.com.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I'm looking for someone who can help me with
behavioral problems in a cat. My kitty constantly cries and whines
and meows, and I've ruled out health problems and am now looking
for someone to help me ``train'' her (if you can train a cat!). Do
you have any ideas? _ Kim Brill
</P>
<P>
   A: Train a cat? I am good, but I am not that good. By ruling out
health problems, I hope you mean a full examination (blood tests,
etc.) by a vet. Animal behaviorist Diana Smith, Hearts and Paws,
notes cats may reach sexual maturity as early as four months, so
that is a possibility. Veterinarian Ed Childress of Highland's Pet
Medical Clinic says other indications that this is the cause of the
whining include thrusting her derriere in the air and rubbing her
chest on the ground. This will pass in a few weeks. Remember too,
some breeds such as Siamese are more vocal than others, adds
Childress. Anxiety (over the holidays, the Christmas tree, a stray
in the front yard, house guests, etc.) could also trigger such
behavior. Remove the anxiety and improve the behavior. Q: I am
looking for a specific mailbox for my new house. The box is iron
(heavy), and stands on a pedestal that is usually bolted down. The
slot on front says ``LETTERS,'' and mail is retrieved from the back
from a locked door. This box comes in black, white or green. I want
black. I saw some in a catalog last year, but don't remember which
one. Can you help? _Jan Fulgham
</P>
<P>
   A: Try Renovator's Supply catalog, (800) 659-2211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a dinnerware set that has been in storage, and it has
gray/black markings on it. What can I use to safely clean it
without affecting the finish? The set was purchased about 25 years
ago. Also, is the company still making this pattern? _ Carolyn
Burton
</P>
<P>
   A: This poppytrail dinnerware in the antique grape by Metlox is
no longer being made. Pieces are only available from companies such
as Retrospective Modern Designs at (712) 653-3678 or online at
retrospective.net. Tips from the professionals who buy and sell
this dinnerware: Try removing the black marks with silver polish or
that miracle cleanser, Bar Keeper's Friend. When storing pottery or
china, separate (and protect) plates with coffee filters or paper
plates. Cuts down on the scratch marks! Q: In the last month or so,
pigeons have moved into my neighborhood. Lots of them! I don't mind
Californians moving in, but pigeons just won't do! Why have they
suddenly invaded the neighborhood, and how can we encourage them to
move on?
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Allen
</P>
<P>
   A: Pigeons are attracted by a good food source and a nice place
to live _ who isn't? Ray Taylor of the Austin Area Pigeon Club says
to look for neighbors who may be putting out food or a vacant
building that provides protection from the elements. Remove the
home and the food and the pigeons might take a hike. Pigeons also
like to roost in high places _ crevices of tall buildings are
attractive because they provide safety from predators like cats.
While you are at it, pick up some inflatable owls _ they scare
pigeons but won't do much to the Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need you to settle something. My sister says that
millennium is spelled with two n's and I say it is spelled with
one. She said it was a word on her spelling test at school, so it
is correct with two n's. We were at a restaurant and I saw it
spelled with one. Please tell us which one is correct!
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian and Amber Nunnery
</P>
<P>
   A: Amber is correct, big brother. Two n's, two m's, two l's and
two i's. The word comes from the Latin ``mille'' meaning 1,000 and
``annus,'' meaning year. In the Bible, Revelations 20 refers to
this time period when followers ``reigned with Christ a thousand
years.'' Lately, it has come to mean a period of 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago I received a doll catalog called My Twinn.
This company makes a doll from a picture. The dolls are very
detailed and lifelike. Help me to find the company and how I can
get another catalog or e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lisa S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Request a catalog at mytwinn.com/default.asp or by calling
(800) 4-MY-TWINN (800-469-8946). It takes four weeks for a doll to
be completed. The process begins by matching the child's head _
facial structure, eyes and lips _ so two to three pictures of the
child and a lock of hair are requested. Poseable dolls start at
$149.95; nonposeable, $120.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently went to an evening wedding and was surprised at
the number of women wearing black. Is this OK for an evening
wedding?
</P>
<P>
   _ Elizabeth T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, for an evening wedding black is fine. Remember, in some
Asian cultures, black is considered an unlucky color. No guest
should outshine the bride at a wedding, so steer clear of white.
</P>
<P>
   Q: T.A. Brown Elementary School offers an after-school program
called Prime Time. We would like to offer guitar lessons to
students, but guitars are costly. Are your readers willing to
donate acoustic, six-string guitars (steel strings preferred) to
our school?
</P>
<P>
   _Judy Howard
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe you will. Readers, call Howard at (512) 414-4295 and
arrange for your dusty guitar to get into eager hands.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently heard on the radio they are looking for people to
help take the census. If you can find out where or whom to contact
I would appreciate it. _ William H.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census Bureau needs to fill more than 800,000 temporary,
short-term positions to conduct the 2000 census. For information on
where and how to apply for a census job, visit
www.census.gov/jobs2000/www/index.html or call (888) 325-7733. The
bureau estimates that to hire and retain enough staff, it must
attract at least 3 million applicants. Q: My dad recently visited
from Illinois and he fell in love with the metal cafe tables and
chairs at the airport. He would like to know where they were
purchased and their cost. _ Christy Turner
</P>
<P>
   A: The Knoll-designed chairs and table are available, but does
your dad love them several thousand dollars' worth? Each chair is
about $632; tables begin at $460. Austin-Bergstrom received a
discount for ordering in bulk. Call Judy Shelton at Shelton-Keller
Group, (512) 481-1500, to order this aluminum dining furniture
(also seen in trendy museums). Sound expensive? The set will last
forever. So if you amortize $5,000 over the years for uses during
the furniture's life, it is a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please help solve a long-standing argument. What was Guy
Lombardo's theme song? If you are too young to remember, Guy
Lombardo and his orchestra _ was it the Royal Canadians? _ welcomed
the new year over the radio for years and years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary K. Earney
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Boo-hoo. You got me crying for you ... '' by Gaetano's
brother, Carmen, was his theme song. Of course, Guy brought the
world ``the sweetest music this side of heaven,'' according to his
motto. And his rendition of the Scottish classic ``Auld Lang Syne''
by Robert Burns is a New Year's Eve staple. For those who need to
know, auld lang syne means ``old long since.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about Bill Gates giving scholarships for minorities.
I'd like to know where to contact his foundation for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   _ A.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Do you have at least a 3.3 average on a 4.0 scale? Have you
exhibited leadership through community service? These are just two
of the selection criteria. The Gates Millennium Scholars,
administered by the United Negro College Fund, will provide
scholarships and fellowships for African-American, Native American,
Hispanic American and Asian-Pacific American students.
</P>
<P>
   For more information or to obtain an application, call (877)
690-GMSP (4677) or visit www.gmsp.org. This year's application
deadline has been extended to Feb. 15, 2000.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Who are the greatest athletes from Georgia? The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Sports Illustrated published lists
of the people they chose. The Dec. 26 AJC named Henry Aaron, for
the most home runs in a career, and Bobby Jones, a Golf Grand Slam
winner in 1930, as the top two. The Dec. 27 Sports Illustrated
named its top two: Ty Cobb, who had baseball's best lifetime
batting average (.366), and Herschel Walker, a University of
Georgia football player who won the Heisman Trophy in 1982. Check
out the full lists at your library.
</P>
<P>
   PICK SI FOR KIDS' GREATEST ATHLETES
</P>
<P>
   You can vote for your favorite athletes at Sports Illustrated
for Kids' Web site at www.sikids.com. Categories include greatest
streaks, greatest feats, best athlete of the decade and another
important category: best nickname. While you're visiting the site,
check the Stanley Skunk comic. Stanley's a fragrant jock who just
wants to play ball. Plus, you can send skunk mail to friends and
neighbors!
</P>
<P>
   HAVE A HAPPY SCHOLARSHIP
</P>
<P>
   The next time you get a Happy Meal, be sure to check it
carefully _ it could pay for part of your college education.
McDonald's is offering four $25,000 scholarships during the next
year. Sure, your chances of winning are slim. But you've got to eat
anyway, so when you're at Mickey D's, be sure to look. Good luck!

 &HT;    How will kids live in the next century?
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We asked kids around metro Atlanta to haul out their
crystal balls and predict what the new century will bring.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 of you responded and let your imaginations run
wild. You envisioned flying cars similar to George Jetson's, flying
school buses and even flying bathtubs. We saw teleporters shaped
like satellite dishes and a microchip in a fingertip to be used
like a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Robots frequently took center stage. They could help you clean
your room or even assist a handicapped person.
</P>
<P>
   You were concerned about the fate of serious things, too, such
as AIDS, the environment and endangered species. You also wrote to
us about a better society, one in which people are treated equally.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some more examples of the future you see:
</P>
<P>
   _ Amanda Havriluk, a fifth-grader at the Wesleyan School in
Gwinnett County, told us: ``The planets will be used for different
things. You will go to Earth to work and get food to eat. You will
fly to Uranus for vacations. You will go to Mars to party! You will
go to Saturn to shop, especially for rings, because Saturn is the
ringed planet! You will go to Venus to get beautiful like Venus the
goddess! You will go to jumping Jupiter to play sports. You will go
to Mercury when you get really old to retire. And all the bad
people will go to Pluto to be in jail. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things will be easier in the new millennium. Showers
will be like car washes _ automatic! And, when you step out, you
are blown dry. ... Everyone speaks the same language _ Universal
Space Language.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Delores Cooper, a seventh-grader at Peachtree Middle School in
DeKalb County, wrote about a healing machine to make people well.
Patients would pass through it on a conveyor belt while lying on
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Garrik Hughes, an eighth-grader at Peachtree Middle School in
DeKalb County, envisions a ``machine that makes what your heart
desires.'' He would ``only give it to people who are not
criminals.'' You would wear a hat with wires sticking out to send
signals to a tower shaped like a pyramid. Then the pyramid would
turn your fondest wishes into reality.
</P>
<P>
   _ Demetrius Brown, a seventh-grader at Peachtree Middle School
in DeKalb County, wrote us about a smart pill that kids could take
so they wouldn't have to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diedre f Smyrna (her grade and school were
unavailable), predicted, ``There will be a cure for AIDS and HIV.
There will be no slavery in countries, cities, states or towns!
There will be equal rights for all minority people. There will be
skilled and smarter students. ... There will be better paying
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Sanders, a third-grader at Fountain Elementary in
Clayton County, told us, ``In the next millennium, there will be no
endangered animals.'' He drew animals living in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   _ Katherine Chou, a seventh-grader at Dickerson Middle School in
Cobb County, wrote us a short story with a moral about our
environment. Here is an excerpt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Katherine noticed the sun was coming up, and what she saw made
her gasp. As far as she could see, the world was nothing more than
a big, black, crusty thing. There were a couple of trees, and lucky
for her she was next to one. The only source of oxygen for a good
mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, make a difference, help our Earth and be kind to it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Quang Danh, a second-grader at Morrow Elementary in Clayton
County, would be happy with one change: ``School computers will
have letters in alphabetical order.''

 &HT;    The crisis that fizzled
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The electricity stayed on, planes stayed in the air,
trains chugged along right on schedule, computers didn't conk out,
no banks ran out of money, and the millennium bug didn't kill the
monsters on your PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   For months _ actually years _ we've been deluged with scary
reports that computers might blink out like fireflys when the
clocks rolled over from 1999 to 2000. It didn't happen. It was New
Year's Eve as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Which means your parents might feel a little foolish now if they
stocked up on food, water and gasoline, or even bought an expensive
electric generator, just in case something happened. But they
shouldn't. Millions of people did the same thing. Remember, many of
the world's best computer experts warned us all to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those experts are being compared to the boy who cried
``wolf.'' But that's not fair. The experts' warnings made banks,
companies, the government and others fix their computers to squash
any Y2K bugs before they could bite. Which is why everything was
working fine on New Year's morning _ and why you're going back to
school today.
</P>
<P>
   POKEMON TOY RECALLED
</P>
<P>
   If you got a Pokemon toy from Burger King, be careful with the
container it came in. The red-and-white ball, which opens to reveal
a toy inside, could hurt you.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-month-old girl in California died when half of the ball
covered her nose and mouth, preventing her from breathing.
</P>
<P>
   If you have one of these balls, give it to your parents. They
can return it to Burger King through March 15 and receive a free
order of french fries in its place.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon toy promotion was one of the largest in fast-food
history. It lasted 56 days.
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST DAILY `PEANUTS'
</P>
<P>
   Good grief, Charlie Brown! Today is the last time we'll see a
new weekday ``Peanuts'' comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, who created Snoopy, Linus, Lucy
and the other ``Peanuts'' characters, is retiring after almost 50
years of drawing the comic. Schulz, 77, is recovering from cancer
and says the daily deadlines are too hard to meet.
</P>
<P>
   His last Sunday ``Peanuts'' strip will run Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be too sad, Charlie Brown. We'll still be able to see
the ``Peanuts'' gang in action, as newspapers run daily and Sunday
reprints from the past 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many younger readers, the '70s strips will be new,'' says
Lisa Wilson of United Media, the company that sends the comic strip
to newspapers. ``We hope that, with these reprints, we can cushion
the shock of Mr. Schulz's retirement.''
</P>

 &HT;    The resignation of President Boris Yeltsin has created a new
political situation in Russia. Probably he should have resigned
sooner, even before it was so advantageous to ride the victorious
wave of popular support for his hand-picked successor.
 &HT;    Time will pass judgment on Yeltsin's record in office. What's
needed now, however, is to concentrate on what lies ahead.
 &HT;    Above all, in the coming months, it will be necessary to
strictly follow the Russian constitution. The new presidential
election must take place, as prescribed, and Russia must enter a
new period in its history with dignity and in accordance with
democratic norms.
 &HT;    This is extremely important, but there is something else that we
need to bear in mind.
 &HT;    I hope that the bitter experience of recent years has taught all
of us not to expect miracles. By now we have seen that overnight
revolutions and shocks make good headlines; so do flashy ideas from
``whizz kids'' with little or no experience outside the ivory
tower. But we need long-term, persistent work to build a civil
society and a healthy economy that serves the people.
 &HT;    Russia's politicians, parties and associations will serve the
country well if they dedicate their thoughts and efforts to this
task.
 &HT;    In an interconnected world, any error, especially one made by a
great power, can resonate throughout the world. Events in Moscow
affect every continent; the dangers that pose the greatest threat
one nation also threaten another. It is fitting to use our wisdom
for the good of the worldwide human community.
 &HT;    For example, in what may be termed a new arms race, we see the
most dangerous types of military technology continuing to spread
across the continents. Military technology is being refined and
perfected, and conventional weapons are acquiring the capacity to
function as ``absolute weapons.''
 &HT;    In the more developed countries, new techniques for killing or
paralyzing the enemy are being developed, including psychotropic,
electronic and laser weapons. There is a creeping expansion of the
technological capability for the production of nuclear weapons and
other weapons of mass destruction.
 &HT;    Even while our leaders may honestly grapple with the means to
govern democratically and secure the rule of law, perhaps the
disastrous consequences of the arms race that was part of the Cold
War are being ignored.
 &HT;    That contest not only oppressed everyone with its state of
mutual fear and terrible tension. It also drained the economic
potential of all the participating states. It had extremely
negative political and psychological consequences as well,
strengthening the positions of the most military-minded elements in
society who are well known for their intolerance and cruelty. The
most striking examples in recent years _ although they are by far
not the only ones _ have been in Yugoslavia, the second Persian
Gulf crisis and the ongoing Chechnya war.
 &HT;    I wish we might have entered this new century with the ability
to assert, without question, that the trend toward eliminating
confrontation is irreversible.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, we can only remark that confrontational elements
are still very much woven into the fabric of world politics. The
confrontational approach is consistent with political traditions
having deep historical roots _ traditions based on the notion of
winners and losers in a world balance of power. These tendencies
continue to exist, although often in disguised form.
 &HT;    To be sure, there is progress. World public opinion has been
activated to some degree to infuse universal human values and
principles of morality into global affairs and the resolution of
major problems.
 &HT;    But the political behavior of some countries still shows that
they see the resort to arms as a viable _ a primary _ way of
resolving problems. This should constitute a serious warning.
 &HT;    In view of all this, how do we see the world today? Is there a
``Cold Peace,'' so to speak? A reversion to confrontation, granted
that it is not full-fledged?
 &HT;    In my view, what we see now _ in Russia and elsewhere _ is not
just a transitional period in time but also a special kind of
transitional order _ one that could exist for a long time, one that
may be characterized by instability, conflict and the strong
influence of spontaneous forces in world relations.
 &HT;    Even an enlightened future with civil leadership entails
complications. Absolutely! But perhaps our future politics _ with
its outmoded desires to assert hegemony, to establish spheres of
influence _ will not lag so far in back of our people's urgent need
for the practical application of universal human values.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Vladimir Putin is Russia's Mr. Nice Guy. Everyone admires him.
Like a young prince, he exudes the charm of political freshness.
Always on the move, this man still appears to be shy, even though
in a mere five months he has ascended from being an unknown
bureaucrat, to being prime minister, and now the acting president
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And the people's affection for Putin has only seemed to grow as
he has backed away from being labeled a Russian hero.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I honestly believe, Putin is ready to work selflessly
for the good of this humiliated country. Russia has long yearned
for light at the end of the tunnel, and with Putin we have received
hope that we are going to see it after all.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, for months the 47-year-old politician has had control
of the military and many daily operations of government, these
passed on to him by the progressively ailing, 68-year-old Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, there are people who think that Putin's popularity
is exclusively the result of the Chechen factor _ that is, his
tough prosecution of what the Kremlin has called a ``fight against
Islamic bandits and terrorists'' in the republic of Chechnya. I beg
to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is the focus of many old and new aspirations of the
Russian people: for a strong arm, for youthfulness and integrity of
political leadership and for national revival. Liberals and
patriots, pro-marketeers and statists, rich and poor, generals and
human-rights activists have been equally willing to stake their
hopes on him.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Putin showed the rare talent of being all
things to all men. Placing their bets on him were figures as
diverse as media tycoon Boris Berezovsky, economic reformer Yegor
T. Gaidar and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi, who led a
'93 coup attempt against the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin _ with his corruption scandals, health debacles and
single-digit opinion-poll ratings _ abruptly named Putin
heir-apparent, it could have nipped Putin's career in the bud.
Instead, Putin appeared to thrive on the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, two new pro-Kremlin parties and a host of candidates
in the parliamentary elections were able to ride Putin's coattails
to victory. Since then, the Kremlin has been in a state of euphoric
glee. At last it found a winner! You can criticize Yeltsin for
plenty of things, and to be sure he has lost authority and
credibility. But you have to admit he was determined to keep the
country under his control _ indeed, to his last political breath.
</P>
<P>
   To Putin's credit, however, all the stardom did not swell his
head. He seemed little inclined to overrate his own success: One
has to hand it to him. Presumably, he realized that soon enough
there would be harder things to do. Now, the most difficult
questions he may be asking himself are these: What is my most
effective political resource? How long will this training flight
last? What will I have to face when I touch down?
</P>
<P>
   Being a sensible person, Putin must realize that there is a good
deal of the irrational and fairytale-like in the popular affection
for him, which is generally characteristic of the Russian people.
Putin says he will improve the people's life, and they believe him.
He says he will get the better of the Chechen rebels, and everyone
gives a cheer. He swears he will uproot corruption, and we
desperately want to take it on trust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lurking behind Putin's sudden and effortless emergence are
some formidable problems. Suppose, as everyone is predicting, he
does win the election, which is now rescheduled for March 26, and
he becomes Yeltsin's successor?
</P>
<P>
   What will happen the day after he is installed at the Kremlin?
Who will be the first to enter his office and get down to real
work? Will he have anyone to rely on? His ``king makers,'' perhaps?l he rely on an enchanted nation of people who, having cast
their votes, now expect him to wave his magic wand and put all
things right?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly among the crowd of eager political associates, who are
just dying to share the ``spoils of war'' and push through the
Kremlin gate, there are none disinterested enough to share the
burden and responsibility of leading the government and stabilizing
the country.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is one thing to say: ``I assume responsibility for
Chechnya,'' using Yeltsin's backing and power, but quite another to
mobilize one's own resources and run the country full-time.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Kremlin's aggressiveness in the run-up to the
parliamentary election was Putin's most effective tool. The public
was treated to a barrage of pro-Chechen-war, pro-government,
pro-Putin, anti-opposition propaganda on the leading media outlets,
which are monopolized and controlled by the Kremlin and its allies.
But popularity cannot be kept up indefinitely by these means alone.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, by tacitly encouraging the persecution of his
political opponents, Putin has not only made powerful rivals, he
has effectively brought them to a boiling point. Very soon,
however, he must gather a totally different kind of support. He
will have to set efficient policies _ economic, financial, social,
scientific and cultural. Will Putin be able to attract the type of
human resources he needs for this?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's political demise, as well as the ``change of guard''
at the top, will surely reactivate the power blocs that have, in
recent months, been deactivated and suppressed by the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Putin has won out because his approval ratings have
soared to a dizzy height. I am afraid that in the long term,
however, the backing of his newfound liberal Kremlin allies will
not be strong enough. Putin's political fate largely hinges on
himself. Above all, on his readiness to meet halfway those who are
currently, and somewhat artificially, presented as his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's tradition of intrigue and ugly power politics,
even if Putin does achieve success in the presidential election, he
will have an uphill struggle lying ahead.

<P>
   The hardest thing about power is knowing when to let go. The
next hardest, particularly in a country like Russia which has
experienced nothing but dictatorship for a millennium, is knowing
whom to hand power to.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his resignation on Dec. 31 Boris Yeltsin may have
succeeded on both counts, assuring not only his personal safety and
political legacy, but his place in history and Russia's infant
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   By now Yeltsin is more than the man who saved Russia when a coup
by Communist hard-liners threatened to turn back the clock by
nullifying Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost. In nine
muddy years since, Yeltsin has also created a new Russia, very much
in his own image: one unpredictable, wayward, but full of promise.
By stepping down now, Yeltsin has given his handpicked successor,
Vladimir Putin, the best chance to win elections that will take
place in March.
</P>
<P>
   Shades of the Kremlin of old? Aimed at Yeltsin, a deft
maneuverer of the old school of Communist politics, the gibe is
tempting. It is also unfair.
</P>
<P>
   With mandatory presidential elections approaching next year,
Moscow was awash in rumors: ``feeding time at the zoo,'' as one
former British prime minister called it. By ending the whispering
campaign that he intended to cling to power no matter what, Yeltsin
deserves more cheers than jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Through this orderly and constitutionally correct device to
attempt to assure his succession, Yeltsin may have precluded any
possibility of a chaotic power struggle for the Kremlin without
sacrificing democratic principles. Russia may now go on to complete
its transition from communism to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But what do we know of the heir apparent, Acting President
Putin? In keeping with his shadowy KGB background, very little.
Putin is married with two daughters, 47 years old and a graduate of
Saint Petersburg University's Law Faculty. Stationed for a decade
as a KGB agent in the former East Germany, he also saw Western
democratic and business practices up close, and by now is believed
to be committed to them.
</P>
<P>
   After communism's collapse, he worked for the liberal mayor,
Anatoly Sobchak, and alongside other young reformers like Anatoly
Chubais in the St. Petersburg government of the early 1990s.
Transferred to Moscow, he headed the Federal Security Service, or
FSB (the transformed KGB), until Yeltsin suddenly appointed him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his murky profile, Putin's most potent claim to fame,
and to power, is a renowned toughness. In the bloody mountains and
ruined cities of Chechnya, Putin established his credentials as the
man needed to restore order and stop the country's internal
disintegration by revitalizing state power.
</P>
<P>
   That the West seems nervous about Putin only enhances his
prestige at home. With Western economic policy prescriptions widely
seen as having failed in Russia; with NATO expanding near to the
country's borders and old allies like Serbia bombed; with America
seen as wanting to weaken Russia even more, breaking it up into
pieces and controlling the oil-rich Caspian basin, anti-Western
sentiments are on the rise. Putin's political antenna have caught
this trend. The chance that the West eyes Russia's acting president
with suspicion makes him even more desirable to the traditional
Russian heart.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, however, prefers to promote the impression of
being a more enlightened and modern leader. His prime ministerial
New Year's address _ ``Russia at the Turn of the Millennium'' _ was
posted on the Internet, at a government website, for all the world
to see before being published in Russian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In it he outlined his presidential program. Playing to the
crowds, he declared that Russia is no plaything for the West to
kick around. But demagoguery stopped there. Russia, he also
declared, must mend itself. It will remain cooperative and friendly
with the world, provided that the world is cooperative and friendly
too. But the hard work of rebuilding Russia must be done by
Russians, and with no time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia cultural instincts, in which communal ideas remain
more valued than individualist principles, help determine the
success or failure of policies. The national strategies Putin will
likely follow will take into account these social impulses. Thus he
is unlikely to publicly trumpet the unforgiving capitalist policies
of Yegor Gaidar and Chubais, even if he quietly pursues them.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly a strong patriot, Putin also knows that Russia's
national idea of itself must be cleansed of haughtiness and
imperial ambitions. The Russia he envisions will be a great power
once more, but great in the ways that a truly modern society must
be: in its democratic commitments, its economy and its domestic
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Russia today is that Putin is a man of neither
great talents nor great vices. To ordinary Russians he appears as
modest, principled and honest, a vast contrast with the tainted
politicians of the Yeltsin years. He is a perfect fit for a Russia
grown tired of the heroes, revolutionaries, criminals and even
saviors, who make life exciting but rarely stable.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in September by the Moscow Public Opinion
Foundation showed that what Russians most want is a new Brezhnev,
whose nearly 20 years (1964-1982) of leadership once was disdained
as the ``era of stagnation,'' but now is nostalgically recalled as
a ``golden ear of stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin almost fits this mold of firmness and seriousness, which
ensures stability, a strong state and a ``golden middle'' between
radical reforms and strong-arm rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of their minds, however, Russians also hold a secret
fear. It concerns a type of man, a pleasant, quiet individual who
walks softly through the Kremlin corridors, someone who
uncomplainingly takes on _ and completes _ many hard and unpleasant
tasks while others fight noisily for high position. One day that
unassuming political beast of burden suddenly comes out on top, as
Stalin did in the early 1920s. Of President Putin Russia, like
history, must reserve its judgement.

<P>
   The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define
its ``national interest'' in the absence of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   That we do not know how to think about what follows the
U.S.-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to
the ``post-Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such periods of transition are very important because they
offer strategic opportunities. During these fluid times, one can
affect the shape of the world to come. The enormity of the moment
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was more than just a traditional global
competitor. It strove to lead a universal socialist alternative to
markets and democracy. The Soviet Union quarantined itself and many
of its often unwitting captives and clients from the rigors of
international capitalism. In the end, it sowed the seeds of its own
destruction, becoming in isolation an economic and technological
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   America has emerged as both the principal benefactor of this
revolution and the beneficiary. American values are universal.
Their triumph is most assuredly easier when the international
balance of power favors those who believe in them. But sometimes
that favorable balance of power takes time to achieve, both
internationally and within a country, and in the meantime, it is
simply not possible to ignore and isolate other powerful states.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is a good example. Few would deny that the collapse
of the Soviet Union profoundly transformed the picture of democracy
and human rights in eastern and central Europe and the former
Soviet territories. Nothing improved human rights as much as the
collapse of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States pursued a policy that
promoted political liberty, using every instrument from the Voice
of America to direct presidential intervention on behalf of
dissidents. But it lost sight neither of the importance of the
geopolitical relationship with Moscow nor of the absolute necessity
of retaining robust American military power to deter an all-out
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, President Reagan's challenge to Soviet power was
both resolute and well timed. It included intense substantive
engagements with Moscow across the entire range of issues captured
in a classic ``four-part agenda'' _ arms control, human rights,
economic issues and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration then focused greater attention on
rolling back Soviet power in central and eastern Europe. As the
Soviet Union's might waned, it could no longer defend its interests
and gave up peacefully (thankfully) to the West _ a tremendous
victory for Western power and also for human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is fortunate to count among its
friends several great powers, it is important not to take them for
granted _ so that there is a firm foundation when it comes time to
rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia presents a different challenge. It still has many
of the attributes of a great power: a large population, vast
territory and military potential. But its economic weakness and
problems of national identity threaten to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is determined to assert itself in the world and often
does so in ways that are at once haphazard and threatening to
American interests. The picture is complicated by Russia's own
internal transition _ one that the United States wants to see
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The old Soviet system has broken down, and some of the basic
elements of democratic development are in place. People are free to
say what they think, vote for whom they please, and (for the most
part) worship freely. But the democratic fragments are not
institutionalized _ and with the exception of the Communist Party,
political parties are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in his last months as president, few paid attention
to Boris Yeltsin's decrees. Arguably, the Russian government has
been mired in inaction and stagnation for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic troubles and its high-level corruption have
been widely discussed. Its economy is not becoming a market but is
mutating into something else. Widespread barter, banks that are not
banks, billions of rubles stashed abroad and in mattresses at home,
and bizarre privatization schemes that have enriched the so-called
reformers give Moscow's economy a medieval
</P>
<P>
   The problem for U.S. policy is that the Clinton administration's
ongoing embrace of Yeltsin and those who were thought to be
reformers around him quite simply failed. Clearly the United States
was obliged to deal with the head of state, and Yeltsin was
Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. support for democracy and economic reform became
support for Yeltsin. His agenda became the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The United States certified that reform was taking place in
Russia where it was not, continuing to disburse money from the
International Monetary Fund in the absence of any evidence of
serious change.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some curious privatization methods were hailed as economic
liberalization; the looting of the country's assets by powerful
people either went unnoticed or was ignored. The realities in
Russia simply did not accord with the administration's script about
Russian economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not be faulted for trying to help. But,
as the Russian reformer Grigori Yavlinsky has said, the United
States should have ``told the truth'' about what was happening. Now
we have a dual credibility problem _ with Russians and with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of life in the Russian economy. The financial
crash of August 1998 forced import substitution, and domestic
production has increased as the resilient Russian people have taken
matters into their own hands. Rising oil prices have helped as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But these are short-term fixes. There is no longer a consensus
in America or Europe on what to do next with Russia. Frustrated
expectations and ``Russia fatigue'' are direct consequences of the
``happy talk'' in which the Clinton administration engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic future is now in the hands of the Russians.
The country is not without assets, including its natural resources
and an educated population. It is up to Russia to make structural
reforms, particularly concerning the rule of law and the tax codes,
so that investors _ foreign and domestic _ will provide the capital
needed for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity will arise after the March 26 election when
there is a new government. But the cultural changes ultimately
needed to sustain a functioning civil society and a market-based
economy may take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Western openness to Russia's people, particularly its youth, in
exchange programs and contact with the private sector and
educational opportunities can help that process. It is also
important to engage the leadership of Russia's diverse regions,
where economic and social policies are increasingly pursued
independently of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy must concentrate on the important
security agenda with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, it must recognize that American security is threatened
less by Russia's strength than by its weakness and incoherence.
This suggests immediate attention to the safety and security of
Moscow's nuclear forces and stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program should be funded fully and pursued
aggressively. (Because American contractors do most of the work,
the risk of the diversion of funds is low.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, Washington must begin a comprehensive discussion with
Moscow on the changing nuclear threat. Much has been made by
Russian military officials about their increased reliance on
nuclear weapons in the face of their declining conventional
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian deterrent is more than adequate against the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, and vice versa. But that fact need no longer be
enshrined in a treaty that is almost 30 years old and is a relic of
a profoundly adversarial relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was intended to prevent the
development of national missile defenses in the Cold War security
environment. Today, the principal concerns are nuclear threats from
the Iraqs and North Koreas of the world and the possibility of
unauthorized releases as nuclear weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, in fact, lives closer to those threats than Washington
does. It ought to be possible to engage the Russians in a
discussion of the changed threat environment, their possible
responses, and the relationship of strategic offensive-force
reductions to the deployment of defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Moscow should understand that any possibilities for
sharing technology or information in these areas would depend
heavily on its record _ problematic to date _ on the proliferation
of ballistic-missile and other technologies related to weapons of
mass destruction. would be foolish in the extreme to share defenses with Moscow
if it either leaks or deliberately transfers weapons technologies
to the very states against which America is defending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the United States needs to recognize that Russia is a
great power, and that we will always have interests that conflict
as well as coincide. The war in Chechnya, located in the oil-rich
Caucasus, is particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Vladimir Putin used the Chechnya war to stir
nationalism at home while fueling his own political fortunes. The
Russian military has been uncharacteristically blunt and vocal in
asserting its duty to defend the integrity of the Russian
Federation _ an unwelcome development in civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Putin is acting president, the long-term effect of the
war on Russia's political culture should not be underestimated.
This war has affected relations between Russia and its neighbors in
the Caucasus, as the Kremlin has been hurling charges of harboring
and abetting Chechen terrorists against states as diverse as Saudi
Arabia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The war is a reminder of the vulnerability of the small, new
states around Russia and of America's interest in their
independence. If they can become stronger, they will be less
tempting to Russia. But much depends on the ability of these states
to reform their economies and political systems _ a process, to
date, whose success is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile America can exercise power without arrogance and
pursue its interests without hectoring and bluster. That has been
America's special role in the past, and it should be again as we
enter the new century.

<P>
   The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define
its ``national interest'' in the absence of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   That we do not know how to think about what follows the
U.S.-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to
the ``post-Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such periods of transition are very important because they
offer strategic opportunities. During these fluid times, one can
affect the shape of the world to come. The enormity of the moment
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was more than just a traditional global
competitor. It strove to lead a universal socialist alternative to
markets and democracy. The Soviet Union quarantined itself and many
of its often unwitting captives and clients from the rigors of
international capitalism. In the end, it sowed the seeds of its own
destruction, becoming in isolation an economic and technological
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   America has emerged as both the principal benefactor of this
revolution and the beneficiary. American values are universal.
Their triumph is most assuredly easier when the international
balance of power favors those who believe in them. But sometimes
that favorable balance of power takes time to achieve, both
internationally and within a country, and in the meantime, it is
simply not possible to ignore and isolate other powerful states.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is a good example. Few would deny that the collapse
of the Soviet Union profoundly transformed the picture of democracy
and human rights in eastern and central Europe and the former
Soviet territories. Nothing improved human rights as much as the
collapse of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States pursued a policy that
promoted political liberty, using every instrument from the Voice
of America to direct presidential intervention on behalf of
dissidents. But it lost sight neither of the importance of the
geopolitical relationship with Moscow nor of the absolute necessity
of retaining robust American military power to deter an all-out
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, President Reagan's challenge to Soviet power was
both resolute and well timed. It included intense substantive
engagements with Moscow across the entire range of issues captured
in a classic ``four-part agenda'' _ arms control, human rights,
economic issues and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration then focused greater attention on
rolling back Soviet power in central and eastern Europe. As the
Soviet Union's might waned, it could no longer defend its interests
and gave up peacefully (thankfully) to the West _ a tremendous
victory for Western power and also for human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is fortunate to count among its
friends several great powers, it is important not to take them for
granted _ so that there is a firm foundation when it comes time to
rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia presents a different challenge. It still has many
of the attributes of a great power: a large population, vast
territory and military potential. But its economic weakness and
problems of national identity threaten to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is determined to assert itself in the world and often
does so in ways that are at once haphazard and threatening to
American interests. The picture is complicated by Russia's own
internal transition _ one that the United States wants to see
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The old Soviet system has broken down, and some of the basic
elements of democratic development are in place. People are free to
say what they think, vote for whom they please, and (for the most
part) worship freely. But the democratic fragments are not
institutionalized _ and with the exception of the Communist Party,
political parties are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in his last months as president, few paid attention
to Boris Yeltsin's decrees. Arguably, the Russian government has
been mired in inaction and stagnation for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic troubles and its high-level corruption have
been widely discussed. Its economy is not becoming a market but is
mutating into something else. Widespread barter, banks that are not
banks, billions of rubles stashed abroad and in mattresses at home,
and bizarre privatization schemes that have enriched the so-called
reformers give Moscow's economy a medieval tinge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for U.S. policy is that the Clinton administration's
ongoing embrace of Yeltsin and those who were thought to be
reformers around him quite simply failed. Clearly the United States
was obliged to deal with the head of state, and Yeltsin was
Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. support for democracy and economic reform became
support for Yeltsin. His agenda became the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The United States certified that reform was taking place in
Russia where it was not, continuing to disburse money from the
International Monetary Fund in the absence of any evidence of
serious change.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some curious privatization methods were hailed as economic
liberalization; the looting of the country's assets by powerful
people either went unnoticed or was ignored. The realities in
Russia simply did not accord with the administration's script about
Russian economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not be faulted for trying to help. But,
as the Russian reformer Grigori Yavlinsky has said, the United
States should have ``told the truth'' about what was happening. Now
we have a dual credibility problem _ with Russians and with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of life in the Russian economy. The financial
crash of August 1998 forced import substitution, and domestic
production has increased as the resilient Russian people have taken
matters into their own hands. Rising oil prices have helped as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But these are short-term fixes. There is no longer a consensus
in America or Europe on what to do next with Russia. Frustrated
expectations and ``Russia fatigue'' are direct consequences of the
``happy talk'' in which the Clinton administration engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic future is now in the hands of the Russians.
The country is not without assets, including its natural resources
and an educated population. It is up to Russia to make structural
reforms, particularly concerning the rule of law and the tax codes,
so that investors _ foreign and domestic _ will provide the capital
needed for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity will arise after the March 26 election when
there is a new government. But the cultural changes ultimately
needed to sustain a functioning civil society and a market-based
economy may take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Western openness to Russia's people, particularly its youth, in
exchange programs and contact with the private sector and
educational opportunities can help that process. It is also
important to engage the leadership of Russia's diverse regions,
where economic and social policies are increasingly pursued
independently of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy must concentrate on the important
security agenda with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, it must recognize that American security is threatened
less by Russia's strength than by its weakness and incoherence.
This suggests immediate attention to the safety and security of
Moscow's nuclear forces and stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program should be funded fully and pursued
aggressively. (Because American contractors do most of the work,
the risk of the diversion of funds is low.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, Washington must begin a comprehensive discussion with
Moscow on the changing nuclear threat. Much has been made by
Russian military officials about their increased reliance on
nuclear weapons in the face of their declining conventional
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian deterrent is more than adequate against the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, and vice versa. But that fact need no longer be
enshrined in a treaty that is almost 30 years old and is a relic of
a profoundly adversarial relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was intended to prevent the
development of national missile defenses in the Cold War security
environment. Today, the principal concerns are nuclear threats from
the Iraqs and North Koreas of the world and the possibility of
unauthorized releases as nuclear weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, in fact, lives closer to those threats than Washington
does. It ought to be possible to engage the Russians in a
discussion of the changed threat environment, their possible
responses, and the relationship of strategic offensive-force
reductions to the deployment of defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Moscow should understand that any possibilities for
sharing technology or information in these areas would depend
heavily on its record _ problematic to date _ on the proliferation
of ballistic-missile and other technologies related to weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish in the extreme to share defenses with Moscow
if it either leaks or deliberately transfers weapons technologies
to the very states against which America is defending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the United States needs to recognize that Russia is a
great power, and that we will always have interests that conflict
as well as coincide. The war in Chechnya, located in the oil-rich
Caucasus, is particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Vladimir Putin used the Chechnya war to stir
nationalism at home while fueling his own political fortunes. The
Russian military has been uncharacteristically blunt and vocal in
asserting its duty to defend the integrity of the Russian
Federation _ an unwelcome development in civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Putin is acting president, the long-term effect of the
war on Russia's political culture should not be underestimated.
This war has affected relations between Russia and its neighbors in
the Caucasus, as the Kremlin has been hurling charges of harboring
and abetting Chechen terrorists against states as diverse as Saudi
Arabia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The war is a reminder of the vulnerability of the small, new
states around Russia and of America's interest in their
independence. If they can become stronger, they will be less
tempting to Russia. But much depends on the ability of these states
to reform their economies and political systems _ a process, to
date, whose success is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile America can exercise power without arrogance and
pursue its interests without hectoring and bluster. That has been
America's special role in the past, and it should be again as we
enter the new century.

 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state.
 &HT;    Billions of dollars of foreign aid have poured into its reforms.
 &HT;    Bitter struggles have been waged between Russia's free-market
radicals and their Communist or nationalist foes, most
significantly in 1993, when armed struggle broke out between the
parliament and President Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    Great privations have been visited on the country in the name of
necessary sacrifice.
 &HT;    Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better? Russians,
free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their nation has shrunk
_ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by the people.
 &HT;    The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of the
state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year since the
Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it
grew, at best, by less than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially
nonexistent in Soviet times, is now officially 12 percent and may
really be 25 percent.
 &HT;    Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed.
 &HT;    ``There was a debate about institutions and infrastructure back
in 1990,'' says Joseph Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World
Bank, whose earlier work on imperfect information and markets has
put him in line for a Nobel prize. ``I remember talking to a
conference in Prague in 1991 on the theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos
Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards themselves?') in a situation of
rapid privatization. There were already differences between (us
Western reformers) then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation. In Warsaw in 1989, he
explained market economics to the Solidarity activists about to be
thrust into power.
 &HT;    That December, the first Polish post-Communist government was
quailing before price liberalization. Late at night in the office
of the finance minister, Sachs had got on the phone and harangued
American officials until they promised to nudge the IMF into
providing $1 billion in support for the Polish currency.
 &HT;    His myth as the economic liberator was born, and with it a
mechanism known as ``shock therapy.'' This was shorthand for a raft
of measures _ price liberalization, budget stabilization, a
slashing of subsidies _ undertaken more or less simultaneously to
``shock'' the economy into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery.
 &HT;    The young reformers in Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs
and his mechanism their way forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    On a leave of absence from Harvard, Sachs installed himself and
his team in the Russian Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large
part of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had
been embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall.
 &HT;    Both men proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and
impatiently, while Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed
the IMF and the World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to Russia's government as acting prime minister. But he
needed much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any
other Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy. But its
release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with the effect of
wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough _
without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, was
to observe later, any therapy.
 &HT;    The shock was such that by April 1992 the slender parliamentary
majority the government commanded for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, economist Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has
characterized Russian reform right up till now _ a guerrilla
struggle with a hostile, often violently hostile, legislature.
Russia's free-market reformers hoped the West would back them as
soon as they took office. But the West did not. This, for many
insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in (to Russia). When South
Korea ran into difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six
months. ... The problem was the financial scale.''
 &HT;    Thus, the economic radicals, East and West, charge that we lost
Russia. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision _ Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of the Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed
for this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with Summers and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War.
 &HT;    ``The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it wasn't going
to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was the Russians
themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do, the absence of
a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the '93 battle with parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say we have lost Russia _ through
our own actions and mistakes. Lost because we pursued agendas that
were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost because we encouraged
and supported precisely those men in the government dacha, who were
hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies, as some now recommend, would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration. ...
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation.
 &HT;    Russia never was ours to lose. It must find itself; until then,
we can do little more than watch, offering an occasional bit of
encouragement from the sidelines.

majority the government commanded for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, economist Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has
characterized Russian reform right up till now _ a guerrilla
struggle with a hostile, often violently hostile, legislature.
Russia's free-market reformers hoped the West would back them as
soon as they took office. But the West did not. This, for many
insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in (to Russia). When South
Korea ran into difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six
months. ... The problem was the financial scale.''
 &HT;    Thus, the economic radicals, East and West, charge that we lost
Russia. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision _ Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of the Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed
for this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with Summers and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War.
 &HT;    ``The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it wasn't going
to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was the Russians
themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do, the absence of
a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the '93 battle with parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say we have lost Russia _ through
our own actions and mistakes. Lost because we pursued agendas that
were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost because we encouraged
and supported precisely those men in the government dacha, who were
hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies, as some now recommend, would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration. ...
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation.
 &HT;    Russia never was ours to lose. It must find itself; until then,
we can do little more than watch, offering an occasional bit of
encouragement from the sidelines.

<P>
   Imagine the unwashed folk who lounged around the fire with their
cups of foul ale in January 1000, wondering what the new millennium
might bring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they hoped for a better way to sharpen knives or soothe
a throbbing tooth.
</P>
<P>
   But computers and genetic engineering? Inconceivable. Equally
futile are most of our own speculations about third-millennium
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At least we can be reasonably certain about predicting what will
occur in the heavens over specific periods.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, events can sometimes take us by surprise. Some comets, for
example, have such incredibly slow orbits _ 5,000 to 100,000 years
_ that every visit close to the sun seems like the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Halley's, follow shorter, more predictable
periods. Its next appearance in 2061 should be a winner _ the
comet's bright, fuzzy head will ie favorably in the northern sky
and its tail may span half the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are plenty of sky wonders on the way that
won't require a 60-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   A midnight lunar eclipse, easily visible throughout North
America on Jan. 20, for example, kicks off the new century in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of my top 10 list of the events for the early
years of the 21st century, astronomical headliners that require
nothing more than the naked eye:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000: &LR;  Jupiter approaches Saturn in the autumn sky. The
eye-catching meeting of these two giant planets happens once every
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2001: &LR;  Those in the upper half of the United States should look
northward for vivid displays of the aurora borealis, a by-product
of a peak in solar storm activity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2003: &LR;  On Aug. 27, Mars will venture closer to Earth than at
any time in the past 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks the Red Planet will outshine everything else in
the night sky except for the moon and will be a delight through
backyard telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  In June, for the first time since 1882, Venus will cross
the face of the sun. With a proper sun-dimming filter, this rare
type of eclipse, known as a transit, can be seen without a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  The first spacecraft to orbit Saturn will arrive at the
ringed planet for a four-year reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is the last of a kind _ heavy, expensive and fully
loaded. Its arrival won't be visible, of course, but you can bet
that glitzy pictures from the billion-dollar mission will show up
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2006: &LR;  The moon's shadow will sweep over Egypt and run through
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2009: &LR;  The greatest, longest solar eclipse of the 21st century
will cross China and the Pacific Ocean, offering a rare 6.5 minutes
of daytime darkness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2012: &LR;  Venus will transit the sun again, the last such event of
the century. This time it will be visible from North America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2017: &LR;  Breaking a 38-year drought, a total eclipse of the sun
will slash the United States from coast to coast, briefly turning
day into night. It will be our first glimpse of totality in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if we can't all be as prescient as Jules Verne, at
least we can predict SOME of the future.

   A midnight lunar eclipse, easily visible throughout North
America on Jan. 20, for example, kicks off the new century in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of my top 10 list of the events for the early
years of the 21st century, astronomical headliners that require
nothing more than the naked eye:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000: &LR;  Jupiter approaches Saturn in the autumn sky. The
eye-catching meeting of these two giant planets happens once every
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2001: &LR;  Those in the upper half of the United States should look
northward for vivid displays of the aurora borealis, a by-product
of a peak in solar storm activity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2003: &LR;  On Aug. 27, Mars will venture closer to Earth than at
any time in the past 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks the Red Planet will outshine everything else in
the night sky except for the moon and will be a delight through
backyard telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  In June, for the first time since 1882, Venus will cross
the face of the sun. With a proper sun-dimming filter, this rare
type of eclipse, known as a transit, can be seen without a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  The first spacecraft to orbit Saturn will arrive at the
ringed planet for a four-year reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is the last of a kind _ heavy, expensive and fully
loaded. Its arrival won't be visible, of course, but you can bet
that glitzy pictures from the billion-dollar mission will show up
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2006: &LR;  The moon's shadow will sweep over Egypt and run through
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2009: &LR;  The greatest, longest solar eclipse of the 21st century
will cross China and the Pacific Ocean, offering a rare 6.5 minutes
of daytime darkness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2012: &LR;  Venus will transit the sun again, the last such event of
the century. This time it will be visible from North America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2017: &LR;  Breaking a 38-year drought, a total eclipse of the sun
will slash the United States from coast to coast, briefly turning
day into night. It will be our first glimpse of totality in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if we can't all be as prescient as Jules Verne, at
least we can predict SOME of the future.

around.

&HT;     TV RINGS IN A NEW ERA IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once it became clear that it was not going to be, in the words
of R.E.M., the end of the world as we know it, the television story
of the new year switched from fear to partying, from breaking news
to garden-variety New Year's Eve bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   It was fortunate, then, that the networks and even the
affiliates had back-up plans when no planes fell from the sky and
nobody blew up the Space Needle in Seattle or landmarks between New
York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as high-tech people began dubbing it, Apocalypse Not.
Still, it made for surprisingly entertaining viewing. From Peter
Jennings' marathon anchoring to Worldwide Culture 101 put on by PBS
and a ton of CNN international events in between, it was something
special.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States was one of the last to celebrate the
new millennium, one of the great TV spectacles happened in the
middle of the day. As the rest of the world ushered in the new
year, a great many Americans probably were working or shopping. Too
bad. They missed what amounted to one of the most intriguing
television events of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While we are used to Dick Clark counting down the ball drop, the
rest of the world showed that in various ways a blowout is a
blowout, and you don't need Times Square to make an impact. With
ABC, CNN and PBS leading the way, midday viewers were treated to
real-time midnight strokes throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   People were doing the pogo in New Delhi. In Moscow's Red Square,
St. Basil's was bathed in the light of fireworks as the first great
test of Y2K technology (and the focus of many fears) passed
innocently without a nuclear meltdown or even a city-block power
outage. The Russians, who switched presidents in a pre-millennium
changing of the guard, proved they could party with anyone. Events
at the stroke of midnight in other countries paled compared with
the chill you felt watching Moscow roll over into the 21st century,
because, if for nothing else, the bogeyman of technology and retro
Cold War nuclear fears were fading away.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, at the Opera House, there was an astounding
pyrotechnics display that would be topped later in Paris, as the
Eiffel Tower became the center of one of the most spectacular,
sustained light shows anybody has seen, until Britain topped
everyone with a record-breaking, explosion-filled, 17-minute
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   If you were lucky enough to decide to sit down in front of the
tube early (rather than get truncated recaps later in the evening,
which did no justice to the live events and expanded coverage),
then you saw technology at its finest. ABC, CNN and PBS did
masterful jobs of giving viewers live coverage, interviews and some
historical insight to the rest of the world. It amounted to a
surprise travelogue and riveting television.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' desire to anchor the entire evening had ups and downs
but mostly proved he is calm and clear in a major event. The ABC
production was entertaining enough to stick with the entire night,
but the other networks provided their own unique elements. PBS, for
example, had a much more subdued delivery, forgoing hype for
information, letting its anchors and guests add historical
significance to the pictures on display. And more than any network,
PBS emphasized cultural traditions, from ice music in Lapland to
singers in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   CNN and PBS knew when to stay quiet, while the urge to yak often
overcame the high-priced anchors working as reporters at ABC. But
that was only a slight blemish to what was a mighty good effort all
around.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight came to various countries, the joy spilled out in
sometimes odd, amusing and endearing ways. No one partied or
cheered in Djibouti, East Africa, because there was nothing to be
happy about in poverty. It's only 1420 on the Muslim calendar and
many cities, such as Baghdad, were observing religious rites that
banned celebrations. In Egypt (6240 on the calendar, if you are
counting), the millennium doesn't mean anything except tourist
dollars, so they played along, though the fog obscured planned
fireworks near the pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to look away from the beauty of the fireworks
exploding off the Acropolis in Athens, or wonder if something were
going to go awry in Bethlehem's Manger Square. But the peace doves
quickly erased fears. Although some religious extremists thought
there would be a Second Coming of Jesus in Jerusalem, only two men
were arrested at the stroke of midnight as they tried to go over
the wall of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
   People waltzed in Vienna and went absolutely nuts in Amsterdam,
dancing to ``YMCA'' in a nod to cheesy fun and lowered inhibitions.
For those counting _ or watching _ China's official celebration
lasted all of eight minutes. But that country invented fireworks,
the ubiquitous party favor of choice across the planet. And no
millennium coverage would be complete without a prolonged
conversation about Greenwich Mean Time and how, when it comes to
time, Greenwich, England, is the center of the world. And so we
learned a lot about the Millennium Dome (the largest ``roofed''
building in the world, twice as large as the Georgia Dome), but we
are still uncertain about what will happen to the structure
post-New Year, because Greenwich hardly is London.
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe the coverage captured all kinds of joyous
moments, filling the midday viewing with what amounted to the most
interesting material of the day. In comparison to the celebrations
around the world, the New York ball drop was boring, a been-there,
done-that moment that didn't satisfy. Not even 2 million people,
3,500 pounds of confetti shot out of cannons and Dick Clark could
elevate the event above a tired cliche.
</P>
<P>
   As for news coverage, it all became repetitive once Australia
didn't go dark. Reporters repeated stories about how all the
computers came through without glitches, how airplanes were safe,
and how terrorism here and abroad was eerily silent.
</P>
<P>
   Once midnight came to San Francisco, all the stories were told.
And though the fireworks were nice in a provincial kind of way, the
overall effect was roughly the same as it was in New York. If you
only watched for three hours as the time change rolled West, you
already had a sense of redundancy. But if you spent the day
watching the world step into the unknown, you already had
experienced the zenith of history's march.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting our history, the United States, it seems, already had
been upstaged by the time we got to the zeros. And it was a
wonderful thing to behold.

BONDS HAD A BAD YEAR BUT SHOULD BOUNCE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 55 and my wife is 48. My annual income is $85,000 and
our only debt is a $140,000 mortgage on a new home purchased two
years ago. We currently pay an extra $200 per month toward the
principal. I have a 401(k) plan with a current balance of $243,807,
almost entirely invested in stock funds. I have been contributing
18 percent of my salary to this account, but based on my last pay
raise I will henceforth be limited to 13 percent contributions.
Both of us have traditional IRAs, to which we each contribute
$2,000 a year; the combined balance is $32,400. We also own 100
shares of Black &AMP; Decker common stock. Finally, we have credit
union accounts totaling $36,400, earning at rates ranging from 2.75
percent to 3.5 percent. To these accounts we add $1,070 a month
from a military pension and the income from my wife's part-time
bookkeeping work, which will amount to $15,000 to $20,000 for 1999.
At the present time, I would feel comfortable retiring with 75
percent of my current income stream, or $5,300 a month. I estimate
a Social Security income of $1,120 a month, and my military pension
(which has a small cost-of-living adjustment each year) will
provide a$1,070. Is my target attainable? What suggestions
would you make to change the portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   D.F., Alpine, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Given your very substantial savings levels, you should be in
good shape _ but not quite as good as it may at first seem.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mid-range figure of $17,500 a year saved from your
wife's earnings, you will be putting away a total of $45,390 a
year, and if you achieve overall portfolio returns of 8 percent
over the next seven years, the pool would grow to $964,317.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pool that is certainly capable of comfortably
delivering a $3,110 monthly income stream, with plenty left over
for continued principal growth.
</P>
<P>
   But when you calculate the effects of inflation on the formula,
it looks a bit murkier. If inflation averages 3.5 percent over the
next seven years, you will need $6,743 to buy what $5,300 buys
today.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, instead of $3,110 a month, you would be looking for your
savings to produce a $4,553 income stream. If you established a
fixed-income portfolio to produce this without invading the
principal, you would need $825,000, provided your average yield
from the fixed-income investments was 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave you with $139,317, which you could leave in
stock investments that might protect you against the effects of
inflation in the later years of retirement; I say might, because it
probably isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of factors that should make things brighter.
One is that I haven't factored in the COLA that's associated with
the military pension.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that the accumulation would be larger if you held
your contributions to the 401(k) to the current percentage,
increasing the dollar contributions every time you get a raise. If
your wife's earnings exceed that $17,500 midpoint, you would also
have a larger accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, if you were to divert the 5 percent of your
earnings that you are no longer allowed to put in the 401(k) into a
taxable savings program, the accumulation would reach $1,012,938,
using the same assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   As for your investment vehicles, obviously the weak element here
is the low-interest credit union accounts. If you simply
transferred those balances to a good money market account with a
mutual fund family, you would realize a notable improvement.
</P>
<P>
   But I would establish a level that represents what you believe
you need as emergency savings, and put only that much into the
money market fund.
</P>
<P>
   I would then take the rest, and all of the ongoing contributions
from your wife's earnings and the military pension, and begin
building that fixed-income portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that bond funds are a tough sell after their bad year
in 1999, but if you take a longer view, they should be attractive.
I'd suggest a three-pronged approach, with half of the money in an
intermediate-term fund such as one holding government securities or
GNMAs, with a further 25 percent each in a short-term corporate
bond fund and a high-yield corporate bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you began with half of the money now at the credit union, and
added at the rate of $30,340 per year, you would build a $291,473
fixed-income portfolio by the time you retire, based on
expectations of 6.5 percent average annual total returns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 77 and a widower planning marriage in March. I receive a
check each month of approximately $2,500 from my investments, and
live comfortably on this and Social Security. My investments are
Franklin High Income Trust Class A, Franklin Municipal Securities
Trust, California High Yield, and Prudential Municipal Bond fund. I
am happy with my monthly check. However, I see my fund value
decrease each month. This worries me. If this continues I could be
wiped out. Do I have to worry?
</P>
<P>
   J.A., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First, congratulations on your upcoming marriage, which is a
much nicer thing to think about than the bond markets of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain what the first holding you cite is; perhaps it's
Franklin Age High Income fund, or perhaps Franklin High-Yield
Tax-Free fund. In any event, what you are seeing in your portfolio
is what happens to your principal balance when bond funds have bad
years and you withdraw the income; your balance is not only
depleted by the amount of the losses suffered by the funds, but in
addition by the $30,000 in distributions that you have taken.
</P>
<P>
   It also appears likely that your sequence of withdrawals
probaeeds by a bit the amount of the yields, so the decline
in your balance was thus aggravated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, I don't think you should worry overmuch. Bond
funds periodically suffer bad years, almost always caused by
increases in interest rates, and/or fears of future increases.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the interest rate cycle turns the other way
eventually, and the better funds recoup their losses of the bad
years. The two funds I can identify precisely are excellent funds,
but both hold long-term portfolios, which makes them suffer more in
a bad interest-rate climate that shorter-term funds.
</P>
<P>
   I think the worm will turn for this portfolio, although perhaps
not in the short term. I suggest you ride it out, and if the
decline in the current portfolio value bothers you, you could
reduce the effect by slightly reducing the amount of your
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 86, so my working years were spent when wages were low.
My savings are mostly invested in bond funds. I have several
questions. I am thinking of investing in a Vanguard fund. Do you
think it would be sensible to buy it in my son's name? I don't need
the money. Also, how is it that one is able to accumulate hundreds
of thousands of dollars in an IRA by contributing the maximum of
$2,000 a year?
</P>
<P>
   P.H., Cape Cod, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a potential tax advantage in buying the fund
position in your name, and then leaving it to your son in your
will. That is what is called the step-up provision in the tax laws,
which allows a person inheriting securities to treat the value of
the holding at the time of the donor's death as his or her base
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you put the investment in your name and the value of
the holding advances during the balance of your lifetime, the
amount of that gain would be tax-free, and your son would be liable
for capital gains taxes only on any appreciation in the fund
position that comes after he inherits the shares.
</P>
<P>
   As for those mammoth IRA accounts that surface from time to time
in letters to this column, you can fund an IRA by rolling over
other tax-deferred savings programs such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s, or
lump-sum pension distributions into an IRA, thus allowing the
balances to far exceed what a person might have accumulated through
a sequence of $2,000-a-year contributions.

VOTERS GET A MONTH TO NARROW THEIR FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The second look may be a sharper look.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 30 days, the pace of the presidential campaign will
accelerate, the airwaves will be dominated by appeals and
put-downs, the candidates will come into ever sharper relief _ and
caucus-goers in Iowa and primary voters in New Hampshire will weigh
the options, and will discover the candidates anew.
</P>
<P>
   They will look at Al Gore and remember that they were told he
was wooden, a stick figure, only to find him more human, more
vulnerable, more needy _ needy for their approval, and needy for
their vote _ than they had ever expected of a 51-year-old man of
accomplishment and erudition who had won election to the House,
Senate, and vice presidency and now wants to graduate to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   They will look at George W. Bush and remember that they were
told he was smooth but shallow, only to find him more searching,
more nuanced, more sophisticated than they expected from a man who
glided through life without a care if not carelessly, and then
blithely took his apprenticeship in politics as the governor of the
second-largest state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They will look at Bill Bradley and remember that they were told
he was boring, a drone, a pampered overachiever used to being at
the center of attention, only to find that he has an uncanny
ability to make the audience, not the speaker, the center of
attention, and that the touchstone of this Princeton and Oxford
figure is not formality but informality.
</P>
<P>
   They will look at John McCain and remember that they were told
he was unpredictable, even tempestuous, only to find that his iron
sense of discipline will always return the conversation to his
advantage (his desire for political reform) and that his manner is
easy, approachable, even warm.
</P>
<P>
   They will look at Steve Forbes and remember that they were told
that he was an upper-class toff, more interested in the
capital-gains tax and horse breeding than in the prosaic concerns
of life, only to find that he is tough, uncompromising, gritty _
and fluent in international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   They will look at all the candidates _ these five plus three
more Republicans, Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer, and Senator Orrin G.
Hatch _ and wonder if they really know them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, when the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 1
New Hampshire primary seemed an eternity away, the presidential
campaign was dominated by a vice president known mostly as a loyal
subordinate and by a governor who was known, if at all, for his
congeniality. And it shaped up as a sterile struggle between Gore
and Bush, two famous sons of two famous political fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the presidential nomination races are different _ they
really have turned into contests, not coronations _ and the
candidates are emerging from their caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the campaign has changed in the past several
months, it will change even more in the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the presidential race has belonged to the few _ the
candidates, their paid advisers, a handful of volunteers, a horde
of reporters, commentators, editors, and technicians. From here on
out, the presidential race will belong to the the workers
and the wealthy, the stockboys and the stockbrokers, the farmers
and the financiers.
</P>
<P>
   And, history shows, once the public gets involved _ once
Americans wrestle the political choices away from the political
class _ all the assumptions, all the expectations, change.
</P>
<P>
   Now not only the moment of decision, but also the moment
of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Iowa and New Hampshire, people's attention is about to be
magnified, maybe out of proportion,'' said Steven Parker, a
political scientist at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. ``In
other places, politics is now the tiniest of ripples in an ocean
that has changed dramatically. But in Iowa and New Hampshire, this
will be the biggest show in town, and the intensity is going to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the public has only the vaguest familiarity with the
presidential candidates, their positions, their lives, their
outlooks, their motivations. A study by the Annenberg Public Policy
Center at the University of Pennsylvania released late last month
found that ``the public is still learning'' some of the details
``the elites take for granted,'' adding: ``At this stage of the
presidential campaign, most Americans do not even recognize the
names of many of the contenders. Many people who do recognize a
candidate's name do not feel they know enough to express a
favorable or unfavorable opinion about him.''
</P>
<P>
   So unfamiliar with the candidates are the American people that,
according to the study, ``no single impression of any presidential
candidate is widely held by the public.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been one of the dominant figures in the campaign, and
his rise to his status as the most prominent challenger to the GOP
front-runner was perhaps the leading political story of the autumn.
Even so, less than half the American people profess to have any
familiarity with him at all _ and only about a third know he is a
senator. Indeed, only two Americans in five know that Bradley,
whose rise is the other major political story of the fall, once
played professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the public's views of key campaign issues any stronger.
A Pew Research Center poll taken last month showed that few
Americans could associate candidates with their principal policy
proposals. For all the attention to McCain's crusade against the
campaign-finance system, only 11 percent knew that McCain was
associated with an overhaul of the system, with 10 percent
associating that issue with Bush, who has not made it a staple of
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings are important, but people learn quickly, or at
least make up their minds quickly,'' said James Chace, a Bard
College professor whose Dean Acheson biography has been a subject
of discussion in Republican debates. ``They look at these people
and decide that they're tired, or they've been around, or something
else. People's decisions are complicated, but it comes down to
leadership and good judgment. People never know exactly who has
those things, but they try to figure out who does _ and often they
are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the imperfect prisms of politics _ debates where the
premium is on pugilism, advertisements where cold calculations
portray candidates as warm and fuzzy, campaign events where the
audience often consists of the committed more than the casual or
the curious _ tens of thousands of the people of Iowa and New
Hampshire are about to draw the conclusions that will shape the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance that they will look at the candidates,
and that they will find their choice determined by an old word with
a new meaning: character.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, that word has been a proxy for marital
fidelity and personal stability. When commentators spoke of the
``character issue'' involving Senator Gary W. Hart of Colorado, the
Democratic contender in 1984 and 1988, they really meant his
reputation for womanizing. But when people speak of character in
2000, they mean something else entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public is a little more into judging the
candidates by moral and religious characteristics than professors
and reporters do,'' said David Siemers, a political scientist at
Colorado College. ``The president is uniquely positioned to lead in
a moral sense, and most of the time the public knows that. Voters
try candidates on for size that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates sense that is exactly what is going on right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electorate thinks in terms of bringing honor and dignity
to the office of the presidency, it thinks in terms of
trustworthiness, that a candidate intends to do what he says he
will do, that he can stand tough, make decisions,'' Bush said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the two presidential races seem so close in
New Hampshire is that voters have been reluctant to choose among
them in those areas. The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll of
New Hampshire voters showed that at least 71 percent of Granite
State likely voters consider Bush, McCain, Gore, and Bradley to be
strong leaders and to have the kind of personality and temperament
it takes to serve effectively as president. At least 79 percent of
the state's likely primary voters consider all four of them honest
and trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon the people who turn up at caucuses in Iowa or vote
in the primary in New Hampshire will have very definite views,''
said Parker, the Nevada political scientist. ``The television
advertisements will do that. But so will the press, as it puts
these guys under the microscope.''

 HILLARY'S CHOICE  
By Gail Sheehy 
Random House. 389 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is hardly the worst book about Hillary Rodham Clinton, but
it might well be the sloppiest.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Sheehy, author of ``Passages'' and several psycho-political
profiles in Vanity Fair magazine, asks the question: Why did this
smart, ambitious woman, who seemed destined for her own great
career, give it up and tie her fate to Bill Clinton's?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Sheehy never provides an answer. Or rather, she
offers several explanations, some truistic, others rickety.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy owns the cake of lather when it comes to barber-shop
Freudianism, so much blame gets brushed on Hillary's ``drillmaster
father,'' whose ``demand for perfection'' and ``readiness to
demean'' were ``internalized'' by her ``overactive superego.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sheehy fails to support her premise, much less the analysis.
Hugh Rodham seems to have been strict and undemonstrative, but so
were many fathers of the era. Sheehy's piece de resistance _ that
he didn't even attend Hillary's college graduation, where she
delivered a famlazing commencement speech _ has been flatly
denied by the First Lady's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy's claim that Bill Clinton represented Hillary's first
``taste of freedom . . . an escape from her father,'' is diluted by
her own revelation that, before meeting Bill, Hillary enjoyed a
three-year relationship with a handsome Georgetown student with
whom she had sex and may have smoked pot. ``Get her away on a
weekend,'' she writes of Hillary in those randy days, ``and she
could be playful.'' So Bill wasn't her first ``taste''? Then what?
</P>
<P>
   Her portrait of the Clintons' marriage is at least as strange as
the marriage itself. She may be right that Hillary plays
``enabler'' to Bill's antics. (``He lied to her. And she let
him.'') But what does it mean to find in their relationship
``echoes of Eleanor and Franklin, or Tracy and Hepburn, with
undertones of Bonnie and Clyde''?
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``White House aides'' who ``puzzle over why the Clintons
make a display of physical affection,'' Sheehy speculates, ``Maybe
he does it to make her feel good, to make it look like he's turned
on by her.'' She doesn't consider maybe he is turned on by her.
</P>
<P>
   As the book trundles on, Sheehy grows desperate. At one point,
she cites a ``highly qualified mental health professional who works
too close to the White House to be identified'' as diagnosing the
president with multiple-personalities disorder: He's not lying
about his sexual affairs _ he doesn't know he's having them!
</P>
<P>
   However, 10 pages later, Sheehy notes that the presi
dalliance with Monica Lewinsky coincided with ``three major
personal marker events'' _ his mother's death, his daughter's
departure for college, and his knee injury, which made him hobble
``like an old man'' and remember that his father died young.
</P>
<P>
   But does this mean he's not schizophrenic? And what about his
countless earlier affairs? What ``marker events'' triggered them?
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy's description of young Hillary's evolution from Goldwater
Republican to liberal Democrat is interesting. Her big scoop was
persuading a childhood friend named John Peavoy to turn over a
bundle of letters Hillary wrote him from college. It's fascinating
to read the future steely First Lady describe herself as a
``compassionate misanthrope.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, how much can one infer about a grown woman's
character from letters she wrote at 19? Sheehy puts especial stock
in one letter where Hillary remembers dancing in her backyard as a
little girl, pretending there were ``heavenly movie cameras
watching my every move.'' But don't most children imagine being the
stars of their own movies?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate flaw of Sheehy's book may be that she's working the
wrong angle. In explaining why Hillary didn't pursue her own
career, she latches onto a letter from college, describing a brief
funk over who-am-I-really and the-meaning-of-life _ standard
late-teen angst. But Sheehy interprets it as a full-blown
``identity crisis'' and a fear of introspection that Hillary
allayed by turning ``her attention to advising others on how to
live their lives. . . . This became a lifelong pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Weak. Very weak.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy might have done better by looking a bit at the world
around her subject. Hillary graduated from Wellesley in 1969, on
the cusp of the feminist revolution, when _ as her classmate Miriam
Horn has written elsewhere _ half the graduates followed the girls'
school tradition of catching a man, while the other half carved out
their own paths. Hillary, clearly, was caught in the middle. Had
she come of age a few years later, it is doubtful she would have
played second-fiddle to a Bill Clinton, no matter how mean her
daddy was.

MIXED MARRIAGES ALTER LONGTIME BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A constant question in Jamy Gaynor's mind is what will her
children look like. Will they take the strong cheekbones and cocoa
skin from her father's West Indian heritage or the hazel eyes and
lean stature from her mother's English and Slavic stock? Or will
her children bare the flawless olive skin and almond eyes of her
fiance's Asian parents?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure, Gaynor, 23, of Fitchburg, Mass., who is
biracial, and her fiance, Souvanna Sommala, 24, who is Thai and
Laotian, don't share the same feelings of alienation that afflicted
her parents a quarter of a century ago, when friends abandoned them
and local realtors shut doors in their faces. To them, race lines
are blurred, faded and antiquated. Gaynor's sister Nicole dates an
Irish-American man; Sommala's nephew is black and Asian, and their
friends cross racial and ethnic divides.
</P>
<P>
   With roots in four continents, the extended Gaynor family is the
face of the new millennium, demographers say. As immigrants
continue to stream across the nation's borders, and with the number
of interracial marriages projected to double during the next
century, social historians are predicting that the racial
distinctions that have defined American history will slowly melt
away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the younger Gaynors move toward a world where they
say race won't matter, they are still faced with questions of
identity. Jamy Gaynor and Sommala wonder whether their children
will choose to be Buddhists or Christians. And Jamy still struggles
to master the native tongue of her future in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend and I perceive things differently, from foods to
the way we raise children. . . . He eats bland food. I like spicy
foods,'' said Nicole Gaynor, Jamy's younger sister. ``It's going to
be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists fear that as the old racial boundaries fade,
pockets of hatred will become all the more rabid. Some people will
be threatened by the nation's changing complexion, sparking hate
crimes such as cross burnings and more serious violence, said Paul
Watanabe, a political science professor at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, these sociologists say, people are
unlikely to lose their deep need for cultural identity. The
Gaynors, and the burgeoning number of multiracial families like
them, are at the forefront of the difficult questions many
Americans will face in the 2000s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the real debate and dialogue will fall in the 21st
century will be culture versus race,'' said Regina
Rodriguez-Mitchell, assistant director of the William Monroe
Trotter Institute in Boston. ``What are the leading elements that
govern our behavior? What guides and centers us? What marks your
identity, where do your values and belief systems spring from?''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, American society insisted on clear divisions
between races. Census takers in the 19th century considered anyone
with ``one drop'' of blood to be blmer Plessy, the
African-American plaintiff who was part of the 1896 landmark Plessy
v. Ferguson decision that preserved racial segregation in Southern
schools, was only one-eighth black. Across the South, miscegenation
laws prohibited black and white people from marrying. Slowly those
lines began to blur, though, as the last of the legal barriers
banning interracial marriages were dismantled more than two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the number of mixed marriages has blossomed.
Interracial marriages have increased tenfold since 1960, according
to the 1990 census, and the number of offspring from these
marriages has reached 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Their growing numbers and their rejection of old racial
categories forced the census for the first time this year to allow
people to identify themselves by more than one race.
</P>
<P>
   Other sociologists saypulation of families who cross all
blood lines will change racial attitudes in a way that new laws and
political speeches never could. Groups that historically have
separated themselves will sit together at family reunion picnics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interracial marriages provide the death knell to racist
thinking,'' said Sally Engle Merry of Wellesley College. ``Pretty
soon you can classify people into one group or another, then the
whole system of race begins to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as race becomes less prevalent in their lives, sisters
Nicole and Jamy Gaynor say cultural issues like religion and
language can also create tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Protestant and we are not supposed to pray to other
gods, but in the Buddhist religion you are constantly on your knees
praying. So it can be a little hard going to the gatherings and
just standing there,'' Jamy said.
</P>
<P>
   But their differences, they say, are minor compared with the
hatred that their parents confronted years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Gaynor, a son of Jamaican and Barbados immigrants, and
Sharon, a farm girl from northern Massachusetts whose father
emigrated from Czechoslovakia, met in Boston during the early 1970s
while she was a student at Boston University and he was a student
at UMass. They shared a love for education that soon blossomed into
romance. But during one of the most turbulent times in the city's
history, their union was not accepted by strangers and many of
their friends. Dirty looks and comments were common, they said.
Twice, they were ready to put a down payment on a house, only to be
told that someone else had bought the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because other people saw us as interracial _ it brought us
closer. It was like you and me against the world,'' said Clarence
Gaynor, 51, an administrator at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School
in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Even their parents were skeptical about their decision to get
married, he said, ``not because I was black and she was white but
what other people projected upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   They eventually moved to Brockton, Mass., where they've lived
for the past 26 years. But, although the parents taught their
children to not focus on race, Nicole says that she has not been
able to escape society's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl in school, I was always teased by
black and white kids,'' she said. ``The black kids told me I was
black and should be proud of it and that my mother was a whore, and
the white kids said my father is nothing.'' The other children
wanted her to choose between being black and white, Nicole said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sommala and Jamy Gaynor say race has not been an issue for
them and that it won't be for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to teach them to consider themselves
multiracial,'' said Gaynor. ``And we will expose them to both
religions.''
</P>
<P>
   When the children become adults, said Gaynor, they can choose
their religion, their culture, even their race. It will be up to
them, she said, to make a world for themselves.

   NEW RELEASES: ``The Harmonists'' _ This overlooked story about
entertainers during the rise of Hitler didn't get the push it
needed during its theatrical release but it's a terrific find for
those looking for a neglected film at video stores. Highlighted by
fine performances and an unsentimental story, this mix of music and
history is touchingly tough.
</P>
<P>
   A VIDEO FOR PARENTS WHO WANT TO SLEEP LATE: If the kids are
already bored with their gifts, head to the video store and hope
that ``Gulliver's Travels'' is available. Paramount, whose
animation department was overshadowed by Disney, Warner Bros., and
MGM, was responsible for one of the greatest feature-length
animated films ever made _ Dave Fleischer's adaptation of Jonathan
Swift's classic. The DVD version is astounding _ bringing out all
the brilliance of the hand-painted cels and featuring a well-done
documentary on Fleisher and the painstaking restoration process.
For adults and children alike.

IN THE HOLYLAND, A YEAR FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The world did not end.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the land of panic and prophecies, of hype and holiness,
we seem to have survived New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   And amid all the frenzy in the weeks that led up to the arrival
of the number 2000 on our calendars, digital watches, laptop
computers, and Palm Pilots, it seemed the actual event that this
round and imposing number marks was obscured by us all.
</P>
<P>
   I mean the media, specifically, and I am as guilty as the next
reporter for being lured into front-page stories with big
millennial headlines and chilling vignettes about the ``End of
Days,'' as the Book of Revelations calls the violent upheaval
prophesied to precede the return of the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations, including the Globe, also assigned seemingly
endless coverage to the whole ``Y2K bug'' scenario, deciding that
in this milestone they would focus on ways to prevent computer
viruses rather than deal with something we can't control. The
passing of time, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But in the quiet morning after, perhaps it is time to ask, ``Two
thousand years of what?'' What exactly are we measuring with this
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   wer here in the Holy Land is tangible; it is grounded in
the hills of Galilee near Nazareth and the narrow cobblestone
streets of Bethlehem and Jerusalem; it stares you in the face. It
is the history of the life of Jesus Christ, born 2,000 or so years
ago, in a grotto on a rocky, terraced hillside in the ancient town
of Bethlehem, just a five-minute drive from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   With all the live network news coverage of the ball dropping in
New York's Times Square, of standups from Britain's Royal Greenwich
Observatory, the fireworks displays at Florida's Disney World, the
glitter and champagne in Las Vegas, the sleepy town of Bethlehem
and the site where people believe Jesus was born can't hold a
candle when it comes to packaging live television.
</P>
<P>
   In advisories printed by big media organizations, the planning
was intense and meticulous for coverage of the millennium. In the
Reuters news agency's advisory, there was a menu of offerings
focused on stories about ``how the world is ready to cope with the
millennium bug.'' There were feature packages available on ``how
science, medicine, and technology have progressed through the
millennium.'' There were messages for the millennium from
``entertainers, athletes, and politicians.'' Even a poll selecting
``the personalities of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The one personality noticeably absent from the vast millennial
coverage plan was Jesus. This historical figure whose birth marks
the beginning of the calendar we use in daily life was not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true of the Globe's millennium coverage plan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is simply easier to make this celebration secular and
inclusive and part of a collective measure of time for the whole
world. We have globalized the event.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the Christian churches themselves prefer this. There
may be wisdom in a quiet, internal reflection on a faith that has
had its dark chapters in a millennium that began with the Crusades
and finished with the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But the inescapable fact is that the chronology that brings us
to 2000 derives from the Christian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian chronology was established in the 6th century AD
by Dionysius Exiguus, who was the first to mark the beginning of
the year with the birth of Jesus. This was a change in chronology
from the Julian calendar established by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, the
calendar in place during the time of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Exiguus fixed the year 1 as the birth of Jesus by dating nine
months from the Annunciation (when Mary learned she was pregnant
with Jesus), which was believed then to have been March 25. But
Exiguus miscalculated, many historians now believe, and Jesus'
birth would have taken place four to eight years earlier than
Exiguus's estimation.
</P>
<P>
   This first Christian calendar also had a built-in error that led
to losing a day every 128 years. So in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII
overhauled the calendar by lopping off 10 days and building in a
system of leap years to avert the occurrence of discrepancies. The
Gregorian calendar also restored New Year's Day to Jan. 1. Thus,
here we are today, the whole calendar more of an art than the
science of dating the exact birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The Gregorian calendar was not immediately adopted by
Christendom. England did not accept it until 1752. Some
denominations within the Eastern Orthodox Church still have not
adopted it, which explains why Greek Orthodox Christmas falls on
Jan. 6, and Armenian Orthodox Christmas on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in our modern era, the Gregorian calendar has become the
measure of time _ with some significant secular modifications. For
example, rather than marking the years as AD, or ``Anno Domini,''
which translates from the Latin as ``the year of the Lord,'' it is
now generally accepted in scholarly circles to refer to CE, or
Common Era. Similarly, BC or ``before Christ,'' is now referred to
as BCE, or ``Before the Common Era.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations officially adopted the Gregorian calendar,
and therefore it has become in effect the global standard. The
advent of computers also confirmed its place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   UN recognition of the calendar led The New York Times to
conclude last month, ``Within this context, 2000 no longer refers
to the cyclical, ritual time of a particular faith, but to the more
linear chronology of historical time.''
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion is puzzling. In other words, because the United
Nations adopted the Christian calendar it is no longer a Christian
calPerhaps this is putting too fine a point on it, but
shouldn't it be seen as, in addition to being the Christian
calendar or a ritual time for that specific faith, it also is a
universally accepted chronology of historical time. One concept
does not exclude the other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if we want to be precise in the matter, this
Christmas actually marks the 1,999th birthday of Jesus even if the
Vatican has said that it is the Jubilee celebration of 2,000 years
of Christianity. And for that matter, the official starting point
of the new millennium is not until Jan. 1, 2001, according to the
US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., the nation's official
timekeeper. But that didn't stop the media, nor the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian calendar and the turning of the year 2000 seem
perhaps more stark here in the Holy Land because there are two
other religious calendars observed, the Jewish and the Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jewish calendar, the year is 5760. Regarding the arrival
of the third millennium, Jews have ``been there, done that,'' as
Micah Halpern, an Israeli who writes the ``Onsite insights'' column
for America Online, put it in a Dec. 20 column titled ``Whose
Millennium Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims start their calendar counting at September 622 CE.
This commemorates the prophet Mohammed's exodus from Mecca and
arrival in Medina. It was there that the ``Age of Ignorance''
ended. And according to this calendar, which is lsed and has
354 days to a year, we are currently in the year 1420. So the
second millennium for Muslims is still 580 Muslim years away.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Fortin, an Assumptionist priest born in
Worcester who heads the Holy Land celebrations in Bethlehem for the
Vatican, stood in the desert expanse known as Shepherds' Field,
where it is believed that angels came 2,000 years ago and heralded
to local shepherds ``good tidings and joy'' at the coming of the
Lord in the form of the infant Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Fortin was preparing for a Christmas Eve celebration, and
stopped to make a point: ``There is so much hype with all this. The
millennium! Two thousand years. But 2,000 years of what? It seems
everyone has forgotten the origin of the calendar and that is the
birth of Jesus, which was first announced right here where you are
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have to be wary of hype and commercialism at
Christmas, but with the millennium . . . now we have to be extra
vigilant to keend what it is all about,'' Fortin said.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream denominations, Roman Catholic and Protestant, may
also bear some blame, according to Stephen O'Leary, who teaches a
course on ``The Millennium and the Media'' at the University of
Southern California, and wrote the book ``Arguing the Apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainstream Christian denominations have missed the
opportunity to present this as the 2,000th birthday for Jesus, and
as a genuine time to reflect on the faith's history,'' O'Leary
said. ``I think they feared it would be seen as a crackpot
approach, and so they missed the historic moment. They abandoned
the field to the millennial secular hype and all its hucksters. So
that is what we are stuck with now. And that is a shame.''

ICELANDERS WARY OF GENETIC RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ In this land of fire and ice, where natural
creation is still unfurling, two grand creations of the human mind
_ morality and science _ are locked in a classic
turn-of-the-millennium struggle.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a genetic research project putting the private
medical records, sophisticated DNA tests, and detailed genealogical
histories of an entire nation under the microscope _ and, more to
the point, into a massive, computerized database capable of
tracking mutant genes over centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious project represents an effort to learn all there is
to know medically about nearly every Icelander who has lived, a
search stretching back almost to the days of Leif Ericson and the
Viking Sagas. The research by Iceland's first biotechnology firm,
Decode Genetics, brainchild of a former Harvard Medical School
professor, Kari Stefansson, aims to unlock the genetic causes of
the worst diseases afflicting humankind, and possibly to find
cures.
</P>
<P>
   It is an audacious quest for the genetic grail, the
infinitesimal scraps of coding within each cell that put some
individuals at higher risk than others of developing a certain
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the undertaking represents a potentially
dangerous invasion of privacy, warning that the fusion of
genealogy, health data, and supercomputers might take medical
research into frightening Orwellian realms where Big Doctor knows
all.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland may be the best place on earth to search for the mutant
genes that make people susceptible to cancer, stroke, heart
disease, and myriad other ills. The country's 273,000 people form
the most homogenous population on earth, a gene pool hardly rippled
by new infusions since the year 1000. So the isolation of aberrant
genes, scientists hope, will be much easier to find here than in
the genetic seas of the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers for the Icelandic Cancer Society sought to
better understand breast cancer, for example, they were able to
track the arrival of a defective gene, now called BRCA2, to a 16th
century cleric named Einar.
</P>
<P>
   In other societih a search would be impossible. But in
Iceland, people can commonly trace their ancestors back 30
generations to the Norse seafarers who settled the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a society obsessed with who we are, who we were, and who
we come from,'' said Stefansson, who created Decode Genetics three
years ago with $12 million in venture capital raised mainly in the
Unates. ``We've been marrying among ourselves for 1,000
years, and we've kept very detailed records.''
</P>
<P>
   The research has turned an unaccustomed spotlight on Iceland,
whose parliament, the Althing, enacted a special law granting
Decode exclusive rights to national health records to build the
electronic database.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, perhaps, the government also granted Decode a
12-year license to market whatever discoveries come from the data,
a deal that could be worth billions of dollars. The arrangement has
drawn much angry criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even aside from the privacy issue, which we feel is the
critical issue, there is the question of why one private company is
being allowed to take so much from Iceland,'' said Tomas Zoega,
psychiatrist and chairman of the ethics committee of the Icelandic
Medical Association, which opposes certain aspects of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, this is too much about money,'' Zoega said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the controversy also seems to center on Stefansson, a
51-year-old neurologist whose piercing gaze and pale features are
as typically Icelandic as his thick wool sweater, but whose
larger-than-life flamboyance stands out among a people known for
their reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The more emotional criticisms of Stefansson seem to stem from
the fact that, in forming Decode, he has shed his skin as a
``pure'' scientist to become a corporate CEO. Decode, which was
incorporated in Delaware and will soon make its first public stock
offering in the United States, is very much a capitalist
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   But Stefansson makes no apologies for the pursuit of profits.
``Health care is a business, top to bottom,'' he said. ``What is a
doctor other than a professional selling services to the sick,
wounded, and dying? Put that way, it sounds indecent. Just as you
can make it sound indecent that this company might profit through
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefansson stressed that the company will use an advanced
computer encryption system that will prevent individual health
records in the database from becoming public. Although any
Icelander has the right to withhold records from the study, only a
few thousand have opted to do so _ and polls show a majority of
Icelanders not only support the project but are proud to be a part
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticists in the United States are following the Decode debate
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing strikes me as sinister about this research, and
there's much good that could come from it,'' said Philip R. Reilly,
clinical geneticist and director of Waltham's Eunice Kennedy
Shriver Center for Mental Retardation. ``It's just become
fashionable with the bioethics crowd to pin the word `Orwellian' on
anything related to genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the fear is that insurance companies will
misuse the fruits of genetics research to deny medical coverage to
people with ``bad'' genes. Fear in Iceland is less specific because
the country's socialized medical system makes it impossible for
anyone to be denied treatment, but it seems to stem at least partly
from the perception that Iceland is being used as a test lab for
giant multinational pharmaceutical interests.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the project, including many of Iceland's top
politicians, are excited by the medical possibilities of the
research and the potential economic spinoffs. They envision Iceland
becoming a world center for biotechnology, creating high-paying
jobs in a country far too reliant on fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with nearly 300 people working in Decode's research and
administrative building near Reykjavik, Decode employs more than
one out of every 1,000 Icelanders. Meanwhile, it has signed a $200
million contract with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Hoffman-La Roche
to identify genes that lead to a dozen deadly ailments, including
heart disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see our Iceland scientists coming back from Cambridge or
Chicago to do important research at home is exciting,'' said
Ragnheidur Haraldsdottir, deputy secretary of the national health
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Tte over Decode Genetics has been the most bitter and
extensive national controversy since Iceland gained independence
from Denmark in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Decode's detractors insist that Iceland risks turning its people
and their health histories into a commodity, like codfish, to be
bought and sold. They paint Stefansson as part slick entrepreneur,
part mad scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kari is using a great talent for salesmanship to take over a
country's medical records and exclude other scientists,'' said
Jorunn Erla Eyfjord, a prominent researcher who heads the molecular
and cell biology laboratory of the Icelandic Cancer Society. ``I
don't oppose the research. I am troubled by the scale of the Decode
project, and how this data could be misused.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the project is moving quickly even as ethicists
urge caution and more debate about the implications.
</P>
<P>
   Their pleading irks Stefansson. ``Tell a 25-year-old patient
with multiple sclerosis there is no hurry, that every moral angle
should be examined at leisure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is possible because Iceland is Europe's most remote
and northerly nation, and its historic isolation _ coupled with the
fact that many Icelanders have an interest in genealogy that
borders on obsession _ means family trees can be traced with an
ease and accuracy impossible elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Stefansson, for example, can rattle off generations of his
ancestry back to Egill Skallagrimsson, a warrior-poet born in AD
910 and one of the heroes of the Icelandic sagas, the nation's
ancient chronicles.

<P>
   What's more, almost any Icelander can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icelanders have no grand monuments, no great palaces,'' said
Thordur Kristjansson, a genealogist. ``The only thing we have had
to remind us of our past is our family memory. Our genealogy is our
monument.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Icelandic gene pool is remarkable. Most inhabitants are
descendants of the original Vikings and Gaels who planted roots
here from AD 870 to 930. Meanwhile, centuries of famine, bubonic
plague, deadly volcanic eruptions, and other disasters have so
culled the population that nearly every inhabitant is part of the
trunk, limbs, and branches of the same hardy tree.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Iceland is a highly literate society, with
vital statistics _ births, deaths, marriages _ dating back
centuries, and centralized modern medical histories kept since
1915.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Hoffman-La Roche represents one of the largest
agreements ever forged between a genetic research company and a
major drug firm. But the money involved may be peanuts compared to
what Iceland's genetic secrets may ultimately be worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iceland could become the cutting edge of a revolution in
genomics-genetic knowledge,'' said Terry McGuire, a founding
partner of Polaris Venture Partners, a Massachusetts firm that
invests in Decode. ``Obviously, we hope Decode will be profitable.
But there is also real excitement over research that could benefit
mankind.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Pentagon announced last week that it had identified the
remains of a Massachusetts man missing in action in Vietnam since
1968, Eleanor Gregory resigned herself to entering a new century
still holding a vigil for the brother she has not seen for half of
her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 66-year-old Shrewsbury, Mass. woman's emotions remain
jagged and raw. Her voice wells up as she speaks about her brother,
Russell Peter Bott, a Green Beret last seen in Laos on Dec. 2,
1966, when he was 30 years old and the father of a baby he never
had the chance to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory believes her brother may have been a prisoner of war,
and that he may still be one. But, in a way, it is Gregory who has
been a prisoner for more than three decades. She and other family
members of missing servicemen are held captive by an anguish that
for most Americans _ even those who lost loved ones _ long ago
receded to the pages of history books or family albums.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even as remains continue to be identified in Vietnam, the
dawn of the 21st century raises a question for some people who are
close to the search for MIAs and POWs: How long is too long to
suspend life for love of a missing relative?
</P>
<P>
   The wives of many MIAs have never remarried. They and other
family members have not been able to mourn and move on, and their
quest for answers costs the United States $55 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get easier _ it gets harder as it goes along,
Gregory said. ``It's been 33 years, and it's just like this all
happened yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others in her place, Gregory curses the government. And
also like others she clings to the hope that after all these years
her brother might turn up alive, perhapsfrom some jail
hidden on the outskirts of Hanoi or tucked in the depths of the
Laotian jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he alive? I have to believe he is, of course, until they
can prove further,'' Gregory said. ``Why would it seem unlikely if
(the Vietnamese) can't come up with my brother?''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century after the fall of Saigon, the search for
missing servicemen continues to be a major uing. The $55
million a year the Pentagon spends on its program with the
government of Vietnam is used to excavate grave sites, pore over
documents, and test remains at a laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The POW/MIA cause has also become a part of the American
landscape. Under Massachusetts law, every city and town must fly
the black POW/MIA flag over at least one municipal building and at
every police and fire station. It is the only flag other than the
Stars and Stripes ever flown over the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the results have been slow. With the recent accounting for
Air olonel Robert M. Elliot, 2,031 servicemen remain on the
POW/MIA roster. The remains of another 552 have been identified and
returned to their families, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Of the men Massachusetts sent to war, the remains of 17
considered MIAs have been recovered and another 47 are still
unaccounted for, according to Maureen Dunn of Randolph, Mass.,
regional coordinator for the National League of POW/MIA Families.
Dunn said the Bay State has the highest per-capita rate of
recovered MIAs in the nation, perhaps due to the vigorous activism
of local families.
</P>
<P>
   To many families, the government's efforts are not enough to
make up for what they call years of government lies and neglect. To
critics, however, the POW/MIA issue is a bogus distraction that has
cruelly kept families in suspense and diverted money and attention
from worthier causes, such as the well-being of living Vietnam
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me most is what gets displaced by the MIA concern
_ the problems faced by the living veterans of the war,'' said
Vietnam scholar Christian G. Appy, speaking of the homelessness and
substance abuse problems that have plagued veterans. ``Some people
argue (troubled veterans) are the true missing of the war _ missing
in Amnot missing in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans dwell on the servicemen listed as POW/MIAs in
Indochina, said Appy, because the return of the missing offers a
national redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this idea that some part of us had not come home,'' he
said. ``We lost something more than a war in Vietnam _ we lost our
innocence, our youth. These POWs represented something we had left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of MIAs from Vietnam is tiny compared to World
War II or the Korean War, said Appy, who wrote ``Working Class War:
American Combat Soldiers in Vietnam.'' And estimates of the number
of MIAs on the Vietnamese side range from 200,000 to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   H. Bruce Franklin, author of ``M.I.A. or Mythmaking in
America,'' argues that all evidence suggests that there have never
been any living POWs held in Vietnam since the United States and
North Vietnam signed a peace treaty in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Still, POW/MIA family members lead suspended lives, still
waiting for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole idea has kept alive in a very cruel way for some
survivors of these dead soldiers the fraudulent hope that they may
still be alive,'' Appy said. ``It's prevented a closure that should
have happened decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing the fate of a loved one is a form of torture that
Pauline Boss, a professor of family social sciences at the
University of Minnesota, has studied for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most difficult loss of all, the loss that is never
certain, because there is grief that is essentially frozen,'' said
Boss, author of ``Ambiguous Loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cleary O'Connor, 53, of Wayland, Mass. faced such a task
when her husband, Air Force pilot Peter Cleary, disappeared over
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what it's like to have to come to your own
conclusions as time passes by,'' she said. ``You think: `I hope
he's alive.' Then: `Maybe he's alive.' `Maybe he isn't alive.'
Finally: `I guess he's dead.' It's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was able to grieve for his death after a few years, and
she eventually remarried. Many wives, however, are paralyzed by the
uncertain circumstances and can bring themselves to do neither.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, Boss said, experience depression, anger,
psychosomatic symptoms, and family conflict that can last for two
or three generations.
</P>
<P>
   Family members are brutal in their condemnation of the
government. Some single out two prominent Vietnam veterans _
Arizona Senator John McCain, who was himself a POW, and
Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Both ``sold out'' the missing
servicemen, Gregory said, when they supported the diplomatic and
trade ties the United States established with Vietnam during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry deflected such criticism in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are angry, unfortunately, because their personal
loss has not been resolved,'' he said. ``But we have in place the
most extraordinary accountability process in the history of human
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   As that process grinds forward, many parents, wives, and
children of the missing servicemen cling to the hope that they,
too, will be as lucky as Elliot's family. To them, it would make
all the difference to receive a couple of teeth or some bones. One
is Dunn, whose husband, Joseph Dunn, was shot down in the South
China Sea the same day Elliot crashed _ Valentine's Day, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I still go to bed at night and see that
25-year-old kid in a raft, saying, `Where are they? Why aren't they
coming to get me?' '' said Dunn, who never remarried. ``To get his
remains would mean as much to me as if he walked through the door
alive.''

WHY WASN'T THE PANAMA CANAL DUG DEEPER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When the Panama Canal was constructed, was it possible to cut
the channel deep enough to eliminate the locks necessary to raise
the shipsing the oceans to seek a common level?
</P>
<P>
   RC Jr., Goodyear, AZ
</P>
<P>
   A. The Panama Canal, which officially passed out of U.S. hands
Jan. 1, was an amazing feat of human science, technology, and will.
But nature also taught humans a humbling lesson there about just
how far technology and science could go.
</P>
<P>
   The first one to learn them was the man who built The Suez
Canal, Ferdinand Vicomte de Lesseps.
</P>
<P>
   Ever hear the palindrome A man a plan a canal Panama? De Lesseps
was the man with the plan. At the time, in the 1870s, experts said
Nicaragua was the better site for the Atlantic-Pacific canal. Even
though the Nicaragua route was longer, it was lower, it had lakes
that could be incorporated into the waterway and it had a more
forgiving climate in which to work. But it didn't have one thing
Panama did; a railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific, which had
been built to carry people across the isthmus to ships in the
Pacific headed up to the California Gold Rush. With the railroad,
De Lesseps was convinced that he could dig a sea level canal of
half the distance of Suez, in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Work began in 1881. Within a year the first engineer quit,
saying it was impossible. The oppressive tropical climate was more
match for the French steam shovels that had done fine in the
dry heat of Suez. The rain was torrential, 51 feet between June and
October, 1884. The Chagres River, along the chosen route, could
rise ten feet in a day, flooding out all work.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the bugs and diseases of the rain forest killed 500 men
in 1882, 2,000 in 1883, 2,400 in 1884. In 1885, 20 of every 100 new
workers brought in died of yellow fever or malaria. A headline of
the day asked ``Is M. de Lesseps a canal digger, or a grave
digger?''
</P>
<P>
   Geology was another challenge. At the highest point they had to
dig through, the Culebra Cut, only 330 feet above sea level, the
Continenide was an unstable mix of soil, sedimentary and
igneous rocks. To dig a canal to sea level, with wide and
gentle-enough slopes to avoid disastrous mudslides, the Culebra Cut
would have had to be more than three quarters of a mile wide across
the top. Two engineering reviews said a sea-level canal was
impossible. De Lesseps, by all accounts an egotist and more a
salesman than an engineer, pressed on.
</P>
<P>
   Though he relented in 1887 and announced that Gustave Eiffel
would build locks for the Panama Canal, by 1889 his company was
bankrupt. (Another good thing. Eiffel was free to build his tower.)
Construction stopped. Eight years of work in what de Lesseps had
called ``le plus belle region du monde'' had excavated 30 million
cubic yards, dug 163 feet down into the Clubbed Cut, and killed
20,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Congress quickly chartered a company to build
a sea level canal. Not through Panama but Nicaragua. A stock market
crash in 1893 quashed that plan, but President William McKinley and
his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, pressed on with the Nicaragua
plan. Once again however, Panama came up with something Nicaragua
couldn't match. In 1902 the French investors in the first effort
decided to sell their partially dug canal, maps, and equipment, for
40 centimes on the franc (sixty percent off).
</P>
<P>
   After Colombia, which controlled the isthmus, refused a $35
million offer for the land from America, the United States put a
battleship off Panama. With Roosevelt waving a big stick, the
Panamanians declared their independence from Colombia and agreed to
let the United States dig.
</P>
<P>
   But nature would not give in to the Americans any more than it
had to the French. U.S. work began in 1904, but only months later,
three quarters of the Americans working on the canal fled as yellow
fever and malaria spread. Dr. William Gorgas, a Colonel in the Army
Corps of Engineers, was brought in. He had done pioneering work
with Dr. Walter Reed in Cuba, discovering that the Stegomyia
mosquito spread yellow fever. Gorgas and Reed learned its life
cycle, eliminated its breeding habitat, and all but wiped out
yellow fever in Havana. Within a year and a half of coming to
Panama, he eliminated yellow fever and greatly reduced other
malaria and other diseases. Digging resumed in earnest in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Roosevelt and others still hadn't decided whether to
dig down to sea level, or build a canal with locks and a lake in
the middle created by damming up the Chagres River. In 1905
Roosevelt became the first U.S. President in office to leave the
country, visiting the canal project. Reminiscent of de Lesseps, he
declared that he favored a sea level canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity and power of this great nation require that we
should treat this matter in a final, masterly way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, after engineers testified that a sea level canal would
take 18 years, and a locks and lake plan only 9, Congress went for
the locks and lake plan, by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later the 50 mile-long Panama Canal opened.
</P>
<P>
   The first trip through the canal was by a cement barge, on
August 3, 1914. It was the first day of World War One.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mary in 1936 Was the first ship to big to fit. Today,
only modern supertankers are too big for the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the $25 million Woodrow Wilson paid Colombia years
later, the Panama Canal cost the United States $639 million
dollars, ($7 billion dollars today) including the $40 million paid
to the French. For perspective, the U.S. had spent a total of $75
million for the Louisiana Territory, Florida, California, New
Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   It created a nation, and helped the world learn how to fight two
scourge diseases. (Gorgas went on to head the Army Medical Service
in World War I, and was knighted).
</P>
<P>
   It is a monument to the power of science, technology, and human
ego. The fact that it is not at sea level, and that it cost 25,000
lives, testify to the fact that science and technology and human
will have their limits.

PUSH BUILDS FOR CRACKDOWN ON WEB THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the weeks after his stepdaughter, Amy Boyer, was killed by a
stalker she barely knew who detailed his plans on a Web page, Tim
Remsburg figured the odds of anyone else facing such a bizarre
crime were ``like winning the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though, Remsburg has taken his family's story
public, and drawn national attention from a network of people who
see the murder of the Nashua, N.H. woman as emblematic of a
dangerous new world. The Internet age, they say, has ushered in a
spectrum of threatening activity that service providers are not
willing to monitor, and law enforcement is not prepared to address.
</P>
<P>
   As Remsburg prepares to file lawsuits against various Internet
businesses he insists assisted his -old stepdaughter's
killer, he has found a deep vein of support from Internet safety
advocates who hope Boyer's murder will draw more attention to gaps
in accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yahoo and Tripod had reviewed (Liam Youens's) page two
years ago, . . . the Remsburgs would be having a very merry
Christmas. If the people who run the Net don't start taking
responsibility now, laws are going to get passed whether they want
them or not,'' said Jayne Hitchcock, who began pushing for the
passage of federal and state cyberstalking laws after a
correspondent flooded newsgroups with messages designed to harrass
her.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Internet crime resonated particularly with Vice
President Al Gore, who this year commissioned a study on
``cyberstalking'' and went out of his way to mh Remsburg and
his wife during a campaign trip to New Hampshire. The report Gore
commissioned, which was released in August by US Attorney General
Janet Reno's office, concluded that most law enforcement agencies
do not recognize the seriousness of on-line threats, and in some
cases, ``victims have been told . . . simply to turn their
computers off.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the incidence of on-line threats appears to be
rising. Twenty percent of the cases handled by the Manhattan
district attorney's Sex Crimes Unit involve cyberstalking, as do 20
percent of Los Angeles disttorney's Stalking and Threat
Assessment Unit, the report said. Hitchcock, who advises victims of
on-line crime through her Web site, said that although on-line
harassment was rare when she first raised the issue three years
ago, she now gets 100 complaints every week.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has included e-mail in its stalking statute since
1997, but Kurt Schwartz, deputy chief of the Massachusetts attorney
general's criminal bureau, said the four State Police officers in
his computer crimes division have trouble keeping up with all the
complaints referred to them by local police departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at law enforcement five years from now, you're
going to find a lot of resources. Right now, we're behind,''
Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists who have worked with e-mail threats say Internet
techhas changed the nature of crime by giving criminals a
new tool before police are ready to catch up. And the anonymity
available on the Web also has created a new criminal personality,
with people more willing to act impulsively than they would in
real-life, face-to-face encounters, said one specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history of crime, there were a lot of
people who didn't commit crimes in their hometowns, but when you
first get automobiles and planes, because they're mobile, they're
more apt to commit crimes, because of the veil of anonymity. And
that's what we have here,'' said Terry Gudaitis, a former CIA
criminologist now working with the Virginia-based Global Integrity
Corp., which helps private corporations handle e-mail threats and
on-line stalking cases.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said most of the complaints she received originated
from disagreements born in on-line chatrooms or newsgroups.
Hitchcock herself moved from her Maryland home to New England to
escape escalating harassment from people in an on-line newsgroup,
an experience she detailed in her upcoming book, ``The Wild, Wild
Web: Danger on Your Computer.'' At one point, her on-line
correspondent sent out a rash of e-mail that contained her address
and phone number, saying she was interested in sado-masochistic
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said one case investigated by Massachusetts Attorney
General Thomas F. Reilly's computer crimes division involved a
woman who had received e-mail from a correspondent who described
what she had purchased at a grocery store deli counter one day. The
next day, the person e-mailed her a layout of her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will do evil things much more quickly when they think
they can do it anonymously,'' he said. ``If you're sitting at home
using a screen name, it's very easy to send threats aimed at
terrorizing people a world away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wattendorf and Hitchcock also see substance in Remsburg's
personal agenda _ holding various Internet businesses responsible
for assisting Liam Youens in killing his stepdaughter. Throughout
the late summer and early fall, Youens had tracked Boyer down using
Internet-based private detectives, and narrated his progress,
chillingly, on a Web site named after his victim. On Oct. 15, 1999
Youens shot Boyers in front of the dentist's office where she
worked, and then turned the gun on himself. Remsburg first learned
of the ``Amy Boyer'' site that night, and was infuriated that the
service providers that hosted Youens's pages _ Geocities and Tripod
_ did not monitor for hate speech or death threats on the Web pages
they host.
</P>
<P>
   Although they may prohibit members from posting pornography,
hate speech, libel or threats of violence on their home pages,
Internet service providers are not required by law to search for
violations. Most providers ``do not monitor content, period,'' said
Barbara Dooley, president of the Commercial Internet Exchange, an
association of 150 Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock said it's worth pushing the companies to police
themselves voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the technology,'' she said. ``You can do it if you
really want to; it just costs money. In the long run, you'll make
it a lot safer, and we won't have to get laws passed.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the law regards Internet service providers as
closer to a telephone company than a publishing house. Earlier this
month, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that Prodigy, a
provider, could not be held liable for a 1994 incident in which
someone created accounts in the name of Alexander Lunney, now a
college student, and used those accounts to send sexually explicit
material and death threats to a local scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and
Technology in Washington, said that holding providers responsible
for content on the Web would ``tear down its basic fabric'' by
setting up a central censoring entity. With billions of Web pages
out there, systematic screening for threats on pages that can be
changed at any moment would require human intervention on a massive
scale, Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is not a book publisher. It is something new,'' said
Dooley. ``The standards of book publishing are not completely
transferable when every single person can be a publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first generation of Internet offenders is going
to jail. California this spring successfully prosecuted a
51-year-old security guard who had posted e-mail impersonating a
woman who had rejected his romantic advances. The messages included
the woman's address and said she wanted to be raped; at least six
men came to her door and said they had come to rape her. A second
defendant sent hundreds of threatening e-mails to five university
students. Both men face up to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a rapid education for Remsburg, who never took much
interest in the Internet until Boyer's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get the word out there,'' he said. ``If enough
of us band together, we can make change.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   These days, you never really drive alone. Hidden beneath the
glass-and-steel skin of a sleek sedan or a boxy SUV hides a coterie
of computers that offer navigational tips, improved control and the
ability to call for assistance when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that's only the beginning of the end of your
automotive autonomy. Before long, silicon chips will decide how you
should behave on the road, or whether you should be on the road at
all. You'll be behind the wheel, but you won't really be in the
driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Crash response systems such as General Motors' OnStar hint at
where auto electronics are headed.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar links together a service center, air bags, the
satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
   When a vehicle gets into an accident, the air bag goes off, and
the electronics call a dispatcher. If the occupants are OK, they
can end the drill and drive away. If they're hurt or unable to
respond, the dispatcher notifies the nearest emergency crew using
signals from the GPS unit to guide rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, perhaps, but not good enough for Ray
Resendes, program manager of the Department of Transportation's
two-year-old Intelligent Vehicle Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are killed in auto accidents each
year. And driving isn't getting easier. Roads are becoming
increasingly crowded and drivers more distracted by built-in cell
phones, faxes, TV sets and, coming sooner than you think,
voice-activated PCs with full Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Under these conditions, it is all too easy for drivers to drift
out of their lanes or follow too closely. So one of the Intelligent
Vehicle Initiative's goals is to help bring to market affordable
collision warning systems, using radar or laser-based ranging
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of trucks and buses are already equipped with
primitive versions that warn drivers with beeps or flashing lights
when they approach traffic too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers a more sophisticated system called
``proximity controlled cruising'' that kicks in when cruise control
is switched on. It can preempt tailgating by easing off the gas or
applying the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more watchful systems are beginning to show up. One
incorporates a pair of motion sensors _ a yaw-rate sensor that
monitors how much the car is diverging from a nice tight turn, and
a lateral-acceleration sensor that monitors the car's sideways
motions. They are linked to the suspension, steering, antilock
braking and traction-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   A computer chews on the data, then determines whether the car is
heading where the driver wants it to go. If not, the computer cuts
back on the gas and activates individual brakes to tame the car's
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Limited stability-control systems are already mounted on many
Cadillacs Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous researchers, including Jay Jakubczak, manager of Sandia
National Laboratories' Intelligent Micromachine Department, are
working on cheaper versions that could make the systems affordable
on all cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jakubczak sees no reason why computers shouldn't take over more
of the driving: ``If (the computer) says, `Hey, we're about to go
into a spin,' it can send power to different wheels, or brake
wheels, or reduce speed, or even steer to prevent that from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendes looks forward to what he antiseptically calls ``roadway
departure prevention systems,'' embedded electronics that keep a
car on the straight and narrow even when drunk, sleepy, inept or
bored drivers lose track of where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are developing video-based systems that scan
road markings and process them through pattern-recognition software
to warn drivers when they're straying.
</P>
<P>
   Although automakers are very reluctant to let computers take
over completely, a prototype auto developed at Carnegie Mellon
University follows lane markers handily without human assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have
identified a way to determine alertness by measuring droopy
eyelids. Vehicles may one day incorporate dashboard cameras to scan
drivers' eyes. Too much sag and the car will rouse the driver awake
with sounds, vibrations or even scents.
</P>
<P>
   As safety-monitoring systems multiply, cars also will become
easier to monitor. That sounds like a good idea to Jakubczak, who
has teen-age drivers in the house. He envisions a vehicle linked by
wireless transmitters to his home computer, allowing him to monitor
the way his children use the family car. In extreme cases, he could
remotely shut the engine down.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are venturing in this direction. CarMon is a
stand-alone snoop box that attaches to an auto's interior, where
its motion sensors register and store information about
acceleration and deceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Parents or companies can dump that data onto a home computer to
graphically display aggressive, reckless or upright driving.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance systems raise so many legal, law-enforcement,
insurance and regulatory implications that Resendes cannot imagine
them becoming common. Trucking companies might like to keep tabs on
their drivers but probably wouldn't install such devices for fear
that the police could demand the electronic information after an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a sensing module in many new General Motors cars already
conducts a crude type of surveillance, recording the speed of a
car, whether the driver has applied the brakes, and whether the
driver was wearing a seat belt immediately before a crash.
</P>
<P>
   An onboard diagnostic computer already knows if your car is
polluting more than it should. That's just a step away from having
it report transgressions to environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, it's like the little black box in airplanes,''
says Allen Lyons, a manager at California's Air Resources Board.
The board is considering requiring next-generation onboard monitors
to transmit emissions data to the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons says that would be a convenience, because only dirty cars
would be summoned to an emissions inspection center.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons acknowledges the proposal raises Big Brother worries.
Who's to know if the black box isn't relaying other information,
like speed data, that could bring on a different kind of summons?
</P>
<P>
   Lyons suggests that a switch would allow an owner to activate
the transmitter only when it's time to certify a vehicle's
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Such manual controls should help calm fears, but the warm
embrace drivers have given to traction systems and active
suspensions has already let the control cat out of the bag. That
independent, open-road feeling may never be the same.

graphically display aggressive, reckless or upright driving.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance systems raise so many legal, law-enforcement,
insurance and regulatory implications that Resendes cannot imagine
them becoming common. Trucking companies might like to keep tabs on
their drivers but probably wouldn't install such devices for fear
that the police could demand the electronic information after an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a sensing module in many new General Motors cars already
conducts a crude type of surveillance, recording the speed of a
car, whether the driver has applied the brakes, and whether the
driver was wearing a seat belt immediately before a crash.
</P>
<P>
   An onboard diagnostic computer already knows if your car is
polluting more than it should. That's just a step away from having
it report transgressions to environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, it's like the little black box in airplanes,''
says Allen Lyons, a manager at California's Air Resources Board.
The board is considering requiring next-generation onboard monitors
to transmit emissions data to the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons says that would be a convenience, because only dirty cars
would be summoned to an emissions inspection center.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons acknowledges the proposal raises Big Brother worries.
Who's to know if the black box isn't relaying other information,
like speed data, that could bring on a different kind of summons?
</P>
<P>
   Lyons suggests that a switch would allow an owner to activate
the transmitter only when it's time to certify a vehicle's
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Such manual controls should help calm fears, but the warm
embrace drivers have given to traction systems and active
suspensions has already let the control cat out of the bag. That
independent, open-road feeling may never be the same.

<P>
   These days, you never really drive alone. Hidden beneath the
glass-and-steel skin of a sleek sedan or a boxy SUV hides a coterie
of computers that offer navigational tips, improved control and the
ability to call for assistance when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that's only the beginning of the end of your
automotive autonomy. Before long, silicon chips will decide how you
should behave on the road, or whether you should be on the road at
all. You'll be behind the wheel, but you won't really be in the
driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Crash response systems such as General Motors' OnStar hint at
where auto electronics are headed.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar links together a service center, air bags, the
satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
   When a vehicle gets into an accident, the air bag goes off, and
the electronics call a dispatcher. If the occupants are OK, they
can end the drill and drive away. If they're hurt or unable to
respond, the dispatcher notifies the nearest emergency crew using
signals from the GPS unit to guide rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, perhaps, but not good enough for Ray
Resendes, program manager of the Department of Transportation's
two-year-old Intelligent Vehicle Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are killed in auto accidents each
year. And driving isn't getting easier. Roads are becoming
increasingly crowded and drivers more distracted by built-in cell
phones, faxes, TV sets and, coming sooner than you think,
voice-activated PCs with full Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Under these conditions, it is all too easy for drivers to drift
out of their lanes or follow too closely. So one of the Intelligent
Vehicle Initiative's goals is to help bring to market affordable
collision warning systems, using radar or laser-based ranging
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of trucks and buses are already equipped with
primitive versions that warn drivers with beeps or flashing lights
when they approach traffic too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers a more sophisticated system called
``proximity controlled cruising'' that kicks in when cruise control
is switched on. It can preempt tailgating by easing off the gas or
applying the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more watchful sare beginning to show up. One
incorporates a pair of motion sensors _ a yaw-rate sensor that
monitors how much the car is diverging nice tight turn, and
a lateral-acceleration sensor that monitors the car's sideways
motions. They are linked to the suspension, steering, antilock
braking and traction-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   A computer chews on the data, then determines whether the car is
heading where the driver wants it to go. If not, the computer cuts
back on the gas and activates individual brakes to tame the car's
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Limited stability-control systems are already mounted on many
Cadillacs Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous researchers, including Jay Jakubczak, manager of Sandia
National Laboratories' Intelligent Micromachine Department, are
working on cheaper versions that could m systems affordable
on all cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jakubczak sees no reason why computers shouldn't take over more
of the driving: ``If (the computer) says, `Hey, we're about to go
into a spin,' it can send power to different wheels, or brake
wheels, or reduce speed, or even steer to prevent that from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendes looks forward to what he antiseptically calls ``roadway
departure prevention systems,'' embedded electronics that keep a
car on the straight and narrow even when drunk, sleepy, inept or
bored drivers lose track of where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are developing video-based systems that scan
road markings and process them through pattern-recognition software
to warn drivers when they're straying.
</P>
<P>
   Although automakers are very reluctant to let computers take
over completely, a prototype auto developed at Carnegie Mellon
University follows lane markers handily without human assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have
identified a way to determine alertness by measuring droopy
eyelids. Vehicles may one day incorporate dashboard cameras to scan
drivers' eyes. Too much sag and the car will rouse the driver awake
with sounds, vibrations or even scents.
</P>
<P>
   As safety-monitoring systems multiply, cars also will become
easier to monitor. That sounds like a good idea to Jakubczak, who
has teen-age drivers in the house. He envisions a vehicle linked by
wireless transmitters to his home computer, allowing him to monitor
the way his children use the family car. In extreme cases, he could
remotely shut the engine down.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are venturing in this direction. CarMon is a
stand-alone snoop box that attaches to an auto's interior, where
its motion sensors register and store information about
acceleration and deceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Parents or companies can dump that data onto a home computer to
graphically display aggressive, reckless or upright driving.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance systems raise so many legal, law-enforcement,
insurance and regulatory implications that Resendes cannot imagine

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Pentagon announced last week that it had identified the
remains of a Massachusetts man missing in action in Vietnam since
1968, Eleanor Gregory resigned herself to entering a new century
still holding a vigil for the brother she has not seen for half of
her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 66-year-old Shrewsbury, Mass. woman's emotions remain
jagged and raw. Her voice wells up as she speaks about her brother,
Russell Peter Bott, a Green Beret last seen in Laos on Dec. 2,
1966, when he was 30 years old and the father of a baby he never
had the chance to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory believes her brother may have been a prisoner of war,
and that he may still be one. But, in a way, it is Gregory who has
been a prisoner for more than three decades. She and other family
members of missing servicemen are held captive by an anguish that
for most Americans _ even those who lost loved ones _ long ago
receded to the pages of history books or family albums.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even as remains continue to be identified in Vietnam, the
dawn of the 21st century raises a question for some people who are
close to the search for MIAs and POWs: How long is too long to
suspend life for love of a missing relative?
</P>
<P>
   The wives of many MIAs have never remarried. They and other
family members have not been able to mourn and move on, and their
quest for answers costs the United States $55 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get easier _ it gets harder as it goes along,
Gregory said. ``It's been 33 years, and it's just like this all
happened yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others in her place, Gregory curses the government. And
also like others she clings to the hope that after all these years
her brother might turn up alive, perhaps freed from some jail
hidden on the outskirts of Hanoi or tucked in the depths of the
Laotian jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he alive? I have to believe he is, of course, until they
can prove further,'' Gregory said. ``Why would it seem unlikely if
(the Vietnamese) can't come up with my brother?''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century after the fall of Saigon, the search for
missing servicemen continues to be a major undertaking. The $55
million a year the Pentagon spends on its program with the
government of Vietnam is used to excavate grave sites, pore over
documents, and test remains at a laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The POW/MIA cause has also become a part of the American
landscape. Under Massachusetts law, every city and town must fly
the black POW/MIA flag over at least one municipal building and at
every police and fire station. It is the only flag other than the
Stars and Stripes ever flown over the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the results have been slow. With the recent accounting for
Air Force Colonel Robert M. Elliot, 2,031 servicemen remain on the
POW/MIA roster. The remains of another 552 have been identified and
returned to their families, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Of the men Massachusetts sent to war, the remains of 17
considered MIAs have been recovered and another 47 are still
unaccounted for, according to Maureen Dunn of Randolph, Mass.,
regional coordinator for the National League of POW/MIA Families.
Dunn said the Bay State has the highest per-capita rate of
recovered MIAs in the nation, perhaps due to the vigorous activism
of local families.
</P>
<P>
   To many families, the government's efforts are not enough to
make up for what they call years of government lies and neglect. To
critics, however, the POW/MIA issue is a bogus distraction that has
cruelly kept families in suspense and diverted money and attention
from worthier causes, such as the well-being of living Vietnam
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me most is what gets displaced by the MIA concern
_ the problems faced by the living veterans of the war,'' said
Vietnam scholar Christian G. Appy, speaking of the homelessness and
substance abuse problems that have plagued veterans. ``Some people
argue (troubled veterans) are the true missing of the war _ missing
in America, not missing in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans dwell on the servicemen listed as POW/MIAs in
Indochina, said Appy, because the return of the missing offers a
national redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this idea that some part of us had not come home,'' he
said. ``We lost something more than a war in Vietnam _ we lost our
innocence, our youth. These POWs represented something we had left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of MIAs from Vietnam is tiny compared to World
War II or the Korean War, said Appy, who wrote ``Working Class War:
American Combat Soldiers in Vietnam.'' And estimates of the number
of MIAs on the Vietnamese side range from 200,000 to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   H. Bruce Franklin, author of ``M.I.A. or Mythmaking in
America,'' argues that all evidence suggests that there have never
been any living POWs held in Vietnam since the United States and
North Vietnam signed a peace treaty in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Still, POW/MIA family members lead suspended lives, still
waiting for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole idea has kept alive in a very cruel way for some
survivors of these dead soldiers the fraudulent hope that they may
still be alive,'' Appy said. ``It's prevented a closure that should
have happened decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing the fate of a loved one is a form of torture that
Pauline Boss, a professor of family social sciences at the
University of Minnesota, has studied for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most difficult loss of all, the loss that is never
certain, because there is grief that is essentially frozen,'' said
Boss, author of ``Ambiguous Loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cleary O'Connor, 53, of Wayland, Mass. faced such a task
when her husband, Air Force pilot Peter Cleary, disappeared over
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what it's like to have to come to your own
conclusions as time passes by,'' she said. ``You think: `I hope
he's alive.' Then: `Maybe he's alive.' `Maybe he isn't alive.'
Finally: `I guess he's dead.' It's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was able to grieve for his death after a few years, and
she eventually remarried. Many wives, however, are paralyzed by the
uncertain circumstances and can bring themselves to do neither.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, Boss said, experience depression, anger,
psychosomatic symptoms, and family conflict that can last for two
or three generations.
</P>
<P>
   Family members are brutal in their condemnation of the
government. Some single out two prominent Vietnam veterans _
Arizona Senator John McCain, who was himself a POW, and
Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Both ``sold out'' the missing
servicemen, Gregory said, when they supported the diplomatic and
trade ties the United States established with Vietnam during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry deflected such criticism in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are angry, unfortunately, because their personal
loss has not been resolved,'' he said. ``But we have in place the
most extraordinary accountability process in the history of human
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   As that process grinds forward, many parents, wives, and
children of the missing servicemen cling to the hope that they,
too, will be as lucky as Elliot's family. To them, it would make
all the difference to receive a couple of teeth or some bones. One
is Dunn, whose husband, Joseph Dunn, was shot down in the South
China Sea the same day Elliot crashed _ Valentine's Day, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I still go to bed at night and see that
25-year-old kid in a raft, saying, `Where are they? Why aren't they
coming to get me?' '' said Dunn, who never remarried. ``To get his
remains would mean as much to me as if he walked through the door
alive.''

THE TALENTED FOLKS AT BLACK LIZARD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mysteries have always offered readers a vicarious walk on the
wild side. Edgar Allan Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle would take us on
a guided tour of the underworld, and their alter egos, Dupin and
Sherlock Holmes, would lead us back to a world where crime always
had its punishment. But the 20th-century crime novel, at its best,
leaves the reader with no such return ticket to safety. Instead,
Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler gave us existential
meditations on morality; Jim Thompson takes an immoral universe as
a given.
</P>
<P>
   It's to this genre of writing that Anthony Minghella's movie
adaptation of ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' belongs. On its own terms
it's an excellent film, maybe even worth the Oscar (though the
Academy is always inclined to walk on the safer, more uplifting
side of the street). Despite the intelligence of his adaptation,
however, Minghella's terms are not those of Patricia Highsmith, the
undervalued writer of the novel. She didn't like the movies made of
her novels _ which included Alfred Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a
Train'' (adapted by Chandler); Rene Clement's ``Purple Noon'' (also
based on ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''); and Wim Wenders's ``The
American Friend'' (based on a sequel, ``Ripley's Game''). Minghella
comes closer than his illustrious predecessors to capturing the
seductive logic of evil, but still, chances are that Highsmith will
be turning in her four-year-old grave at the compromises and
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Minghella's movie, though, is cause for celebration _ not only
because it uses the filmmaker's art to create an elaborate
fictional world (out of the glow of Italian sunshine and the
jazz-inflected dark side of the 1950s) but also because it will
inevitably lead some readers to discover Highsmith's richer,
subtler psychopathology. It may also lead them to the publishing
enterprise that has reissued all five of the Ripley books,
Vintage's delectable Black Lizard paperback series.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage began reprinting the masters _ Chandler, Hammett, James
M. Cain _ under the banner of Vintage Crime in 1989. When the
editor in charge of the series, Edward Kastenmeier, looked into the
rights for Thompson's books, he found they were owned by Black
Lizard and ``in order to acquire Jim Thompson we bought the whole
Black Lizard line _ hook, line, and sinker _ which also included
writers like Charles Willeford and David Goodis.''
</P>
<P>
   With the elegant Ross Macdonald and Chester Himes in tow (Himes
was the author of the Harlem series of crime fiction in which the
police can be more dangerous than the thieves), Kastenmeier went on
the search for more contemporary thrills _ Michael Dibdin's Aurelio
Zen Italian mysteries, Maj Sjowall's and Per Wahloo's Martin Beck
series from Sweden; Andrew Vachss's nails-for-breakfast
investigator Burke; and Highsmith's equally intriguing soul mate,
Ruth Rendell. Black Lizard will publish two of Rendell's creepiest
books, ``A Judgement in Stone'' and ``A Demon in My View,'' this
month , and is taking on her frontlist as well as her backlist,
starting with ``Harm Done,'' the latest of her Inspector Wexford
mysteries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A shiver runs through it &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that unites the Black Lizard writers is that they are
as noir as noir can be. (Although even in this company, everyone
looks like Steve Forbes or Dr. Laura next to Thompson. Stanley
Kubrick said that Thompson's ``The Killer Inside Me'' was
``probably the most chilling and believable first-person story of a
criminally warped mind I have ever encountered.'') The other common
feature is that they have the feel of first-class modernist
literature, a quality underscored by the artful packaging that
gives them the look and heft of the Vintage International series,
home to the likes of Vladimir Nabokov, William Faulkner, and
Guenter Grass, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't go as far as the genre's champions and put the
mystery and crime writers in the same class _ the form boxes them
in more than it frees them _ but at their best they come awfully
close. As Chandler says of Hammett in his essay ``The Simple Art of
Murder,'' which is part of the series: ``He demonstrated that the
detective story can be important writing. `The Maltese Falcon' may
or may not be a work of genius, but an art which is capable of it
is not `by hypothesis' incapable of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Dibdin's explanation of the title to his ``Ratking,'' with
all of its chilling metaphorical possibilities _ ``A ratking is
what happens when too many rats have to live in too small a space
under too much pressure. Their tails become entwined and the more
they stretch and strain to free themselves the tighter grows the
knot binding them, until at last it becomes a solid mass of
embedded tissue.'' Not exactly Agatha Christie.
</P>
<P>
   Or take this dialogue between Macdonald's detective Lew Archer
and a sociology student he's interviewing in 1961's ``The Wycherly
Woman.'' She asks him: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `` `Is it the parents or the children who are responsible for j.
d.? I can't make up my quote mind unquote.' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `` `I wish you'd stop saying that about your quote mind
unquote.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Is it boring? My apologies. Do you blame the parents or the
child?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `I don't blame anybody, if you want an honest answer. I think
blame is one of the things we have to get rid of. When children
blame their parents for what's happened to them, or parents blame
their children for what they've done, it's part of the problem, and
it makes the problem worse. People should take a close look at
themselves. Blaming is the opposite of that.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bit simplistic, perhaps, in terms of causality, but good
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Black Lizard will publish Dan Fesperman's ``Lie
in the Dark.'' Much of contemporary crime fiction deals with the
futility of catching criminals in the midst of so much evil.
Imagine how Fesperman's detective, Vlado Petric, feels. His beat is
war-torn Yugoslavia, and all his friends think he's a fool to be
``plumbing toilets in the midst of a flood.'' Often he agrees. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making skin crawl &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But of all the writers, the ones who get under the skin, like
the best of contemporary writers in any genre, are Highsmith and
Rendell. Highsmith _ who was born in Texas in 1921, but lived in
Europe, where she was more appreciated _ hated being thought of as
a suspense writer. Perhaps because she and Rendell aren't
responding to testosteronic hyperbole, they are freer than their
male counterparts to go into less-explored psychological terrain.
(It may also have something to do with the fact that Highsmith's
mother tried to abort her by drinking turpentine.) Kastenmeier
isn't sure there will be more Highsmith coming from Black Lizard,
but ``Strangers on a Train'' would seem to be a natural. As good as
the movie is, Highsmith intertwines the liBruno and Guy in
ways that Hitchcock and Chandler backed away from in favor of more
conventional morality and characterization.
</P>
<P>
   That's what separates Highsmith's ``Ripley'' from Minghella's.
Without giving away the endings, Minghella's isn't nearly as
cowardly as Clement's, but he still felt it necessary to tack on a
layer of guilt that subverts the power of the novel. It's Ripley's
ability to actualize himself through murder, really, and get on
with his life that makes the first two in the series (``Ripley
Under Ground'' being the second) so chilling. Ripley pays no
apparent price and, oddly, the reader roots even harder for him
than for the Matt Damon character in the film. Writing in a clear,
spare style, Highsmith stays resolute in her determination not to
give her characters or her readers easy ways out. No wonder Graham
Greene and Gore Vidal were such fans.
</P>
<P>
   Highsmith was not Thompson, though. They both wrote crime
fiction as opposed to mysteries, but there is a central mystery in
her writing: Where is the moral center? That there is one is
evidenced by her dedication to ``Ripley Under Water'' in 1991: ``To
the dead and the dying among the Intifadeh and the Kurds, to those
who fight oppression in whatever land, and stand up not only to be
counted but to be shot.'' But try finding anything that unambiguous
in her texts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's Highsmith's ability to make us see the Ripley
within ourselves that makes her such a compelling writer. One of
the negative results of the movie is that Arthur Tress's creepy
matte cover of a faceless Ripley (it's in keeping with the rest of
the series) has been replaced with a glossy collage of Damon, Jude
Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow. It is always somewhat troubling to have
television or the movies replace the images that we come up with
ourselves in reading a book, but more so here. If we look closer at
Tress's Ripley photos, instead of seeing Damon we might see
ourselves. (The first three Ripleys have also just been published
in one hardback volume by Everyman.)
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, too, describes a frighteningly ambiguous moral
universe. ``Evil was a stupid word,'' she says in ``Fatal
Inversion,'' written under the alias of Barbara Vine. Her Inspector
Wexford novels are a cut above P. D. James's Dalgliesh and a cut
below Colin Dexter's Morse, though the plot dealing with his
assistant, Mike Burden in ``No More Dying Then'' is exceptional.
Most detectives are, in fact, the moral center of their authors'
writing, so it's in her non-Wexford books that Rendell's eerier
voice shines.
</P>
<P>
   Take the first sentences of ``A Judgement in Stone:'' ``Eunice
Parchman killed the Coverdale family because she could not read or
write. There was no real motive and no premeditation. No money was
gained and no security.'' As in Highsmith books, the randomness of
life is a recurring, haunting theme.
</P>
<P>
   If Highsmith and Rendell offer no easy psychological motivation
or conventional moral resolution, neither do they revel in chaos.
We shudder not in escapism, but in confrontation with reality. They
reflect our world too frighteningly. What Julian Symons says about
Highsmith in the recently published ``Oxford Companion to Crime
Mystery and Writing'' applies to Rendell as well: ``She has also
been, without intending it, a prophet. The terrors and delusions
driving her psychopaths to violent action are the ones we see
enacted now in the apparently motiveless crimes recorded in our
daily newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   For the latest variations, turn back to the news section. But
for a creepier context of today's violence, pick up a novel by
Highsmith or Rendell.

A TOUGH TALE OF HITLER'S RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Harmonists'' _ This overlooked story about
entertainers during the rise of Hitler didn't get the push it
needed during its theatrical release but it's a terrific find for
those looking for a neglected film at video stores. Highlighted by
fine performances and an unsentimental story, this mix of music and
history is touchingly tough.
</P>
<P>
   A VIDEO FOR PARENTS WHO WANT TO SLEEP LATE: If the kids are
already bored with their gifts, head to the video store and hope
that ``Gulliver's Travels'' is available. Paramount, whose
animation department was overshadowed by Disney, Warner Bros., and
MGM, was responsible for one of the greatest feature-length
animated films ever made _ Dave Fleischer's adaptation of Jonathan
Swift's classic. The DVD version is astounding _ bringing out all
the brilliance of the hand-painted cels and featuring a well-done
documentary on Fleisher and the painstaking restoration process.
For adults and children alike.

IN THE HOLYLAND, A YEAR FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The world did not end.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the land of panic and prophecies, of hype and holiness,
we seem to have survived New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   And amid all the frenzy in the weeks that led up to the arrival
of the number 2000 on our calendars, digital watches, laptop
computers, and Palm Pilots, it seemed the actual event that this
round and imposing number marks was obscured by us all.
</P>
<P>
   I mean the media, specifically, and I am as guilty as the next
reporter for being lured into front-page stories with big
millennial headlines and chilling vignettes about the ``End of
Days,'' as the Book of Revelations calls the violent upheaval
prophesied to precede the return of the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations, including the Globe, also assigned seemingly
endless coverage to the whole ``Y2K bug'' scenario, deciding that
in this milestone they would focus on ways to prevent computer
viruses rather than deal with something we can't control. The
passing of time, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But in the quiet morning after, perhaps it is time to ask, ``Two
thousand years of what?'' What exactly are we measuring with this
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   The answer here in the Holy Land is tangible; it is grounded in
the hills of Galilee near Nazareth and the narrow cobblestone
streets of Bethlehem and Jerusalem; it stares you in the face. It
is the history of the life of Jesus Christ, born 2,000 or so years
ago, in a grotto on a rocky, terraced hillside in the ancient town
of Bethlehem, just a five-minute drive from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   With all the live network news coverage of the ball dropping in
New York's Times Square, of standups from Britain's Royal Greenwich
Observatory, the fireworks displays at Florida's Disney World, the
glitter and champagne in Las Vegas, the sleepy town of Bethlehem
and the site where people believe Jesus was born can't hold a
candle when it comes to packaging live television.
</P>
<P>
   In advisories printed by big media organizations, the planning
was intense and meticulous for coverage of the millennium. In the
Reuters news agency's advisory, there was a menu of offerings
focused on stories about ``how the world is ready to cope with the
millennium bug.'' There were feature packages available on ``how
science, medicine, and technology have progressed through the
millennium.'' There were messages for the millennium from
``entertainers, athletes, and politicians.'' Even a poll selecting
``the personalities of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The one personality noticeably absent from the vast millennial
coverage plan was Jesus. This historical figure whose birth marks
the beginning of the calendar we use in daily life was not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true of the Globe's millennium coverage plan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is simply easier to make this celebration secular and
inclusive and part of a collective measure of time for the whole
world. We have globalized the event.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the Christian churches themselves prefer this. There
may be wisdom in a quiet, internal reflection on a faith that has
had its dark chapters in a millennium that began with the Crusades
and finished with the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But the inescapable fact is that the chronology that brings us
to 2000 derives from the Christian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian chronology was established in the 6th century AD
by Dionysius Exiguus, who was the first to mark the beginning of
the year with the birth of Jesus. This was a change in chronology
from the Julian calendar established by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, the
calendar in place during the time of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Exiguus fixed the year 1 as the birth of Jesus by dating nine
months from the Annunciation (when Mary learned she was pregnant
with Jesus), which was believed then to have been March 25. But
Exiguus miscalculated, many historians now believe, and Jesus'
birth would have taken place four to eight years earlier than
Exiguus's estimation.
</P>
<P>
   This first Christian calendar also had a built-in error that led
to losing a day every 128 years. So in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII
overhauled the calendar by lopping off 10 days and building in a
system of leap years to avert the occurrence of discrepancies. The
Gregorian calendar also restored New Year's Day to Jan. 1. Thus,
here we are today, the whole calendar more of an art than the
science of dating the exact birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The Gregorian calendar was not immediately adopted by
Christendom. England did not accept it until 1752. Some
denominations within the Eastern Orthodox Church still have not
adopted it, which explains why Greek Orthodox Christmas falls on
Jan. 6, and Armenian Orthodox Christmas on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in our modern era, the Gregorian calendar has become the
measure of time _ with some significant secular modifications. For
example, rather than marking the years as AD, or ``Anno Domini,''
which translates from the Latin as ``the year of the Lord,'' it is
now generally accepted in scholarly circles to refer to CE, or
Common Era. Similarly, BC or ``before Christ,'' is now referred to
as BCE, or ``Before the Common Era.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations officially adopted the Gregorian calendar,
and therefore it has become in effect the global standard. The
advent of computers afirmed its place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   UN recognition of the calendar led The New York Times to
conclude last month, ``Within this context, 2000 no longer refers
to the cyclical, ritual time of a particular faith, but to the more
linear chronology of historical time.''
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion is puzzling. In other words, because the United
Nations adopted the Christian calendar it is no longer a Christian
calendar? Perhaps this is putting too fine a point on it, but
shouldn't it be seen as, in addition to being the Christian
calendar or a ritual time for that specific faith, it also is a
universally accepted chronology of historical time. One concept
does not exclude the other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if we want to be precise in the matter, this
Christmas actually marks the 1,999th birthday of Jesus even if the
Vatican has said that it is the Jubilee celebration of 2,000 years
of Christianity. And for that matter, the official starting point
of the new millennium is not until Jan. 1, 2001, according to the
US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., the nation's official
timekeeper. But that didn't stop the media, nor the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian calendar and the turning of the year 2000 seem
perhaps more stark here in the Holy Land because there are two
other religious calendars observed, the Jewish and the Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jewish calendar, the year is 5760. Regarding the arrival
of the third millennium, Jews have ``been there, at,'' as
Micah Halpern, an Israeli who writes the ``Onsite insights'' column
for America Online, put it in a Dec. 20 column titled ``Whose
Millennium Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims start their calendar counting at September 622 CE.
This commemorates the prophet Mohammed's exodus from Mecca and
arrival in Medina. It was there that the ``Age of Ignorance''
ended. And according to this calendar, which is lunar-based and has
354 days to a year, we are currently in the year 1420. So the
second millennium for Muslims is still 580 Muslim years away.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Fortin, an Assumptionist priest born in
Worcester who heads the Holy Land celebrations in Bethlehem for the
Vatican, stood in the desert expanse known as Shepherds' Field,
where it is believed that angels came 2,000 years ago and heralded
to local shepherds ``good tidings and joy'' at the coming of the
Lord in the form of the infant Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Fortin was preparing for a Christmas Eve celebration, and
stopped to make a point: ``There is so much hype with all this. The
millennium! Two thousand years. But 2,000 years of what? It seems
everyone has forgotten the origin of the calendar and that is the
birth of Jesus, which was first announced right here where you are
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have to be wary of hype and commercialism at
Christmas, but with the millennium . . . now we have to be extra
vigilant to keep in mind what it is all about,'' Fortin said.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream denominations, Roman Catholic and Protestant, may
also bear some blame, according to Stephen O'Leary, who teaches a
course on ``The Millennium and the Media'' at the University of
Southern California, and wrote the book ``Arguing the Apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainstream Christian denominations have missed the
opportunity to present this as the 2,000th birthday for Jesus, and
as a genuine time to reflect on the faith's history,'' O'Leary
said. ``I think they feared it would be seen as a crackpot
approach, and so they missed the historic moment. They abandoned
the field to the millennial secular hype and all its hucksters. So
that is what we are stuck with now. And that is a shame.''

WHY WASN'T THE PANAMA CANAL DUG DEEPER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When the Panama Canal was constructed, was it possible to cut
the channel deep enough to eliminate the locks necessary to raise
the ships, allowing the oceans to seek a common level?
</P>
<P>
   RC Jr., Goodyear, AZ
</P>
<P>
   A. The Panama Canal, which officially passed out of U.S. hands
Jan. 1, was an amazing feat of human science, technology, and will.
But nature also taught humans a humbling lesson there about just
how far technology and science could go.
</P>
<P>
   The first one to learn them was the man who built The Suez
Canal, Ferdinand Vicomte de Lesseps.
</P>
<P>
   Ever hear the palindrome A man a plan a canal Panama? De Lesseps
was the man with the plan. At the time, in the 1870s, experts said
Nicaragua was the better site for the Atlantic-Pacific canal. Even
though the Nicaragua route was longer, it was lower, it had lakes
that could be incorporated into the waterway and it had a more
forgiving climate in which to work. But it didn't have one thing
Panama did; a railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific, which had
been built to carry people across the isthmus to ships in the
Pacific headed up to the California Gold Rush. With the railroad,
De Lesseps was convinced that he could dig a sea level canal of
half the distance of Suez, in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Work began in 1881. Within a year the first engineer quit,
saying it was impossible. The oppressive tropical climate was more
than a match for the French steam shovels that had done fine in the
dry heat of Suez. The rain was torrential, 51 feet between June and
October, 1884. The Chagres River, along the chosen route, could
rise ten feet in a day, flooding out all work.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the bugs and diseases of the rain forest killed 500 men
in 1882, 2,000 in 1883, 2,400 in 1884. In 1885, 20 of every 100 new
workers brought in died of yellow fever or malaria. A headline of
the day asked ``Is M. de Lesseps a canal digger, or a grave
digger?''
</P>
<P>
   Geology was another challenge. At the highest point they had to
dig through, the Culebra Cut, only 330 feet above sea level, the
Continental Divide was an unstable mix of soil, sedimentary and
igneous rocks. To dig a canal to sea level, with wide and
gentle-enough slopes to avoid disastrous mudslides, the Culebra Cut
would have had to be more than three quarters of a mile wide across
the top. Two engineering reviews said a sea-level canal was
impossible. De Lesseps, by all accounts an egotist and more a
salesman than an engineer, pressed on.
</P>
<P>
   Though he relented in 1887 and announced that Gustave Eiffel
would build locks for the Panama Canal, by 1889 his company was
bankrupt. (Another good thing. Eiffel was free to build his tower.)
Construction stopped. Eight years of work in what de Lesseps had
called ``le plus belle region du monde'' had excavated 30 million
cubic yards, dug 163 feet down into the Clubbed Cut, and killed
20,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Congress quickly chartered a company to build
a sea level canal. Not through Panama but Nicaragua. A stock market
crash in 1893 quashed that plan, but President William McKinley and
his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, pressed on with the Nicaragua
plan. Once again however, Panama came up with something Nicaragua
couldn't match. In 1902 the French investors in the first effort
decided to sell their partially dug canal, maps, and equipment, for
40 centimes on the franc (sixty percent off).
</P>
<P>
   After Colombia, which controlled the isthmus, refused a $35
million offer for the land from America, the United States put a
battleship off Panama. With Roosevelt waving a big stick, the
Panamanians declared their independence from Colombia and agreed to
let the United States dig.
</P>
<P>
   But nature would not give in to the Americans any more than it
had to the French. U.S. work began in 1904, but only months later,
three quarters of the Americans working on the canal fled as yellow
fever and malaria spread. Dr. William Gorgas, a Colonel in the Army
Corps of Engineers, was brought in. He had done pioneering work
with Dr. Walter Reed in Cuba, discovering that the Stegomyia
mosquito spread yellow fever. Gorgas and Reed learned its life
cycle, eliminated its breeding habitat, and all but wiped out
yellow fever in Havana. Within a year and a half of coming to
Panama, he eliminated yellow fever and greatly reduced other
malaria and other diseases. Digging resumed in earnest in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Roosevelt and others still hadn't decided whether to
dig down to sea level, or build a canal with locks and a lake in
the middle created by damming up the Chagres River. In 1905
Roosevelt became the first U.S. President in office to leave the
country, visiting the canal project. Reminiscent of de Lesseps, he
declared that he favored a sea level canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity and power of this great nation require that we
should treat this matter in a final, masterly way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, after engineers testified that a sea level canal would
take 18 years, and a locks and lake plan only 9, Congress went for
the locks and lake plan, by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later the 50 mile-long Panama Canal opened.
</P>
<P>
   The first trip through the canal was by a cement barge, on
August 3, 1914. It was the first day of World War One.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mary in 1936 Was the first ship to big to fit. Today,
only modern supertankers are too big for the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the $25 million Woodrow Wilson paid Colombia years
later, the Panama Canal cost the United States $639 million
dollars, ($7 billion dollars today) including the $40 million paid
to the French. For perspective, the U.S. had spent a total of $75
million for the Louisiana Territory, Florida, California, New
Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   It created a nation, and helped the world learn how to fight two
scourge diseases. (Gorgas went on to head the Army Medical Service
in World War I, and was knighted).
</P>
<P>
   It is a monument to the power of science, technology, and human
ego. The fact that it is not at sea level, and that it cost 25,000
lives, testify to the fact that science and technology and human
will have their limits.

A 20TH-CENTURY STAR TURNS TO THE EIGHTEENTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000   The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sunny speaking voice of Cecilia Bartoli came onto the phone
from her hotel room in Frankfurt. The mezzo-soprano is probably the
most popular female classical singer before the public today, and
certainly the biggest recording star in her field, even if she has
yet to make a crossover album. Although she had sung an all-Vivaldi
concert the night before, she sounded eager to participate in a
telephone press conference about her adventures in Vivaldi,
documented on her best-selling CD ``The Vivaldi Album'' (Decca),
and in a brief tour that recently brought her to America for a
handful of concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Bartoli dedicated her new album to the memory of her brother
Gabriele, a violist and musicologist, who died of a brain tumor; he
was the first to draw his sister's attention to Vivaldi. ``My
brother was the one who showed the music of Vivaldi to me, the
sacred music, and we performed together some Vivaldi cantatas in
Europe and also in the States. It is because of him that now I sing
this music, and the recording is a sort of late present for him.
When I was working on the cantatas, I decided to look more to try
to discover more things about him and what he did in his time. I
found that Vivaldi was more famous as an opera composer than as a
composer for sacred music or even as an instrumental composer. At
the beginning, I went to Venice and then to Turin, where in the
National Library I found most of the manuscripts of Vivaldi _
incredible things, amazing really.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Vivaldi's operas, ``Orlando Furioso,'' has successfully
been revived in modern times, by Marilyn Horne. Bartoli says she is
not yet sure which of the others is worth reviving in full, or
which she would like to sing onstage. ``I really must study all of
them to see which one is the right one to start with. I think
`Farnace' may be a great opera, and probably also `La Griselda.' I
am looking forward to making one of these operas integrale onstage,
but it is difficult to say right now which one it should be.
Because of the work of so many different groups, and of conductors
like Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Christopher Hogwood, there is a
Baroque renaissance today. People are more used to listening to
Baroque music, and they understand what the structure of it is and
how it works. So now is the time to perform these operas onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vivaldi Album'' contains many examples of the kind of
spectacular but unorthodox coloratura singing that drives Bartoli's
audiences and critics crazy _ for different reasons. It also
contains a few slow arias that display her exceptional musicality,
beauty of tone, and pliant expressivity, most notably an aria from
``Farnace,'' ``Gelido in ogni vena,'' which must stand with the
singer's greatest recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become very attached to the music of Vivaldi,'' Bartoli
says. ``This music is dramatic and it is lyric and there are
virtuoso moments as well. Sometimes I really feel that Vivaldi used
the voice the way he would use a violin. Also sometimes the voice
sings with the flutes, the strings, and the other instruments, and
it is very interesting to try to match all those colors, to find
more colors and nuances in the voice. Sometimes it is an echo,
sometimes a conversation, sometimes a contest. Always it is about
making an expression. The aria from `Farnace' is so sad _ the
father is standing in front of the bier of his son, and he knows
that everything that has happened was his own fault, and now it's
too late. There are similar bars of music in `Winter' from `The
Four Seasons.' The blood of this person becomes cold; it is also
winter inside the person, inside the soul of this father. For me,
this was the most difficult piece on the recording.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartoli has a very clear sense of her abilities and of the
direction she wants to take. She made her breakthrough as a Mozart
and a Rossini singer. Without renouncing either, she now wants to
concentrate on Handel, Vivaldi, and Haydn. ``It is important to
perform the music you feel, the music you believe in. I am trying
to take this direction; the Baroque direction is suitable to my
voice, to my temperament. I hope the opera houses will understand
that. This process is not just for a single singer _ it is for
everybody, because the audience can discover new things.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently Bartoli completed a tour and a recording of Handel's
``Rinaldo'' conducted by Christopher Hogwood. ``At first they
wanted me to sing the title part, but for this you need a different
type of voice from mine. This part was made for a castrato with an
alto color. I can sing some castrato parts, but the ones that were
written more between the soprano and mezzo ranges. Rinaldo calls
for a dark, low voice; I have another instrument, so I chose to
sing Almirena, the wife, and the countertenor David Daniels sang
Rinaldo. Singing Handel is very different from singing Vivaldi. The
Handel line is more pure in a way, more lyric. In Vivaldi you have
extremes; Vivaldi was more extreme as a composer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartoli was also scheduled to sing her first Melisande in
Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' this season, but did not.
``Melisande I was supposed to sing in Florence. Italy is a great
country, but sometimes things there are not so good organized, and
this was happening with `Pelleas.' Already they are asking me again
to do this role in Salzburg, with Simon Rattle conducting, but that
comes at a time when I will be at the Met in New York. Next year my
two new roles will be in the `Armida' of Haydn, in Vienna with
Nikolaus Harnoncourt conducting, and Fiordiligi in Mozart's `Cosi
fan tutte.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fiordiligi will be Bartoli's third role in this opera _ she
began as Dorabella, and then sang Despina for her Met debut. ``I am
so excited about this _ I am completely crazy about the women of
Mozart. As you know, when I was at the Met for `The Marriage of
Figaro,' I sang a different version of Susanna's role, with arias
Mozart wrote for Vienna. The singer who was performing this
version, Gabriella Dal Bene, `La Ferrarese,' was also the singer
for whom Mozart wrote the role of Fiordiligi, about two years
later. So now, about two years after Susanna, I will sing
Fiordiligi for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartoli's decision to sing the alternate operas created a
certain amount of controversy, at least in the columns of The New
York Times. ``I felt a little bit sad about this _ to attack not
me, but Mozart, this made me sad. Mozart wrote some different arias
for a different singer, and I thought it would be exciting to hear
these for the first time since then on the stage, to give the
audience to discover something.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Bartoli says she wants to extend her explorations
to other composers of Vivaldi's era, such as Riccardo Broschi, the
brother of the celebrated castrato Farinelli, and Geminaro
Giacomelli. She is also definitely interested in looking into some
more Spanish music; recently she added Falla's ``Seven Popular
Spanish Songs'' to her recital repertory. ``I will not be singing
just the Baroque music,'' she says. ``It is important for a
musician to explore, no?'' One role Bartoli says she will certainly
not be singing is Violetta in ``La Traviata,'' though rumors have
been circulating about that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In America Bartoli has been seen exclusively in comic roles so
far, a fact that she regrets. ``I did some tragic, dramatic parts
in Europe, and I would really like to bring an opera like the
`Orfeo ed Euridice' of Haydn to America. The dramaticity of the
18th century is very different from the dramaticity of the 19th
century, and I feel closer to the 18th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her popularity on recordings and television, Bartoli
says she does not always feel satisfied with her work in media
other than live performance. ``On the recording it is always
difficult for me to recognize myself. When I sing, I have a
resonance in my head, in my body, and what the people get in the
hall is different, and what they get on the recording is also
different. I miss a little bit the three-dimensional part, which
you cannot have. On television you see just two dimensions, and in
a recording you can listen only to what the microphone or the
speakers give you. You don't have the three dimensions as in a live
perf. Still, it is great to have opera on TV, this is clear.
I do not like to watch myself on TV, but this is a way to learn.
When I look at myself on TV I can say, `This is good' or `This I
can do in a different way.' In any case, it is a lesson, a way of
learning to grow. What I do like to do is watch other singers and
musicians when they perform; this too is a way to learn. Acting is
part of being a singer. After all, a singer is a person who tells a
story, and you need to know how to do that, with your voice, with
your body, with your brain _ with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Bartoli unleashes a cascading coloratura laugh. ``I
don't even like to speak on the telephone. You know, I also talk
with my hands, the way all Italians do!''

CHILIAD KILLJOY TAKES THE PULSE OF A NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime New Year's morning, the cat mistook the Christmas tree
skirt for his litter box. The cat clearly is not Y2K-compliant, but
neither am I, or the tree would have been dismantled long before
the glorious new chiliad.
</P>
<P>
   Chiliad, with a hard C, KIL-ee-ad. That's what my favorite
publication, the Fortean Times (``The Journal of Strange
Phenomena''), prefers to call the millennium. Chiliad is a Greek
word meaning any group of 1,000. Chiliasm, the FT editors note in
the current issue, is a belief in better times to come. We can
hope.
</P>
<P>
   At least we won't have to hear any more hysteria-provoking
blather about how Y2K techno failure will have us all hunkered down
in a new Dark Age with only our Coleman heaters and emergency
stores of water-packed tuna to warm and sustain us.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 dawned with a minimum of technological glitches.
Human error, though, is still very much with us, as reflected in
this line, heard on a New Year's Day radio report: ``The only power
outages reported were caused by drivers running into utility
poles.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology was ready for the turn of the millennium, but were
we? Are we? New Year's Eve, while watching Chet and Natalie, New
England's favorite TV newscouple, shepherd in the new millennium, I
found myself wondering about the dissolution of their
nonprofessional marriage. On air they're still so warm and loving.
Their electronic marriage is a model. What went wrong in ``real''
life?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe their relationship wasn't Y2K-ready. They're only human,
in spite of what some of Natalie's fans may believe. It's possible
that what made for a happy marriage in the 20th century doesn't
measure up in the 21st. Instead of poking my nose into their
marriage, I should examine my own. Is it ready for the Naughty
Oughties? How can it be, if I'm not?
</P>
<P>
   The news of the last two days has been full of people unprepared
for Y2K. One of my favorite examples was in a Globe news story, a
quote from a young Sturbridge woman who said she took her pulse
immediately after midnight. ``I thought I would feel a lot
differently, but here we are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never catch a computer making such an enigmatic statement.
But I know exacty what she meant. I didn't take my pulse on the
stroke of the year 2000, but I should have, just to prove to myself
that I was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been curled for hours in a semifetal position in front of
the TV, watching ABC's dazzling worldwide coverage of the turn of
the chiliad, from Tonga to Times Square. Peter Jennings's costume
changes alone had taxed my emotions to the limit, and there were
still three hours to go before the new century would creep up on
the Hollywood Hills. A little earlier, watching a musical interlude
featuring Harry Connick Jr. in Las Vegas, I finally understood the
advantage of drinking to excess on New Year's Eve. His performance
was not the sort of thing you want to face sober. Why hadn't I laid
in a stash of champagne?
</P>
<P>
   The network's coverage was a technological triumph, easily
spanning time zones, continents, countries. Unfort, some of
the entertainers ABC presented were definitely not Y2K ready.
There's something perverse about using the most sophisticated and
advanced communication technology in the world to bring the likes
of Neil Diamond and Barry Manilow and Billy Joel into our homes on
a night that we will remember the rest of our lives, no matter how
hard we may try to forget certain portions of it. Years from now,
when people speak of the turn of the 21st century, I will think of
Neil Diamond croaking ``America'' while spotlights dance off his
hairpiece. I want to feel chiliastic, but how?

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that 1.3 million American marriages end in divorce
every year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Meg Campbell's marriage became one of them. Her story
might have ended there, in the mounting ash heap of terminated
relationships. But Campbell, an educator from Boston, did something
unexpected. She wrote ``Solo Crossing,'' a book of poetry about her
separation and divorce, although she had never been a poet. In the
process, she not only reinvented her life by discovering a new
metier but may have produced an overnight hit.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published two months ago, and ``it's just taken
off,'' says Campbell's publisher, Cynthia Navaretta of Midmarch
Arts Press, a small New York publishing house that specializes in
books on the arts. ``The book is selling better than any book I've
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Campbell was the featured poet on
www.PoetryCentral.com _ a New York-based Web site promoting poets
and poetry events _ and it resulted in ``this incredible
word-of-mouth networking,'' says Campbell, still dazzled. ``It's
really feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantaneously, she started getting invitations to give
readings around the country, including New York, San Antonio, and _
Campbell is ecstatic about this one _ Blytheville, Ark. The
bookstore owner in Blytheville, Mary Gay Shipley, was featured in a
New Yorker article in October that described her Oprah-like
prescience in anticipating books that will become hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just so excited,'' says Sherrie Casteel, who is
coordinating the reading for a monthly poet's group that meets at
That Bookstore in Blytheville. ``Her poetry is beautiful and it
speaks to everyone, whether it is my 14-year-old daughter or the
58-year-old retired English teacher in our group who is
African-American and writes his poetry in Zulu,'' she says. ``I
read the book and said, `Yes, this is wonderful.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bookseller Amazon.com has ordered Campbell's book
in quantity and made it available on 24-hour shipment. Campbell
says she now receives e-mail every day from enthusiastic readers.
There was the woman in New York who had been married for 40 years
and divorced for five who ``told me she thought she'd put it all
behind her but was sobbing reading my book.'' That same day there
was a note from the African-American woman in San Antonio who
``said she felt it was her story.'' And there was ``some guy in
Chicago'' going through a divorce who read excerpts of the book on
the Internet and said he needed the rest of it _ immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people have told me, `I don't like poetry but I
like your book,' '' says Campbell, 47. She describes the book _ a
modestly designed, softcover collection of 61 poems _ as a ``memoir
of separation and divorce, the new life beyond, and the whole range
of emotions in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Like rage, for one:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are separated
</P>
<P>
   eight months. You live
</P>
<P>
   with another woman,
</P>
<P>
   take her to your uncle's wedding,
</P>
<P>
   tell me
</P>
<P>
   you have an open heart
</P>
<P>
   about us.
</P>
<P>
   What heart?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And loneliness:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I understand
</P>
<P>
   this is my life.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming
</P>
<P>
   alone.
</P>
<P>
   Tired. Afraid
</P>
<P>
   How much longer can I last?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (end poetry style)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And starting over:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even temporary celibacy, I've read,
</P>
<P>
   promises clarity, calm.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings pristine, detached.
</P>
<P>
   Then why am I undressing
</P>
<P>
   the Saturn repair associate
</P>
<P>
   or the man who comes to give my garden a bid?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have published much more intellectual poets and those with
bigger reputations,'' Navaretta says, noting that Campbell's book
sold about 600 copies in the first five weeks, ``which is a
phenomenal number for poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poetry reaches people. It is easy to read. It is from the
heart. And there is an audience out there, which is apparently not
a poetry audience, of people who are attracted to the subject.
After all, the experience (of divorce) is so common now.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would have predicted an unknown poet could have generated
this kind of response, least of all Campbell, who graduated from
Radcliffe College to go on to a career that has included many
occupations, none of them poet. She has been a community organizer,
Massachusetts Senate legislative research director, teacher, and
school administrator. Currently she is a lecturer at the Harvard
Graduate School of Education and executive director of
Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound in Cambridge, Mass., a
comprehensive reform school that uses the teaching methods of the
Outward Bound wilderness programs.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of two daughters, both in college, Campbell declines
to discuss specific details of the dissolution of her
nearly-20-year marriage, except to say ``the breakup was not my
choice'' and to make reference to her poem called ``Court Date,''
which suggests there had been another woman in her husband's life.
</P>
<P>
   The end of her marriage was utterly ``paralyzing. There is a lot
of shame associated with separation and divorce,'' particularly,
she says, for Catholics like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, divorce simply just wasn't an option
for Catholics,'' she says. ``It was unthinkable. I knew one
divorced family in my elementary school, and the father was
alcoholic and the mother (itals)had to go to work.(undated) It was
like something out of Charles Dickens.''
</P>
<P>
   After Campbell and her husband separated, she was consumed by
``shame, guilt, and failure. I had been a very proud person. This
whole experience was very humbling. I cried every day for the first
year.''
</P>
<P>
   She writes in the introduction to her book: ``Succeeding in
marriage was vitally important to me. I failed. I would have done
anything to spare my children pain. I could not. Dating in my
forties was not in my original life plan, nor was living alone with
a vociferous cat.''
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, she says, she discovered that ``life surprises
and teaches.'' She sought help from many sources _ her Catholic
faith, therapists, loving friends and family, books, a divorce
support group _ and unexpectedly, a catharsis came in the form of
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always kept a journal, but suddenly it was like a volcano,
and I started pouring forth (itals)stuff.''(unitals) Dream
fragments and poems appeared in her journal. When she showed the
first 10 to friends, they encouraged her to keep writing. Some 50
poems later, she had ``Solo Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to come. With a friend in New York, William
Duke, she is working on an anthology of poems about divorce, called
``Split Verse: Poems to Heal the Heart,'' which will also be
published by Midmarch. She believes it is the ``first ever
anthology of poems about divorce,'' containing more than 60 poems
from among 1,000 entries, submitted by poets around the country in
response to an advertisement in Poets &AMP; Writers magazine.
</P>
<P>
   What has she learned from this whole experience? That ``your
disability is your opportunity,'' says Campbell, quoting Kurt Hahn,
the founder of Outward Bound. She is happier now than she has been
in years, having discovered the support of a ``large, wonderful
extended family who was totally there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She has also learned _ from her new cadre of readers and from
the profuse interest in her anthology from other poets _ that her
solo experience has been shared by many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we all feel vulnerable,'' says Campbell.
``Everyone in a way is on a solo crossing. But we all have safety
boats behind us even if we can't see them in the fog. And poetry is
a wonderful way for all those powerful emotions to be compressed
and distilled.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda Wachner has company.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the corporate halls of fashion, retailing and beauty
were dominated by men. But women are hitting the industry's topmost
echelons in greater numbers and Wachner, Warnaco's high-profile
boss and a pioneer in the old boys' club, isn't the only woman
running the show anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Two developments last month presented further evidence that
there's a new breed of executive breaking into the top ranks:
Within days, Andrea Jung was appointed chief executive officer of
Avon and Christina Johnson was named ceo of Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jung stands alone as the only female to be running a
Fortune 500 fashion or bempany. The three other female ceo's
in the Fortune 500 are Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard, Jill
E. Barad of Mattel and Marion D. Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of running multimillion- or even
multibillion-dollar corporations, women are well represented. In
addition to Wachner, Jung and Johnson, there's Lillian Vernon,
chairman and ceo of the firm bearing her name; Carolee Friedlander,
ceo of Carolee Designs; Josie Natori, ceo of Natori Co.; Josephine
Chaus, chairwoman of Chaus, Inc.; Jessica McClintock,
owner/designer of Jessica McClintock; Eileen Fisher, owner of the
sportswear firm bearing her name; Carole Hochman, ceo of Carole
Hochman Designs, and Diane Von Furstenberg, who heads her own
ready-to-wear company, DVF Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Also over the past several years, women have gained more ground
and more authority to run fashion and beauty divisions of larger
conglomerates. Companies such as T The Limited, Dayton
Hudson, Liz Claiborne, Federated and Jones Apparel Group are among
those that have steadily elevated women to top positions. In fact,
female division presidents are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   There's Jeanne Jackson, president of Banana Republic; Robin
Burns, president of IBI Intimate Beauty Corp.; Grace A. Nichols,
chief executive officer of Victoria's Secret Stores (a division of
Intimate Brands); Beth M. Pritchard, ceo of Bath &AMP; Body Works,
another division of IBI; Patricia DeRosa, president of Ann Taylor;
Marie Holman-Rao, president of Limited Design Services; Janet
Grove, chairman and ceo of the Federated Merchandising Group;
Vanessa Castagna, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of J.C. Penney Stores, merchandising and catalog, and Susan
Kronick, chairman of Burdine's, among others.
</P>
<P>
   On fashion's manufacturing side, there's Denise Seegal,
president of Liz Claiborne Inc.; Jackwyn Nemerov, president of the
Jones Apparel Group; Mindy Grossman, president and ceo of Polo
Jeans; Carol Hochman, chief executive officer of Danskin, and
Christa Michalaros, president of Tommy Hilfiger women's sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   And in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, women
executives are sprouting up all over the landscape. Meg Whitman,
chief executive officer of eBay; Candice Carpenter, chairman and
ceo of iVillage Inc., and Nancy Evans, president of iVillage, are
just a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see any ceilings in the world you and I live
in,'' said Hal Reiter, president and ceo of Herbert Mines
Associates, an executive search firm here. ``No one says to me, `I
want a guy.'' I don't even think it's an issue anymore. Women have
been very successful in fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we get an assignment for a ceo in the fashion
business, it's completely gender neutral. I always say, `Do you
have a preference?' and they say, `I'd love a woman. It's a
complete demonstration by women that they are as completely capable
as men, if not more,''' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerated growth of the Internet has created many
opportunities for women, since the rules of the game _ and the
necessary job skills _ haven't been clearly defined yet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advances, women are still a minority in the
executive suites, and some recruiters say their take-home pay still
lags behind the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (women's) deals are perhaps not as lucrative since their
negotiating skills are not as inbred and honed as some of their
male counterparts,'' said Terre Simpson, owner of Simpson
Associates, an executive search firm here. She noted that some men,
whose skills might not be as good, are ``terrific negotiators,''
able to carve out larger packages for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Herbert Mines's Reiter believes that women, at least on the
ceo level, are getting equal pay. ``Look at Linda Wachner,'' he
said, perennially one of the highest paid executives in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is women are being paid as much as men,'' said
Reiter. ``And they don't negotiate themselves. They usually have
their lawyer or headhunter do it.'' Plus, he said, these women
ceo's didn't get to the top posts by being shrinking violets when
it comes to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's Fiorina is said to have a total compensation
package worth $5.25 million, and Mattel's Barad's compensation is
$4.75 million. Meanwhile, the Gap's Drexler pulled in $7.8 million
in total compensation. Leonard Lauder's total compensation was $6.6
million, while the Limited's Wexner had a total compensation of
$2.7 million. In 1998, Jung, who was then president and chief
operating officer of Avon, received $5 million, largely reflecting
$3.8 million in restricted stock.
</P>
<P>
   Jung, 41, now runs a $5.2 billion conglomerate. She also serves
on the board of General Electric, the Fragrance Foundation,
Cosmetic Executive Women and Princeton University, of which she's a
graduate. She was named to Fortune's list of ``50 Most Powerful
Women in American Business,'' in both 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jung is a prime example of a woman who has handily cracked the
top tier and sees herself as a role model for her daughter. In an
interview following her appointment, Jung described being a working
mother as ``tough'' and ``challenging,'' but said she was excited
by setting an exar her 10-year-old daughter and her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest rounds of applause I got was when I walked
into a birthday party just yesterday and all of her friends thought
it was a great thing that a woman got to the top and they're all 10
years old ... I think there is something in that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dayton Hudson's Linda Ahlers was interviewed earlier this
year, she said she never found barriers to her advancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you create your own ceilings,'' said Ahlers.
``Personally, if I started to think there was a glass ceiling,
there would have been one for me. I won't let it exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the 48-year-old chief executive officer and president
of Saks Fifth Avenue here, said, ``I have been very fortunate in my
career. I worked for Philip Miller for 17 years and he's been a
huge mentor in terms of my professional growth. He fostered a
leadership style that's one of equality.'' Johnson noted that women
comprise 75 percent of the Saks Fifth Avenue's staff and 50 percent
of the executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Do women have to work harder than men to get ahead? Johnson
noted that results can be easily measured in fashion retailing, so
``performance is not gender-related ... (but) if anything, I
believe that women, because of the fact they've had a different
equality mechanism in the workplace, have an innate pressure to
perform. They are constantly aware of how they're perceived in the
workplace and have a much stronger need to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest child in her family, Johnson said she was trained
at an early age to strive for achievement. Johnson majored in
sociology at Loyola University, which, she said, ``helped
tremendously in terms of development of people.'' And while she
described her ascension in retailing ``as a steady climb,'' she
attributed her success to a very diverse career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come up through the merchandising ranks,'' said
Johnson, noting she worked for Marshall Field's stand-alone catalog
and was a general merchandise manager at Saks before handling store
operations. ``The key for any woman in terms of running a company
today is to develop general management skills,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the defining moment was when she realized she had a
shot at the top post, she said: ``After the merger (with Profitt's)
and when Brad Martin became chairman of the company, he elevated me
to vice chairman. At this point I realized there was a significant
opportunity to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the path, management style has a lot to do with the
success of the industry's top female executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I have a participatory management style,''
said Johnson. ``Am I tough? I've heard that said about me. Maybe. I
firmly believe it's a team that brings an organization to its
highest capability. I very much like to have my management style
reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Mines' Reiter said the reason there haven't been more
women in top positions is really based on numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only X amount of women in the business ... Because
there are fewer women to choose from, fewer women move to the
top,'' contended Reiter.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics differ by industry, however. Reiter said when he
conducts a beauty search, generally 75 percent of the candidates
are women. For a retail fashion position, usually 25 percent are
female candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more women in cosmetics and beauty than
anywhere else. It's where the inventory is,'' said Reiter. He said
that when he conducted the Ann Taylor (president) search, ``almost
every candidate they saw was a woman.'' They chose Patricia DeRosa,
former executive vice president of Charming Shoppes; before that,
she had been president of GapKids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills are what's rising to the top, not the gender,''
said Terre Simpson of Simpson Associates. ``I think finally, after
much duress, it's beginning to be a level playing field. Women are
primed now and are moving up above the midmanagement level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mind-set changing and acknowledging women's
contributions. Now, they assess a person on their business acumen
and contribution, rather than gender,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hart, partner in the executive search firm Spencer Stuart
and managing director of its North American retail practice,
observed that although fashion and beauty companies have
historically recruited women, women are now rising to the top
across virtually every industry.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the Internet has created many such
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of the Internet, you can go off the big
corporate tracks and give them (women) the leverage of full
corporate responsibility,'' Hart said. ``What I do think about the
Internet is the rules aren't written yet _ who the right person has
to be and what traditional route you have to come up. It's not just
women, but diversity in the Internet. There are fabulous
opportunities for women. There used to be a premium for gray hair.
Now there's a premium for youth.''
</P>
<P>
   While some women may be attracted to Internet positions, others
are apparently content with more conventional venues. ``The lure of
potential compensation, to be part of something that will hopefully
go public, catches a lot of people's eyes. But some people are very
content in non e-commerce. Those channels won't go away. They have
some amazing business challenges running traditional companies with
traditional channels of distribution,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Jung and Johnson, she said these women have plenty
of opportunities to run huge management teams and global
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrea (Jung) is someone who is remarkably bright. She is one
of the most outstanding people in leadership. She has a delightful
personality. She's very determined and accomplished with huge
interpersonal skills,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a lot of women are content running important divisions
_ if not exactly the ceo slot. ``There are fabulous women who are
running divisions of companies who will either be picked off and
become a ceo, or it may not be their total driving force. They
might have enough autonomy and are very satisfied,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that a lot of men find satisfaction in the
decision-making and leadership role, but there are plenty of people
who can do that within the confines of a company. She pointed to
Ann Fudge, president of the Maxwell House and Post divisions of
Kraft Foods, who also sits on three boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're challenged and well respected, and treated well by
your company ... you add it all up in the end. By the time you
reach the top, the pay check is pretty good. Lots of women have
made self-selecting choices. Sometimes they're the candidates for
the ceo jobs, and they're the ones who pass,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she said, executives need a global perspective and
companies have to provide the experience to round out their skills.
She believes that many of today's female ceo's come from the
marketing ranks. ``Marketing tends to be the function that's king
in consumer companies. Those functions are cluttered with women,''
said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Kusin, managing partner of the consumer practice at
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, an executive search firm here, doesn't
believe that the fashion and beauty industries have lagged behind
other industries in naming female ceo's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In creatively driven businesses such as these, women have been
pulled to them. Any faster-paced businesses have been more
appealing to women,'' said Kusin.
</P>
<P>
   She said Jung's appointment at Avon gives other companies the
confidence that it can happen and that it's not that big a risk.
Like men, Kusin noted, some female ceo's will be successful, and
some won't. ``The issue of gender will become less important. Who
succeeds and who doesn't depends on leadership skills.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kusin agreed that e-businesses are a natural place
for women to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are geared to run these businesses based on the speed of
change and chaos, so it's common to see women in start-ups, because
of their sheer creativity and the ability to see where it all needs
to go. It plays to women's strong suits.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tobey Maguire, a slight figure in T-shirt and
sweatpants with a dusting of beard on his pale face, pulls out a
plastic box and snaps it open. He's in a coffeehouse on the Sunset
Strip, a bowl of oatmeal in front of him and Baroque music blasting
from a speaker behind, as he studies a multicolored array of
pebble-textured pills so big they look like a display in a
Hollywood Boulevard rock shop.
</P>
<P>
   They're vitamins, and gulping them down on doctor's orders is
the price Maguire is paying for a strep throat _ which in turn may
be the price for working so hard the past couple of years bringing
enigmatic youthful angst to receptive moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   After grabbing the attention of critics as the lonely
prep-schooler in ``The Ice Storm'' and the yearning, TV-besotted
suburban kid in ``Pleasantville,'' Maguire is currently breaking
out as the star of three back-to-back movies.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Ang Lee's bloody epic ``Ride With the Devil,''
in which he appeared as a young Bushwhacker losing his innocence to
the Civil War and his virginity to a widow played by Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by Lasse Hallstrom's ``The Cider House
Rules,'' based on John Irving's novel, with Maguire as the naive
orphan hero, Homer.
</P>
<P>
   And he just finished Curtis Hanson's ``Wonder Boys,'' in which
he appears as Michael Douglas' brilliant, suicidal student. The
film is due out early next year year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a little recovery time to get them out of my system,''
Maguire says about the string of intense movies, in a voice that
still wobbles like a teen-ager's. ``It's like a relationship. It
feels almost weird to work with another director. It feels like
you're betraying the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to directors talk about Maguire makes working with him
sound just as much like a love affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strangely exhilarating,'' says Hallstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin Dunne, who directed the actor as a doubt-riddled teen in
the Oscar-nominated 1995 short ``The Duke of Groove,'' mentions
Maguire's soulful gaze. ``Those eyes,'' he says. ``I could tell
there was so much going on behind them. But whenever I would say
that, Tobey would say, `There's nothing going on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire's understated performance in ``The Cider House Rules''
depended so much on those expressive eyes _ and little else _ that
it made the suits a bit nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom says he did hear from Miramax _ but wasn't fazed. The
movie ended up getting a 2 1/2-minute standing ovation at the 1999
Venice Film Festival, which gets Maguire damp-eyed remembering.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his beginnings, Maguire's quiet self-confidence is
something of a marvel. Granted, he began acting in commercials and
on television at the age of 13, after his mother, a secretary,
persuaded him to take drama lessons. But his parents had divorced
when he was only 2, and poverty followed, accompanied by a series
of moves through some of L.A.'s drearier suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. I
had food to eat and a roof over my head,'' he says, hesitating, but
adds, ``There was a moment when we were really poor and I spent a
night in a shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, his circumstances were deeply embarrassing to
him. Now, it is his earlier discomfiture that worries him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was I embarrassed for? Who cared what they really
thought?'' he wonders out loud. ``Strangers in a grocery store when
the food stamps came out? People in the doctor's office when we
were going to use the Medi-Cal stickers?''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, though, Maguire had an inexplicable faith in
his ability to make it as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was, like, 16, I would turn down stuff that I thought
was really, really cheesy,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, it's still something he worries about. In a lawsuit that
he and Leonardo DiCaprio settled recently, an independent producer
accused them of trying to squelch distribution of a low-budget
movie they'd made in 1995 because of Maguire's concern for his
image.
</P>
<P>
   He also seems loath to appear to be riding the coattails of
DiCaprio, a longtime friend (and sometime partner in crime during
DiCaprio's rowdier nightlife episodes) who earlier helped him get a
role in ``This Boy's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a friend like any other friend, and we see each other,''
Maguire says, shrugging uncomfortably, even though DiCaprio calls
during a photo shoot to discuss plans for his birthday party that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never went through the cliche of `Now I'm going to get
f---ed up,'' Dunne says of Maguire, pointing to a group of
fast-living young Hollywood actors who didn't finish high school,
don't plan on going to college and sleep in each other's cars and
on floors.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire, too, was a high-school dropout who wasn't planning on
college when Dunne met him. But, Dunne says, ``He's always been
levelheaded. He made a decision that he wasn't going to let dope
and booze be a part of his life,'' he says. ``And it wasn't as if
he had to come out of rehab to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that he doesn't run with the pack _ and in the
process has developed an image a tad more worldly than the
wide-eyed innocents he plays onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be drastically funny, outspoken and sarcastic,'' says
Hallstrom, who saw that side of him on the ``Cider House'' set.
``And his EQ is high _ his emotional quotient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think closer to his core is an open heart,'' says Maguire's
``Ride With the Devil'' co-star Jeffrey Wright. ``The reason he can
bring these things out in films is not solely out of role
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Open heart or not, Maguire has coached himself to keep mum about
his love life. What is known is that he has an on-again-off-again
relationship with Quincy Jones's daughter, model Rashida Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave those questions well alone,'' he says with a little
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But total secrecy, not to mention a normal adolescence, is the
price of early fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a strange thing to start your career at 13,'' says
Maguire, who regrets dropping out of school. ``I've definitely had
another form of educationretty good at figuring stuff out in
my head mathematically, but I don't really know how to write a
letter properly. I can't remember what I learned about the
structure of sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   He curls his long upper lip in his cat-ate-the-canary grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my understanding of mortality and responsibility is
growing.''

THE ADVENTURES OF TWO WHO EXPLORED THE WILD WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000   The Boston Globe  
 
A NEWER WORLD 
Kit Carson, John C. Fremont, and the Claiming of the American West 
By David Roberts 
Simon &AMP; Schuster. 320 pp. Illustrated. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They saved each other's lives. They served as foils for each
other. They assured each other's place in history, and in myth.
</P>
<P>
   They were John C. Fremont and Kit Carson, and in myth and even
in the sober annals of history they were wild-eyed adventurers,
explorers, wild men. They were also stubborn fools. But history _
of the American West, especially, but in a way all of history _ is
made by adventurers, explorers, wild men, and stubborn fools.
</P>
<P>
   David Roberts, a writer with a taste for adventurers and a soft
spot for stubborn fools, has taken a fresh look at some familiar
faces, and in ``A Newer World: Kit Carson, John C. Fremont, and the
Claiming of the American West,'' he gives new life to some of the
most vivid figures on the American canvas. He does one thing more,
too: He reminds us that historical figures, even the fabled loners
of the West, never actually accomplished very much of anything
alone.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly is the brilliant new truth that shines forth from
Roberts's book. Carson went from gung-ho Indian battler to
introspective Indian sympathizer. Fremont went from explorer to
senator. Carsknown as the Rope Thrower, Fremont as the
Pathfinder. Carson was modest, Fremont showy. And together, Roberts
tells us, they ``effectively closed the era of the discovery of the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not a small thing, especially since it is historically
respectable to think that the exploration of the West _ the process
rather than any single, significant discovery _ was one of the
principal ways men and women of the 19th century discovered their
country, their notions of community, and their sense of selves.
Carson and Fremont were part of that, and they are part of the
folklore of the period and the region. But they were human, too,
and that's where the stereotypes break down.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has written an ingenious and ingratiating volume,
focusing on two men who in a dozen years in the middle of the 19th
century conducted expeditions of exploration that changed the
history of America and, just as important, the way Americans looked
at their history.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this book _ more the chronicle of a partnership
than a double biography _ are four campaigns, beginning with the
1842 expedition to Wyoming's Wind River Range and concluding with
the infamous 1863-64 roundup of the Mescalero Apaches and Navajos
that led to the Long Walk. Roberts traced them all, in documents
and by car and foot, and the result is a sense of realism _ the
literary equivalent of the whiff of wood smoke, you might say _
rarely achieved in Western historical writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the 1842 expedition onward, their destinies and renown
would be intertwined,'' Roberts writes, adding: ``yet in all the
West, no pair of adventurers more different in character than
Carson and Fremont could be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hard work of the campaigns was done by Carson, but
the dreamy one was Fremont. The son-in-law of Thomas Hart Benton, a
Missouri senator, and one of the theorists of continental
expansion, Fremont was a visionary, but a visionary with blind
spots. He pushed and pushed, which is sometimes an advantage in
human affairs, and sometimes he pushed too far, which is seldom an
advantage in snowy mountains, particularly those buried in snow
drifts reaching 40 feet. He was known as the conqueror of
Cali but throughout his expeditions he was nearly conquered
by the elements. He defied his enemies, the law, civil authorities
_ and, particularly in his drive to cross the Sierra Nevada in
midwinter, good sense. His expedition suffered such cold and
privation that the horses, not content with eating the pack
saddles, began to munch on one another's tails.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont was self-centered, he was vain, he was single-minded.
All of these were on full display in all of his missions, in none
more so than the expedition that led to the Bear Flag Revolt, the
declaration of the California Republic, his eagerness to describe
himself as ``Military Commander of US Forces in California,'' and
his court-martial. On horseback, in his memoirs, in the imagination
of the American people, and most of all in his own mind, he was a
giant. On the ground, he was human _ and flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Roberts's commentary about Fremont and the revolt in
California: ``Thus, as he began to grasp the opportunity of a
lifetime, Fremont allowed the grandiose self-importance that lay
always just beneath his surface to emerge. If the man had a tragic
flaw, this was it. Now he rode at the head of his battalion
surrounded by a personal body-guard of five fierce-looking Delaware
Indians; sometimes he tied green ribbons around his horse's neck
and tail. His dispatches took on an ex cathedra tone.''
</P>
<P>
   There were hardships aplenty in his expeditions (and nothing
makes for better reading iomfort of our own rocking chairs,
here in the 21st century, than accounts of hardship in the 19th).
But Fremont's men often were frost-bitten, often were in danger,
often were watching their mules die, or were slaughtering them
because they thought they might die any minute. (The mules had a
real hard time of it, sometimes eating the ropes and rawhide
lariats that were draped around their long necks.)
</P>
<P>
   In most of this, Fremont played the lead, giving an imperfect
performance, while Carson won credit for best supporting actor.
Roberts points out that Fremont had a ``self-conscious
preoccupation with how everything he did would look in the view of
history, which precluded the kind of thoughtless performance that,
at its purest, defines true heroism.'' He notes, moreover, that
Carson ``had that quality in his very blood.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Fremont was always bidding for history's approval.
Carson merely wanted to wander the West, catch deer, beaver, and
buffalo, and scoot home to visit his wife. He knew how to survive
four days in the desert without water. He knew his way around the
woods. His genius was in knowing how the West could be won.
Fremont's was in insisting that this was the time to win it.
</P>

ROBBINS ROCKS THEATER HISTORY IN `CRADLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000   The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What may be one of the greatest moments in American
theater history is also one of the least-known moments in American
theater history.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was a theater major in college, Tim Robbins knew
nothing about how members of the Federal Theater Project defied
efforts by the US House of Representatives' Special Committee on
Un-American Activities  &UR; t &LR; o derail a production of Marc
Blitzstein's politically charged musical ``The Cradle Will Rock''
in the &UR;  &LR; 1930s. Though the play was directed by a then-22-year-old
Orson Welles and marked the beginning of congressional
investigations into anti-Communist activities, this chapter somehow
found itself consi history's shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied theater in college, and it wasn't covered,'' Robbins
said. ``Years later, someone told me the story, and approached me
about doing a movie about it. I immediately thought this was a
story screaming to be told, and I started doing research about this
incredible American achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of Robbins's research is the just-released ``Cradle
Will Rock,'' which strongly parallels today's ongoing battles over
artistic freedom, political opportunism, and government meddling.
The film blends real events and people such as Nelson Rockefeller,
Welles, John Houseman, and Diego Rivera with fictional characters.
The ensemble cast includes Hank Azaria, Susan Sarandon, John
Cusack, Joan Cusack, Vanessa Redgrave, John Turturro, Cherry Jones,
Emily Watson, Bill Murray, and Ruben Blades.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday morning in October, Robbins, a boyish 41-year-old
with a skullcap of salt-and-pepper hair, draped his impossibly long
frame over a club chair in a midtown Manhattan hotel suite. He's
itchy for a cup of coffee, and is still tender after the ouster of
his beloved New York Mets in game six of the National League
Championship Series by the hated Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He's eager to talk about his film, his first directorial effort
since 1995's ``Dead Man Walking,'' which earned him an Academy
Award nomination. But first he's got to work out those
brokenhearted baseball blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a Vancouver hotel room for Game Six. I had my bags
packed, and a ticket for Game Seven in Atlanta,'' he said. ``I was
going. I was going.''
</P>
<P>
   That Robbins can hold the Mets so dear in a city loopy for
Yankee pinstripes _ especially on this, the day after a ticker-tape
parade for the Yankees' second consecutive World Series
championship _ says much about his affinity for underdogs. That
proclivity, and his opposition to government interference in the
creation and distribution of art, fueled his desire to make
``Cradle Will Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a politician, regardless of the era, who's
going to use the one piece of art they find that is controversial
for their own political gain,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of this interview, New York was all in a twist over
a Brooklyn Museum of Art exhibit of a Virgin Mary painting
incorporating elephant dung and snippets from pornographic photos.
The artwork incurred the wrath of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who went to great but ultimately unsuccessful lengths to shut the
exhibit _ and the museum _ down.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani ``got the press he wanted. He wound up alienating more
people than he thought, but he got his core voters. It's coldly
calculated politics,'' Robbins said. ``He's in that tradition of
politicians who use art for political gain, and in doing so,
compromise the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   To Robbins, Giuliani is no different from Committee Chairman
Martin Dies Jr., a Texas Democrat who believed the Federal Theater
was a hotbed of radical thought, and its plays little more than
Communist propaganda. A division of the New Deal's Works Progress
Administration, the Federal provided work for artists and
technicians, and offered inexpensive theater to a Depression-weary
public.
</P>
<P>
   During his research, Robbins was especially impressed with the
theater's director, Hallie Flanagan, played in the film by Cherry
Jones. Flanagan was eventually called to testify before the House
committee about the theater's works and members.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was _ wow! _ talk about an inspiring woman. She was so
open to different kinds of theater, and managed this incredibly
ambitious federal program that brought theater to one-quarter of
the population,'' said Robbins, who worked on the film's script for
nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had never seen live theater before, and she wound up
reaching 25 million people with different interpretations of
classics and modern playwrights, but also experimental theater,
political theater, social theater,'' he said. ``The thing I was
most shocked about was that I hadn't heard about her. I wonder if a
man had been the head of it, or if it had been less controversial,
whether it would have been part of the curriculum of the theater
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Azaria, who portrays playwright Blitzstein, said he knew
``nothing, less than nothing'' about this period before reading
Robbins's script, although he, like the filmmaso studied
theater history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think this rather large moment in theater history would
be talked about,'' Azaria said. ``My theory is in that in the
1950s'' _ when redbaiting reached its demagogic height _ ``you
couldn't talk about it, and it probably just got lost in the
shuffle. But it's a fascinating time, and should be talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its political viewpoints and clashing ideas and
ideologies, Robbins resists branding his film as political. He has
nothing against political films _ he wrote and directed a dandy one
in 1992 with his mock documentary, ``Bob Roberts,'' in which he
starred as the title character, a corrupt, folk-singing right-wing
politician. Political films have their place _ but ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' he said, just isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a political movie. `Political movie'
implies for me a whole different thing,'' Robbins said. ``This is
about human beings, passion, and courage _ all the kinds of words
you don't mention in the same sentence as politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sarandon, who plays fascist sympathizer Margherita Sarfatti,
disagreed with her director _ and her longtime companion. Every
film, she said, is a political film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you think `(Saving) Private Ryan' was political? `Private
Ryan' basically tells you if you want to be a guy you now have to
kill at point-blank range, and now you're a hero, and you're OK.
That's a political statement,'' she said. ``I think every film
contributes to your culture. They all give you permission, entitle
you, reinforce stereotypes, tell women what they need to look like,
what happens when you reach a certain age, tell guys what it means
to be a man. That's all political.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your definition of a political film?'' Sarandon asked.
``Every film is a political film, but you just don't notice the
ones that reinforce the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins has no interest in reinforcing the status quo in his
films, especially when he's behind the camera. In three films as a
writer-director, he has skewered the American political system and
its easily duped electorate in ``Bob Roberts''; thoughtfully
examined both sides of the death penalty debate in ``Dead Man
Walking''; and, with ``Cradle Will Rock,'' unearthed a
long-forgotten episode in theater history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmakers are storytellers, and it depends on what kind of
story you want to tell. If you keep wanting to tell the story of
`boy meets girl,' you can do that,'' he said. ``But this story
allows a larger canvas, and it's such a rich, interesting time.
There are many things here which are still issues today.
Ultimately, I find those actors standing up to be inspiring. It
really shows how an individual can have courage, the courage to
exercise your freedom of expression.''

WINONA RYDER'S TRIP TO THE EDGE OF SANITY

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Winona Ryder with Angelina Jolie in a
scene from ``Girl, Interrupted.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Reality bites again for Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    The petite actress, who's spent most of her career playing
emotionally troubled characters, reaches for the gold ring of angst
in her latest film, ``Girl, Interrupted.''
 &HT;    Opening nationwide on Jan. 14, the film is based on Susanna
Kaysen's best-selling memoir of her two-year stint at a mental
institution in the late 1960s, a story harrowing even by
contemporary standards _ and one which resonated strongly with
Ryder herself.
 &HT;    ``When I read the book I was about 21, and I was just floored,''
the 28-year-old actress says as she settles into a chair at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. As always, she's polite yet reserved,
and speaks in a voice barely louder than a whisper.
 &HT;    ``I found it to be incredibly captivating,'' she recalls. ``I
hadn't read a character so brutally honest since I'd read Salinger.
It's very rare in literature to find brutal honesty without
self-indulgence, and cut with such humor.
 &HT;    ``It's usually very self-indulgent if it's that honest, almost
nauseatingly so.''
 &HT;    Almost obsessed with Kaysen's saga, Ryder bought the film rights
to the book. As executive producer, she was determined to protect
the material and see to it that director James Mangold, whom Ryder
handpicked after seeing his film ``Heavy'' (1994), could craft a
film in line with their shared vision.
 &HT;    ``Girl, Interrupted'' introduces Kaysen (Ryder) as a depressed
teen who, like many of the young women on her ward at Claymoore
Hospital, is nonetheless anything but insane. During her stay at
the institution Kaysen encounters a variety of people who change
her life, including a beguiling sociopath (Angelina Jolie), an
understanding nurse (Whoopi Goldberg) and the facility's head
psychiatrist (Vanessa Redgrave).
 &HT;    Ryder didn't find it hard to relate to Kaysen. At 19, after
ending her romance with then-beau Johnny Depp and working too hard
for too long, the actress briefly checked herself into an
institution during the filming of ``The House of the Spirits''
(1993).
 &HT;    ``It was actually for five days,'' she says. ``I think anybody
would back me up and say 19 is a tough age for anyone, whether
you're an actress or cramming for exams, and your parents are
driving you crazy and you're breaking up with your first love.
Whatever you're going through, it's a tough year.
 &HT;    ``I was working back-to-back on movies,'' Ryder recalls, ``and I
had a week off from this film, in which I was playing a political
prisoner and doing torture scenes in Portugal. I've always been a
terrible insomniac. I came back, and was so exhausted that I
checked myself into a clinic for sleep deprivation. But it was a
psychiatric ward.''
 &HT;    Ryder reports, however, that she gained nothing from the
experience.
 &HT;    ``It didn't help me at all,'' she says. ``The thing I did get is
that those places really don't help.
 &HT;    ``You don't go to a place where they give you a pill that fixes
you,'' she says bluntly. ``They don't give you a sheet of secret
answers. You can't pay enough money to have a placeu, which
is incredibly upsetting when you think that you can. I thought, `I
have money, and if I pay them enough they're going to have to give
me some sort of cure for just feeling broken and confused and
ultra-too-sensitive for this world.'
 &HT;    ``But it didn't work like that,'' the actress says. ``I left
feeling just the same, pretty much, and just as tired. They really
didn't offer anything, except for group therapy, which was one hour
a day.
 &HT;    ``Then I went back to `House of the Spirits' _ and all of the
torture scenes got cut out! So I went through it for nothing.''
 &HT;    Ultimately, Ryder says, she found that she had to look within
herself to find any sort of healing.
 &HT;    ``It's what Susanna learns in the film, which is that there are
no answers,'' she says. ``When you finally accept that, that it's
OK not to have answers for everything, that it's OK not to be
perfect, that it's OK to be a human being and be confused, that
actually feeling crazy is normal ... ''
 &HT;    She trails off, groping for the right words, and starts again.
 &HT;    ``If you're sitting there and feeling that you understand the
world,'' she says, ``with war and disease and famine and violence
and assassinations, I'd worry about that person who understood all
of those things.
 &HT;    ``So feeling ... ''
 &HT;    A quizzical look crosses Ryder's face. She raises a finger to
her mouth.
 &HT;    `` ... granola in my teeth.''
 &HT;    The actress cracks up for a moment, then resumes her thought.
 &HT;    ``So feeling confused is actually just feeling like a human
being,'' she says. ``And it's important to understand that the only
place you can go to is yourself.''
 &HT;    It's been two years since Ryder's last film, ``Alien
Resurrection'' (1997), but it's unlikely that another hiatus of
comparable length will occur in the foreseeable future.
 &HT;    She's already completed the long-delayed supernatural thriller
``Lost Souls,'' and recently wrapped ``Autumn in New York.'' The
latter film, which she writes off as ``more of a job,'' is a drama
that casts her as a dying young woman who falls in love with
Richard Gere.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of jokes about the fact that Richard is old
enough to be my father,'' says Ryder, who lives in Manhattan,
reportedly with her boyfriend, actor Matt Damon.
 &HT;    Truth be told, she thinks Hollywood's fascination with pairing
older actors and younger actresses is a joke in and of itself.
 &HT;    ``It's really kind of gross,'' she says.
 &HT;    Later this year, Ryder intends to act in two additional
self-produced projects, including ``Roustabout,'' a small-scale
drama about the death of the American circus, and ``The Lambs of
God,'' which she describes as ``a socially conscious fairy tale.''
 &HT;    Ryder has long been regarded by many as the best actress of her
generation, and moviegoers and critics alike have been waiting for
her to find a film that befits her talent. Some might consider
``Girl, Interrupted'' that film, while one of those other personal
projects that she's developing might do the trick.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Ryder insists that she's enjoying herself as
much today as she did back in 1986, when she stepped onto the set
of ``Lucas,'' her big-screen debut.
 &HT;    ``It's weird, but I still feel like a kid in a way,'' she says.
``I still get really excited when I get a job, and I still get
really excited the first day of work. I'm still fascinated by the
camera, and I still love my job.
 &HT;    ``When I stop loving my job, I think that's when I'll stop,''
she adds. ``But I also know it's sort of up to the audience when
they stop liking me and stop going to see my movies.
 &HT;    ``That's when I'll stop, because I won't get hired!''

 `ALLY McBEAL'S' LUCY LIU HEADS FOR THE BIG SCREEN

 (Includes a color slide of Lucy Liu with Lolita Davidovich in a
scene from ``Play It to the Bone.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Being an angel can be hell.
 &HT;    Just ask Lucy Liu, who's late for Angels Training Camp.
 &HT;    The same way ``Saving Private Ryan'' (1998) staged a boot camp
for its actors, the new movie version of ``Charlie's Angels'' is
putting Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz through rigorous
training.
 &HT;    Of course, it's not exactly the same training.
 &HT;    Do they practice walking in bikinis? Are they learning to jiggle
like a bowl of Jello? Advanced students, perhaps, are mastering
walking with a slit in your skirt while yelling, ``Freeze,
scumbag!''
 &HT;    Liu laughs.
 &HT;    ``This is very serious business,'' the 31-year-old actress
insists. ``Our angels don't use guns at all. We just use our bodies
and whatever skills we can bring, both physically and mentally.
 &HT;    ``I've learned that patience is a virtue,'' she adds, ``and the
body is definitely breakable. And that I'm not immortal.''
 &HT;    Of course, they're not doing ``Serpico'' here.
 &HT;    ``It should be really fun,'' Liu says, ``which is the point of
it. Hopefully people aren't going to think it's Shakespeare. Drew,
Cameron and I just want to have a great time on the movie _ I think
that's going to show when we start shooting.''
 &HT;    Liu's entire life seems to be spent shooting one film or
television show or another these days _ in fact, she's speaking by
telephone from a courtroom set during a break in the taping of her
hit series, ``Ally McBeal.''
 &HT;    Besides her day job as ``Ally's'' vixen Ling Woo and the
upcoming ``Charlie's Angels,'' she co-stars in Ron Shelton's boxing
movie ``Play It To the Bone,'' opening Jan. 14, and will team with
Jackie Chan for next summer's ``Shanghai Noon.''
 &HT;    ``I haven't seen the light of day in months,'' she says only
half-jokingly. ``My only day off in the last year has been
Christmas.''
 &HT;    Liu didn't even make it to the recent cast screening of ``Play
It to the Bone,'' in which she plays a sultry hitchhiker who gets
picked up by two boxers (Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas) on
their way to Las Vegas.
 &HT;    ``From the minute I met Woody, it was just instant chemistry,''
she recalls. ``They basically hired me on the spot.''
 &HT;    Her scenes were shot in Las Vegas, but Liu says she didn't try
her luck at the casinos.
 &HT;    ``I didn't put one chip on the table,'' she says firmly. ``I
have an obsessive-compulsive personality _ if I put one chip down,
I'd be in jail for stealing somebody's car and trying to sell it to
get more money. I didn't even go there.''
 &HT;    Filmgoers may think she's come out of nowhere, but ``Ally
McBeal'' fans discovered Liu long since _ not that they necessarily
love her.
 &HT;    As she herself says, ``I hear from people who say, `The first
time I saw you on ``Ally McBeal,'' I was screaming at my TV set,
``Who is this bitch?'''
 &HT;    These days ``this bitch'' is perhaps a little less bitchy, Liu
adds. Ling is still a sharp-edged lawyer into fetishes, sex games
and tormenting men, but she's gained some depth this season.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm adding a softer element,'' Liu says. ``I want to
bring Ling around, so she's not flat. I don't want to get
pigeonholed as just playing the bitch _ it's boring. You want to
make sure you don't get bored yourself.''
 &HT;    As for ``the knee trick,'' the mysterious sexual technique which
is Ling's stock-in-trade, Liu pleads ignorance.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people come up to me on the street and ask about the
knee thing,'' the actress says. ``I say, `Don't ask me, ask (show
creator) David E. Kelley.' I don't even know what's involved _ all
we do is talk about it.''
 &HT;    Earlier this season, Liu and series star Calista Flockhart were
involved in a much-publicized lesbian kiss, a twist which caught
even Liu by surprise.
 &HT;    ``I opened the script one day,'' she recalls. ``I was reading
and said, `Oh, OK.' I kept reading and said, `That's funny.' Then I
got to the kiss and started screaming, `No way!'
 &HT;    ``That's the beauty of working with David E. Kelley.''
 &HT;    Both women were nervous shooting the scene, the actress admits.
 &HT;    ``We didn't chew a lot of minty gum,'' Liu says, laughing. ``We
were just very professional about it. We didn't talk about it a
lot, either _ we just said to each other, `How do you feel? Are you
OK? Great. Let's go.'''
 &HT;    In the end, Liu says, she enjoyed the episode.
 &HT;    ``The kiss was so simple and real,'' Liu says. ``It wasn't in
any way whoring the idea of two women kissing. It was a really
special moment.''
 &HT;    The show has had a lot of special moments for Liu since she
first auditioned _ for the role of Nellie Porter, which she didn't
get. But Kelley was so intrigued by her audition that he created
Ling specially for her.
 &HT;    ``I was shocked,'' Liu says.
 &HT;    Watching Ling on the prowl, it's hard to believe that, as a
girl, Lucy Alexis Liu had no thought of becoming an actress.
 &HT;    ``I was such a shy kid,'' she says. ``I would disappear into the
background. I had to learn that I could speak out and lightning
wouldn't strike me.''
 &HT;    A native of Queens, N.Y., Liu grew up in a family of serious
thinkers, her mother a biochemist and her father a civil engineer.
She earned a degree in Asian languages and cultures _ to please her
parents, she says _ at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
 &HT;    It was there that, on a whim, she auditioned for a college
production of ``Alice in Wonderland.'' She was cast as Alice, and
it changed her life.
 &HT;    ``It was either act or I couldn't do anything at all,'' Liu
says. ``I just couldn't live unless I was able to act _ it's in my
blood.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, her move to Los Angeles was initially unproductive,
leaving her working at a catering company to make ends meet. It was
not until she was cast in a small role in ``Gridlock'd'' (1997)
that her career took off, landing her other roles in ``City of
Industry'' (1997), ``True Crime'' (1998), ``Payback'' (1998) and
``Molly'' (1999).
 &HT;    Along the way came ``Ally McBeal,'' and suddenly Liu was a hot
actress, a fact which she admits isn't entirely gratifying.
 &HT;    ``I actually don't read my fan mail,'' she says. ``I have
somebody else do it for me, because it can get a little bit scary.
I did read the letters in the beginning, and I started to get a bit
paranoid. There were obsessives _ people told me too much about
themselves.
 &HT;    ``I think there is only so much time you have before one of
these people will come after you.''
 &HT;    Single, Liu spends her almost-nonexistent free time on
photography. She is also fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and practices
kali-eskrima-silat, a martial art which revolves around knife- and
stick-fighting.
 &HT;    A bit more sophisticated than you might expect from one of
Charlie's angels, but Ling promises that the film is more than
merely a reprise of the campy 1970s television hit.
 &HT;    ``My angel has her stuff together,'' she says. ``They're all
really intelligent. Each angel knows a lot about technology.
 &HT;    ``I can't really say if I'm more like Farrah Fawcett or Kate
Jackson,'' she adds. ``We're our own people. These are the modern
angels.''

STORM WARNING: NORMAN JEWISON ON DENZEL WASHINGTON, `HURRICANE'
CARTER AND MAKING MOVIES WITH MEANING

 (Includes a color slide of Norman Jewison directing Denzel
Washington in a scene from ``The Hurricane.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Denzel Washington strapped on his boxing gloves, and Norman
Jewison blanched.
 &HT;    The veteran director hadn't realized how much it meant to the
Oscar-winning actor to play former middleweight champion Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane'' until it came time to
film the boxing scenes.
 &HT;    ``Denzel went into the ring with a real boxer _ this guy wasn't
a stunt man, and they were throwing like 82 punches in a minute,''
the director recalls. ``They had to miss each other by just a
millimeter. Suddenly I thought, `What if somebody makes a
miscalculation?'
 &HT;    ``My greatest fear was that Denzel was going to end up with a
broken nose.''
 &HT;    Carter's ring career was cut short when he was wrongfully
convicted of a triple murder and sentenced to three consecutive
life terms in prison. It was more than 20 years before he was
finally freed through the efforts of a group of Canadian social
activists recruited by a young black boy who had read Carter's
story.
 &HT;    By that time, the former boxer had become an icon of racial
injustice in America, the subject of books, protest marches and
even a Bob Dylan song.
 &HT;    ``Denzel cared as much about being Rubin Carter as I've seen an
actor ever care about anything,'' Jewison says. ``Forget about the
money, forget about your agent, forget about your family, Denzel
felt he was destined to play this role. And that's great for a
director. He lost 44 pounds and he was solid muscle _ he'll never
look that good for the rest of his life.''
 &HT;    It was the opposite of what Jewison faced with Cher, who won a
Best Actress Oscar for her performance in his ``Moonstruck''
(1987).
 &HT;    ``She didn't want to play a 40-year-old Italian spinster with no
makeup,'' the director recalls. ``I told her, `You are my first
choice of any actress in the world and, if you don't take this
role, it's going to be the biggest mistake you ever made in your
life.'
 &HT;    ``So she said yes, and during filming she turned to me one day
and said, `Who was your second choice?'''
 &HT;    The Canadian-born Jewison has often been drawn to stories of
outsiders and minorities seeking justice, from ``In the Heat of the
Night'' (1967) to ``And Justice for All'' (1982) and ``A Soldier's
Story'' (1984). Carter's saga fascinated him.
 &HT;    ``I first read an article in Sports Illustrated,'' he recalls.
``Then I read the book Carter wrote in prison, `The Sixteenth
Round' (Viking, 1974). It won him support from everyone from Bob
Dylan, who wrote a song about him, to Muhammad Ali, but it wasn't
enough to get him his freedom. I thought, `This is a person who is
worth making a film about, because he never gave up _ he was able
to look at the concrete walls surrounding him and see beyond the
walls.'
 &HT;    ``It wasn't until after I'd made up my mind to do the film that
I actually met Rubin Carter,'' he adds. ``I found him totally
charismatic. He's incredible. I know Denzel had the same feeling
about him that I did. We both wished we could have found a part for
him, because he's that amazing _ not bitter or angry, in spite of
what he's been through.
 &HT;    ``As it was, he came to the set a few times and gave us all the
support he could.''
 &HT;    Washington and Jewison had first worked together on ``A
Soldier's Story,'' adapted from a play in which Washington had
earned an Obie Award. They had nearly reunited for ``Malcolm X''
(1992) _ Jewison had worked on the project for years before
director Spike Lee, after mounting a campaign insisting that the
film must have an African-American director, gained control of the
movie.
 &HT;    Jewison insists that he's not bitter toward Lee or toward
Washington, who was Oscar-nominated for the role.
 &HT;    ``I knew Denzel was destined to be Malcolm X,'' he says. ``I'm
not hurt, but I was surprised when Spike was making statements that
only a black artist could understand the black psyche. That's doing
a great disservice to art _ it's the kind of thing you might expect
a politician to say.''
 &HT;    Jewison had originally planned to make ``The Hurricane'' as a
television miniseries, he says, because of the epic scope of the
story.
 &HT;    ``Rubin's fight to regain his freedom spans decades,'' he
explains. ``It includes not only his own book but `Lazarus and the
Hurricane' (Viking, 1991), which focuses on the role of the young
black boy, Lesra Martin, who got his guardians involved.''
 &HT;    Eventually, Jewison chose to concentrate on Carter's
relationship with Lesra, who read ``The Sixteenth Round'' and began
to correspond with the ex-champion in prison.
 &HT;    ``I did have to leave a lot out,'' he admits. ``I'm certainly
not a fan of long movies, and I think too many are being made. The
one horror I have is boring the audience.
 &HT;    ``But I cut `Hurricane' from three hours and 10 minutes to a
little under two-and-a-half hours,'' he says. ``I couldn't make it
any shorter without sacrificing my artistic integrity.''
 &HT;    And, no, Jewison doesn't shy away from admitting that this is a
film with a message.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to think it's entertaining,'' he says. ``But I think
it's a reminder that, in a country that stands so strongly for
freedom, there's still a lot of racism. That is a fact. I think we
need to deal with it.
 &HT;    ``I think the time is right for that kind of message,'' he adds.
``When I did `In the Heat of the Night' , even though it was
at the height of the civil-rights movement, I didn't think anyone
would come to see it. Bobby Kennedy said to me, `This will be an
important film because the timing is right, Norman.'
 &HT;    ``I hope Bobby would have said the same thing about
`Hurricane,''' Jewish says. ``As we approach the millennium, it
isn't too bad to consider what Carter learned _ `Hate got me in
here, b can bust me out.'''
 &HT;    At 73, Jewison looks back on a career that has included four
Oscar nominations as Best Director _ he has never won, though he
received the prestigious Irving Thalberg Award at last year's
Academy Awards _ and finds perspective in the words of another
distinguished director.
 &HT;    ``The last time I saw the late John Huston, he was sitting on a
terrace looking out at the Pacific Ocean,'' he recalls. ``He had an
oxygen tank on his back because he had emphysema and, nevertheless,
he was smoking a cigar. I was terrified, because I thought he was
going to blow himself up.
 &HT;    ``He had just finished directing `The Dead,''' Jewison says,
``and I asked him what it was like. He took a sip of Cristal and
said, `Norman, it was just as tough to make as the first picture I
ever made.'''
 &HT;    Jewison pauses.
 &HT;    ``John's words were a reminder to me that you always have to
fight hard for the stories you want to tell,'' he says with a wry
smile. ``As you get older, there's just more at stake _ you're
starting to run out of time. But I'm proud of `Hurricane.' It took
eight or 10 years to get it to the screen, but it was worth it.
 &HT;    ``We all live by work and love,'' he concludes. ``And if you
don't love your work, life can be a little difficult.
 &HT;    ``I may be older, but I'm not cynical, not yet.''

 (Includes a color slide of Dennis Franz, Rick Schroder and Gordon
Clapp in a scene from ``NYPD Blue.'') 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before Jan. 9, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some days, it seems that Det. Andy Sipowicz is the most put-upon
person since the Book of Job.
</P>
<P>
   In that tale, you'll recall, God took away Job's family, his
health and all his material possessions, turning the poor fellow
into an icon of human suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 2,800 years and into the fictional world of ``NYPD
Blue,'' and you have Sipowicz (Dennis Franz), an Everyman living
his life cursed with alcoholism and illness, beset by his own
racism and inner turmoil, damaged by the deaths of a partner, his
wife and an estranged son. It often seemed as if life couldn't get
any worse.
</P>
<P>
   Then came last fall, when he almost lost his home.
</P>
<P>
   Not his real home, of course _ his home in our homes, the
television network where he had spent the last six years, the
channel from which he had been coming into our lives on a weekly
basis.
</P>
<P>
   In October, ABC delayed Sipowicz's return to the air when it
decided to use the 10 p.m. Tuesday slot usually occupied by ``NYPD
Blue'' to help boost its new drama ``Once and Again.'' The
long-running hit was elbowed aside, amid talk of a shift to ...
well, to some other night.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC hadn't counted on the response of the show's creator,
Steven Bochco, a veteran of shows such as ``Murder One'' and ``Hill
Street Blues.'' Exhibiting bulldog tendencies worthy of Sipowicz
himself, Bochco upped the ante, threatening to pull the show from
ABC and decamp to another network _ with NBC executives promising
to air the show Tuesdays at 10 if Bochco brought it their way.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a position to play hardball, though. Bolstered by a
unique blend of police procedural and personal drama, ``NYPD Blue''
consistently lands in the top 20 of the Nielsen ratings. In six
years on the air, it has won more than a dozen Emmys, including
three for Franz. Predictably, when the skirmishing was leaked to
the press, the show's fans reacted with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is a Hollywood story, so there's a happy ending:
Starting Jan. 11, ``NYPD Blue'' will return to its usual time slot.
Furthermore, the network will run all 22 new episodes straight
through to May, without the usual frustrating pause for midseason
reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the controversy grabbed headlines and, as Franz
says, ``Controversy certainly is not detrimental to any show.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor is speaking on location, standing at the side of a
grimy street in the eastern-Manhattan neighborhood known as
Alphabet City, where the new season is in its first week of
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Law &AMP; Order'' or ``Spin City,'' New York-based shows
which are actually shot in the city, ``NYPD Blue'' is largely shot
in Los Angeles. But the show always kicks off a new season with a
week of outdoor location shooting in New York, which helps connect
the cast, crew and writers with the heat of the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to start off that way, because you have the whole
energy of New York,'' says Kim Delaney, now entering her fifth
season as Det. Diane Russell. ``The cast hasn't seen each other for
a few months, so it's like going back to school, seeing everybody.
And we're in the same hotel here, as opposed to when we work in
L.A., where everybody goes home after work. You get connected to
each other faster like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After six years, Franz's identity is forever bound to that of
Sipowicz. Yet, along with head writer/co-executive producer David
Milch, Franz continues to find new angles on the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if Shakespeare had written about somebody, and had
been able to tell 125 or 130 stories about that person,'' the actor
says, referring to the number of existing ``NYPD Blue'' episodes.
``You really have a long time to completely investigate the
complexities of what makes up that person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers have a fascination with the Sipowicz character and
continue to explore him in such a great depth,'' Franz adds. ``For
an actor, that is a rare opportunity, to get to the dark, sad and
tragic places that he sometimes goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's wearing his character's unfashionable wardrobe,
Franz seems nothing like Sipowicz. He looks smaller, more gentle _
especially since a substantial offseason weight loss. His eyes are
inquisitive and owlish, rather than fearful, deep-set and pinched,
as they appear on screen. Franz is a man at ease, in short, a world
away from the fitful Sipowicz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is an inspiration,'' says Rick Schroder, who joined
``NYPD Blue'' last season as Det. Danny Sorenson. ``Our show makes
demands that other shows don't _ we have rewrites at the last
minute, there are things that would drive most people batty. But
Dennis excels in that environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson became Sipowicz's partner last year, replacing Det.
Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) after the character died. A year later
Delaney, whose character was married to Simone, still hasn't
entirely adjusted to the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was tough,'' she says. ``I still think it feels
different. It's like having a new child or something, and bringing
that into the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wearing a police uniform, Delaney radiates a coy sex
appeal, underlined by her gently tousled hair. It makes her a
favorite of real cops here, some of whom are guarding the set from
passersby. She makes being a member of the force seem sexy, edgy
but alluring. And, like the rest of the cops on the show, Russell
seems a real, imperfect human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``These characters are all written with such complexities and
demons,'' Delaney says. ``There's so much underneath whatever we're
saying. When he writes something, David Milch will talk to me and
give me, you know, 10 things to think about that aren't even on the
page, things that Russell might feel in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the show is that it manages to balance those
personal stories with compelling tales about police work. Bill
Clark, a retired New York cop who serves as co-executive producer,
prides himself on getting all the details right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay by the rules that detectives have to live with,'' he
sniffs, ``not the Hollywood rules.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, for example, that Sipowicz can't get a search
warrant simply because it's convenient to the plot _ he must have
legally defined probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show's distinguishing feature remains the personal
approach it takes to the detectives on the beat, and its
examination of their troubled lives. And Milch has no intention of
going any easier on his troubled leading man.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third season, a priest said to Sipowicz, `Don't give up
on God, he may not be done with you yet,''' Milch says. ``I don't
intend to lay off. I don't think God is done with Sipowicz.''

 (Includes a color slide of Winona Ryder with Angelina Jolie in a
scene from ``Girl, Interrupted.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Reality bites again for Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    The petite actress, who's spent most of her career playing
emotionally troubled characters, reaches for the gold ring of angst
in her latest film, ``Girl, Interrupted.''
 &HT;    Opening nationwide on Jan. 14, the film is based on Susanna
Kaysen's best-selling memoir of her two-year stint at a mental
institution in the late 1960s, a story harrowing even by
contemporary standards _ and one which resonated strongly with
Ryder herself.
 &HT;    ``When I read the book I was about 21, and I was just floored,''
the 28-year-old actress says as she settles into a chair at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. As always, she's polite yet reserved,
and speaks in a voice barely louder than a whisper.
 &HT;    ``I found it to be incredibly captivating,'' she recalls. ``I
hadn't read a character so brutally honest since I'd read Salinger.
It's very rare in literature to find brutal honesty without
self-indulgence, and cut with such humor.
 &HT;    ``It's usually very self-indulgent if it's that honest, almost
nauseatingly so.''
 &HT;    Almost obsessed with Kaysen's saga, Ryder bought the film rights
to the book. As executive producer, she was determined to protect
the material and see to it that director James Mangold, whom Ryder
handpicked after seeing his film ``Heavy'' (1994), could craft a
film in line with their shared vision.
 &HT;    ``Girl, Interrupted'' introduces Kaysen (Ryder) as a depressed
teen who, like many of the young women on her ward at Claymoore
Hospital, is nonetheless anything but insane. During her stay at
the institution Kaysen encounters a variety of people who change
her life, including a beguiling sociopath (Angelina Jolie), an
understanding nurse (Whoopi Goldberg) and the facility's head
psychiatrist (Vanessa Redgrave).
 &HT;    Ryder didn't find it hard to relate to Kaysen. At 19, after
ending her romance with then-beau Johnny Depp and working too hard
for too long, the actress briefly checked herself into an
institution during the filming of ``The House of the Spirits''
(1993).
 &HT;    ``It was actually for five days,'' she says. ``I think anybody
would back me up and say 19 is a tough age for anyone, whether
you're an actress or cramming for exams, and your parents are
driving you crazy and you're breaking up with your first love.
Whatever you're going through, it's a tough year.
 &HT;    ``I was working back-to-back on movies,'' Ryder recalls, ``and I
had a week off from this film, in which I was playing a political
prisoner and doing torture scenes in Portugal. I've always been a
terrible insomniac. I came back, and was so exhausted that I
checked myself into a clinic for sleep deprivation. But it was a
psychiatric ward.''
 &HT;    Ryder reports, however, that she gained nothing from the
experience.
 &HT;    ``It didn't help me at all,'' she says. ``The thing I did get is
that those places really don't help.
 &HT;    ``You don't go to a place where they give you a pill that fixes
you,'' she says bluntly. ``They don't give you a sheet of secret
answers. You can't pay enough money to have a place fix you, which
is incredibly upsetting when you think that you can. I thought, `I
have money, and if I pay them enough they're going to have to give
me some sort of cure for just feeling broken and confused and
ultra-too-sensitive for this world.'
 &HT;    ``But it didn't work like that,'' the actress says. ``I left
feeling just the same, pretty much, and just as tired. They really
didn't offer anything, except for group therapy, which was one hour
a day.
 &HT;    ``Then I went back to `House of the Spirits' _ and all of the
torture scenes got cut out! So I went through it for nothing.''
 &HT;    Ultimately, Ryder says, she found that she had to look within
herself to find any sort of healing.
 &HT;    ``It's what Susanna learns in the film, which is that there are
no answers,'' she says. ``When you finally accept that, that it's
OK not to have answers for everything, that it's OK not to be
perfect, that it's OK to be a human being and be confused, that
actually feeling crazy is normal ... ''
 &HT;    She trails off, groping for the right words, and starts again.
 &HT;    ``If you're sitting there and feeling that you understand the
world,'' she says, ``with war and disease and famine and violence
and assassinations, I'd worry about that person who understood all
of those things.
 &HT;    ``So feeling ... ''
 &HT;    A quizzical look crosses Ryder's face. She raises a finger to
her mouth.
 &HT;    `` ... granola in my teeth.''
 &HT;    The actress cracks up for a moment, then resumes her thought.
 &HT;    ``So feeling confused is actually just feeling like a human
being,'' she says. ``And it's important to understand that the only
place you can go to is yourself.''
 &HT;    It's been two years since Ryder's last film, ``Alien
Resurrection'' (1997), but it's unlikely that another hiatus of
comparable length will occur in the foreseeable future.
 &HT;    She's already completed the long-delayed supernatural thriller
``Lost Souls,'' and recently wrapped ``Autumn in New York.'' The
latter film, which she writes off as ``more of a job,'' is a drama
that casts her as a dying young woman who falls in love with
Richard Gere.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of jokes about the fact that Richard is old
enough to be my father,'' says Ryder, who lives in Manhattan,
reportedly with her boyfriend, actor Matt Damon.
 &HT;    Truth be told, she thinks Hollywood's fascination with pairing
older actors and younger actresses is a joke in and of itself.
 &HT;    ``It's really kind of gross,'' she says.
 &HT;    Later this year, Ryder intends to act in two additional
self-produced projects, including ``Roustabout,'' a small-scale
drama about the death of the American circus, and ``The Lambs of
God,'' which she describes as ``a socially conscious fairy tale.''
 &HT;    Ryder has long been regarded by many as the best actress of her
generation, and moviegoers and critics alike have been waiting for
her to find a film that befits her talent. Some might consider
``Girl, Interrupted'' that film, while one of those other personal
projects that she's developing might do the trick.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Ryder insists that she's enjoying herself as
much today as she did back in 1986, when she stepped onto the set
of ``Lucas,'' her big-screen debut.
 &HT;    ``It's weird, but I still feel like a kid in a way,'' she says.
``I still get really excited when I get a job, and I still get
really excited the first day of work. I'm still fascinated by the
camera, and I still love my job.
 &HT;    ``When I stop loving my job, I think that's when I'll stop,''
she adds. ``But I also know it's sort of up to the audience when
they stop liking me and stop going to see my movies.
 &HT;    ``That's when I'll stop, because I won't get hired!''

 `ALLY McBEAL'S' LUCY LIU HEADS FOR THE BIG SCREEN

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Lucy Liu with Lolita Davidovich in a
scene from ``Play It to the Bone.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Being an angel can be hell.
 &HT;    Just ask Lucy Liu, who's late for Angels Training Camp.
 &HT;    The same way ``Saving Private Ryan'' (1998) staged a boot camp
for its actors, the new movie version of ``Charlie's Angels'' is
putting Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz through rigorous
training.
 &HT;    Of course, it's not exactly the same training.
 &HT;    Do they practice walking in bikinis? Are they learning to jiggle
like a bowl of Jello? Advanced students, perhaps, are mastering
walking with a slit in your skirt while yelling, ``Freeze,
scumbag!''
 &HT;    Liu laughs.
 &HT;    ``This is very serious business,'' the 31-year-old actress
insists. ``Our angels don't use guns at all. We just use our bodies
and whatever skills we can bring, both physically and mentally.
 &HT;    ``I've learned that patience is a virtue,'' she adds, ``and the
body is definitely breakable. And that I'm not immortal.''
 &HT;    Of course, they're not doing ``Serpico'' here.
 &HT;    ``It should be really fun,'' Liu says, ``which is the point of
it. Hopefully people aren't going to think it's Shakespeare. Drew,
Cameron and I just want to have a great time on the movie _ I think
that's going to show when we start shooting.''
 &HT;    Liu's entire life seems to be spent shooting one film or
television show or another these days _ in fact, she's speaking by
telephone from a courtroom set during a break in the taping of her
hit series, ``Ally McBeal.''
 &HT;    Besides her day job as ``Ally's'' vixen Ling Woo and the
upcoming ``Charlie's Angels,'' she co-stars in Ron Shelton's boxing
movie ``Play It To the Bone,'' opening Jan. 14, and will team with
Jackie Chan for next summer's ``Shanghai Noon.''
 &HT;    ``I haven't seen the light of day in months,'' she says only
half-jokingly. ``My only day off in the last year has been
Christmas.''
 &HT;    Liu didn't even make it to the recent cast screening of ``Play
It to the Bone,'' in which she plays a sultry hitchhiker who gets
picked up by two boxers (Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas) on
their way to Las Vegas.
 &HT;    ``From the minute I met Woody, it was just instant chemistry,''
she recalls. ``They basically hired me on the spot.''
 &HT;    Her scenes were shot in Las Vegas, but Liu says she didn't try
her luck at the casinos.
 &HT;    ``I didn't put one chip on the table,'' she says firmly. ``I
have an obsessive-compulsive personality _ if I put one chip down,
I'd be in jail for stealing somebody's car and trying to sell it to
get more money. I didn't even go there.''
 &HT;    Filmgoers may think she's come out of nowhere, but ``Ally
McBeal'' fans discovered Liu long since _ not that they necessarily
love her.
 &HT;    As she herself says, ``I hear from people who say, `The first
time I saw you on ``Ally McBeal,'' I was screaming at my TV set,
``Who is this bitch?'''
 &HT;    These days ``this bitch'' is perhaps a little less bitchy, Liu
adds. Ling is still a sharp-edged lawyer into fetishes, sex games
and tormenting men, but she's gained some depth this season.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm adding a softer element,'' Liu says. ``I want to
bring Ling around, so she's not flat. I don't want to get
pigeonholed as just playing the bitch _ it's boring. You want to
make sure you don't get bored yourself.''
 &HT;    As for ``the knee trick,'' the mysterious sexual technique which
is Ling's stock-in-trade, Liu pleads ignorance.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people come up to me on the street and ask about the
knee thing,'' the actress says. ``I say, `Don't ask me, ask (show
creator) David E. Kelley.' I don't even know what's involved _ all
we do is talk about it.''
 &HT;    Earlier this season, Liu and series star Calista Flockhart were
involved in a much-publicized lesbian kiss, a twist which caught
even Liu by surprise.
 &HT;    ``I opened the script one day,'' she recalls. ``I was reading
and said, `Oh, OK.' I kept reading and said, `That's funny.' Then I
got to the kiss and started screaming, `No way!'
 &HT;    ``That's the beauty of working with David E. Kelley.''
 &HT;    Both women were nervous shooting the scene, the actress admits.
 &HT;    ``We didn't chew a lot of minty gum,'' Liu says, laughing. ``We
were just very professional about it. We didn't talk about it a
lot, either _ we just said to each other, `How do you feel? Are you
OK? Great. Let's go.'''
 &HT;    In the end, Liu says, she enjoyed the episode.
 &HT;    ``The kiss was so simple and real,'' Liu says. ``It wasn't in
any way whoring the idea of two women kissing. It was a really
special moment.''
 &HT;    The show has had a lot of special moments for Liu since she
first auditioned _ for the role of Nellie Porter, which she didn't
get. But Kelley was so intrigued by her audition that he created
Ling specially for her.
 &HT;    ``I was shocked,'' Liu says.
 &HT;    Watching Ling on the prowl, it's hard to believe that, as a
girl, Lucy Alexis Liu had no thought of becoming an actress.
 &HT;    ``I was such a shy kid,'' she says. ``I would disappear into the
background. I had to learn that I could speak out and lightning
wouldn't strike me.''
 &HT;    A native of Queens, N.Y., Liu grew up in a family of serious
thinkers, her mother a biochemist and her father a civil engineer.
She earned a degree in Asian languages and cultures _ to please her
parents, she says _ at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
 &HT;    It was there that, on a whim, she auditioned for a college
production of ``Alice in Wonderland.'' She was cast as Alice, and
it changed her life.
 &HT;    ``It was either act or I couldn't do anything at all,'' Liu
says. ``I just couldn't live unless I was able to act _ it's in my
blood.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, her move to Los Angeles was initially unproductive,
leaving her working at a catering company to make ends meet. It was
not until she was cast in a small role in ``Gridlock'd'' (1997)
that her career took off, landing her other roles in ``City of
Industry'' (1997), ``True Crime'' (1998), ``Payback'' (1998) and
``Molly'' (1999).
 &HT;    Along the way came ``Ally McBeal,'' and suddenly Liu was a hot
actress, a fact which she admits isn't entirely gratifying.
 &HT;    ``I actually don't read my fan mail,'' she says. ``I have
somebody else do it for me, because it can get a little bit scary.
I did read the letters in the beginning, and I started to get a bit
paranoid. There were obsessives _ people told me too much about
themselves.
 &HT;    ``I think there is only so much time you have before one of
these people will come after you.''
 &HT;    Single, Liu spends her almost-nonexistent free time on
photography. She is also fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and practices
kali-eskrima-silat, a martial art which revolves around knife- and
stick-fighting.
 &HT;    A bit more sophisticated than you might expect from one of
Charlie's angels, but Liises that the film is more than
merely a reprise of the campy 1970s television hit.
 &HT;    ``My angel has her stuff together,'' she says. ``They're all
really intelligent. Each angel knows a lot about technology.
 &HT;    ``I can't really say if I'm more like Farrah Fawcett or Kate
Jackson,'' she adds. ``We're our own people. These are the modern
angels.''

STORM WARNING: NORMAN JEWISON ON DENZEL WASHINGTON, `HURRICANE'
CARTER AND MAKING MOVIES WITH MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Norman Jewison directing Denzel
Washington in a scene from ``The Hurricane.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Denzel Washington strapped on his boxing gloves, and Norman
Jewison blanched.
 &HT;    The veteran director hadn't realized how much it meant to the
Oscar-winning actor to play former middleweight champion Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane'' until it came time to
film the boxing scenes.
 &HT;    ``Denzel went into the ring with a real boxer _ this guy wasn't
a stunt man, and they were throwing like 82 punches in a minute,''
the director recalls. ``They had to miss each other by just a
millimeter. Suddenly I thought, `What if somebody makes a
miscalculation?'
 &HT;    ``My greatest fear was that Denzel was going to end up with a
broken nose.''
 &HT;    Carter's ring career was cut short when he was wrongfully
convicted of a triple murder and sentenced to three consecutive
life terms in prison. It was more than 20 years before he was
finally frough the efforts of a group of Canadian social
activists recruited by a young black boy who had read Carter's
story.
 &HT;    By that time, the former boxer had become an icon of racial
injustice in America, the subject of books, protest marches and
even a Bob Dylan song.
 &HT;    ``Denzel cared as much about being Rubin Carter as I've seen an
actor ever care about anything,'' Jewison says. ``Forget about the
money, forget about your agent, forget about your family, Denzel
felt he was destined to play this role. And that's great for a
director. He lost 44 pounds and he was solid muscle _ he'll never
look that good for the rest of his life.''
 &HT;    It was the opposite of what Jewison faced with Cher, who won a
Best Actress Oscar for her performance in his ``Moonstruck''
(1987).
 &HT;    ``She didn't want to play a 40-year-old Italian spinster with no
makeup,'' the director recalls. ``I told her, `You are my first
choice of any actress in the world and, if you don't take this
role, it's going to be the biggest mistake you ever made in your
life.'
 &HT;    ``So she said yes, and during filming she turned to me one day
and said, `Who was your second choice?'''
 &HT;    The Canadian-born Jewison has often been drawn to stories of
outsiders and minorities seeking justice, from ``In the Heat of the
Night'' (1967) to ``And Justice for All'' (1982) and ``A Soldier's
Story'' (1984). Carter's saga fascinated him.
 &HT;    ``I first read an article in Sports Illustrated,'' he recalls.
``Then I read the book Carter wrote in prison, `The Sixteenth
Round' (Viking, 1974). It won him support from everyone from Bob
Dylan, who wrote a song about him, to Muhammad Ali, but it wasn't
enough to get him his freedom. I thought, `This is a person who is
worth making a film about, because he never gave up _ he was able
to look at the concrete walls surrounding him and see beyond the
walls.'
 &HT;    ``It wasn't until after I'd made up my mind to do the film that
I actually met Rubin Carter,'' he adds. ``I found him totally
charismatic. He's incredible. I know Denzel had the same feeling
about him that I did. We both wished we could have found a part for
him, because he's that amazing _ not bitter or angry, in spite of
what he's been through.
 &HT;    ``As it was, he came to the set a few times and gave us all the
support he could.''
 &HT;    Washington and Jewison had first worked together on ``A
Soldier's Story,'' adapted from a play in which Washington had
earned an Obie Award. They had nearly reunited for ``Malcolm X''
(1992) _ Jewison had worked on the project for years before
director Spike Lee, after mounting a campaign insisting that the
film must have an African-American director, gained control of the
movie.
 &HT;    Jewison insists that he's not bitter toward Lee or toward
Washington, who was Oscar-nominated for the role.
 &HT;    ``I knew Denzel was destined to be Malcolm X,'' he says. ``I'm
not hurt, but I was surprised when Spike was making statements that
only a black artist could understand the black psyche. That's doing
a great disservice to art _ it's the kind of thing you might expect
a politician to say.''
 &HT;    Jewison had originally planned to make ``The Hurricane'' as a
television miniseries, he says, because of the epic scope of the
story.
 &HT;    ``Rubin's fight to regain his freedom spans decades,'' he
explains. ``It includes not only his own book but `Lazarus and the
Hurricane' (Viking, 1991), which focuses on the role of the young
black boy, Lesra Martin, who got his guardians involved.''
 &HT;    Eventually, Jewison chose to concentrate on Carter's
relationship with Lesra, who read ``The Sixteenth Round'' and began
to correspond with the ex-champion in prison.
 &HT;    ``I did have to leave a lot out,'' he admits. ``I'm certainly
not a fan of long movies, and I think too many are being made. The
one horror I have is boring the audience.
 &HT;    ``But I cut `Hurricane' from three hours and 10 minutes to a
little under two-and-a-half hours,'' he says. ``I couldn't make it
any shorter without sacrificing my artistic integrity.''
 &HT;    And, no, Jewison doesn't shy away from admitting that this is a
film with a message.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to think it's entertaining,'' he says. ``But I think
it's a reminder that, in a country that stands so strongly for
freedom, there's still a lot of racism. That is a fact. I think we
need to deal with it.
 &HT;    ``I think the time is right for that kind of message,'' he adds.
``When I did `In the Heat of the Night' in 1967, even though it was
at the height of the civil-rights movement, I didn't think anyone
would come to see it. Bobby Kennedy said to me, `This will be an
important film because the timing is right, Norman.'
 &HT;    ``I hope Bobby would have said the same thing about
`Hurricane,''' Jewish says. ``As we approach the millennium, it
isn't too bad to consider what Carter learned _ `Hate got me in
here, but love can bust me out.'''
 &HT;    At 73, Jewison looks back on a career that has included four
Oscar nominations as Best Director _ he has never won, though he
received the prestigious Irving Thalberg Award at last year's
Academy Awards _ and finds perspective in the words of another
distinguished director.
 &HT;    ``The last time I saw the late John Huston, he was sitting on a
terrace looking out at the Pacific Ocean,'' he recalls. ``He had an
oxygen tank on his back because he had emphysema and, nevertheless,
he was smoking a cigar. I was terrified, because I thought he was
going to blow himself up.
 &HT;    ``He had just finished directing `The Dead,''' Jewison says,
``and I asked him what it was like. He took a sip of Cristal and
said, `Norman, it was just as tough to make as the first picture I
ever made.'''
 &HT;    Jewison pauses.
 &HT;    ``John's words were a reminder to me that you always have to
fight hard for the stories you want to tell,'' he says with a wry
smile. ``As you get older, there's just more at stake _ you're
starting to run out of time. But I'm proud of `Hurricane.' It took
eight or 10 years to get it to the screen, but it was worth it.
 &HT;    ``We all live by work and love,'' he concludes. ``And if you
don't love your work, life can be a little difficult.
 &HT;    ``I may be older, but I'm not cynical, not yet.''

 (Includes a color slide of Dennis Franz, Rick Schroder and Gordon
Clapp in a scene from ``NYPD Blue.'') 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before Jan. 9, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some days, it seems that Det. Andy Sipowicz is the most put-upon
person since the Book of Job.
</P>
<P>
   In that tale, you'll recall, God took away Job's family, his
health and all his material possessions, turning the poor fellow
into an icon of human suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 2,800 years and into the fictional world of ``NYPD
Blue,'' and you have Sipowicz (Dennis Franz), an Everyman living
his life cursed with alcoholism and illness, beset by his own
racism and inner turmoil, damaged by the deaths of a partner, his
wife and an estranged son. It often seemed as if life couldn't get
any worse.
</P>
<P>
   Then came last fall, when he almost lost his home.
</P>
<P>
   Not his real home, of course _ his home in our homes, the
television network where he had spent the last six years, the
channel from which he had been coming into our lives on a weekly
basis.
</P>
<P>
   In October, ABC delayed Sipowicz's return to the air when it
decided to use the 10 p.m. Tuesday slot usually occupied by ``NYPD
Blue'' to help boost its new drama ``Once and Again.'' The
long-running hit was elbowed aside, amid talk of a shift to ...
well, to some other night.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC hadn't counted on the response of the show's creator,
Steven Bochco, a veteran of shows such as ``Murder One'' and ``Hill
Street Blues.'' Exhibiting bulldog tendencies worthy of Sipowicz
himself, Bochco upped the ante, threatening to pull the show from
ABC and decamp to another network _ with NBC executives promising
to air the show Tuesdays at 10 if Bochco brought it their way.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a position to play hardball, though. Bolstered by a
unique blend of police procedural and personal drama, ``NYPD Blue''
consistently lands in the top 20 of the Nielsen ratings. In six
years on the air, it has won more than a dozen Emmys, including
three for Franz. Predictably, when the skirmishing was leaked to
the press, the show's fans reacted with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is a od story, so there's a happy ending:
Starting Jan. 11, ``NYPD Blue'' will return to its usual time slot.
Furthermore, the network will run all 22 new episodes straight
through to May, without the usual frustrating pause for midseason
reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the controversy grabbed headlines and, as Franz
says, ``Controversy certainly is not detrimental to any show.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor is speaking on location, standing at the side of a
grimy street in the eastern-Manhattan neighborhood known as
Alphabet City, where the new season is in its first week of
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Law &AMP; Order'' or ``Spin City,'' New York-based shows
which are actually shot in the city, ``NYPD Blue'' is largely shot
in Los Angeles. But the show always kicks off a new season with a
week of outdoor location shooting in New York, which helps connect
the cast, crew and writers with the heat of the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to start off that way, because you have the whole
energy of New York,'' says Kim Delaney, now entering her fifth
season as Det. Diane Russell. ``The cast hasn't seen each other for
a few months, so it's like going back to school, seeing everybody.
And we're in the same hotel here, as opposed to when we work in
L.A., where everybody goes home after work. You get connected to
each other faster like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After six years, Franz's identity is forever bound to that of
Sipowicz. Yet, along with head writer/co-executive producer David
Milch, Franz continues to find new angles on the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if Shakespeare had written about somebody, and had
been able to tell 125 or 130 stories about that person,'' the actor
says, referring to the number of existing ``NYPD Blue'' episodes.
``You really have a long time to completely investigate the
complexities of what makes up that person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers have a fascination with the Sipowicz character and
continue to explore him in such a great depth,'' Franz adds. ``For
an actor, that is a rare opportunity, to get to the dark, sad and
tragic places that he sometimes goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's wearing his character's unfashionable wardrobe,
Franz seems nothing like Sipowicz. He looks smaller, more gentle _
especially since a substantial offseason weight loss. His eyes are
inquisitive and owlish, rather than fearful, deep-set and pinched,
as they appear on screen. Franz is a man at ease, in short, a world
away from the fitful Sipowicz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is an inspiration,'' says Rick Schroder, who joined
``NYPD Blue'' last season as Det. Danny Sorenson. ``Our show makes
demands that other shows don't _ we have rewrites at the last
minute, there are things that would drive most people batty. But
Dennis excels in that environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson became Sipowicz's partner last year, replacing Det.
Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) after the character died. A year later
Delaney, whose character was married to Simone, still hasn't
entirely adjusted to the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was tough,'' she says. ``I still think it feels
different. It's like having a new child or something, and bringing
that into the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wearing a police uniform, Delaney radiates a coy sex
appeal, underlined by her gently tousled hair. It makes her a
favorite of real cops here, some of whom are guarding the set from
passersby. She makes being a member of the force seem sexy, edgy
but alluring. And, like the rest of the cops on the show, Russell
seems a real, imperfect human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``These characters are all written with such complexities and
demons,'' Delaney says. ``There's so much underneath whatever we're
saying. When he writes something, David Milch will talk to me and
give me, you know, 10 things to think about that aren't even on the
page, things that Russell might feel in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the show is that it manages to balance those
personal stories with compelling tales about police work. Bill
Clark, a retired New York cop who serves as co-executive producer,
prides himself on getting all the details right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay by the rules that detectives have to live with,'' he
sniffs, ``not the Hollywood rules.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, for example, that Sipowicz can't get a search
warrant simply because it's convenient to the plot _ he must have
legally defined probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show's distinguishing feature remains the personal
approach it takes to the detectives on the beat, and its
examination of their troubled lives. And Milch has no intention of
going any easier on his troubled leading man.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third season, a priest said to Sipowicz, `Don't give up
on God, he may not be done with you yet,''' Milch says. ``I don't
intend to lay off. I don't think God is done with Sipowicz.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Jan 4:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ARMAGEDDON (Undated) _ The site of Revelation's Armageddon
may in fact be Megiddo, some scholars speculate. And what's being
dug up there now is casting some doubt on the Bible as a reliable
history of King David and Solomon the Wise. By John Noble Wilford.
(1775 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRAIN (Undated) _ The finding that the brain develops and
maintains itself by adding new cells is the most revolutionary of
the '90s, the Decade of the Brain. The next decade promises to
generate a total revision of how scientists think human minds are
organized and constructed. By Sandra Blakeslee. (2050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENIUS-CRACKPOTS (Undated) _ The down side of become a famed
physicist is the unwanted attention it attracts from a wide range
of ``cosmic theorists,'' who attend talks and lectures with the
zeal of paparazzi pursuing a princess. Even Nobel laureates display
a willingness to engage the wooliest of theorists more often than
might be believed. The reasons vary, from fear of insulting someone
who does not seem quite stable to tolerance of a scientist who,
outside of a single, inexplicable obsession, does solid work. The
result is that certified geniuses and unmistakable crackpots
frequently come in contact. Einstein was no exception. By James
Glanz. (1080 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STORM-FORECAST (Paris) _ The storms that devastated France
last week were not unprecedented. But because they came in ``like a
cannon shot'' across the Atlantic, where weather monitoring

they would be. By Suzanne Daley. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>

clock, based on the pulse rate of the cesium atom, that could go
for 20 million years without losing a second. The practical
applications are yet to come. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FOSSIL-EROSION (Undated) _ For 65 million years, the fossil
triceratops now displayed at the National Museum of Natural History
in Washington lay protected in its rocky cocoon, immune to the
ravages of the outer world. But for the last 90 years, the hot
breath of musitors has been eating away this valuable
dinosaur, and now, like some of its fossil neighbors, it is
threatened with destruction. By Malcolm W. Browne. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on using
bacteria to clean up radioactive waste, new observations about ice
on Charon and reproductive patterns of a tiny malaria parasite. By
Henry Fountain. (725 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undted) _ Personal Health: Short midday naps
(taken about 8 hours after getting up) can bring about great
benefits, some researchers claim, pointing to many prominent people
known to be nappers. By Jane E. Brody. (1190 words) (The second of
two articles on sleep; the first, on the perils of lost sleep, is
available as a repeat.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CARSON-BRAIN-SURGERY (Undated) _ A conversation with Dr.
Benjamin S. Carson, the Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon known for
separating a pair of conjoined, or Siamese, twins, joined that the
back of the skull. He thinks in 3-D and now uses computer models to
practice brain surgery. By Claudia Dreifus. (1380 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOUTH-BACTERIA (Undated) _ New studies have revealed 37
previously unknown types of bacteria that thrive in the mouth.
Verne G. Kopytoff. (360 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-KIDS (Undated) _ Even children now are turning to
personal trainers, and at least some exercise experts don't think
it's such a great idea. By Randi Hutter Epstein. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PATIENT-RIGHTS (Undated) _ Patients have a right to informed
consent, and they're entitled to make the decisions about their
lives, even if they make the wrong ones. Doctors often try to
direct, but only sometimes is their advice followed. By Sandeep
Jauhar, M.D. (1540 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drivers who work night shifts or long hours (or who have more
than one job) are much more likely to be in a car accident caused
by being tired, a new study suggests. (275 words).
</P>
<P>
   _ Versatile vitamin C may also be effective in treating
moderately high blood pressure, the Pauling Institute reports. (250
words)

to explore the positive phenomena that occur in people who are
prisoners of war. (215 words)
</P>

their doctors, a medical journal concludes, but surgeons do a
better job than primary care doctors. (315 words)

   _ People with a history of depression do not necessarily have a
harder time of giving up smoking, but they may become more
depressed once the habit is broken. (185 words)

city immediately conjures up images of drug cartels, guerrillas and
gangs of kidnappers and hired killers. But Medellin is also the
hometown of Fernando Botero, 68, Latin America's most celebrated
living artist, and he is now putting the full weight of his renown
behind a wide-ranging effort to overhaul the city's reputation and
skyline. Over the next few months the painter and sculptor intends

THE REAL WATER-COOLER SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box info below) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics tend to dismiss them as old-fashioned, and reporters
covering the entertainment industry often shun them in favor of the
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayers'' and ``Will &AMP; Graces'' and ``Ally
McBeals'' of the world, shows considered trendy and edgy. They
don't always even get a lot of respect from executives on the
networks that air them.
</P>
<P>
   They may not land the highly sought-after age 18-to-49
demographic advertisers lust for, but they do have impressive
numbers of rabidly loyal viewers, larger even than many of the
trendy shows. They're family series like ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' ``7th Heaven,'' ``Providence'' and ``Judging Amy,'' and
dramas considered clean-cut like ``JAG,'' ``Diagnosis Murder'' and
``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy'' is viewed in about 5 million homes a week; six weeks
rarely passes without Sarah Michelle Gellar popping up in
Entertainment Weekly, or on the cover of some other magazine. By
contrast, ``JAG,'' the legal drama set against a naval backdrop
which airs opposite ``Buffy,'' has more than three times the
audience. However, its attractive stars, David James Elliott and
Catherine Bell, rarely generate much media heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood, the media and most producers in town are very
liberal and view the military as a negative,'' declares Don
Bellisario, creator and executive producer of ``JAG,'' as well as
previous hits ``Magnum P.I.'' and ``Quantum Leap.'' To them,
``JAG'' is ``just a military show, a shoot-'em-up. It's not. It's
as well written, directed and performed as any show I've ever made,
including `Quantum Leap,' which was a critical darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tackled issues such as gays in the military, segregation
issues, animal rights, all the issues that are popular among the
liberals in Hollywood, and because it's a military show, they write
it off,'' he continues. ``It astonishes me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven,'' about a minister and his predominantly
well-adjusted family, is the most-viewed series on the
youth-oriented WB network, but also its least written-about, though
it has its own teen heartthrob in Barry Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the publicity's hurting the other shows,'' laughs Brenda
Hampton, creator and executive producer of ``7th Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy winner ``Ally McBeal'' was hailed upon its arrival, yet
it's routinely beaten by the Ray Romano family situation comedy
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' even though one doesn't find Patricia
Heaton, who plays Romano's wife on the show, gracing any magazine
covers in a catsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have girls in bikinis,'' concedes Phil Rosenthal,
creator and executive producer of ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
``It's strange _ it's almost like the press picks who they want to
talk about and then puts them on the covers, whether or not the
audiences is actually watching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' was the beneficiary of media hype this past
fall season, while ``Judging Amy,'' which aired opposite it, was
virtually ignored. Nonetheless, ``Amy,'' about a single mother
leaving New York to live with her mother in a smaller city, is seen
in 5 million more homes weekly that its highly touted competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics like to focus on the `From the makers of ...' angle,
to tell what a show's pedigree is, and everyone mentioned
`thirtysomething' in reviews of `Once and Again.' Our credits were
summarily ignored,'' observes Barbara Hall, ``Amy's'' executive
producer, whose previously worked on such well-respected series as
``Northern Exposure,'' ``Moonlighting'' and ``I'll Fly Away.''
Joseph Stern, her partner on the series, counts the Emmy-winning
series ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey'' and ``Law &AMP; Order'' among his credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt a little overlooked,'' Hall says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, ``JAG,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and
``Judging Amy'' have all charted in the top 10 in the Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're water-cooler shows, just not the water-cooler shows at
The New York Times or Entertainment Weekly or Rolling Stone,'' says
David Wild, Rolling Stone's TV reporter and author of ``The
Showrunners,'' which examines last year's turbulent TV season from
the perspective of series creators. ``These shows have no snob
appeal. If you're at the coffeehouse where journalists hang out and
tell someone you're working on a story about `Providence,' you
don't score any points with anybody.

   ``The world view of most TV pundits doesn't extend far beyond
their navel,'' Wild continues. ``It shows a lack of vision not to
acknowledge that there are other kinds of TV and that some of it is
kind of good. Shows may have no snob appeal, but they still have
appeal. People who write about TV often forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Masius, creator and executive producer of ``Providence,''
about a doctor who returns to her Rhode Island hometown after her
mother's death, and previously a writer on ``St. Elsewhere,''
offers this: ```St. Elsewhere' was never on the cover of TV Guide
in the six years it was on the air,'' he points out, ``but they
released this list recently and picked it as the best drama of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Marsh, co-author of ``The Complete Directory to Prime Time
Network and Cable TV Shows,'' says that family shows of this nature
traditionally are the Rodney Dangerfields of network programming.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Waltons' was originally scheduled as a throw-away
opposite `The Flip Wilson Show,' which at the time was the No. 2
show on television,'' Marsh says. ``CBS figured, `This little show
can't possible compete with Flip; we'll lose. In its first year,
`The Waltons' knocked `Flip Wilson' out of the top 10, buried it in
its second season and went on to run seven more years.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to shows that seek to appeal to the lowest common
denominator or the series' creator's friends, the people behind
these shows think in terms both personal and with an eye on viewers
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is always to entertain,'' Bellisario says.
``I've been in Hollywood 20-some years, but still have the same
values and judgments as when I was a kid in a small town in
Pennsylvania. The shows I write reflect that. I don't do urban
angst shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``JAG'' aired its first season on NBC, where Bellisario endured
much network interference. ``NBC wanted an all-action show,'' he
recalls. ``They basically said, `If this is a cross between `Top
Gun' and `A Few Good Men,' we want `Top Gun.' They pressed for that
a lot.'' The network also insisted on a blonde actress, Tracey
Needham, who Bellisario says ``didn't fit the style of the show.''
Once NBC canceled the series, CBS quickly picked it up. ``Les
Moonves (CBS president) said, `Do the show you want to make,''' and
Needham was quickly replaced by Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal was just trying to make ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' a
winsome depiction of the lives of his and Romano's families. ``The
early comparisons to `Seinfeld' were weird _ we purposefully tried
not to imitate `Seinfeld,''' he says. ``If our show is hip at all,
we stumbled onto it just trying to be truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Says ``Amy's'' Hall, who was brought in to retool a concept
based on star Amy Brenneman's mother, ``I think of myself as the
audience. What I changed when I came in was the tone of the story.
It was a woman's story; I told it from a woman's point of view.
This particular one really spoke to me _ it's a personal story
about single motherhood. It's so much like my own life: single
motherhood, being in a male-dominated profession. I don't get into
these issues in big ways, we get into them in subtle ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven's'' Hampton's motivation was simple: ``When I dream
of watching TV with my daughter _ that's the show I wanted to
pitch.'' It happened to come at a time when The WB was aiming for a
family audience, which quickly evolved into the teen-heavy
demographic of today. ``By the end of the first year, they were
asking if I could make Matt and Mary bad teens,'' she recalls with
a laugh. ``At that point, I couldn't. If someone hires you to do a
job, you want to do what they hired you to do. At that point, the
character development had been established _ we couldn't just make
them the bad teens.''
</P>
<P>
   When devising ``Providence,'' Masius says that ``given the
nature of the emotional issues, we knew our core audience would be
women, but we weren't going to be so heavy-handed as to alienate
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably no accident that most of these programs feature
tight-knit families _ three of them feature multiple generations
living under the same roof or in very close proximity, and another
is about a close, large nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our show, the thing that's not real is that no one's family
is this good,'' Hampton says.
</P>
<P>
   ```7th Heaven' struck a chord in a time when schools have armed
guards and metal detectors,'' author Marsh points out. ``In the
real world, families are scattered to the four winds _ nobody knows
from relatives. There's a need to look at things as not as
confrontational as they've become, even on sitcoms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important element on `Judging Amy' is the family _
the extended family is not seen on TV,'' Hall adds. ``It's
significant that people are interested in that again. We show
different kinds of families _ not all look alike. It's a hopeful
show, showing a single mother doing well in a supportive
environment. It shows that a broken home doesn't have to be
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, `Providence' is entertainment and a fantasy,''
Masius says. ``It's obviously an attractive one. If people had
their druthers, they'd get along great with their siblings and
their parents and their kids. Instead, they're thousands of miles
away and not having support systems that are traditional.
</P>
<P>
   ```Providence' evokes a kind of a simpler time. The bottom line
_ friends and family are all you're left with, and people like the
opportunity to revisit that. It's strikes a chord in basic human
nature. You want to get back to the people most important to you,
to re-examine and re-evaluate those relationships.'' &QL;

   SCI-GENIUS-CRACKPOTS (Undated) _ The down side of become a famed
physicist is the unwanted attention it attracts from a wide range

a willingness to engage the wooliest of theorists more often than
might be believed. The reasons vary, from fear of insulting someone
who does not seem quite stable to tolerance of a scientist who,
outside of a single, inexplicable obsession, does solid work. The

 `MY RETURN TO KOSOVO'S KILLING FIELDS': An Exclusive 8-Part
Series   (The following provocative ``separate buy'' articles are from the

Times Syndicate. Please see purchase information at end of

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS:  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his hard-hitting dispatches from the front lines of Kosovo,
the Independent's veteran correspondent Robert Fisk was NATO's
sternest critic during the war in Kosovo _ the top international
news story of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut-based Fisk recently returned to Kosovo _ ``as I always do
after such conflicts'' _ to search for the war's first casualty:
truth. And to assess the war's real _ and continuing _ human toll.
</P>
<P>

extraordinary eight-part special report, ``My Return to Kosovo's
Killing Fields,'' with you and your readers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS:  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his hard-hitting dispatches from the front lines of Kosovo,
the Independent's veteran correspondent Robert Fisk was NATO's
sternest critic during the war in Kosovo _ the top international
news story of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut-based Fisk recently returned to Kosovo _ ``as I always do
after such conflicts'' _ to search for the war's first casualty:
truth. And to assess the war's real _ and continuing _ human toll.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Syndicate is pleased to share his
extraordinary eight-part special report, ``My Return to Kosovo's
Killing Fields,'' with you and your readers.
</P>
<P>

   &UR; SAFETY: The Odds Against the Weary Driver &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who work night shifts or long hours (or who have more
than one job) are much more likely to be in car accidents caused by
being tired, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the Highway Safety Research Center at the
University of North Carolina, said the study was the first of its
kind in which so many drivers involved in accidents had been
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Drivers who had been in fatigue-related accidents were more
than four times as likely to work at night as members of a control
group of drivers who had had accidents not tied to fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   _Twenty-seven percent worked 60 or more hours a week (compared
with 17 percent in the control group), and those in accidents were
almost twice as likely to work more than one job.
</P>
<P>
   _Sleeping less than six hours a night, being awake more than 20
hours or driving from midnight to 6 a.m. were all associated with
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The safety center interviewed 1,403 North Carolina drivers who
had been in crashes, including 467 in which fatigue or falling
asleep had been blamed.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers acknowledged that many people could do
little to change factors like working at night, they said they
wanted drivers to know how important it was not to drive when they
were tired. They even suggested roadside naps in extreme
situations.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that anyone who was chronically sleep-deprived
was at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could well happen to you,'' said Donald W. Reinfurt, the
deputy director of the highway center. ``When you think you're
doing fine, but you know you're beginning to get drowsy, don't push
it. It's not worth it because you're much more like to be in a
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TREATMENTS: For Hypertension, an Eye on Vitamin C &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The ever-versatile vitamin C may be put to new use.
</P>
<P>
   A daily supplement of the vitamin may help people who suffer
moderately high blood pressure, scientists from Boston University
and the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University reported
recently in The Lancet, a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Pauling, the chemist twice honored with a Nobel Prize (Peace and
Chemistry), became a passionate proponent of vitamin C, an
antioxidant, in the 1970s, suggesting that large doses of it could
ward off diseases like cancer. Many other scientists remain
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that when high blood pressure patients _ 45
people whose pressure was more than 140 over 90 _ were given 500
milligrams a day of vitamin C, mean pressures were reduced an
average of 9 percent. The benefits began about a month after the
vitamin was added to their diets. The researchers said they were
not sure how the process worked, and added that more research
needed to be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a significant finding that may be of
considerable value to patients who have moderately elevated blood
pressure,'' Dr. Balz Frei, the director of the Pauling center, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In previous studies, Frei and other scientists found that taking
vitamin C seemed to help the body's blood vessels remain relaxed,
reducing pain in angina pectoris patients and lowering the risk of
heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The institute has called on the government to double the
recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C to 120 milligrams a day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEHAVIOR: Seeking an Up Side to Traumatic Stress &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The damaging emotional legacy of traumatic events _ being held
as a prisoner of war, for example _ is well established. But some
researchers at the University of Michigan believe such experiences
may also have a positive side, bringing about deep changes in some
people.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are interested in what they say is the emerging
field of ``post-traumatic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   They define this as ``positive changes in self-perception,
interpersonal relationships and philosophy of life for people who
have undergone significant trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, using money from the Center for Naval Analysis, a
part of the Navy, plan to do a two-year study of Navy and Air Force
veterans who were POWs in Vietnam, comparing their findings with
studies of Vietnam War veterans who were not captured.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects will be sent detailed questionnaires, and the siblings
of some prisoners will also be surveyed to see if their impressions
match those of the former POW's.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope to be able to identify what factors make some
people more predisposed to benefit from trauma. Doing so, they say,
may make repatriating other former prisoners easier and may improve
treatments for people who undergo other types of trauma.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PATTERNS: At Doctor's Office, a Cloud of Confusion &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who leaves a doctor's office with a passel of
prescriptions and in a fog of confusion about what is wrong is
likely to be in abundant company.
</P>
<P>
   Patients, in fact, seldom get complete, understandable
information, a new study says. The report, in a recent Journal of
the American Medical Association, examined how well doctors
explained a range of options to patients and how often doctors made
sure the patients understood.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers listened to tapes of patients' appointments with
59 primary care doctors and 65 surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   In only 9 percent of the cases did patients receive what the
researchers considered enough information to make informed
decisions. Simple procedures, like follow-up screenings or lab
tests, elicited the best information, they found, while complex
ones like screening for prostate cancer, elicited the least.
Surprisingly, despite their reputation for being the most
autocratic, surgeons fared better than primary physicians, the
study said. The study provided examples of good and bad ways
doctors could work with patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should check your thyroid level to see if that is
causing your fatigue,'' a doctor says in one positive example.
``Does that seem reasonable?''
</P>
<P>
   The other approach: ``I'd like to check some blood tests. Here's
the slip to take to the lab.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers suggested that growing time pressure on doctors, was
part of the explanation. But whatever the cause, Dr. Michael J.
Barry of Massachusetts General Hospital, in an accompanying
editorial, said the findings presented ``a challenge to the medical
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most physicians would accept the importance of informed
consent to patient management as something more than just medical
necessity,'' Barry wrote. ``If that is the case, we, as physicians,
must do a better job practicing what we preach.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MENTAL HEALTH: A Healthy Move and a Possible Setback &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Smokers who think a history of depression means that they will
have a harder time quitting are wrong, researchers from Rhode
Island have found, but giving up cigarettes will not necessarily
make them any happier.

   Their new study runs counter to earlier research that found that
people with depression had more trouble cutting back or quitting
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, which appeared in the November issue of Nicotine
&AMP; Tobacco Research, documented an increase in symptoms of
depression that occurred about a month after the smokers began
trying to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by researchers from Brown University and
Miriam Hospital in Providence, looked at 133 smokers, 41 of whom
had a history of depression.
</P>
<P>
   The smokers were given some self-help publications and
instructions to quit on a specific date, seven days after their
first interview with researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In later examinations, the researchers measured the smokers' and
former smokers' symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and depression, as
well as their success at giving up smoking.

PERSONAL-HEALTH: NEW RESPECT FOR THE NAP, A PAUSE THAT REFRESHES 
</HEADLINE>
   LOSING SLEEP: Second of two columns on sleep debt.  
 (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You must sleep sometime between lunch and dinner, and no
halfway measures. Take off your clothes and get into bed. That's
what I always do. Don't think you will be doing less work because
you sleep during the day. That's a foolish notion held by people
who have no imaginations. You will be able to accomplish more. You
get two days in one _ well, at least one and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   --Winston Churchill
</P>
<P>
   As a short sleeper who is rarely in bed for more than six hours
a night, I'm a strong believer in naps for recharging my batteries.
Sir Winston and I are in good company. Napping enthusiasts have
included Albert Einstein, Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Edison and at
least three presidents: John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill
Clinton. Besides, sleep researchers have shown that regardless of
how long one sleeps at night, the human body is programmed to
become sleepy in the early afternoon, even without a big lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napping should not be frowned upon at the office or make you
feel guilty at home,'' writes Dr. James B. Maas, a psychologist and
sleep expert at Cornell. ``It should have the status of daily
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, people would doze for an hour or so after the
midday meal, and in some Latin American and European countries
siestas are still in vogue. But in most industrialized nations, the
usual response to the afternoon sag in energy is to try to
jump-start the system with caffeine, a tactic that sleep experts
say is actually counterproductive, creating only the illusion of
efficiency and alertness and depriving the body and brain of
much-needed sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there is growing evidence that restorative naps
are making a comeback. Recognizing that most of their employees are
chronically sleep-deprived, some companies have set up nap rooms
with reclining chairs, blankets and alarm clocks. If unions are
truly interested in worker welfare,hould make such
accommodations a standard item in contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who take advantage of the opportunity to sleep for 20
minutes or so during the workday report that they can then go back
to work with renewed enthusiasm and energy. My college roommate,
Dr. Linda Himot, a psychiatrist in Pittsburgh, who has a talent for
10-minute catnaps between patients, says these respites help her
focus better on each patient's problems, which are not always
scintillating. And companies that encourage napping report that it
reduces accidents and errors and increases productivity, even if it
shortens the workday a bit. Studies have shown that sleepy workers
make more mistakes and cause more accidents, and are more
susceptible to heart attacks and gastrointestinal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA scientist's study showed that 24-minute naps
significantly improved a pilot's alertness and performance on
trans-Atlantic flights. (The co-pilot remained awake.) Dr. David
Dinges, a sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, is a
strong advocate of prophylactic napping _ taking what he and others
call a ``power nap'' during the day to head off the cumulative
effects of sleep loss. He explained that the brain ``sort of
sputters'' when it is deprived of sufficient sleep, causing slips
in performance and attentiveness and often resulting in
``microsleeps'' _ involuntary lapses into sleep, in which accidents
can occur.
</P>
<P>
   A brief afternoon nap typically leaves people feeling more
energized than if they had tried to muddle through without
sleeping. Studies have shown that the brain is more active in
people who nap than in those who don't sleep during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Maas, the Cornell psychologist and author of ``Power Sleep''
(Villard Books, 1998), points out that naps ``greatly strengthen
the ability to pay close attention to details and to make critical
decisions.'' He also states that ``naps taken about eight hours
after you wake have been proved to do much more for you than if you
added those 20 minutes onto already adequate nocturnal sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of naps: brief ones taken to revive the
brain and long ones taken to compensate for significant sleep loss.
The reviving workday nap should not be longer than 30 minutes; any
more and the body lapses into a deep sleep, from which it is
difficult to awake.
</P>
<P>
   Long naps help when you've accumulated a considerable sleep debt
_ for example, when the previous night's sleep was much shorter
than usual, or when you know you will have to be alert and awake
considerably later than your usual bedtime. I usually try to nap
for an hour or more before attending a play, concert or late party.
But long naps have a temporary disadvantage: they cause what
researchers call sleep inertia, a grogginess upon awakening that
can last about half an hour. Also, long naps can affect the body's
clock, making it more difficult to wake ue proper time in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   As Maas maintains, ``Brief naps taken daily are far healthier
than sleeping in or taking very long naps on the weekend.'' They
are also far better than caffeine as a pick-me-up. ``Consumption of
caffeine will be followed by feelings of lethargy and reduced REM
(or dream) sleep that night,'' Maas writes. ``A debt in your sleep
bank account is not reduced by artificial stimulants.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that naps be scheduled for midday because
late-afternoon naps can cause a shift in your biological clock,
making it harder to fall asleep at night and get up the next
morning. To keep naps short _ 15 to 30 minutes, set an alarm clock
or timer. Westclox makes a gadget called Napmate, a power-nap alark that has a one-button preset so you can program your nap to
last for a specific number of minutes. If you can lie down on a
couch or bed, all the better. If not, use a reclining chair. You
need not follow Churchill's advice to get undressed, but make
yourself as comfortable as possible. Lap robes are very popular and
inexpensive; if a blanket helps you to doze off, use one.
</P>
<P>
   Try to take your nap about the same time each day. Maas
recommends a nap eight hours after you wake up (in the middle of
your day, about eight hours before you go to bed at night). Even on
days when you don't feel particularly sleepy, he suggests taking a
rest rather than a coffee break at your usual nap time.
</P>
<P>
   There are special cases. People who have trouble falling asleep
at night might be wise to avoid daytime naps. Parents of newborns
should nap when the baby does, rather than using all the baby's
sleep time to do chores.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, naps are often essential for people trying to work
through illness, injury or chemotherapy, even if they get adequate
sleep at night. A woman I know who continued working while
receiving cancer therapy napped each day on the floor under her
desk. Like so many workplaces, hers had no suitable place to rest.

RUSE IS A RUSE IS A RUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 9)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)

<P>
   That's nothing but a  &UR; ploy &LR; ,'' said Bill Bradley to Al Gore on
``Meet the Press'' last month.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were locked in TV combat. Gore had just suggested
that the twoDemocratic candidates pledge to shun TV commercials
and engage only in debates. The vice president dramatically
extended his hand and said: ``I'm ready to agree right now. Debates
aren't  &UR; ploys &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley looked at his opponent's hand like an uninterested palm
reader; he wasn't having any part of the surprise offer: ``No, to
come here, shake my hand _ that's nothing but a  &UR; ploy &LR; .'' At Gore's
repeated usage of the word, Bradley edged it with increasing scorn,
adding, ``I'm not someone who's interested in  &UR; tactics &LR; , Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Across America, the question arose: Was the no-commercials
proposal a sincere suggestion, as Gore maintained, or was it merely
a  &UR; ploy &LR; ,  &UR; tactic &LR; ,  &UR; ruse &LR; ,  &UR; stratagem &LR;  or  &UR; trick &LR; , as Bradley
insisted? Around the world, viewers asked a more fundamental
question: What is a  &UR; ploy &LR; , anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The attack word is closely associated with the current campaign.
Two months ago, Cragg Hines of The Houston Chronicle wrote that
``Gore has repeatedly tried the weekly debate  &UR; ploy &LR;  against
Bradley, who has refused to take the bait.''
</P>
<P>
   A month before that, when Gore relocated his headquarters to
Nashville, Tenn. _ the better to detach from Washington Beltway
associations and re-establish middle-American roots _ Tex Austin, a
musician and cowboy-boot salesman, was quoted deriding the move in
The Chicago Tribune: ``This is obviously just a political  &UR; ploy &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This drew an observation from James Dao, a New York Times
reporter: ``History may someday show that voters viewed Gore's
headquarters shift as a disingenuous  &UR; ploy &LR;  or, more likely, a move
that was forgotten the day after it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The word's origin is shrouded in mysterious Highland vapors.
Most etymologists believe it to be the product of aphesis, the
process by which we clip unaccented vowel syllables off a word's
stem. That is how  &UR; alone &LR;  becomes  &UR; lone &LR;  and  &UR; around &LR;  becomes
 &UR; round &LR; . (``Is the Lone Ranger round here, Tonto?'')
</P>
<P>
   In this hypothesis regarding the origin of  &UR; ploy &LR; , the Scottish
dialect clipped the  &UR; em &LR;  off the verb  &UR; employ &LR;  to create a noun
that meant ``activity'' and later ``an amusing way to pass the
time; an escapade, hobby or sport.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Stephen Potter, the British author of ``Gamesmanship''
and ``Lifemanship'' and the coiner of  &UR; one-upmanship &LR; , gave the
word a tongue-in-cheek sense of ``a maneuver to gain the better of
an opponent or co-worker.'' He wrote, ``Each one of us can, by
 &UR; ploy &LR;  or  &UR; gambit &LR; , most naturally gain the advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following decade, the Potter sense of the word was
snatched up into the language of diplomacy. An occasional plot
device in the 19th century novels of Anthony Trollope involved the
misheard proposal or the misread caress. A man would say or do
something innocuous; a Victorian maiden would interpret that word
or gesture romantically and accept what she considered amounted to
a proposal of marriage; and the poor (or lucky) fellow found
himself affianced.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Rufford makes such a gesture to the husband-hunting
Arabella Trefoil in Trollope's 1875 ``American Senator'' and finds
himself in the center of Trefoil's formidable attempt at landing a
proper mate. (Her attempt does not succeed.) Trollope uses the same
 &UR; ploy &LR;  four years later in ``John Caldigate,'' in which John gets
thrown into a linen closet with his cousin Julia and comes out, ins and her mother's minds, engaged.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, President Kennedy
received two messages from the Soviet Union's Nikita Khrushchev:
One was informal and ambiguous, a later one more official and
threatening. He chose to ignore the later one and to interpret the
earlier one as an offer to remove Soviet missiles in return for a
pledge not to invade Cuba _ an inference that left Khrushchev with
his nonoffer ``accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   This deft maneuver was described in what some felt was the myth
making that followed as ``the Trollope  &UR; ploy &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In current usage, a  &UR; ploy &LR;  is more cunning than a  &UR; subterfuge &LR; ,
not as overtly false or bookishly old-fashioned as a  &UR; ruse &LR;  and
somewhat more creative than a  &UR; tactic &LR; . It is not planned in as
much detail as a  &UR; stratagem &LR; , is less contrived than an  &UR; artifice &LR; 
and does not have the coquettish quality of a  &UR; wile &LR; . A  &UR; ploy &LR;  is
more underhanded than a  &UR; maneuver &LR;  and not as playful or artful as
a  &UR; dodge &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Another synonym is  &UR; gambit &LR; , which began as an opening move in
chess that sacrifices a pawn to gain position for a more powerful
piece. By metaphoric extension, a  &UR; gambit &LR;  can range from an
enticing opening in conversation to a  &UR; tactic &LR;  in gaining advantage
in business.
</P>
<P>
   In the lexicon of trickery, a correct gamesman uses a  &UR; gambit &LR; 
while an engaging rogue employs a  &UR; ploy &LR; , and the mildest deceiver
trots out a  &UR; gimmick &LR; . When Bill Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser,
followed up his candidate's  &UR; ploy &LR;  characterization by castigating
Gore for ``resorting to contrived  &UR; gimmicks &LR; ,'' his use of
 &UR; contrived &LR;  was redundant.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, as we see, a  &UR; ploy &LR;  is double-edged; accusations of
trickiness can get tricky. In dealing with nationalities, Winston
Churchill observed in 1906: ``Nothing is more fatal than a  &UR; dodge &LR; .
Wrongs will be forgiven, sufferings and losses will be forgiven or
forgotten, battles will be remembered only as they recall the
martial virtues of the combatants; but anything like a  &UR; trick &LR;  will
always rankle.''

ROBIN ROMANO, 45; GLOBE ASST. SPORTS EDITOR BATTLED CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Robin Romano, an assistant sports editor at the Boston
Globe known for inspiring colleagues and friends with her passion
for sports, her flair for journalism and her penchant for off-key
crooning, died of cancer Monday at her home in Marblehead. She was
45.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Romano was born in Marblehead and graduated in 1972 from
Marblehead High, where she served as captain of the softball,
basketball and soccer squads, was top player on the golf team, and
developed a life-long love of athletics. She attended Northeastern
University on a scholarship, playing on the softball and basketball
teams and graduating in 1977 with a degree in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first newspaperwomen to cover major sporting events,
Miss Romano held writing and editing jobs on most of America's best
newspaper sports sections. She was drawn to sports journalism by
her late father, Anthony, who for 50 years worked as a reporter,
writer and sports editor at the Salem Evening News until he retired
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Romano began her journalism career in 1973 as a co-op
student at the Quincy Patriot Ledger, for which she would cover the
1975 World Series and the '76 NBA playoffs. ``She was just one of
those people you could see instantly would be great. You know the
kind,'' said Fred Turner, who hired Miss Romano in Quincy and now
is the sports editor at the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. ``She
walked in and started interviewing for the co-op spot, and I said
to myself, `This one's going to make it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her next job was in 1977 at the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, where
she covered the Celtics for four years and the Patriots for two,
along with writing a weekly column. In 1981, she moved to the old
Washington Star, where she was a copy editor and wrote part-time.
After the Star folded, she worked as a senior copy editor at the
Atlanta Constitution, then moved to the Dallas Morning News to
supervise layout and oversee a weekly, in-season special section on
the Cowboys, working for one of the most respected names in sports
journalism, Dave Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin Romano's loss is a personal tragedy for me, but also a
major tragedy for the journalism profession,'' Smith said. ``Robin
was a special journalist . . . talented with a solid work ethic and
a love of the profession. Robin had a great sense of values. She
always put God and family first. And she loved people.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Romano was hired as Sunday sports editor at the Orange
County Register in 1984 and a year later was promoted to assistant
sports editor. She was in charge of the paper's special sports
sections, was instrumental in its award-winning coverage of the
1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, and assigned writers to stories. As
much as they remain impressed by her organizational and layout
skills, her California colleagues remember her even more as a
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just very warm and cared about everybody,'' said Mark
Whicker, a sports columnist at the Register since 1987. ``She'd
tease people about things and would like to be teased by others _
especially about the Celtics and golf. Everybody could talk to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing Robin liked most about southern California was its
almost year-round sunshine, which meant more time for golf. ``I
played with and against her a few times,'' Whicker said. ``She'd
swing easy, and it'd go a long way. I do remember she wouldn't
always give you the putt you wanted her to give you.''
</P>
<P>
   That competitive spirit, and the skill to back it up,
characterized Miss Romano's golf game anewsroom performance
when she returned to Massachusetts in November 1989 to take an
assistant sports editor's job at the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the process of hiring her, she would always
mention how much she loved trying to beat the larger paper in
southern California, the LA Times,'' said Globe sports editor Don
Skwar. ``But I knew about her competitive nature a few years
earlier when I'd met her for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Dallas at a wedding of a friend who worked at the
Dallas Morning News, and Robin was working there at the time. We
were at a pre-wedding party, and Robin and I started talking about
golf. She mentioned that she golfed, and we talked about getting a
game going the next day. I asked her what her handicap was, and in
the space of about 40 seconds, it grew from a 7 to a 17. She knew
she might be playing against me, so she was greasing the skids. I
knew right then and there that some day, she should be working for
us at the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Her editing duties at the Globe included overseeing special
sections on topics ranging from baseball and football to the Boston
Marathon, the Olympics, and the closing of the Garden, and helping
put out the daily and Sunday papers. She was a critical factor in
the more than two dozen national awards the Globe won during her 10
years there and helped make it what sports editors across the
country agree year after year is among America's premier sports
sections.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, however, don't capture the depth of her
contribution. She was a master at bringing together photographers
and designers, writers, editors and layout artists to produce
special sections, series and daily papers. She had an exceptional
eye for laying out a compelling page, an ear for distinguishing
good story ideas, and a sense of how to draw in fans, those who
were avid like her as well as rainy day ones. And she had a special
way with office interns, some of whom composed poems to her in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was her ability to come up with compelling story
ideas the way she did in creating a section commemorating the 100th
Boston Marathon. Recognizing that it was the course itself that
helped distinguish the race, she took readers to each key spot,
from the start in Hopkinton to Heartbreak Hill, letting them see
and feel the route through the words of marathon legends and
seasoned journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Romano also helped report, write, edit and lay out three special
series, all of which grew in part out of her personal experiences
and two of which won national awards. The first was on the way
greyhounds are sometimes mistreated during and after their racing
careers, which she knew about as the owner of a greyhound named
Poppy. The second, called ``Kids and Sports,'' looked at what can
be an excessively competitive world of youth sports that she knew
about through her long sports career and the experiences of her
niece and nephews. The most recent involved medical errors, a topic
she approached even as she was fighting her own colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin was a gifted journalist, but more importantly her
friendliness, her thoughfulness and her smile lifted the spirits of
all of us who worked with her,'' said Globe Editor Matthew V.
Storin. ``The Globe family has sustained an irreparable loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The last story Miss Romano wrote for the Globe was a review last
April of the book, ``Born to Play,'' by baseball player Eric Davis.
Like Miss Romano, Davis was battling colon cancer; and like him,
she inspired friends with the lessons the disease taught her. Miss
Romano wrote that Davis ``chooses not to tell a tale of suffering
and heartbreak but of how _ out of adversity _ one can learn to
appreciate life and set an example for others to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the Globe, Miss Romano collected two women's
championships at Thorny Lea Country Club in Brockton and was a
fixture in the winner's circle at events of the Women's Golf
Association of Massachusetts. While she loved most sports, her
favorites were baseball and basketball, while her passions were the
Red Sox and watching the horses run at Suffolk Downs.
</P>
<P>
   As her sickness limited her stamina, Miss Romano took up walking
and cycling. She also spent even more time with her family. But she
almost never complained, not to her brother, Anthony, and sister,
Ruth of Salem, or to her mother, Myrtle. And especially not to her
doctors and nurses, who became her friends. She liked to sing
publicly, particularly Barbara Streisand tunes, but she never let
on whether she accepted the widely-held view that she could not
hold a note. And when Globe colleagues recently presented her with
their tape of Streisand's ``People,'' she said, ``They were worse
than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, when she was undergoing treatment at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, she took 100 sick children from there to a
Celtics game and got Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri to come along.
And last month, when she was so weak she could barely stand, she
worried about how her family was handling her illness and what she
could do to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed at some of the darkest moments,'' says friend and
colleague Marcia Dick. ``One Friday afternoon after the cancer came
back, her oncologist and her surgeon were battling over whether she
should have more surgery or go back on chemo. Her mother and I were
ashen, but she bolted down a sandwich from Boston Chicken while
discussing the options.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved junk food, but she learned to love broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   A funeral Mass will be held Saturday at Star of the Sea Parish
in Marblehead, followed by burial at Waterside Cemetery. In lieu of
flowers, expressions of sympathy may be made in her memory to the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 1309 Beacon St., Brookline, MA 02115;
Hospice of the North Shore, 10 Elm St., Danvers, MA 01923; and
Greyhound Friends, 167 Saddle Hill Rd., Hopkinton, MA 01748.

 &HT;    DID CIA RANSACK GREEK JOURNALIST'S OFFICE?
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A reporter's interview of a potential political
adversary of the president of the United States touches a sensitive
nerve at the very highest level of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the FBI gets a call from one of the president's
closest aides and immediately opens an investigation of the
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency is called to the White House and
ordered to investigate the reporter and his story.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the reporter's office is ransacked _ at the
very moment he is having dinner at the invitation of a high-ranking
U.S. government official.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate?
</P>
<P>
   Try Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Greek journalist Elias P. Demetracopoulos says he
believes his 1961 interview with Adm. Arleigh Burke, then chief of
naval operations, caused the Kennedy White House to resort to
extraordinary and illegal measures against him.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he accuses Kennedy press secretary Pierre Salinger
of initiating investigations of him by the CIA and the FBI. He also
suggests that the CIA ransacked his Athens office while he was
dining with the U.S. ambassador to Greece``I just don't remember anything about that,'' Salinger said in
a telephone interview from Paris. ``I'm sorry, but it's just not
something that's in my brain.''

<P>
   Demetracopoulos says documents he has obtained from the FBI and
the Central Intelligence Agency support his conclusions.
   In an article in the January issue of ``Proceedings,'' a
magazine of the U.S. Naval Institute at Annapolis, Md., he says his
experience illustrated ``a kind of paranoia'' in the Kennedy White
House, ``... almost the sort of paranoia that was to grip, then
consume, and finally overwhelm the Nixon administration a decade
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Demetracopoulos, now 71, is retired and lives in Washington. In
early 1961, he was political editor of three Greek dailies,
Macedonia, Ethnos and The Athens Daily Post. He also was Athens
correspondent for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He
came to Washington in January 1961 to cover the inauguration of
President-elect John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the inauguration, the Greek journalist interviewed
several U.S. officials, including Burke. Like Kennedy, Burke was a
War War II naval hero.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``Thirty-one-Knot Burke'' because of the high
speed he ran the ships under his command in the Pacific, the
admiral was known for his hard-line views of the Soviet Union. He
died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1961, amid speculation that he had presidential
aspirations, some Republican leaders already were urging him to run
against Kennedy in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   His comments during the Demetracopoulos interview included a
response to threats by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to shoot
down any U.S. Sixth Fleet aircraft flying over the Black Sea and to
deny the Navy surface ships access to the the sea. The subject was
important to Greek readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Admiral replied in his usual no-nonsense manner, warning
the Soviet Union that it would come out second best in a nuclear
confrontation with the United States,'' Demetracopoulos writes.
``He asserted the right of U.S. warships to sail in the Black Sea,
despite Soviet objections.''
</P>
<P>
   Demetracopoulos said the interview, in which Burke expressed
other, similar views on the Russians and nuclear war, was taped and
transcribed by the Navy. Pursuant to ground rules for the
interview, the transcript was reviewed by the Navy and a copy
delivered to him, stamped, ``No objection to publication on grounds
of national security.'' The stamp was dated ``JAN 16 1961.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Kennedy was inaugurated, amid concern in some
military circles that his administration would fail to maintain
former President Dwight Eisenhower's vigilance against Soviet
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of this sentiment, the new president on Feb. 9,
1961, issued an order that top military officers clear all public
statements with the White House and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Demetracopoulos was back in Athens, transcribing his
interview notes, translating them into Greek and writing stories.
On Feb. 14, his story based on the Burke interview was released
simultaneously to the three Greek dailies and North American papers
subscribing to the NANA news wire. It was widely published the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   In light of what was being called a Kennedy White House ``gag
policy,'' the story carried an editor's note, declaring that the
interview had been conducted and cleared before the policy was
announced, indeed before Kennedy became president.
</P>
<P>
   The story generated a stir, although the president noted during
another press conference _ on the day the story was published _
that the interview had taken place prior to his taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy got a laugh from White House correspondents when he
declared, ``I would say that this makes me happier than ever that
such a directive has gone out.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Demetracopoulos said records he has obtained from the
CIA and FBI show the administration did not drop the matter. The
day after the second press conference, Demetracopoulos writes,
Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre Salinger, summoned CIA officials
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several lines describing the meeting have been expunged from
the copy of the memo the CIA provided me,'' Demetracopoulos writes.
``Then, at the bottom of the page, the text resumes with this
comment: 'It has not as yet been established definitely whether the
cited interview was a personal one with Admiral Burke or based on
questions submitted to him in writing by (Demetracopoulos). In
addition, there is some doubt as to the exact date of the
interview, which is the crux of the
</P>
<P>
   entire investigation, inasmuch as the establishing of an
interview date prior to or after January 20, 1961, is of prime
importance to President Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Proceedings article refers only to contacts between
the White House and the CIA, Demetracopoulos said in an interview
last month that documents he has obtained from the FBI show that on
Feb. 17, Salinger telephoned J. Edgar Hoover, then director of the
FBI, and initiated an investigation by that agency as well.
</P>
<P>
   Demetracopoulos said that because he was aware that his story
was creating a stir in the United States, he published a follow-up
on Feb. 19, along with a photograph of the Navy stamp at the top of
the interview, showing his conversation with Burke took place on
Jan. 12, too early to have been subject to the Kennedy directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA file does not show when or what the CIA reported back
to Salinger,'' he writes. ``The redacted file gives no hint of what
actions the CIA took to try to answer the questions Salinger posed
on behalf of the President. But I believe that the file is related
directly to an experience I had back in Athens.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that shortly after the second article was published, he
was telephoned by the late Ellis O. Briggs, then the U.S.
ambassador to Greece, inviting him to dine privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Briggs asked that I bring along my stamped copy of the
interview,'' he writes. Instead, Demetracopoulos said he placed the
original copy of the interview in a bank deposit box and brought a
copy to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was having dinner with the ambassador, and the
original copy of the interview reposed safely in a central Athens
bank safety deposit box, my office was burglarized,'' he said. ``No
valuables were removed, but my files were rifled. Could this be
what the CIA was doing for Salinger? The agency certainly knew that
I was at the U.S. Embassy that evening and would not be working at
my office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over decades, my office was never burglarized, except that one
night. A mere coincidence? Possibly. But I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote to the article, Demetracopoulos quotes a passage
from the book ``The Dark Side of Camelot,'' by journalist Seymour
Hirsch: ``Demetracopoulos suffered for publishing his interview
with Burke: a State Department notice eventually was sent to all
American embassies in NATO countries cautioning senior officials
against the granting of any interviews to him. He also was
investigated for years by the CIA, at the request of Pierre
Salinger, the White House press secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Naval Institute is a private research and publishing
organization with offices on the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy.
The full text of Demetracopoulos's article can be found at the
institute's Internet site, www.usni.org.

   &UR; Harnessing Bacteria &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that if World War III were to occur, perhaps
the only thing left alive on the planet would be swarms of
radiation-resistant bacteria. But before those bugs get the run of
the place, at least one team of scientists would like to put them
to work.
</P>
<P>
   A researcher from the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences, with colleagues, has re-engineered the most
radiation-resistant form of bacteria known, with the goal of using
it to clean up the toxic mess left behind at radioactive waste
sites associated with the production of nuclear weapons. Their work
is reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to containing radioactive elements like uranium,
these sites, of which there are about 1,000 in the United States
alone, are often also contaminated by heavy metals like mercury and
by toluene and other organic solvents. The bacterium, D.
radiodurans, has already been shown to be effective in breaking
down some organic contaminants. The trick was getting it to deal
with heavy metals as well.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers accomplished this by inserting genes from a
strain of E. coli bacteria that can change mercury from an ion (the
form it is most often found in at waste sites) to its elemental
form, which is less toxic. While the scientists acknowledge that
they still have much research to do, they hope that D. radiodurans
can someday play a major role in reducing the costs of nuclear
waste cleanup, now estimated worldwide at $265 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An Icy Finding &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pluto's moon, Charon, orbits the planet so closely that the two
are very difficult to observe separately using Earth-based
telescopes. Even with a large and precise instrument like the Keck
telescope in Hawaii, atmospheric blurring makes it practically
impossible to distinguish planet from moon.
</P>
<P>
   But on one exceptional night in May 1998, astronomers using the
Keck were able to obtain distinct images and spectra of Pluto and
Charon. And Charon's spectrum held some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   While it had previously been known that Charon has water ice,
the spectrum revealed that the ice was in crystalline, not
amorphous, form (meaning the molecules were neatly ordered, not
jumbled together). Crystalline ice is found in the relatively warm
conditions found on moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Out around
Pluto, which is far colder because of its distance from the Sun,
the ice would be expected to be amorphous.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers, who described their findings in the journal
Science, suggest that the ice on Charon probably recondenses in
crystalline form as it is vaporized by the constant bombardment of
tiny meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Versatile Parasite &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One way many species adapt to changing environmental conditions
is by adjusting the sex ratio of their offspring. British and
French researchers have discovered that this holds true even when
the species is the tiny malaria parasite Plasmodium and the
environment is blood.
</P>
<P>
   During their reproductive cycle, Plasmodium parasites produce
both male and female gametocytes, or sex cells. It is these cells
that are picked up along with blood when a mosquito bites an
infected animal or person. The gametocytes then produce male and
female gametes, and fertilization occurs, eventually producing new
parasites that are passed on when the insect bites again.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who studied Plasmodium in birds and mice, found
that in response to the infection, the animals' immune systems
produce more of a hormone that promotes the production of blood
cells. More blood cells make conditions more crowded for the male
gametes _ it's harder for them to get around and fertilize females.
The parasite's response is simple: it produces more male
gametocytes so that there will be more male gametes around in the
harsher conditions, thus increasing the chances for fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported on their studies in Science, note
that the anti-malaria drug chloroquine inhibits the production of
the hormone, so it may be influencing the gametocyte sex ratio and
how efficiently the disease is transmitted.

TIPPER GORE PROFILE ALL PRO, NO CON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
INTIMATE PORTRAIT: TIPPER GORE 
Produced by: Valerie Sheperd 
Directed by: Lee Grant 
Date: Tuesday at 7 p.m. 
On: Lifetime 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give the Lifetime channel credit for dubbing its women's
biography series ``Intimate Portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   These tributes should not be confused with the serious and
disinterested business of revealing real character, warts and all.
Like the hourlong ``Intimate Portrait: Tipper Gore,'' the
biographies tend to be affectionately personalized celebrations of
famous subjects. Not that there's anything wrong with valentines _
but I think it helps to understand that these profiles are, by
definition, anything but objective.
</P>
<P>
   The great beneficiary of the timely Tipper Gore broadcast is her
husband, Vice President Al Gore. As a matter of fact, the candidate
for the Democratic presidential nomination gets almost as much face
time in this feel-good documentary as does his wife in the title
role. But, then, according to narrator and family friend Tommy Lee
Jones, the Gore marriage is ``a remarkable partnership.'' And,
Jones testifies, they are ``as deeply in love as they were on their
wedding day _ and I know, because I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture: Home movie sentimentality crossed with a
campaign-friendly outline of Tipper Gore's busy family and work
life.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I think it would take more than high rpm spin to make
someone seem as decent and natural as Tipper Gore appears in the
interviews marshalled for this film. She seems bright,
unpretentious, and doesn't diguise the ambitions that lead her to
vigorously campaign for her politician husband and to advocate for
the homeless and mental health issues. She tries to demystify the
subject of mental illness by discussing her mother's and her own
history of clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a relentlessly positive portrait. By revealing a
few flaws, it could have created a no less likable but far more
richly human being.

GENIUSES, CRACKPOTS AND A GRAND UNIFIED THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y., Calif.)   (Eds., in 9th graf, spelling Tereasa is CQ)  
 (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Physicists, if they are successful enough to penetrate the
public consciousness, learn that with fame come fans with _ to put
it mildly _ eccentric ideas.
</P>
<P>
   These cosmic theorizers, who might be defined as obsessed,
confused, intellectually outmatched or just plain weird proponents
of demonstrably incorrect ideas, maintain a voluminous
correspondence with noted physicists and turn up at their talks and
speeches with the reliability of paparazzi chasing princesses and
pop artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get about a grand unified theory a month,'' said Dr. Steven
Chu, a physicist at Stanford, as he hurried toward an escalator
after a talk. He had just disentangled himself from an
argumentative man in a sport jacket who was carrying copies of
several century-old papers by Albert Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the topic on the man's mind, as he pointed
vigorously at passages in the papers, was his theory of how all of
physics could be knitted together with one or two revolutionary
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   What may be more surprising is that Chu, who shared the 1997
Nobel Prize in Physics, did not simply brush off someone from whom
he clearly had so little to learn. Chu debated a few points with
him, wished him well and gently made a getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, even those with Chu's high-powered credentials,
display a willingness to engage the woolliest of theorists more
often than might be believed. The reasons vary, ranging from fear
of insulting someone who does not seem quite stable to tolerance of
a scientist who, outside of a single, inexplicable obsession, does
solid work. The result is that certified geniuses and unmistakable
crackpots frequently come in contact.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein was no exception. Once, in the 1940s, he met for four
hours with Dr. Wilhelm Reich, who believed that a box called an
Orgone Accumulator could concentrate an energy of which the entire
universe was supposedly composed, and that he thought could cure
human maladies like cancer and impotence. ``When I told him, in
concluding, that people considered me mad, his reply was `I can
believe that,''' Reich wrote in his journal.
</P>
<P>
   The author Richard Gilman, in reviewing a book on Reich in The
New York Times recently, wrote that ``poor, nutty, deluded Reich
quotes this proudly, as if Einstein were sympathizing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the origin and contents of the entire universe is
irresistibly attractive to armchair theorists in general, said Dr.
Tereasa Brainerd, an astronomer at Boston University, whose
research has been covered in newspapers. ``They are always wrong,
for the simple reason that the authors have not understood the
basic physics that is involved,'' Dr. Brainerd said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Brainerd said she did occasionally respond to letters,
especially if the writers were not simply asserting that all of
astronomy was wrong (a common conceit). When she does respond,
``it's always with the idea of free public education in mind,'' Dr.
Brainerd er approach is to try to correct a few fallacies
and keep the writers interested in science.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme is that their theories anticipated a discovery
that has just been reported in the news, said Dr. Alexei
Filippenko, an astronomer at the University of California at
Berkeley. Filippenko has a thick sheaf of letters from people who
believe they anticipated the discovery by him and other asrs
that the universe is filled with a strange energy that is boosting
its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery ``confirms what I have theorized for over 20
years,'' declared a writer in Nashville, who appended a list of
numbers and equations. ``Congratulations. The attachment is my
paper and proof that this is the case. Your findings are not a
bazarre notion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild theorizing is not limited to people with no science
background, said Dr. Benjamin Bederson, a physicist at New York
University. ``Saddest of crackpot theories,'' said Bederson, ``come
from superannuated, formerly fine scientists who late in their
careers get bored doing bread-and-butter stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   A classic example, he said, was the renowned physicist Dr.
Julian S. Schwinger, who in old age believed he had found a
scientific explanation for cold fusion, a scheme for producing
energy that was soon shown to have no basis in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, scientists who lose their bearings in one topic are often
perfectly sound in the rest of their work, said Dr. Virginia
Trimble, an astrophysicist at the University of California at
Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are exceedingly nice persons if only you can keep
them off their particular subject,'' Dr. Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   Cranks also turn up in less rarefied areas of research. Dr.
Donald Moyer, a former physicist, who is now a patent agent in
Chicago, said his most frightening experience was with a man who
claimed that he had invented bulletproof paint. Sitting in Moyer's
office and clutching a paper bag, the man said ominously that the
paint was also resistant to intercontinental ballistic missiles and
suggested that Moyer would want to arrange a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Moyer said, ``he reached into the paper bag and
pulled out an 8-by-10 plaque with a portrait of Dwight
Eisenhower.''
</P>
<P>
   To top off his pitch, the man explained that the wondrous paint
was made from recycled garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The fear that such people can inspire often leads to some nimble
circumlocutions on the parts of legitimate scientists, Moyer said.
Once, as he was discussing crackpot theorizing with a fellow
physicist in his office, his colleague took out a file marked
``public relations'' that was filled with letters on off-the-wall
theories. When Moyer asked why in the world the folder was so
labeled, his colleague explained that the writers sometimes turned
up in his office, ``and they get really upset if you take out a
folder marked `crackpots.'''
</P>
<P>
   The best strategy of all for dealing with cranks may be to tie
them up with their own ideas, said Chu, the Nobel laureate. Riding
the escalator to his next talk, Chu hesitated not at all when a
reporter asked for advice on how to respond to a paranoid person
who believed that the government was controlling his mind with
invisible lasers, and who wanted to know how to escape them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to wear aluminum-foil hats,'' Chu said.

   &UR; Black Ice &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is black ice really black? What is it, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   A. What weather reports call black ice is not black at all; it
just looks that way because it is transparent and whatever color
the road's surface is shows through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the roadway were maroon, I guess we would call it maroon
ice,'' said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ice roadway is visible depends on how it is
formed, he explained. Rime ice, which is visible, forms when
droplets of freezing drizzle adhere to the roadway with air trapped
inside because the drops do not splatter when they hit.
</P>
<P>
   Black ice, which is not easily seen, is a coating of thin ice
that is often the result of the thawing and refreezing of roadside
snowbanks. It may also come from freezing drizzle or rain that
splatters when it hits the road, so that no air is trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   In daylight, black ice may look like a dull patch of road
 that is darker than the rest of the highway. It is most
treacherous at night, when it is difficult or impossible to spot.
Unfortunately, it is also most common at night, because that is
when temperatures drop, traffic flow eases and melted snow
refreezes.
</P>
<P>
   Black ice should be suspected, and driving speeds should be
reduced, when temperatures are near or below freezing, especially
in fall and early winter, when there is no obvious precipitation on
the road.

<P>
   In the end it was a merciful relief. Every extra day that Boris
Yeltsin's courtiers dusted him off, dosed him up and sent him
tottering into the public eye had become a personal humiliation and
a national embarrassment. It was amazing he lasted so long.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years in office, the Russian president leaves the
Kremlin but a husk of the man who did more than any other to bring
about the collapse of the Soviet Union and, with it, the threat of
a return to a new arms race, Cold War, repression, suspicion and
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The sparkling figure who leapt onto the turret of a tank during
the farcical 1991 coup attempt against President Mikhail Gorbachev
was long ago displaced by a fitful and muddled invalid who seemed
in permanent danger of making a fool of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Autocratic though he remained to the end, it became hard to
imagine that this was the same man who, faced with a rebellious
legislature that had appointed someone else in his place, ordered
tanks to shell parliament in 1993, brutally reasserting his own and
the Kremlin's authority, at the cost of several hundred lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the robust contours of Yeltsin the Democrat and
Yeltsin the Autocrat collapsed into the blurred and wobbly lines of
a bewildered and erratic old man.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years satirists portrayed him as King Lear.
</P>
<P>
   You could see their point. He had become a remote and unloved
figure, shielded from the outside world by a tight group of aides,
and his family _ notably his younger daughter and adviser, Tatyana,
and his wife, Naina.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the so-called ``family'' became no less plausible
than Yeltsin himself, their public standing became corroded by
allegations of corruption and rumors that they had stashed away
personal fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Russians became increasingly uncomfortable with their leader,
and seemed pathetically happy to attach their affections to almost
anyone else who took control of the nation's helm as premier _
Sergei Kiriyenko, Yevgeny Primakov, Sergei Stepashin, and finally
the Yeltsin protege Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the president set foot abroad, the public winced with
embarrassment. They will long recall his tipsy attempts to conduct
an orchestra in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they enjoy the sight of him stumbling in public, or
taking 25 seconds just to sign his name.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he was not to blame. His most famous foreign gaffe _
his non-appearance from the presidential aircraft at Shannon
airport in 1994 was probably the result of illness.
</P>
<P>
   And no one will ever know whether the night, in 1987, when he
ended up getting drenched in the Moscow River was _ as Alexander
Korzhakov, his former bodyguard, alleges _ an attempt at suicide,
or the result of drunkenness, or (as Yeltsin has hinted) the work
of the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as history assesses the career of this contradictory
and capricious Siberian, he will be granted real credit, and
deservedly so. Russians of the late twentieth century can speak,
worship and travel more or less freely.
</P>
<P>
   With the shameful exception of the Chechen war, cynically
reignited anew by his protege Vladimir Putin, their leader never
resorted to the repressive and dictatorial solutions _ the prison
camps, purges, tireless snooping and daily harassment _ of his
Soviet predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kremlits wealthy allies increasingly
controlled access to the media _ particularly at election time _
his enemies were usually allowed to carp, and many have done so
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   History will surely also relate that Yeltsin should have done
more to contain human-rights abuses, which are rampant, especially
within the vastly corrupt police and courts. And yet it is doubtful
whether any Russian president, in the post-Soviet maelstrom, could
have exerted control over a country so vast.
</P>
<P>
   To do so certainly required a longer concentration span than he
could ever muster. Yeltsin's spells of intense work _ he rose at 5
a.m. daily during the 1996 election campaign _ combined fatally
with periods of detachment, exhaustion and boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Illness did not help. Even before his second term began _
between the two rounds of the July election _ he was stricken by a
heart attack. A quintuple coronary bypass was not enough to put him
back on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Double pneumonia, laryngitis, bronchitis, and colds ensured that
he was, at best, a part-time president.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition to him remain muted because the majority of
Russians were divided over the alternatives, or driven to apathy,
overwhelmed by the struggle to survive. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Communists could never muster the necessary political
consensus to challenge him. It often seemed that their leaders did
not, at heart, even want to. Their demise will be seen by history
as one of Yeltsin's biggest achievements.
</P>
<P>
   The West will also praise Boris Yeltsin for securing the rise of
the centrist parties in the State Duma, which is no longer under
Communist control. This is, in western thinking, a good thing as it
means parliament should work with the Kremlin, which is supposedly
good for ``reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a country as crony-riddled and corrupt as Russia, where
the rot reaches into the Kremlin itself, this comfortable
arrangement is scarcely cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The centrists are, in fact, mostly the same old apparatchiks
that have hovered around the corridors of power for last eight
years. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   None of this diminishes the fact that Friday saw one of the
world's great politicians bowing out of the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in his own way, a maestro, an impoverished laborer's son
turned builder from Sverdlovsk who became Russia's first elected
post-Soviet leader. He was a maverick and natural leader from the
outset. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 300 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 975) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world may never know for certain whether the young Yeltsin
really did blow off two fingers of his left hand with a grenade, or
_ typhoid stricken _ rescued his school friends after an expedition
into the taiga, or gambled on his life with criminals on train
tops, or was nearly drowned in his baptismal font by a drunk
priest.
</P>
<P>
   These sound like inventions; he was always prone to boastfulness
and exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   There was times when he had good cause to brag. By 45, he was
the region's first secretary of the Communist Party, the most
powerful man in Sverdlovsk, the third most important industrial
province in the entire USSR.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985 _ at 54 _ he was running Moscow, brought to the capital
by his future enemy and rival, Gorbachev. But discomfort with
Gorbachev developed into full-blown conflict which nearly cost
Yeltsin his political career.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1987, at a plenum of the Central Committee, he
attacked the Soviet leader for the ``culture of adulation,''
announced that ``perestroika'' was going nowhere, and asked to be
allowed to resign from the Politburo. Instead, he was
unceremoniously sacked.
</P>
<P>
   His humiliation won him vital public support, and was a major
turning point for himself and the country.
</P>
<P>
   By June 1991, he was elected president of Russia, a newly
created job under the Soviet umbrella. Six months later, in the
aftermath of the failed August coup, the USSR finally ceased to
exist, and (though it rose again) the Communist Party was banned.
And he was left in charge of its largest component part.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge was clearly sweet. His nemesis, Gorbachev, claims
Yeltsin threw him out of his Kremlin office three days earlier than
agreed, and held a breakfast-time whisky-drinking party in it with
his aides. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He remained spectacularly capable of surprising his critics to
the end.
</P>
<P>
   No one could have guessed that he would return to fight in
Chechnya, having called the first war his greatest mistake. But, in
hindsight, his arrogance, his determination always to prove the
world wrong, overrode judgment and decency.
</P>
<P>
   Had his political opponents been tougher and less cozy with the
ruling elite, and had ordinary Russians been less world-weary and
more willing to rise up and challenge their masters, he would
probably have left the Kremlin years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at last, he has given his power away. A new era can begin. &QL;

   KLIN, RUSSIA _ The ice-bound evergreen forests and the foggy
fields are the same as when Tchaikovsky lived here, but Russia's
most famous composer would hardly recognize modern Klin, a city of
poverty, violence and despair.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of Russia, Klin hopes that the country's recent
parliamentary elections will mark the beginning of change for the
better. There is certainly next to no chance that they will
transform the country overnight _ and they could conceivably make
things even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the Yeltsin years is clearly visible in Klin. The
road into town is lined with wooden hovels, the homes of the poor,
interspersed with crenellated red brick castles, like smaller
versions of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   These are the entirely misnamed cottagi of the New Russians, who
made their fortunes as much through crime as enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Recently near Klin, police discovered a cache of automatic
weapons in one of these obscene mansions. The guns, of the kind
used to assassinate the democratic politician Galina Starovoitova
last year, were walled in next to the fireplace. The owners
evidently intended to use them to settle further scores.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Chechnya _ Klin is only 50 miles north of Moscow _
but in its way, it too is a battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Klin now boasts a branch of McDonald's. But only the lucky
workers of the thriving brewery, who earn by local standards
``astronomical'' wages (the equivalent of $250 a month), can afford
to treat themselves there. The less fortunate, who toil in the
chemical plant or have no work at all, go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Take Roman Burtsev and his wife Marina, who live in one room of
a communal apa The state benefits they receive for
themselves and their two children come to just 358 rubles (about
$15 a month).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like many Russians, they are besotted with just-resigned
President Boris Yeltsin's chosen successor, Vladimir Putin, because
he is bombing the hated Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to follow him with closed eyes,'' said Roman.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they voted in the recent elections for the party he has
endorsed despite the fact that Unity, or the ``Bear Party,'' has
existed for only a few weeks and is an artificial creation,
designed to support the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Klin has abandoned thought. A middle-aged man
who gave only his first name, Viktor, said he boycotted the Duma
elections in protest at the corruption and manipulative behavior of
national politicians.
</P>
<P>
   And Tolya, a mechanic who feared to give his surname, said he
thought there was something disturbingly authoritarian about Putin
and that he could become ``another Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Dashinskaya said she approved of the tough policy in
Chechnya, but for her it was by no means a foregone conclusion that
Putin would become the next president of Russia. Ms. Dashinskaya
voted for the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry state of the Tchaikovsky Museum, of which she is
assistant curator, as well as the fact that she has not been paid
for months, explained her choice.
</P>
<P>
   The grey clapboard house, in which Tchaikovsky spent his last
years, is in urgent need of restoration. It survived the Bolshevik
Revolution. It survived the Second World War, when the occupying
Nazis stored fuel and parked motorbikes in the drawing room. But it
is succumbing to the general post-Soviet decline.
</P>
<P>
   From this nadir, Russia can only rise _ whether peacefully and
constructively or on a wave of nationalism remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Election-related opinion polls are no longer allowed. But
another poll revealed that 37 percent of Russians thought Stalin an
``outstanding'' personality and 48 percent believed that, were he
alive today, the old Soviet dictator could win power through the
ballot box. &QL;

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Damascus) _ President Clinton today launched a
fresh round of negotiations between Israel and Syria, seizing on a
``historic opportunity'' to reach a land-for-peace deal and end 50
years of enmity between the two Miountries. Clinton held a
separate meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
planned a similar one with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa, before a three-way session anticipated later in the day.
(Summary from wires) By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin began on Monday to put his own imprint on the Kremlin
administration, moving aside several veteran staff members loyal to
retired President Boris Yeltsin and showing the door to his former
boss's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko. But as one television
commentator said Monday night, the changes amount to a ``freshening
up'' of the presidential administration, and hardly a revolution
inside the Kremlin. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN (New Delhi) _ Facing sharp criticism of his
government's decision to negotiate with the hijackers of an Indian
commercial jetliner, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Monday
accused Pakistan of being behind the incident and called on major
nations, including the United States, to declare Pakistan a
terrorist state. By Celia W. Dugger.

   SCOTUS-FAMILIES (Washington) _ A current Supreme Court case on

should be able to gain a court-ordered right to visit with children
over the parents' objection has opened the door not only to an
examination of the stresses besetting the generations, but to a
profound debate over the very definition of family. By Linda
Greenhouse.

   GORE (Dateline to kum, Iowa) _ Al Gore told 1,000 students in
Iowa that the nation needs a tried-and-true leader, capable of
addressing more than a few national problems. His reference is
clearly to his opponent, Bill Bradley. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY (Dateline to kum, N.H.) _ Playing the anti-Washington
themes that have won New Hampshire primaries for Jimmy Carter,
Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchanan, Bill Bradley on Monday portrayed
Vice President Al Gore as timid and out of touch with the American
people, who, he said, are tired of partisan politics and think that
Washington has nothing to do with their lives. By Adam Clymer.

   Y2K-RDP (Undated) _ Year 2000 computer glitches began
multiplying as much of the world headed back to work Monday
following the New Year's holiday, but they remained scattered and,
for the most part, trivial. Nearly all of the reported problems
were fixed within hours of their discovery. The relatively smooth
sailing, especially in foreign nations that had spent far less
money on Year 2000 repairs, led to renewed questions about whether
governments and businesses had squandered money and management
resources after overestimating the scope of the Year 2000
challenge. By Barbaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   DIVMARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Dividends, corporate America
appears to be concluding, are an unnecessary cost of doing
business. Investors do not appear to be interested in getting
dividend payments, so why bother paying them? For the first time in
recent history _ and probably the first time since the Depression _
a quarter of the value of the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks
now comes from companies that do not pay dividends. Two decades
ago, only 2 percent of the value of the index came from such
companies. By Floyd Norris.

   BOTERO-DONATE (Medellin, Colombia) _ Just the mention of this

gangs of kidnappers and hired killers. But Medellin is also the
hometown of Fernando Botero, 68, Latin America's most celebrated
living artist, and he is now putting the full weight of his renown
behind a wide-ranging effort to overhaul the city's reputation and
skyline. Over the next few months the painter and sculptor intends
to install 79 of his paintings, drawings and sculptures that he has
just donated to the Museo de Antioquia here. By Larry Rohter.

</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about power is knowing when to let go. The
next hardest, particularly in a country like Russia which has
experienced nothing but dictatorship for a millennium, is knowing
whom to hand power to.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his resignation on Dec. 31 Boris Yeltsin may have
succeeded on both counts, assuring not only his personal safety and
political legacy, but his place in history and Russia's infant
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   By now Yeltsin is more than the man who saved Russia when a coup
by Communist hard-liners threatened to turn back the clock by
nullifying Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost. In nine
muddy years since, Yeltsin has also created a new Russia, very much
in his own image: one unpredictable, wayward, but full of promise.
By stepping down now, Yeltsin has given his handpicked successor,
Vladimir Putin, the best chance to win elections that will take
place in March.
</P>
<P>
   Shades of the Kremlin of old? Aimed at Yeltsin, a deft
maneuverer of the old school of Communist politics, the gibe is
tempting. It is also unfair.
</P>
<P>
   With mandatory presidential elections approaching next year,
Moscow was awash in rumors: ``feeding time at the zoo,'' as one
former British prime minister called it. By ending the whisperipaign that he intended to cling to power no matter what, Yeltsin
deserves more cheers than jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Through this orderly and constitutionally correct device to
attempt to assure his succession, Yeltsin may have precluded any
possibility of a chaotic power struggle for the Kremlin without
sacrificing democratic principles. Russia may now go on to complete
its transition from communism to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But what do we know of the heir apparent, Acting President
Putin? In keeping with his shadowy KGB background, very little.
Putin is married with two daughters, 47 years old and a graduate of
Saint Petersburg University's Law Faculty. Stationed for a decade
as a KGB agent in the former East Germany, he also saw Western
democratic and business practices up close, and by now is believed
to be committed to them.
</P>
<P>
   After communism's collapse, he worked for the liberal mayor,
Anatoly Sobchak, and alongside other young reformers like Anatoly
Chubais in the St. Petersburg government of the early 1990s.
Transferred to Moscow, he headed the Federal Security Service, or
FSB (the transformed KGB), until Yeltsin suddenly appointed him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his murky profile, Putin's most potent claim to fame,
and to power, is a renowned toughness. In the bloody mountains and
ruined cities of Chechnya, Putin established his credentials as the
man needed to restore order and stop the country's internal
disintegration by revitalizing state power.
</P>
<P>
   That the West seems nervous about Putin only enhances his
prestige at home. With Western economic policy prescriptions widely
seen as having failed in Russia; with NATO expanding near to the
country's borders and old allies like Serbia bombed; with America
seen as wanting to weaken Russia even more, breaking it up into
pieces and controlling the oil-rich Caspian basin, anti-Western
sentiments are on the rise. Putin's political antenna have caught
this trend. The chance that the We Russia's acting president
with suspicion makes him even more desirable to the traditional
Russian heart.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, however, prefers to promote the impression of
being a more enlightened and modern leader. His prime ministerial
New Year's address _ ``Russia at the Turn of the Millennium'' _ was
posted on the Internet, at a government website, for all the world
to see before being published in Russian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In it he outlined his presidential program. Playing to the
crowds, he declared that Russia is no plaything for the West to
kick around. But demagoguery stopped there. Russia, he also
declared, must mend itself. It will remain cooperative and friendly
with the world, provided that the world is cooperative and friendly
too. But the hard work of rebuilding Russia must be done by
Russians, and with no time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia cultural instincts, in which communal ideas remain
more valued than individualist principles, help determine the
success or failure of policies. The national strategies Putin will
likely follow will take into account these social impulses. Thus he
is unlikely to publicly trumpet the unforgiving capitalist policies
of Yegor Gaidar and Chubais, even if he quietly pursues them.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly a strong patriot, Putin also knows that Russia's
national idea of itself must be cleansed of haughtiness and
imperial ambitions. The Russia he envisions will be a great power
once more, but great in the ways that a truly modern society must
be: in its democratic commitments, its economy and its domestic
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Russia today is that Putin is a man of neither
great talents nor great vices. To ordinary Russians he appears as
modest, principled and honest, a vast contrast with the tainted
politicians of the Yeltsin years. He is a perfect fit for a Russia
grown tired of the heroes, revolutionaries, criminals and even
saviors, who make life exciting but rarely stable.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in September by the Moscow Public Opinion
Foundation showed that what Russians most want is a new Brezhnev,
whose nearly 20 years (1964-1982) of leadership once was disdained
as the ``era of stagnation,'' but now is nostalgically recalled as
a ``golden ear of stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin almost fits this mold of firmness and seriousness, which
ensures stability, a strong state and a ``golden middle'' between
radical reforms and strong-arm rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of their minds, however, Russians also hold a secret
fear. It concerns a type of man, a pleasant, quiet individual who
walks softly through the Kremlin corridors, someone who
uncomplainingly takes on _ and completes _ many hard and unpleasant
tasks while others fight noisily for high position. One day that
unassuming political beast of burden suddenly comes out on top, as
Stalin did in the early 1920s. Of President Putin Russia, like
history, must reserve its judgement.

</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about power is knowing when to let go. The
next hardest, particularly in a country like Russia which has
experienced nothing but dictatorship for a millennium, is knowing
whom to hand power to.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his resignation on Dec. 31 Boris Yeltsin may have
succeeded on both counts, assuring not only his personal safety and
political legacy, but his place in history and Russia's infant
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   By now Yeltsin is more than the man who saved Russia when a coup
by Communist hard-liners threatened to turn back the clock by
nullifying Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost. In nine
muddy years since, Yeltsin has also created a new Russia, very much
in his own image: one unpredictable, wayward, but full of promise.
By stepping down now, Yeltsin has given his handpicked successor,
Vladimir Putin, the best chance to win elections that will take
place in March.
</P>
<P>
   Shades of the Kremlin of old? Aimed at Yeltsin, a deft
maneuverer of the old school of Communist politics, the gibe is
tempting. It is also unfair.
</P>
<P>
   With mandatory presidential elections approaching next year,
Moscow was awash in rumors: ``feeding time at the zoo,'' as one
former British prime minister it. By ending the whispering
campaign that he intended to cling to power no matter what, Yeltsin
deserves more cheers than jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Through this orderly and constitutionally correct device to
attempt to assure his succession, Yeltsin may have precluded any
possibility of a chaotic power struggle for the Kremlin without
sacrificing democratic principles. Russia may now go on to complete
its transition from communism to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But what do we know of the heir apparent, Acting President
Putin? In keeping with his shadowy KGB background, very little.
Putin is married with two daughters, 47 years old and a graduate of
Saint Petersburg University's Law Faculty. Stationed for a decae
as a KGB agent in the former East Germany, he also saw Western
democratic and business practices up close, and by now is believed
to be committed to them.
</P>
<P>
   After communism's collapse, he worked for the liberal mayor,
Anatoly Sobchak, and alongside other young reformers like Anatoly
Chubais in the St. Petersburg government of the early 1990s.
Transferred to Moscow, he headed the Federal Security Service, or
FSB (the transformed KGB), until Yeltsin suddenly appointed him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his murky profile, Putin's most potent claim to fame,
and to power, is a renowned toughness. In the bloody mountains and
ruined cities of Chechnya, Putin established his credentials as the
man needed to restore order and stop the country's internal
disintegration by revitalizing state power.
</P>
<P>
   That the West seems nervous about Putin only enhances his
prestige at home. With Western economic policy prescriptions widely
seen as having failed in Russia; with NATO expanding near to the
country's borders and old allies like Serbia bombed; with America
seen as wanting to weaken Russia even more, breaking it up into
pieces and controlling the oil-rich Caspian basin, anti-Western
sentiments are on the rise. Putin's political antenna have caught
this trend. The chance that the West eyes Russia's acting president
with suspicion makes him even more desirable to the traditional
Russian heart.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, however, prefers to promote the impression of
being a more enlightened and modern leader. His prime ministerial
New Year's address _ ``Russia at the Turn of the Millennium'' _osted on the Internet, at a government website, for all the world
to see before being published in Russian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In it he outlined his presidential program. Playing to the
crowds, he declared that Russia is no plaything for the West to
kick around. But demagoguery stopped there. Russia, he also
declared, must mend itself. It will remain cooperative and friendly
with the world, provided that the world is cooperative and friendly
too. But the hard work of rebuilding Russia must be done by
Russians, and with no time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia cultural instincts, in which communal ideas remain
more valued than individualist principles, help determine the
success or failure of policies. The national strategies Putin will
likely follow will take into account these social impulses. Thus he
is unlikely to publicly trumpet the unforgiving capitalist policies
of Yegor Gaidar and Chubais, even if he quietly pursues them.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly a strong patriot, Putin also knows that Russia's
national idea of itself must be cleansed of haughtiness and
imperial ambitions. The Russia he envisions will be a great power
once more, but great in the ways that a truly modern society must
be: in its democratic commitments, its economy and its domestic
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Russia today is that Putin is a man of neither
great talents nor great vices. To ordinary Russians he appears as
modest, principled and honest, a vast contrast with the tainted
politicians of the Yeltsin years. He is a perfect fit for a Russia
grown tired of the heroes, revolutionaries, criminals and even
saviors, who make life exciting but rarely stable.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in September by the Moscow Public Opinion
Foundation showed that what Russians most want is a new Brezhnev,
whose nearly 20 years (1964-1982) of leadership once was disdained
as the ``era of stagnation,'' but now is nostalgically recalled as
a ``golden ear of stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin almost fits this mold of firmness and seriousness, which
ensures stability, a strong state and a ``golden middle'' between
radical reforms and strong-arm rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of their minds, however, Russians also hold a secret
fear. It concerns a type of man, a pleasant, quiet individual who
walks softly through the Kremlin corridors, someone who
uncomplainingly takes on _ and completes _ many hard and unpleasant
tasks while others fight noisily for high position. One day that
unassuming political beast of burden suddenly comes out on top, as
Stalin did in the early 1920s. Of President Putin Russia, like
history, must reserve its judgement.

STORMS THAT SURPRISED EUROPE SHOW FORECAST LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Pa.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY with WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The day before the first of two fierce storms touched
down on France's west coast last week, streaking across the country
and causing heavy damage in other parts of Europe as well,
meteorologists here predicted stormy weather, but nothing out of
the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   There was no warning of the gale force winds that tore down
one-quarter of the country's electric grid, uprooted thousands of
trees and damaged some of the country's best known historic
monuments, including Notre Dame and Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, France is still struggling with the damage, with
more than 400,000 homes yet to get power back.
</P>
<P>
   So in this age of satellite weather pictures and computer
projections, how could these storms have taken a continent so
completely by surprise? Are fierce and unpredictable storms part of
a new weather pattern related to global warming? Are there more to
come?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that predicting weather in Europe remains
particularly difficult, despite the latest technology. Most
meteorologists rely heavily on computerized models that need to be
fed a great number of up-to-the-minute weather observations.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that many of Europe's weather patterns come off
the Atlantic Ocean, where observations are sparse. Key factors may
not be detected, so the models _ never fool-proof _ have a greater
chance of failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with this storm is that it came like a cannon
shot, very fast and very straight, so there wasn't much time to
collect anything,'' said Patrick Galois, a forecaster with the
French national weather service, Meteo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's always hard to get good information over the
Atlantic. There are boats out there that send wind, temperature and
pressure information and we get information from satellites too,
but they look down over what is going on from very high up. We just
don't get a good picture of everything going on over the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Galois said new satellites to be launched later this year might
improve the information that went into forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Late fall and winter storms are not rare in Europe, Galois said.
But, like other experts, he pointed out that the intensity of these
two storms, with hurricane-force winds, was rare, and that the
appearance of two such storms within 48 hours was even more so, a
phenomenon seen perhaps once in a century. Galois said the first
storm took a mere 24 hours to cross the Atlantic. Usually, weather
patterns take about 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not global warming will be a factor in creating more
such storms remains an open question. Galois said not enough
information was yet available about what added warmth might touch
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not create storms, but maybe it will have an effect on
them,'' Galois said. ``If the oceans are warmer, that could be
another source of energy out there that might intensify a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Some climatologists say that if the earth's atmosphere warms as
predicted, storms will become more intense. But while there is some
evidence that rainstorms have become heavier in some parts of the
world, there is no solid indication of stronger wind storms. At any
rate, experts say, no specific weather development can yet be
attributed to global climate change.
</P>
<P>
   The two storms that struck Europe beginning Dec. 26 are the kind
that develop along a front, or boundary between cold arctic air and
warmer southern air that circles the globe. High above this
boundary is the jet stream, the high altitude river of air in which
most storm systems are embedded, and which carries them on a
general west-to-east course.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, meteorologists say, the jet stream was classically
placed and of classic strength to promote the development of
superstorms. It was a ``fast, ripsnorting jet stream right straight
west to east, across the Atlantic from the U.S. to Europe,'' said
Jim Wagner, a meteorologist with the federal Climate Prediction
Center at Camp Springs, Md. This is the kind of atmosphere setup
that can cause a storm to blossom explosively if one should
develop.
</P>
<P>
   The faster the jet stream, the more air it whisks away from the
area of a developing storm below it. This further lowers the air
pressure within the storms (by taking air away from them). The
lower the pressure, the faster air rushes in from outside the storm
to try to equalize things. This rush of air is wind, and the lower
the storm's pressure, the stronger it is. Relatively warm air off
the ocean also imparted extra energy to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, farther south, an unusually strong high-pressure
system made the difference between the center of the storm and the
outside air even greater, and the winds became even stronger _ in
this case, as strong as a moderately severe hurricane. All of these
factors played a role in producing the winds that did most of the
European damage.
</P>
<P>
   The storms themselves were relatively small vortexes of wind and
precipitation circling counterclockwise around a central core. It
was the sustained winds of these vortexes, much like those that
circulate around a hurricane, that blasted the continent. Some
tornadoes might have spun off, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at
Pennsylvania State University. But if they did, he said, they were
not the major problem.
</P>
<P>
   The first storm hit northern France hardest. The second tore
through the southern half of the country. Together, they caused
perhaps as much as $4-billion worth of damage, according to some
insurers, and killed 88 people in France alone.
</P>
<P>
   The national electricity company, id on Monday that the
task of restoring power was proving more difficult than expected
and was hampered by bad weather, especially in isolated zones. Fog
prevented some helicopters from taking off. Snow and flooding were
also making repairs more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But lack of electricity was not the only problem. The education
minister, Claude Allegre, announced that about 40 schools would
remain closed because of damage when classes resume on Tuesday
after the Christmas and New Year's holiday. About 900 of France's
11,400 schools were damaged by the storms.

<P>
   Haley Moran-Wollens is not an elite athlete. She is a
13-year-old who, like lots of other teen-agers, wants to be fit.
And, like a growing number of teen-agers whose parents can afford
it, she has a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   In her case, the trainer is Rodica Vranceanu, who charges $75 an
hour for after-school workouts at Radu Physical Culture, a gym in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the skinniest,'' Haley said. ``I just want
to work out. But a lot of people do it for the nice bodies, even at
my age.''
</P>
<P>
   Though personal training is by no means the norm for American
children, a small but growing number of their parents are paying
the membership fees to private gyms for aerobics, weight lifting,
and body-molding activities once considered for adults only.
</P>
<P>
   At the Spectrum Club in Valencia, Calif., children ages 13 to 17
can become Teen Fit members. They tend to go for the stationary
bicycles and weights, said Cindy Breakfield, sports manager, who
added that personal trainers were available for the younger set.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastcoast Athletic Club in Port Washington, N.Y., has a
program called Excel, which offers personal training at $45 an hour
to children ages 12 to 17, said Christopher Patti, the fitness
director.
</P>
<P>
   Some health experts hail the trend, saying that too many
children do not get enough exercise. But others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad precedent,'' said Richard Killingsworth, a
scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta. ``We are teaching a behavior that it's OK to be sedentary
all day except for the one-hour exercise class. In the past decade,
our children have lost the idea of what it is to enjoy being young
and physically active.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts wonder if it is healthy for children to exercise
in situations designed for adults. Children's bones are more
fragile than adults', and the growth plates on children's bones
have not yet sealed shut. So some parents are concerned that
injuries could stunt growth. But experts say that parents need not
worry because damage to the growth plates is unusual and when it
occurs, it rarely stops development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little data that reasonable exercise or even more
extreme weights will cause permanent damage, but psychologically
and physically children should go for higher reps,'' rather than
heavier weights, said Dr. Peter Jokl, vice chairman of the
department of orthopedic surgery and head of the section of sports
medicine at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Also, children are less coordinated than adults and should not
be expected to keep up with complex movements. The solution, said
Jokl, is to simplify exercise routines.
</P>
<P>
   As for muscles, their basic makeup is the same, whether old or
young. The difference is that prepubescent children do not have the
full load of testosterone and growth hormones, which spur muscle
growth. A 12-year-old boy cannot expect to bulk up the way his
18-year-old brother might, but the younger one can gain a lot of
strength, fitness experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, children do not cope with extreme heat and
humidity as well as adults. For one thing, their sweat glands are
not completely developed, so they cannot release as much heat from
overworked muscles as adults can. So children should drink large
amounts of water before and during activities. The rule of thumb,
said Killingsworth of the CDC, is to drink at least 12-ounces of
water before, during and after exercising in heat. Sports drinks
that contain extra electrolytes are not necessary. (A glass of
tomato juice or orange juice can replenish nutrients lost.)
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, said Charles Corbin, a professor of exercise
science and physical education at Arizona State University at
Tempe, ``is not what children can do, but what children should
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are very capable of vigorous activity,'' he said, ``but
is that what they should be doing? Why would a mom or dad want to
take a kid to a spinning class? We want to teach our kids to be

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally mild air will cover the East Coast states again
Tuesday as gusty winds from the southwest precede an approaching
cold front. Some sunshine will occur near the coast in the morning,
but clouds will thicken by afternoon. Farther west, a band of rain
with a few imbedded thunderstorms will accompany the front as it
moves slowly east across the Appalachians. The rain will reach the
Atlantic Seaboard on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, colder air will surge from the
northern Plains to the Middle West on strong winds from the
northwest. Scattered rain showers in the eastern part of Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley will change to snow showers late Tuesday. As
the chilly winds blow over the relatively mild water, snow showers
will develop near the southern and eastern shores of the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will linger in most of the Plains states. Sunshine
will be plentiful in the central and southern sections, but patchy
clouds will mix with the sun across the north. Afternoon
temperatures will remain several degrees below the seasonal average
in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of Pacific fronts will bringwinds,
coastal rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest. Locally
heavy snow will fall in the Cascades and Bitterroots. Some of the
interior valleys will have rain showers early Tuesday that will
change to snow showers as a cold front sweeps across the region.
Farther south, after a cold dawn, the sunshine will boost
temperatures to near seasonal values in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Perihelion
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Earth came within 91,400,005 miles of the sun as it
reached perihelion, the Earth's closest approach to the sun during
the year. In the current era, perihelion occurs during the northern
hemisphere winter, favoring a modest reduction in temperature
extremes. Aphelion, the point where the sun and earth are farthest
apart, occurs in summer, slightly limiting the warming powers of
the sun. However, the earth's orbital parameters are slowly
changing. In 11,000 years, perihelion will occur in summer and
aphelion in winter, accentuating the seasonal temperatures
differences.

<P>
   For 65 million years, the fossil triceratops now displayed at
the National Museum of Natural History in Washington lay protected
in its rocky cocoon, immune to the ravages of the outer world.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last 95 years, the hot breath of museum visitors has
been eating away this valuable dinosaur, and now, like some of its
fossil neighbors, it is threatened with destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution, hopes to save
its most endangered fossils by removing them from display and
exhibiting only their plastic casts.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil that has suffered the most serious environmental
damage, said Fred Grady, a museum preparator, is that of a
triceratops that has been on view since 1905. Conservators have
also found areas of damage in the museum's stegosaur and in various
extinct mammals, including a mastodon and an Irish elk.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, Grady said, is ``pyrite disease,'' a
condition hastened by moisture, in which sulfur and iron combine as
pyrite (fool's gold), which replaces and greatly weakens the
mineralized bone in fossils. Ivory tusks and antlers, which are not
mineralized, develop cracks and fall apart under their own weight,
and have therefore been replaced by lightened plastic replicas.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration of the museum's prized triceratops has begun and
will continue well into the next year, Grady said. A cast will
replace the fossil, which will be placed in air-conditioned storage
out of public view. The real skull, however, will be kept in a
sealed glass case next to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The preservative varnishes applied to fossils over the years
have deteriorated and in some cases have hastened deterioration,
Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another problem stems from the vibration that damages fossil
bones in contact with metal supports and framework,'' he said.
``Conservators detected some serious bone damage at those contact
points, some of it caused by jack hammers while the museum was
being renovated. We have installed seismometers near some of the
fossils to monitor the threat, and pads are being installed in the
fossil mounts to cushion the shocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's largest dinosaur fossil, a diplodocus, was found to
be undamaged, Grady said, but experts will keep an eye on it.
</P>
<P>
   Although damage caused by the breath of visitors is relatively
rare in museums, it is a big problem in caves decorated by
Cro-Magnon artists some 15,000 years ago. During most of the years
since these artists embellished the walls of Altamira cave in Spain
and Lascaux in France with beautiful images of animals, the caves
were sealed against the elements, and pigments remained fresh and
bright.
</P>
<P>
   But with the arrival of floods of tourists in the 20th century
came moisture from breathing, and algae and bacteria tracked in by
the shoes of visitors. That marked the beginning of rapid
deterioration in the form of faded pigments and smudged images. All
these caves are now closed except for specially authorized visits.
The caves most tourists visit today are replicas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eugene S. Gaffney, curator of vertebrate paleontology at New
York's Museum of Natural History, said he deplored the substitution
of casts for real fossils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visitors to the museum come to see the real thing, not
replicas,'' he said. But that is easy for him to say, because the
Museum of Natural History is more or less immune to the problems
besetting its counterpart in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our halls are air-conditioned, and we recently completed
an overall renovation and remounting of all our dinosaur fossils,''
Gaffney said. ``We once encountered a mildew problem in a glass
case, but we cured it by drying the fossil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have to deal with now is lint _ lint from
the clothing of museum visitors,'' he said. ``So periodically we
get out the vacuum cleaners and go over the dinosaurs. It's nothing
serious, though, and our dinosaurs are in good health.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``TWILIGHT'' &QL; 
By Henry Grunwald (Knopf, $20) &QL; 
Grunwald was vacationing in Italy in 1992 when he went to pour a
glass of later and missed the glass. When he returned to the United
States, his doctor gave him ominous news: He was in the early
stages of macular degeneration, a mysterious condition that affects
some older people and for which there is no cure. ``Macular''
refers to a spot on the retina of the eye. ``As for `degeneration,'
'' he writes, ``the term was extremely depressing, with its
overtones of moral decay.'' His journalistic curiosity outweighed
his apprehension, and Grunwald, former editor of ``Time,'' set out
to learn about the disease that was destroying his sight. He also
became ``a visual glutton, devouring the images around me in order
somehow to hold on to them before they grew even dimmer. The faces
of the people I loved . . . the chance glimpses of youngsters at
play in Central Park, old men in peaceful combat playing chess in
Washington Square.'' He coped through humor (``I joke about all the
ugly things I don't have to see anymore'') and by writing this book
about one of the most poignant episodes in a long and interesting
life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``RAY GUN'' &QL; 
By Eugene W. Metcalf and Frank Maresca (Fotofolio, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We mention this one on behalf of two boys with whom New &AMP;
Notable has more than a passing acquaintance (one is 45, the other
is 7), who perused it together and announced that it was one of the
greatest books of all time. The weaponry, of course, went to their
heads. We flattered ourselves to think we'd be immune to it, but
after only a few pages _ specifically, it was when we saw the Buck
Rogers Liquid Helium Water Pistol, which we knew at once was too
cool for words _ we became ray-gun zealots and prepared to nominate
Metcalf and Maresca for the Pulitzer Prize. Their book is little
more than pictures of old toy ray guns that will make you smile and
remember a time when little boys provided the sound effects for
their guns and didn't really try to kill anyone. These are grand to
look at and whimsically friendly (witness the Smoke Ring Gun or the
Automatic Repeating Bubble Shooting Gun). The only disappointment
is that you don't get to hold them and fire a few bubbles. Metcalf
has a Web site: www.toyraygun.com. &QL; 
``AMERICAN HOLLOW'' &QL; 
By Rory Kennedy (Bulfinch, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Appalachia to be a place of in breeds and
six-fingered children, of hillbillies and moonshine, an America
more backwards than backwoods,'' Kennedy writes. ``But in my year
with the Bowlings, I discovered that the truth is not so simple.''
The Bowling family lives in one of the poorest and most isolated
regions of eastern Kentucky. Kennedy spent a year living with the
family while she produced an acclaimed documentary for HBO. This is
its companion volume. Rich with photographs and long passages in
the Bowlings' own words, it is a portrait of disparate things:
family love and physical abuse, poverty and generosity, tradition
and despair, hard work and joblessness. Tying it together is the
Bowlings' deep family loyalty and regard for the land. ``Me and
Bascum might have worked hard, but now that didn't hurt us,'' says
matriarch Iree Bowling, married 50 years. ``I'm 68, he's 69, and
we're still working. And I plan on working as long as my hands will
move and my legs will go. No, I don't consider myself poor _ never
did. I feel like I'm rich, rich as the Lord wants me to be.'' &QL; 
``THE GREATEST GENERATION SPEAKS''  &QL; 
By Tom Brokaw &QL; 
(Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you ever want to tell your life's story, do get Tom Brokaw to
write it for you. He was a lean, mean promotional machine on behalf
of his last book, ``The Greatest Generation.'' Now, he's back with
more. This volume offers memories and letters (many written in
response to ``The Greatest Generation'') from men and women who
weathered the Depression years, fought in World War II, and
returned home to create what Brokaw calls a ``world of broader
horizons'' for their children and grandchildren. Most of it is
presented as an oral history, with people telling their own
experiences and Brokaw providing chapter lead-ins and transitional
paragraphs. As with those in the previous book, these stories of
courage, hard work, tragedy and perseverance are told quietly, with
little fanfare or self-pity. There's plenty to get weepy over.
According to Brokaw, it shows the effect that ``The Greatest
Generation'' had onpeople who lived through those difficult decades
but never told their stories. ``I wrote a book about America,'' he
says, ``and a lot of America is writing back.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It was 7:45 on a recent morning and Dr. Benjamin
Solomon Carson, professor of neurosurgery and director of pediatric
neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital was sitting in his
office here planning his day.
</P>
<P>
   Carson, who performs three to five operations daily, has an
international reputation as the man to call for tough pediatric
neurosurgical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among his specialties, Carson separates conjoined (or Siamese)
twins, performs hemispherectomies in which half the brain is
removed from children who have extreme seizures and performs
craniofacial work on youngsters with congenital deformities.
</P>
<P>
   If the medicine that Carson practices is heroic, so is his
personal story. A 49-year-old physician, he grew up fatherless in
Detroit. For most of elementary school, he was a problem child with
miserable grades. But his mother, Sonja, a domestic worker, pushed
young Benjamin to read books and eventually turn his grades around.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was ready for college, Yale was offering him
scholarships. Medical school at the University of Michigan
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of personal satisfaction,'' Carson admits, ``in
coming this far from an environment where no one thought you could
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your first reaction in 1997 when you were first
asked to separate Luka and Joseph Banda, 11-month-old Siamese
twins, who were joined at the head?
</P>
<P>
   A. I had mixed feelings about doing the operation.
</P>
<P>
   I was in South Africa to receive an honorary degree at the
Medical University of South Africa and I was asked there if I might
examine the twins.
</P>
<P>
   Now my previous experience separating conjoined twins in South
Africa had not been pleasant. The Makwaeba sisters, whom we had
separated some years earlier, turned out to be completely
symbiotic.
</P>
<P>
   We spent 20 hours separating them. But in the end, one of them
had all the cardiac function and the other, all the renal. So the
operation was technically successful, but the twins died. That
really took a toll on me. I thought, ``Why do this again, here?''
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the Bandas, lying there with their mother,
playing, so cute, I became committed to them. I thought, ``How can
you not do everything to give them a normal life?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Bandas became the first Type 2 craniopagus twins
((joined at the head and facing in opposite directions)) ever
separated with both surviving and both being neurologically normal.
It was a triumph. It was tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the operation to separate the Banda twins prove to be
difficult?
</P>
<P>
   A. Incredibly difficult. It was 28 hours of surgery. What helped
a lot was that months before the actual operation, the experimental
radiology division here at Hopkins asked me to look at a new
computer they had that does 3-D virtual reality images of anything
you program into it. I wasn't sure, at first, how such a computer
might be useful to me. But when I returned from Africa, after my
initial examination of the Bandas, it hit me: this would be great
for separating Siamese twins!
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons surgeons have so much trouble separating
Siamese twins is that nobody gets to do many of them. On the table,
the anatomy is so different from normal, that you're constantly
trying to figure out, ``Can I cut this? Does this wire lead to
what?'' It's like trying to defuse a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   So when I got back from seeing the Bandas, I had their African
doctors program all their information _ CT scans, angiograms, MRI's
_ onto disks, and we loaded all of that onto the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Baltimore, I was able to have images of the twins' heads
right there in front of me. It was beautiful because I was actually
able to practice the operation. I could go from one side to
another. I could actually go inside the blood vessel and see where
I was going.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exciting new things in neurosurgery is computer
technology. It takes a lot of the guessing out of what you're
doing. When you can practice going precisely to a place without
poking here and there, the exposure of the patient decreases
significantly, the morbidity decreases. Ultimately, the cost
decreases because complications go down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you feel when you're digging around in someone's
brain?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm constantly awed by it. Every time, I am looking into the
depths of somebody's brain, I'm thinking, ``This is what makes a
person who they are. That structure contains memories. Everything
that they've ever experienced is right in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happens to time when you're operating?
</P>
<P>
   A. It disappears. A six-hour operation can go by in what seems
like a half hour. You're concentrating at such a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Q. With your heavy patient load, do you get to know any of them
personally?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, absolutely. That's important. Getting emotionally
involved, I think, is a good thing. Of course, when there's a bad
outcome, it's difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, I cried right in the operating room
because the patient was brain dead. I had grown so close to that
family that I had a picture of the little boy in my pocket. And
yet, wone everything we could possibly do. The family knew
that. The parents were in no way bitter. There were hugs all
around. It really is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, I've never spent a day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You were an underachiever as a child?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I had a low opinion of myself _ like so many young
people today.
</P>
<P>
   When I thought I was stupid, I acted like a stupid person. And
when I thought I was smart, I acted like a smart person and
achieved like a smart person.
</P>
<P>
   I was fortunate, in that I had a mother who believed in me and
kept telling me I was smart.
</P>
<P>
   You know, even as late as my first year in medical school, my
faculty adviser advised me to drop out. He said I wasn't
medical-school material.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, I told that story last June when I was the
commencement speaker at my medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When did you realize that neurosurgery was your calling?
</P>
<P>
   A. I first wanted to be a psychiatrist. I decided against that
in medical school when I discovered that psychiatrists didn't, in
reality, do what they did on TV. So I had good eye-hand
coordination, I was a very, very careful person, I loved to dissect
things, I could think in three dimensions. Putting all that
together, I decided on surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You are probably one of the few African-American
neurosurgeons in the country. It must be a little annoying to
always be pointed out as the exceptional guy who made it big.
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right. And I'm not the exception. My brother has done
very well also. He is the manager of the aircraft landing division
of Allied Signal, which recently merged with Honeywell. I know tons
and tons of people who grew up in environments like mine who are
doing fantastic things intellectually and nobody knows about them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tell us about the Carson Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   A. When I'd go to schools to speak, I saw all these trophies for
sports and that the kids who were in the National Honor Society
just got a kind of pat on the head. They were derided as nerds and
Poindexters. I thought, ``This is crazy. These are guys who will
keep us No. 1, not the guy who can do the 25-foot jump shot.''
</P>
<P>
   So my wife, Candy, and I decided we'd take $500,000 of our own
money and start giving scholarships to students to achieve at the
highest academic levels and also who demonstrated humanistic
qualities. The money is invested. When they go off to a college,
the money gets transferred there. The school also gets a big
trophy, a lot of local publicity; they get a medal to wear and they
go to a big banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The writer John Horgan, in his book, ``The Undiscovered
Mind,'' claims we know next to nothing about the way the brain
really works. Do you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree with him 100 percent. It's one of the things that
attracted to me to neuroscience. I thought, ``Here's a field where
you can become a real expert pretty quickly because nobody knows
anything.''

<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Nestled among barren trees and fallow
fields on the edge of Appalachia, this sleepy tin roof hamlet along
the banks of the Potomac River awakened Monday at the epicenter of
decades-long efforts to bring peace to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton opened talks here Monday between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa, this town at the junction of state routes 45 and 480 was
cautiously embracing its sudden role at the crossroads of world
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a big thing,'' said Julie Kane, who was
serving up fresh baked chocolate cupcakes the size of softballs at
the Shepherdstown Sweet Shop Bakery, ``a big thing for a small
town.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats selected Shepherdstown _ population 1,300 _ after
searching the Washington area for a place that was accessible yet
secluded. That's partly to avoid the media scrutiny more likely to
attend talks in the nation's capital, 65 miles downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherdstown is a long way, though, from the fractious Mideast
_ culturally, as well as geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the breakfast crowd cleared out of the Old
Pharmacy Cafe on German Street, the town was quiet enough to hear
the scratching of squirrels scurrying up the bark of ancient oaks,
or the uneven notes of someone practicing piano from inside a red
brick home.
</P>
<P>
   There were ample signs, though, of community support for the
ambitious round of negotiations, which opened, under the aegis of
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, at the National
Conservation Training Center _ a campus of limestone and timber
buildings in an isolated, wooded area operated by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife service.
</P>
<P>
   American flags flew from porch posts along New Street, where
evergreen wreaths with bright red ribbons still hung from wooden
doors and painted windowsills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace _ it's a beautiful sign to see,'' read a small white
poster pinned to the sanctuary door at the Trinity Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace on the Potomac?'' asked ``The Journal,'' the
Martinsburg-based newspaper, in a front-page headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome Clinton, Albright, Barak, al-Sharaa,'' read a roadside
sign at the Covenant Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Clinton arrived just before lunchtime Monday,
thundering into town aboard the presidential helicopter, Marine
One, which set down on a muddy baseball field at Shepherd College.
</P>
<P>
   A place where children's' bicycles stand unlocked on wooden
porches painted deep green or grey, Shepherdstown looks like an
aging portrait of rural Americana.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The town claims to be the oldest in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   It's two-story homes, typically of brick or rock foundations and
clapboard siding, line streets drawn up two centuries ago, when
Shepherdstown stood at the western frontier of Colonial America.
</P>

THIS CLOCK IS GOOD FOR 20 MILLION YEARS

<P>
   For most people, it is enough to know that one second is the
sixtieth part of a minute, which is one-sixtieth of an hour, which
is one twenty-fourth of the time it takes the Earth to make one
complete revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But nature is not nearly so tidy. All kinds of factors
constantly distort the standards by which ordinary people measure
time, and something far more accurate than the Earth's rotation
rate is needed to time such split-second events as course
corrections for interplanetary space probes.
</P>
<P>
   The world's pre-eminent timekeepers, in the United States and
France, have now invented a clock so accurate that it will neither
gain nor lose so much as a second in nearly 20 million years of
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Builders of one of these new ``fountain clocks'' said at a news
conference in Boulder, Colo., last week that practical uses for
these costly gadgets, which keep time by counting the vibrations of
cesium atoms, might not be found for a decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, our task is to create the most accurate and
reproducible fundamental standards we can,'' said Thomas Parker,
chief of the Atomic Standards Group at the Boulder laboratory of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST.
``Users catch up later by adapting our research to specific
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Jefferts and Dawn Meekhof of the institute built and
tested their fountain clock over four years. A clock based on
similar principles recently began operating in Sevres, France, at
the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, an international agreement has defined a second as
the period in which a cesium atom vibrates 9,192,631,770 times. The
vibration rates at which atoms absorb energy are as stable as the
clock pendulums (and far more accurate), and atoms make excellent
gauges of the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic clocks that measure time in terms of the natural resonant
frequencies of various atoms and molecules have been in use since
1949. All of them evolved from techniques suggested in the 1930s by
Dr. Isidor I. Rabi, a physicist at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Today, atomic clocks are widely used to synchronize the time
signals essential to many forms of telecommunication and to the
satellite-based Global Positioning System, which permits extremely
accurate navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of ultraprecise timing in scientific research was
underscored by a discovery for which Dr. Joseph H. Taylor and Dr.
Russell A. Hulse were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.
</P>
<P>
   With the huge radio telescope at Arecibo, P.R., the scientists
discovered a great rarity: a pair of neutron stars orbiting each
other and emitting a radio pulse every six one-hundredths of a
second. By making ultraprecise measurements of the pulse rate of
these emissions over years, they determined the rate was very
slightly increasing, a sign that the neutron stars were spiraling
toward each other and losing energy.
</P>
<P>
   The energy lost, they calculated, was exactly the amount
predicted from Einstein's general theory of relativity as energy
shed by the double pulsar in the form of gravity waves. This was
the first proof, indirect though it was, of the existence of
gravity waves.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists in the United States, Europe and Japan are now
searching for direct detection of these subtle ripples in the
cosmic web of space-time.
</P>
<P>
   But a new technical wrinkle in atomic timing is incorporated in
the latest descendant of Rabi's atomic clock idea _ a laser system
for cooling cesium atoms. The result, a clock the institute calls
NIST F-1, is some three times as accurate as the NIST-7, a cesium
clock invented in 1993 by the standards agency.
</P>
<P>
   Laser cooling of atoms, the main innovation in the NIST F-1
clock, is a technique developed by Dr. Steven Chu of Stanford, Dr.
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of the Ecole Normale Superieure in France
and Dr. William D. Phillips of the standards institute. The three
shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At room temperature an atom flies around at speeds up to 2,500
miles an hour, and is hard to measure. But if six laser beams are
directed at it from opposite directions, the atom must lose energy
in any direction it turns and is soon brought almost to a stop. The
temperature of an atom in such a trap is very close to absolute
zero.
</P>
<P>
   In the fountain clock, six lasers squeeze a cluster of cooled
cesium atoms into a little ball. Levitated by the lasers, the
cluster is then gently tossed upward as if it were the stream of a
fountain, and after the cluster has reached its maximum height
(about one yard) the lasers are turned off.
</P>
<P>
   As gravity tugs the cluster downward, it passes through a
chamber filled with precisely tuned microwaves, which excite those
atoms whose resonant frequencies match the microwave frequency. The
excited atoms then fluoresce, and light detectors measure the
brightness of the fluorescing cluster, which is a measure of the
proportion of atoms excited by the microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   By trial and error, the entire procedure of squirting cooled
atom clusters upward and passing them through a microwave cavity is
repeated many times, each time with a slight change in frequency of
the microwaves until a frequency is found that produces the most
intense fluorescence.
</P>
<P>
   This frequency is closest to the natural frequency of the cesium
atoms. From this information it is comparatively simple to mark off
a precisely measured second, which can then be used for setting
y clocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of each cesium atom as something like a little clock
that ticks more than nine billion times a second,'' Ms. Meekhof
said. ``You count the ticks and then you can use the result to set
the world's other clocks.''
</P>
<P>
   An important use of atomic clocks is correcting the errors in
clock time that result from the wobbling of the Earth's orbital
motions through space.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of timekeeping has been a continuous process of
correction and refinement over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient calendars based on a lunar cycle of 29 or 30 days
resulted in a year 11 days too short, so many governments added a
leap month whenever farmers deemed it necessary. Later, Julius
Caesar decreed a year with 365 days, with the added condition that
every fourth year, starting in 45 B.C., should be a leap year with
an extra day.
</P>
<P>
   But this created three leap years too many every 385 years, so
Pope Gregory XIII (with help from an astronomer) introduced a new
calendar in 1582 that called for a leap day in every year that is
exactly divisible by four; to make things work out correctly, the
pope decreed an exception to this rule: leap years ending in 00
(including 2000) must be evenly divisible by 400 to qualify for the
extra day.
</P>
<P>
   The Gregorian calendar has remained universal in Western
countries and in Japan, Egypt and China. But it is not perfect.
Atomic clocks have shown that unless a leap second is added every
18 months of so, the sun in New York would rise at noon 10,000
years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the forces acting on the Earth's rate of spin are
somewhat unpredictable, so it is impossible to schedule leap
seconds in any systematic way. Like the most ancient calendars
based on lunar cycles, leap seconds (the most recent of which was
delivered to the world's clocks on New Year's Eve, 1998) must be
decided by observations rather than timetables.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no end to the quest for improved time-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``About once every decade science turns up a new refinement, and
I'm sure our fountain clock is not the end of the line,'' Jefferts
said.

`REZ': LOOKING FOR A `BIG SKY' AND FINDING DESPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian Frazier's 1989 book, ``Great Plains,'' was one of those
enchanting books that thoroughly captured the peculiar mood and
magic of a place: not just the mythic dimensions of its history and
not just the mundane facts relating to its highways and byways and
towns, but the shimmering, miragelike overlap of the two. The Great
Plains in Frazier's dreams were ``enormous, bountiful, unfenced,''
and in that book he filled in some of those blanks with names and
stories, peopling that vast Western prairie with individuals he met
in the course of his 25,000-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas that earlier book had an air of exuberance about it _
``Once happiness gets rolling in this open place,'' Frazier wrote,
``not much stops it'' _ ``On the Rez,'' a sequel of sorts to
``Great Plains,'' is a sadder, darker and in many ways less
satisfying book. It continues the story of Frazier's fascination
with the Indians of the Great Plains, taking the author to the Pine
Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota, where his friend Le
War Lance (whom readers first met in ``Great Plains'') now makes
his home.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier comes to Pine Ridge eager to achieve ``that
self-possessed sense of freedom'' he believes the Indians uniquely
understand, and when he first sets foot on the reservation, he
thinks: ``I feel as if I am in actual America, the original version
that was here before and will still be here after we're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' he writes, ``this is the American
bedrock upon which the society outside its borders is only a later
addition. It's the surviving piece of country where `the program'
has not yet completely taken hold.''
</P>
<P>
   On the reservation, Frazier finds people of remarkable courage
and resilience, but he also finds terrible alcoholism, poverty and
factional infighting. He tells us that the Census Bureau lists Pine
Ridge as the ``poorest place per capita'' year after year and that
``the alcoholism rate among adults on Pine Ridge is above 65
percent,'' though ``there is as yet no alcohol treatment center on
the reservation.'' Indeed, drunk driving is a leading cause of
death on Pine Ridge: In 1996 alone, he reports, 12 people died as a
result of alcohol-related car accidents on its roads.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this book is that Frazier never really comes to
terms with the disparity between his romanticized dream of Indian
life (based largely on historical readings and a genuine love of
Sioux culture) and the often discouraging facts of day-to-day life
``on the rez.'' He writes that ``the hopeful, big-sky feeling with
which we often invest Western landscapes is at odds with the
reality of life on Pine Ridge,'' but wistfully adds that the
reservation ``still looks grand to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also complains about other writers' describing reservation
life as ``bleak'' but then gives us pages of sad statistics showing
that ``Indians are about twice as likely as non-Indians to be
murdered,'' that ``their death rate from alcoholism is four times
the national average'' and that ``one in five Indian girls and one
in eight boys attempts suicide by the end of high school.''
</P>
<P>
   When Frazier leaves broad generalizations, the results are
decidedly better. He creates a moving portrait of a young high
school basketball star named SuAnne Marie Big Crow, who led her
reservation team to the state championship in 1989 and died three
years later in a car wreck. He makes an eloquent and impassioned
argument for the U.S. government's giving back the Black Hills to
the Sioux. And he provides some artful digressions on Sioux ideals
of heroism, on the Lakota language, and on Indian superstitions and
lore. (``Rainbow-hued sun dogs _ bright spots on either side of the
sun _ mean an enemy is approaching.'' ``The smoke from anemone
flowers burned on hot coals can cure headaches.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for Frazier's accounts of his own travels, they are enlivened
by a keen eye for detail, and the same delightful sense of the
absurd that animated his humor collections, ``Dating Your Mom'' and
``Coyote vs. Acme.'' Ing us about his own hero worship of
the great Sioux warrior Crazy Horse, Frazier notes that he often
referred ``to his example when wondering how I should act in
certain situations'': so when it came to talking to his wife about
renovating their house, he asked himself, ``Would Crazy Horse have
spent this much to remodel a kitchen?''
</P>
<P>
   All too aware that he is a ``middle-class white guy'' with
Walter Mitty-ish dreams of being an Indian, Frazier chronicles his
friendship with Le War Lance in a wry voice that mixes
self-deprecation with skepticism and wishful thinking. He points
out that Le is constantly asking him for money _ for one emergency
or another, one car part or another _ and he feels both put upon
and grateful that he has a chance to ingratiate himself with his
friend. At times, he grows impatient with Le's habit of getting
drunk and telling far-fetched tales; at other moments, he berates
himself for being judgmental and chintzy and for taking a
``journalistic interest in Le.''
</P>
<P>
   Engaging as the evolving relationship between the two men proves
to be, it enlivens ``On the Rez'' without quite making up for the
book's longueurs and contradictions. In the end, the difference
between this volume and its predecessor may be best summed up by
the two historic figures who act as the presiding spirits of the
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Plains'' featured a moving portrait of the heroic Crazy
Horse, whom Frazier says he loves ``because he remained himself
from the moment of his birth to the moment he died''; because ``his
dislike of the oncoming civilization was prophetic''; because ``he
is not the Indian on the nickel, the tobacco pouch or the apple
crate.'' ``On the Rez,'' in contrast, features an ambivalent
portrait of Red Cloud, who made an early peace with the whites, and
who, under pressure from the U.S. government, reluctantly signed a
treaty agreeing to the sale of the gold-rich Black Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy Horse, who died in his 30s, is a good hero for someone
young,'' Frazier writes. ``As you age and see more of life's
complication, you may find sympathy, if not admiration, for Red
Cloud.''

&HT;     BUSH TOUTS HIS RECORD IN TEXAS TO BOLSTER CREDENTIALS

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Gov. George W. Bush hits the road this week
with key early political contests looming, he is packing his Texas
resume as proof that he has what it takes to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a big step going from governor to president of the
United States, but I've had some pretty good training,`` the
Republican candidate said in Bedford, N.H., the state with the
nation's first primaries on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   After months of honing his political arsenal on the campaign
trail and a holiday break to recharge his batteries, Bush is
heading into an intense monthlong stretch leading to a political
reckoning for would-be presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our state was a nation, it would be the 11th-largest
economy in the world,'' said Bush, who was elected to a second term
as Texas governor in 1998. ``I think if you were to check with the
people down there, they would pay me the high compliment of saying,
`He's done in office what he said he would do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his business experience also helped prepare him for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But he highlights his five years as an elected official in the
government's executive branch to distinguish himself from the other
Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executives are decision-makers. A good executive builds teams.
A good executive knows how to lead,`` said Bush, 53, who is running
for president as a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters said his 1998 re-election with 69 percent of the
vote shows most Texans are satisfied with his leadership on issues
ranging from education to criminal justice to cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Bush takes credit for some initiatives that were in
the works before he took office, exaggerates the positive effect of
tax-cut measures and has a poor record in areas such as
nvironmental protection _ a record he defends.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Bruce Buchanan of the University of Texas at
Austin said that overall, Bush's record gives him modest bragging
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got what I call a moderately successful record compiled
in favorable times, rather than in crisis or trying times,``
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does show a few characteristics we want in a president,``
including the ability to set and achieve goals, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Texas political scientist, Jerry Polinard of UT-Pan
American in Edinburg, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``His claims for success are valid, and one recognizes it's been
a modest success,`` Polinard said. ``He has not been able to get
everything he wants, but neither has he been shut out of the
process.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush's drive for the presidency comes after five years in the
``bully pulpit`` of the governorship. The Texas governorship is
considered a constitutionally weak post in which the power of
persuasion is critical.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has forged a reputation for one-on-one magic that he
demonstrates while campaigning, charming potential voters as he
shakes hands, makes small talk and signs autographs.
</P>
<P>
   And he is credited for being able to work with Democrats, who
controlled the House and Senate when he first was elected in 1994.
The Republican governor particularly forged a bond with former Lt.
Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other statewide Republican that involves
themselves in crowds like he does,`` said Democratic House Speaker
Pete Laney, wondering ``whether that'll be able to continue when he
gets his Secret Service.``
</P>
<P>
   George Christian, a consultant who was a press secretary to
President Lyndon Johnson, said Bush ``came in as governor not
knowing a lot about state government, and he's done very well by
utilizing his natural traits, which are friendliness, cooperation
and a calm approach to what he's trying to do.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not just been someone legislative leaders can work
with, he was ``agreeable to work with,'' Laney said. ``There's a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's gubernatorial record began in 1995, when lawmakers
approved measures addressing four goals he campaigned on: reforms
in education, welfare, juvenile justice and the civil lawsuit
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some said Bush simply latched on to four issues already at the
forefront of the state agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in effect piggybacking on trains that were already
moving,`` Buchanan said. ``There's nothing immoral about that, but
it's not quite the same as being an entrepreneur with bold and
daring vision, either.``
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who heads Bush's Texas campaign for
president, said Bush talked to lawmakers about the issues as his
1994 gubernatorial campaign unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were they being talked about before? Yes. Was he intuitive
enough to understand these are important issues the people of the
state of Texas need and want? Yes,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He articulated where he wanted to take Texas, and then he
followed through. That second part is the most important part,`` he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm dismissed
such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only really positive thing George W. Bush has done is to
stay out of the way when the leaders of the House and Senate were
trying to get things done,`` she said.
</P>
<P>
   The House speaker wasn't so harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part of what made it happen,`` Laney said. While
agreeing with Buchanan that Bush jumped on a moving train in his
first session, Laney called the move ``pretty smart politics.``
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's second legislative session, in 1997, he proposed a tax
overhaul with an eye to relieving local property taxes that heavily
support Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush left himself open to criticism by suggesting that property
tax relief be financed partly by increases in some state taxes,
along with a budget surplus. In the end, he did not get the
overhaul he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the $1 billion property tax reduction for which Bush settled
is a key campaign selling point, coupled with another $1.85 billion
in property and other tax cuts from the 1999 legislative session.
Again, the total was less than he sought.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legislation, a taxpayer group said hoped-for
property tax relief appeared to vanish into a ``black hole`` as a
number of local school districts raised rates. But an official with
the group said that, without state action, taxes would have been
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Bush secured the right to say he had signed large
tax-cut measures into law, which he does with alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   As he travels the country, Bush also touts his record on
education, especially a plan meant to ensure youngsters can read
and are not promoted until academically ready. He wasn't, however,
able to win Texas lawmakers' approval for a pilot program of
publicly paid vouchers for private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, Bush says welfare rolls are down, that he has
made a priority of ``putting people in jail who cannot figure out
how to peacefully coexist with their neighbors`` and that tort
reform has made Texas ``entrepreneurial heaven.``
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATIERAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics see his record as something less than angelic.
</P>
<P>
   They said he has not supported some important measures,
including a bill to strengthen the state's law against hate crimes
after a black man was dragged to his death behind a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contended the bill's inclusion of gays prompted concern
from advisers as Bush eyed his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush stopped that bill. ... I think he only did that
because his advisers didn't want him to sign a bill that protected
gays,`` said Dianne Hardy-Garcia of the Lesbian and Gay Rights
Lobby of Texas. ``That was heartbreaking for us.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied defeating the bill and said existing law should be
enforced. In the dragging-death case, which resulted in three
murder convictions, he noted that the death penalty was handed down
in two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record on the environment also has come under fire, with
environmental groups contending it was filled with industry
influence and missed opportunities. Bush said Texas has made
progress while he has been governor.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also said Bush has not done what he should to help the
poor, including those who suffer from hunger, or prevent gun
violence. Bush says the crime rate has decreased and that he has
worked to rally religious groups to help the poor while moving
people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently took issue with a federal report saying Texas had
the nation's second-largest percentage of households that
experienced hunger between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some people in my state who are hungry. I
don't believe 5 percent are hungry,`` he said in New Hampshire,
drawing concern from advocates for the poor who said there are many
hungry Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and others compare criticism he receives to that in his
first gubernatorial race, when Democratic incumbent Ann Richards
and others suggested he was unprepared to lead the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They underestimated me,`` Bush has said of that contest. ``I
love to be underestimated.``

   People may believe that their mouths are pristine after a good
brushing and flossing. But the truth is that the human mouth is
home to so many microbes that some researchers compare it to a rain
forest for the diversity of life and vast territory yet to be
explored.
</P>
<P>
   A study last month in The Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences supports this analogy by identifying 37 new kinds of
b thriving between teeth and gum. The research brings the
total known species of oral wildlife to about 500, some of which
are permanent residents while others may just be passing through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mouth is a plush ecosystem unto itself, and we are just
beginning to see what is really there,'' said Dr. David A. Relman,
the study's team leader and an assistant professor of medicine and
microbiology at Stanford University. ``People like to go to Africa
to stare at animals, but micro-organisms are far more diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers extracted plaque from the crevice between a
subject's tooth and gum. They then used two techniques to identify
what kinds of bacteria the plaque contained.
</P>
<P>
   One was the traditional method of growing bacteria from the
sample and examining the results with a microscope. The other was
to identify bacteria by examining DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the researchers found 31 new species of bacteria
with the DNA technique and just six from laboratory cultivation.
The difference was that most bacteria have trouble growing outside
their natural environment, Relman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the organisms appear to be related to others normally
found outside the human body. One was similar to a bacterium that
lives in lake bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Floyd E. Dewhirst, a molecular geneticist and dentist at the
Forsyth Institute, a dental research center in Boston, said that
people need not be concerned about most bacteria living in their
 While some bacteria cause diseases like pneumonia if they
get into the bloodstream, others are harmless hitchikers profiting
from a warm, protected environment in which there is plenty to eat.

ARIZONA'S VOTES OPEN TO MISCHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ This year, Arizonans will be able to vote for
president about as often as they get an oil change _ and it will
all be legal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current presidential primary arrangement, voters could
legally cast ballots in the primary elections of the two major
political parties, election and party officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   Voters could then go on to vote for a candidate in the Reform
Party in the summer and cap off all of this multipartisan mischief
with a vote in November for one of the three people they helped
nominate.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could vote for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to world-class political chaos, Arizona-style.
</P>
<P>
   County and state election officials acknowledge that two-fisted
voting could be the result of the scheduling of Republican and
Democratic primaries on separate days 18 days apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it would be possible,'' conceded Maricopa County
Recorder Helen Purcell.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Purcell doubts that voters, many of whom have
proven themselves to be less than excited about voting at all in
recent years, will be inspired to take advantage of the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get 'em to go to the polls once, much less twice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The snarl begins on Feb. 22, the day Arizona Republicans will
vote in a taxpayer-supported presidential preference primary.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the thread leads to March 11, when Arizona
Democrats, constrained by their national rules, hold a separate and
privately financed election.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for mischief arises because the Democrats allow
their members to register to vote up to and including the day of
the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   That means there is nothing to prevent Arizona residents who
register as Republicans by that party's deadline of Monday, Jan.
24, to re-register as Democrats on or before March 11 to cast a
second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage this type of double-dipping at the polls,
Democratic officials say they plan to require voters to sign a form
swearing that they did not vote in any other primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the form isn't worth a jot legally, officials admit, because
there are no consequences for signing it with your fingers crossed
behind your back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's probably not something we could enforce
legally,'' conceded Mark Fleisher, chairman of the Arizona
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will have a third crack at the ballot box next summer,
when the Reform Party intends to hold a national primary election
by mail. The party will allow any registered voter, including
Democrats and Republicans, to participate in an effort to encourage
more interest in the party.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party will then hold a national convention at which
only Reform Party members will be permitted to ratify the party's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Reform Party Chairman Eugene Kerkman said he does not
believe Democrats and Republicans will face ``wholesale'' voter
shenanigans, but he is aware of some people who intend to vote, as
the saying goes, early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are people who do exactly that,'' Kerkman said,
adding that such unauthorized attempts to interfere with another
party's election are ``kind of malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, we've completely lost our sense of
ethics,'' Kerkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the Natural Law Party, with only 70 registered voters,
has already qualified for the ballot, while Kerkman's Reform Party,
which can boast at least one candidate (Pat Buchanan) who got
93,000 votes for president in Arizona in 1996, has not. But the
Reformers, who have 800 registered voters, are working on that.
They have until May.
</P>
<P>
   In another wrinkle that could have important implications for
the Democratic presidential candidates, members of the state
Democratic Party will vote Jan. 22 on whether to allow Independent
voters to participate in their primary.
</P>
<P>
   If the party approves the participation of Independent voters,
it is widely believed that Bill Bradley, who has spent a lot of
time appealing to Independents, will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   State election officials have been aware of the opportunities
for mischief for some time. Last year they tried to get the
Democrats to change their plans and participate in the presidential
preference primary on the same day as Republicans. They even
offered to try to get a joint primary date moved back to March and
proposed an all-mail ballot election to accommodate the Democrats'
national rules, which prevent them from holding their election in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, rebuffed by the Democratic National Committee, state
officials gave up their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursued different ways to have more uniformity in how this
was going to happen, but we just couldn't get any traction,'' said
Jessica Funkhouser, state elections director.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Democrats are running their own show, state
officials are powerless to monitor their election, meaning that the
only safeguard in place is the Democratic Party's sign-up sheet
requiring that voters affirm that they haven't already voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep trying to emphasize that the Democrats are not
participating in a state election,'' Funkhouser said. ``We don't
have any jurisdiction over who they allow to participate in their
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Under rio in which Democrats register as Republicans and
then re-register as Democrats, it would be the Republicans who
could end up hurt, as conceivably Democrats would wish to vote for
the presidential candidate with the least chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said state GOP Chairman Mike Minnaugh, who laughingly
dismissed any concerns about a Democratic raid on his party's
primary. The Democrats, he suggested, have a hard enough time
getting their own members to the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are so concerned about a particular (Republican)
candidate that they are going to get their two people together and
go and re-register,'' Minnaugh joked.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said Democrats are not encouraging such a scheme.
</P>
<P>
   And, pointing out that Democrats went through much the same
routine in 1996, asking voters to promise they weren't voting
twice, Fleisher said he is confident there will be no organized
attempt to subvert the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would interpret it as voter fraud,'' Fleisher
said, adding that ``most people will act responsibly if they think
they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Fleisher said he worries about the potential for such
contretemps to backfire. For instance, Democrats could
inadvertently help elect a candidate who is anathema to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems to backfire when you try to do something like
that,'' Fleisher said. ``I think the Republicans should put forth
their best candidate, and the Democrats should put forth their best
candidate.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Y2K BUG STILL MISSING AS WORKERS RETURN FROM HOLIDAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans returned to their offices and
factories Monday, they found the lights on, the phones working and
their fears about Y2K bugs dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   On the first regular business day o the nation
experienced only ``minor glitches'' that had no chance of
snowballing into big trouble, said John Koskinen, President
Clinton's top Y2K adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can safely say that what has been referred to as the Y2K
bug has been squashed,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example the kinds of problems that turned up, he noted
that a customer returning a movie to a rental shop in suburban
Albany, N.Y., was hit with a $91,250 late fee after computers
showed the tape was overdue by 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said such incidents, while mostly causing chuckles,
help confirm the existence of the Y2K bug, a software flaw that
could have caused older computers to misinterpret the year ``00,''
misreading it as 1900 rather than 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw had the potential to cause massive failures of
computerized equipment, but because of a $100-billion effort by
business owners to eradicate it, the problem will be confined to
``some glitches around the edges,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   The $8.5 billion in spending by the federal government also
appears to have paid off. All 1,300 Social Security Administration
field offices opened Monday and reported no difficulties with their
50 million lines of computer code. The Postal Service did turn up
two minor problems, one involving old retail terminals that showed
the wrong date and the other in a system that reports mail volume.
Both glitches were quickly fixed.
</P>
<P>
   One bug affected a computer at the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in
Oak Ridge, Tenn., but had no impact on operations or workers, the
Energy Department reported. Because computer controls are a
classified function, the exact nature of the problem was not
explained, but the Energy Department said the bug was fixed in
about three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, banks started making plans for shipping back the
extra $50 billion in cash that the Federal Reserve Board had
ordered up to avert possible runs on automated teller machines. The
fresh bills will not be destroyed, but rather will be stored and
eventually used to replace worn-out currency.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said his operation, called the President's Council on
Y2K Conversion, will begin this week to scale back its efforts to
monitor the Y2K bug. However, some staff will continue to watch
computers through Feb. 29. Years ending in 00 include a leap day
only every fourth century _ including this year _ and some
computers are not be prepared for that date quirk.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said he is pleased that software fixes went so well
that they have given rise to skepticism about Y2K, saying he'd
rather respond to those comments than to questions about why things
went so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We geared up for a major potential set of problems and I think
all of us view it as a great victory that we can sit here and talk
about, `Was it money well spent? Did we have to do it?''' he said.

 &HT;    ATTENTION, BORED VOTERS: PRESIDENTIAL RACES ENTERING KEY PHASE
 &HT;    With CAMPAIGN-TIMELINE. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four debates in four days this week signals a new
phase of the 2000 presidential campaign _ one that is likely to be
more ferocious and more unpredictable as voters take control of the
process from the candidates, their advisers and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats square off Wednesday in New Hampshire and again
Saturday in Iowa, while the Republicans debate Thursday in New
Hampshire and Friday in South Carolina _ the beginning of a 10-week
campaign sprint in which a majority of delegates will be chosen for
the parties' nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign begins to take root in the American
consciousness, it does so with serious contests being waged in both
parties. That situation was anticipated by few in the political
class last summer, least of all the two front-runners: Vice
President Al Gore on the Democratic side and Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas among the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   However, for all the rhetorical flourid unprecedented
fund raising that has taken place over the past 12 months, experts
say the campaign has failed to come into focus for most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a serious horse race in both parties, but it's hard
to put your finger on what they're about,'' said Linda Fowler, a
Dartmouth College professor who directs the presidential primary
polling in New Hampshire for Dartmouth and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Fowler said, that both Gore and Bush have tried to
wage a general election campaign since last summer, tailoring their
appeals to moderate centrist voters rather than the more activist
partisans that largely dominate primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Another, she said, is the complacency growing out of years of
uninterrupted economic growth and staggering declines in crime and
welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center for The People and The Press
last month, for example, found that the rhetoric and events of the
presidential campaign had had ``impact'' on the attitudes of
voters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that ``relatively few people are able to
associate candidates with their main policy proposals.'' For
example, only 15 percent of the 1,073 adults polled by Pew
researchers could identify Bush with ``compassionate
conservatism,'' the Texas governor's main campaign slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't seem to care very much about this election
so far, because there doesn't seem to be a salient issue,'' Fowler
said. ``And that has made it easier for insurgent candidates.
People are willing to take a chance on lesser known quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples are former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who only
six months ago was considered a long shot against Gore, and Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, widely regarded as an even longer shot
against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Bradley and McCain running slightly ahead of
their chief opponents in New Hampshire, which holds the nation's
first presidential primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's strength in New Hampshire has allowed him more time to
pick at Gore's lead in Iowa, where both parties will conduct
presidential nominating caucuses on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is skipping the GOP caucus in Iowa, concentrating instead
on winning the South Carolina primary on Feb. 19. A win there,
combined with a victory in the Feb. 22 primary in his home state of
Arizona, could sustain him into a March 7 showdown involving 11
states, including the huge prizes of California, New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's poll momentum and his crusade against the
campaign-finance system may be no match for the awesome
fund-raising talents of Bush. The Texas governor has raised more
than $67 million for his White House bid and still has $31.4
million in the bank. McCain, on the other hand, has raised $15.6
million but has only $7.7 million left.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the GOP, the Democratic Party has not altered its rules
prohibiting primaries between New Hampshire and March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Gore and Bradley will be waging an expensive
coast-to-coast campaign after Feb. 1, perhaps until six Southern
and Western states, including Texas and Florida, vote March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley will both have about $20 million to finance
their campaigns, but Gore, like Bush in the GOP contest, has the
advantage of being supported by the party establishment. Gore also
has the backing of President Clinton, an advantage in the
Democratic primaries, if not in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley anticipated Gore's advantages from the start and has
waged his campaign accordingly, seeking new and independent voters
with promises of a few ``big things'': providing health care to all
children and most adults, reforming campaign finance, tightening
gun controls and increasing the number of teachers in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a speech billed by his campaign as a ``vision for
America in the new millennium,'' told a New Hampshire audience
Monday that as president he would open ``a world of new
possibilities guided by goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, countering Bradley with a speech in Iowa, offered himself
as a tried-and-true national leader capable of tackling more than a
few national problems. ``We cannot afford to say that meeting one
of these challenges is enough,'' he said. ``All of them are well
within our reach ... if we make good decisions with good
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley will meet for their fourth debate Wednesday
night at the University of New Hampshire in Durham. ABC's Peter
Jennings will moderate the debate, which begins at 7 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Tim Russert will moderate the GOP debate Thursday night at
the University of New Hampshire. All six GOP candidates are
expected: Bush, McCain, publisher Steve Forbes, activist Gary
Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and former ambassador Alan Keyes.

researchers could identify Bush with ``compassionate
conservatism,'' the Texas governor's main campaign slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't seem to care very much about this election
so far, because there doesn't seem to be a salient issue,'' Fowler
said. ``And that has made it easier for insurgent candidates.
People are willing to take a chance on lesser known quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples are former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who only
six months ago was considered a long shot against Gore, and Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, widely regarded as an even longer shot
against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Bradley and McCain running slightly ahead of
their chief opponents in New Hampshire, which holds the nation's
first presidential primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's strength in New Hampshire has allowed him more time to
pick at Gore's lead in Iowa, where both parties will conduct
presidential nominating caucuses on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is skipping the GOP caucus in Iowa, concentrating instead
on winning the South Carolina primary on Feb. 19. A win there,
combined with a victory in the Feb. 22 primary in his home state of
Arizona, could sustain him into a March 7 showdown involving 11
states, including the huge prizes of California, New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's poll momentum and his crusade against the
campaign-finance system may be no match for the awesome
fund-raising talents of Bush. The Texas governor has raised more
than $67 million for his White House bid and still has $31.4
million in the bank. McCain, on the other hand, has raised $15.6
million but has only $7.7 million left.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the GOP, the Democratic Party has not altered its rules
prohibiting primaries between New Hampshire and March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Gore and Bradley will be waging an expensive
coast-to-coast campaign after Feb. 1, perhaps until six Southern
and Western states, including Texas and Florida, vote March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley will both have about $20 million to finance
their campaigns, but Gore, like Bush in the GOP contest, has the
advantage of being supported by the party establishment. Gore also
has the backing of President Clinton, an advantage in the
Democratic primaries, if not in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley anticipated Gore's advantages from the start and has
waged his campaign accordingly, seeking new and independent voters
with promises of a few ``big things'': providing health care to all
children and most adults, reforming campaign finance, tightening
gun controls and increasing the number of teachers in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a speech billed by his campaign as a ``vision for
America in the new millennium,'' told a New Hampshire audience
Monday that as president he would open ``a world of new
possibilities guided by goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, countering Bradley with a speech in Iowa, offered himself
as a tried-and-true national leader capable of tackling more than a
few national problems. ``We cannot afford to say that meeting one
of these challenges is enough,'' he said. ``All of them are well
within our reach ... if we make good decisions with good
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley will meet for their fourth debate Wednesday
night at the University of New Hampshire in Durham. ABC's Peter
Jennings will moderate the debate, which begins at 7 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Tim Russert will moderate the GOP debate Thursday night at
the University of New Hampshire. All six GOP candidates are
expected: Bush, McCain, publisher Steve Forbes, activist Gary
Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and former ambassador Alan Keyes.

 &HT;    Census posing problem for Bush
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three months before U.S. census workers begin
counting Americans, the seemingly arcane question of whether they
should give states numbers based on a strict head count or
estimates derived from statistical sampling has become a political
quandary for Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans are wary of sampling because it will boost the
number of perennially undercounted blacks and Hispanics, who tend
tDemocratic. They also argue that the Constitution forbids
it. But Bush is hoping to bring many minority voters into the GOP
fold, and he risks alienating them if he suggests that he favors an
undercount of their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The census is all about politics: Federal officials use the
final tally to determine how many of the 435 U.S. representatives
will be allotted to each state. State legislatures use the numbers
to draw congressional and state legislative districts. People who
aren't counted lose political power, and nearly every census since
the first one in 1790 has been politically charged.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Scott McClellan says Bush generally supports
actual counting as opposed to sampling, but the governor hasn't
said publicly whether he would give the estimates to the states,
which is the crux of the issue. Bush is the only presidential
candidate who hasn't taken a position on that question. All the
other Republicans, with the exception of U.S. Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, say they would withhold the estimates from the states.
McCain and Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley say they would send
them out.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan also couldn't say whether Bush would allow federal
agencies to use estimates in calculating how much education and
welfare money to send to each state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reticence on the issue troubles some conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do is not upset minority voters who
believethat government should exercise their rights. This is a
crass political move,'' said Matthew Glavin of the Atlanta-based
Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative group that
successfully sued to force the use of the actual numbers to
determine how many U.S. representatives each state will get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that Governor Bush doesn't answer the question makes
it appear as if he supports the use of sampled numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The census bureau estimates that 60 percent of the roughly 120
million American households will return their census forms in the
mail. To reach the rest, the bureau will hire about 860,000
temporary workers, most of whom will fan out across the country to
knock on doors.
</P>
<P>
   But even that effort won't result in a complete count. Many
people, distrustful of government, will avoid being counted or will
give the workers inaccurate infor Americans are increasingly
mobile, and some will fall through the cracks. Language barriers
and illiteracy also complicate the process.
</P>
<P>
   Counting in minority communities in inner cities and in rural
areas is particularly difficult. The Census Bureau says it missed
more than 500,000 Texans, many of them Hispanics, in the 1990
census. The state sued unsuccessfully to get the numbers adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a highly disproportionate undercount of racial
minorities, children and the poor, both urban and rural,'' said
Terri Ann Lowenthal of the Census 2000 Initiative, a 4-year-old
group that tracks census-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan says Bush ``will work to do whatever it takes to
locate and count each and every person in America.'' But the census
will be over by the time the next president takes office. And
Lowenthal says counting everybody, even with more money or workers,
is impossible. Census researchers from the National Academy of
Sciences agree.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the accuracy of the census count are nothing new:
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both expressed concerns that
the 1790 census missed many Americans, historians say.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling supporters say the estimates, derived from 300,000
randomly selected households, will produce the most accurate count.
Dozens of prominent minority groups, including the NAACP, the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National
Council of La Raza and the National Urban League, support the
release of the estimates to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are eager to highlight Bush's dilemma. Earlier this
month, the Democratic leaders of the major congressional minority
caucuses wrote a letter to Bush asking him to end his silence on
the sampling issue. ``Do you stand with those who would deny
minorities, children, and the poor fair representation and economic
benefits for purely partisan political reasons?'' the letter
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress members say Bush's home state lost about $1 billion
in federal aid during the 1990s as a result of the undercount and
the subsequent decision, made by President Bush's administration,
not to adjust the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president often
mentions the issue during his interviews with Hispanic media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It literally translates into whether you count or don't count.
Al Gore wants to do everything possible to make sure that Hispanics
are accurately represented,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   The census has a rich history as a political football. Unhappy
with the results of the 1920 census, which showed that for the
first time most Americans lived in cities, rural members of
Congress blocked attempts to adjust political power. As a result,
legislative lines weren't redrawn until after the 1930 census. Most
Republicans acknowledge that the use of sampling to draw districts
would hurt them politically. But some insist that the issue is
constitutional, not political.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would argue that every person in America has a
constitutionally guaranteed right to be counted. But like any other
right that's guaranteed by the Constitution, in order to enjoy the
benefits of that right, individuals must exercise it, `` said
Glavin, who says the Constitution requires a head count.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you choose not to vote, Bill Clinton and the government
can't come in, guess how you would have voted and then adjust the
election results.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody agrees with that analysis. Margo Anderson, a
professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and one of the
nation's foremost census historians, says the Constitution's census
clause is open to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin and the Republican-controlled U.S. House of
Representatives sued the Clinton administration to force the use of
the actual numbers for the 2000 census. Last January, the Supreme
Court ruled, based on an interpretation of census law rather than
the Constitution, that sampling could not be used to determin-- how
many representatives each state will get. Clinton administration
officials interpreted the decision to mean that sampling could be
used for drawing legislative districts and for handing out federal
aid.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be the next White House occupant who decides whether
to give the estimates to the states _ which is why many are waiting
to find out where George W. Bush stands on the issue.

`ALL MY CHILDREN' TURNS 30 WITH BIRTHDAY SHOW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service cients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to realize it was 30 years ago when a teen-age Erica
Kane descended upon Pine Valley _ and the world _ on the ABC soap
opera, ``All My Children.'' But the venerable daytime drama _ with
Erica's drama-queen antics still going strong _ will celebrate
three decades on the air on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Erica (Susan Lucci, winner of the 1999 daytime Emmy
for best actress _ finally! _ after 19 tries) the remaining three
original cast members will be featured: Mary Fickett (Ruth Martin),
winner of the first daytime Emmy for acting in 1973; Ray MacDonnell
(Dr. Joe Martin); and Ruth Warrick (Phoebe Tyler), who played the
wife opposite Orson Welles in ``Citizen Kane''.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hourlong show, which begins at noon, will be a
clipfest as well as a window to the future as characters recall 30
years of groundbreaking stories, including those focusing on AIDS,
abortion, date rape, teen-age alcoholism, racial bias, spousal
abuse, homosexuality, eating disorders and opposition to the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Agnes Nixon, who is still head writer, ``All My
Children'' debuted Jan. 5, 1970, as a half-hour show; seven years
later, it expanded to an hour. It launched many careers, including
those of Dana Delaney, Lauren Holly, Sarah Michelle Gellar,
Christine Baranski, Dorothy Lyman, Amanda Bearse, Kathy Bates,
Robert Downey Jr., Christian Slater, Wesley Snipes and Robert
Urich. &QL;

CASES: WHEN DECISIONS MEAN LIFE OR DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night recently, when I was on call in the emergency room at
my hospital, paramedics wheeled in an elderly woman on a stretcher
at 2 a.m. She was having severe chest pain, which an EKG
immediately confirmed was a serious heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The ER sprung into action. Doctors whisked her into a treatment
room, put her on a monitor, placed an oxygen mask over her face,
and began an IV drip of nitroglycerin. (The paramedics had already
given her an aspirin.)
</P>
<P>
   Though in pain, she was alert, clear-headed and quiet. The only
indication of an emergency was in the buzz of the many doctors and
nurses around her.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, including the cardiology fellow who had been summoned
on an emergency beeper, began preparing her for angioplasty, in
which a catheter would be threaded through an artery in her groin
to open the blockage that was cutting off blood flow to her heart.
</P>
<P>
   The cardiology fellow, a bright, energetic man, stepped outside
the room to talk with the woman's daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother was in critical condition, he told them, and if
nothing was done she might die. Angioplasty probably offered her
the best shot of surviving this crisis, but it was risky,
particularly in an emergency. Their mother, age 90, could die on
the table or suffer brain damage or end up on a ventilator. No one
could predict with any certainty what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   She could also be treated, with a simple injection, with a
thrombolytic drug to dissolve blood clots. But it would probably
not be as effective as angioplasty in this situation, and it
carried a risk of bleeding, especially at her age, into her head.
</P>
<P>
   So what did they want to do?
</P>
<P>
   The children thought for a few minutes, but couldn't decide.
Perhaps, they suggested, they should ask their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now ordinarily, in an emergency, doctors are not supposed to
waste precious time discussing risks and benefits, certainly not
with patients who probably cannot understand the choices before
them anyway. Doctors are taught to treat first and ask questions
later, on the assumption that rational people would prefer
treatment to prolong their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But this emergency was different. The patient was awake and
seemingly competent. We could decide how to keep her alive, but
only she could decide whether the effort would be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The cardiology fellow went through her options, and the woman
listened.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was not clear how much of the complicated situation
she understood, she did not like any of her options, including
doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted assurances we could not give. We wanted a decision
she could not make. She finally looked out at the room of white
coats, slowly shook her head, and said she didn't know. She was
taken to the cardiac care unit for observation.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this was not a surprise. With little medical
knowledge, and often burdened by fear, depression or pain,
hospitalized patients can have a hard time properly weighing their
options. Some doctors even argue that obtaining informed consent
from them is a meaningless exercise promoted by ethicists who don't
understand the realities of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   There are data to support this view. Most studies show that
patients recall less than half of what doctors tell them. In one
study on informed consent before cataract surgery, for example,
only 4 percent of patients recalled more than two out of five risks
disclosed to them by their doctors (only a third remembered later
that blindness was a potential risk). And studies show that
patients often don't take an interest in the informed consent
process.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that patients are often helpless or feel
intimidated is precisely why ethicists have argued that informed
consent is so essential.
</P>
<P>
   So what if patients don't know what is right for them or make
wrong decisions. As Stephen Wear, an ethicist at the State
University of New York at Buffalo, wrote in his book, ``Informed
Consent'': ``Elsewhere, we recognize and accept that harm and
tragedy may result from the free exercise of one's will. But this
is simply the price we must sometimes pay for the freedom to which
we give such a fundamental value and status.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, on the cardiology service, I had a patient who
suffered from a dangerous cardiac rhythm called ventricular
tachycardia.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have shown that these patients live longer when
they have automatic defibrillators implanted in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   My patient was young and seemed an ideal candidate for this
device.
</P>
<P>
   But when I brought it up with him, he flatly refused. His
kidneys had failed years earlier and he had been in and out of
hospitals undergoing dialysis treatment. He had suffered a lot of
pain and did not trust doctors to keep him well.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem to matter to him that he could die suddenly
while walking down the street. He wanted out of the hospital, and
so we had to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   But though I believed he was wrong, it was his decision. If
autonomy means anything, it means patients have the right to make
bad decisions, too.
</P>
<P>
   But many situations are far less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, ``Assessing Competence to Consent to Treatment,''
Dr. Thomas Grisso and Dr. Paul Appelbaum, two ethicists at the
University of Massachusetts, wrote that when patients were unable
to reach a treatment decision or convey it to their doctors, courts
and ethicists have considered them to be incompetent to make
treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But when does irresolution become incompetence? And how can
patients and doctors properly weigh competing values in
emergencies?
</P>
<P>
   I recently took care of an 80-year-old man with prostate cancer.
He had been admitted to the hospital with severe back pain, and an
MRI had revealed a metastasis that was compressing his spinal cord.
After treatment with high-dose steroids and radiation, he felt
better. But one morning, a day before he was to be discharged, his
heart went into an abnormal rhythm that impaired its ability to
pump. His blood pressure dropped, fluid accumulated in his lungs
and he grew short of breath. The best option was to apply an
electrical shock to his heart to jolt it into a normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   But he disagreed, scowling at me through his oxygen mask. ``I
want to give up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I did not think he was competent to make that decision, so I
continued preparations for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 50 years had been sitting quietly beside his bed.
But suddenly she got up and left the room. Minutes later, her
husband's attending physician appeared in the room. He said the
patient's wife would not consent to any more treatment. ``We can
get him through this,'' I protested. But his wife had made a value
judgment that superseded my medical one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the value judgments that complicate emergencies
fall upon doctors.
</P>
<P>
   I admitted a middle-aged man to the hospital a few months ago
who had been diagnosed with salivary gland cancer in 1998. Despite
aggressive treatment, including experimental chemotherapy, the
cancer had spread to his lungs. When I saw him the first night in
the ER, a chocolate cake sat on a small table by his bed. It was
his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   At home he had been getting progressively shorter of breath. But
he was terminally ill and I knew his condition could deteriorate.
So after my exam I broached with him and his wife the subject of
special efforts to keep him alive: whether to resuscitate him if
his heart stopped or if he stopped breathing. His wife said they
wanted everything possible to be done to keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, about 2 a.m., he became acutely short of breath.
His blood oxygen saturation was very low and steadily dropping.
</P>
<P>
   He was awake and able to talk, but lack of oxygen was making him
more and more lethargic. I had no idea of his mental state, but he
said he wanted everything done for him, including intubation if
necessary. ``Then we have to intubate you now,'' one of the other
doctors told him.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the immediate prospect of a breathing tube, he
suddenly lost his nerve. Could we wait a little longer, he asked,
to see if he might get better on his own.
</P>
<P>
   But his condition was deteriorating rapidly. Without mechanical
ventilation, he could suddenly develop cardiac arrest. He and his
wife needed to make a decision immediately, either to accept a
breathing tube, or sign a ``do not resuscitate'' form. A 4 a.m.
conversation with the attending physician resolved nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue had begun to set in. Some minutes later, in the dim dawn
light, they asked me what to do, and I told them. He died the next
day.

 &HT;    Elation turns to sorrow as CARE worker killed overseas
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Monday was a day of deeply mixed emotions for
employees of CARE USA, the Atlanta-based relief and development
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they prepared a party to celebrate the release of a
colleague after eight months in a Yugoslav prison, they received
word that one co-worker in Somalia had been shot to death and
another was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Shuab Mohamed Hussein, a Somali employee of CARE USA, was killed
Sunday when his CARE vehicle was ambushed north of Mogadishu.
Hussein had been with CARE for two months, and worked to ensure
food security and to build bridges and culverts, said Peter Bell,
president of CARE USA.
</P>
<P>
   An employee who was with Hussein is missing, Bell said, and CARE
officials are concerned about his fate. Bell declined to name the
second employee, but noted he was also a native Somali and had been
with CARE forars.
</P>
<P>
   News of Hussein's death came as workers at CARE's headquarters
in Atlanta prepared to celebrate the release of Branko Jelen, a
Yugoslav citizen who worked for CARE Australia. CARE USA and CARE
Australia are both are members of CARE International.
</P>
<P>
   Jelen was arrested April 8, shortly after NATO started bombing
Yugoslavia in March. Two Australian CARE employees had been
arrested a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The three were convicted of passing secret information out of
the country, but the Australians were granted clemency in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that CARE had lobbied hard for Jelen's release,
working with the United Nations, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson,
former South African President Nelson Mandela, former President
Jimmy Carter and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, Jelen had become ``quite depressed,'' Bell
said. He is receiving counseling, and plans to move to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   CARE USA had been reluctant to work in Yugoslavia while Jelen _
whom CARE officials said had done nothing wrong _ remained in
prison. In light of his release, Bell said his organization may
increase its involvement in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic,
where CARE Australia helps refugees from Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``While saddened by the news from Somalia, we are absolutely
elated by Branko's release,'' Bell said. The party would go on.
</P>
<P>
   The news, both the good and the bad, emphasized the dangers
faced by relief workers. Over the last 20 years, 120 CARE employees
have died on the job _ many in accidents, but some from gunfire and
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who recently returned from a trip to Cambodia, India and
Nepal, said the sense of purpose of the staff members impressed him
_ not only in those countries, but in other dangerous venues such
as Somalia, Sudan, Sierra Leone and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their dedication is humbling,'' he said. ``It really is
incredible.''

HOME EX 101: FINDING THE BEST OF THE NEW FITNESS VIDEOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New fitness videos pop up on store shelves like mushrooms _ a
new crop can appear overnight. It's hard to keep up with the
trends, and it's even harder to figure out what is worth buying.
</P>
<P>
   But it's that new-start time of year, and I had a goal: Find the
newest workout videos, check out the latest trends, and figure out
what's worth the money and the wear on my VCR.
</P>
<P>
   This study is highly unscientific _ I couldn't try every video
on the market, and I didn't use them for an extended period to
gauge their long-term effectiveness. I simply scooted back the
comfy couch, popped in the videos in random order, and worked out
like it was 1999. Which it was.
</P>
<P>
   What I learned: Not all fitness videos are created equal _ there
are plenty of losers on the shelves. I was most unimpressed by
``Tai Funk Aerobics,'' the latest in MTV's popular Grind Workout
series. ``Tai Funk'' features boy-group C Note, and, being older
than 14, I was not impressed when they burst into song at the end
of the workout. Next, I tried a new video from the Living Yoga
series. The box clearly says ``for beginners'' _ but when the
instructor neatly tucked her leg behind her ear and serenely
smiled, this beginner gave up and just plopped down on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Below, a sampling of the videos that seem worth the effort _ and
why:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Crunch Boot Camp Training''
</P>
<P>
   Instructor: Susan L. Hitzman, an exercise physiologist,
certified instructor and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   What it is: One of the latest additions to the series developed
by Crunch gyms. Four 71/2-minute segments are designed to condition
muscles and provide a cardio workout; but even though the video is
in segments, it's a nonstop 30-minute workout. Muscle-toning
exercises require light weights.
</P>
<P>
   Why it's worth your time: ``Boot Camp'' is like going to a class
at the gym; it's mostly low-impact and fun. Hitzman is easy to
follow, and she introduces some push-up variations that are
frustrating but effective.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance factor: The video box says Hitzman's favorite binge
food is vanilla yogurt and cottage cheese, but she's not as
obnoxious as she sounds. A warning, though: if you find the idea of
fitness boot camp a little cheesy, the ``now we're soldiers'' theme
may get to you after a few workouts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna Richardson 3-Day Rotation 2000''
</P>
<P>
   Instructor: Donna Richardson, a fitness guru who is also a
national aerobic champion and the spokeswoman for the American
Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   What it is: The three 20-minute segments are designed to be
rotated each day, but you might prefer to do all three in one
session. ``Kick and Jab'' focuses on kickboxing and ``Circuit
Toning'' targets muscle groups throughout the body (some light
weights are needed for this one). The last segment, ``Dance
Aerobics,'' is a cardio workout _ but mostly, it's a dance party
with flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Why it's worth your time: Although most of the moves aren't any
more challenging than a beginning aerobics class, Richardson's
workout is solid and smart. Each segment has a warmup and
cool-down, and the moves are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance factor: Slight. For the most part, Richardson's
enthusiasm is infectious, not forced and tiresome. Go through the
tape a few times, though, and you might criny time
Richardson flashes a sugary smile and says, ``I've got your back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Crunch Workout's Tae Boxing''
</P>
<P>
   Instructor: Billy Blanks, martial arts champion and inventor of
still-trendy Tae-Bo.
</P>
<P>
   What it is: The first segment, ``Kickology,'' covers kicking and
boxing moves for beginners. Once you've got that down, you move on
to the second part, ``Tae Boxing Jam,'' which moves faster and uses
many of the moves from Tae-Bo.
</P>
<P>
   Why it's worth your time: As with Tae-Bo, this workout makes you
feel strong. ``Tae Boxing Jam'' tones all major areas of the body,
burning calories and fat. There's lots of kicking involved, which
feels great. But be ready to concentrate: Blanks isn't as easy to
follow here as he is in his own line of videos.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance factor: Very little to complain about here. Blanks is
clearly a fitness professional, not a cheerleader _ he's serious.
If you're mostly just interested in learning Tae-Bo, though, you're
better off buying the official videos instead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Method: Cardio Boot Camp''
</P>
<P>
   Instructor: Tracey Mallett, a cable fitness show instructor and
a Pilates instructor in California.
</P>
<P>
   What it is: Three 15-minute workouts that combine moves from
martial arts, dance and military-style conditioning. ``Cardio Boot
Camp'' is the latest in The Method series.
</P>
<P>
   Why it's worth your time: The workout is high-energy throughout.
It's complicated enough to keep your attention, but it's simple
enough that you can do it the first time. And it feels so good to
throw those punches.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance factor: If super-charged enthusiasm turns you off,
avoid this video. However, Mallett's accent is charming; push-ups
seem so much more exotic when she drawls out, ``Make sure the
ellllbow is in line with the shooooulder.'' Furthermore, this is
the only video I tried in which the backup group isn't constantly
yelling out, ``Woohoo!'' and ``I can feel it!'' There's something
to be said for that.

THE REAL WATER-COOLER SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: FIXES typo ... audience sted audiences. Fact box info below) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics tend to dismiss them as old-fashioned, and reporterscovering the entertainment industry often shun them in favor of the
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayers'' and ``Will &AMP; Graces'' and ``Ally
McBeals'' of the world, shows considered trendy and edgy. They
don't always even get a lot of respect from executives on the
networks that air them.
</P>
<P>
   They may not land the highly sought-after age 18-to-49
demographic advertisers lust for, but they do have impressive
numbers of rabidly loyal viewers, larger even than many of the
trendy shows. They're family series like ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' ``7th Heaven,'' ``Providence'' and ``Judging Amy,'' and
dramas considered clean-cut like ``JAG,'' ``Diagnosis Murder'' and
``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy'' is viewed in about 5 million homes a week; six weeks
rarely passes without Sarah Michelle Gellar popping up in
Entertainment Weekly, or on the cover of some other magazine. By
contrast, ``JAG,'' the legal drama set against a naval backdrop
which airs opposite ``Buffy,'' has more than three times the
audience. However, its attractive stars, David James Elliott and
Catherine Bell, rarely generate much media heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood, the media and most producers in town are very
liberal and view the military as a negative,'' declares Don
Bellisario, creator and executive producer of ``JAG,'' as well as
previous hits ``Magnum P.I.'' and ``Quantum Leap.'' To them,
``JAG'' is ``just a military show, a shoot-'em-up. It's not. It's
as well written, directed and performed as any show I've ever made,
including `Quantum Leap,' which was a critical darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tackled issues such as gays in the military, segregation
issues, animal rights, all the issues that are popular among the
liberals in Hollywood, and because it's a military show, they write
it off,'' he continues. ``It astonishes me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven,'' about a minister and his predominantly
well-adjusted family, is the most-viewed series on the
youth-oriented WB network, but also its least written-about, though
it has its own teen heartthrob in Barry Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the publicity's hurting the other shows,'' laughs Brenda
Hampton, creator and executive producer of ``7th Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy winner ``Ally McBeal'' was hailed upon its arrival, yet
it's routinely beaten by the Ray Romano family situation comedy
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' even though one doesn't find Patricia
Heaton, who plays Romano's wife on the show, gracing any magazine
covers in a catsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have girls in bikinis,'' concedes Phil Rosenthal,
creator and executive producer of ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
``It's strange _ it's almost like the press picks who they want to
talk about and then puts them on the covers, whether or not the
audience is actually watching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' was the beneficiary of media hype this past
fall season, while ``Judging Amy,'' which aired opposite it, was
virtually ignored. Nonetheless, ``Amy,'' about a single mother
leaving New York to live with her mother in a smaller city, is seen
in 5 million more homes weekly that its highly touted competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics like to focus on the `From the makers of ...' angle,
to tell what a show's pedigree is, and everyone mentioned
`thirtysomething' in reviews of `Once and Again.' Our credits were
summarily ignored,'' observes Barbara Hall, ``Amy's'' executive
producer, whose previously worked on such well-respected series as
``Northern Exposure,'' ``Moonlighting'' and ``I'll Fly Away.''
Joseph Stern, her partner on the series, counts the Emmy-winning
series ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey'' and ``Law &AMP; Order'' among his credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt a little overlooked,'' Hall says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, ``JAG,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and
``Judging Amy'' have all charted in the top 10 in the Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're water-cooler shows, just not the water-cooler shows at
The New York Times or Entertainment Weekly or Rolling Stone,'' says
David Wild, Rolling Stone's TV reporter and author of ``The
Showrunners,'' which examines last year's turbulent TV season from
the perspective of series creators. ``These shows have no snob
appeal. If you're at the coffeehouse where journalists hang out and
tell someone you're working on a story about `Providence,' you
don't score any points with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world view of most TV pundits doesn't extend far beyond
their navel,'' Wild continues. ``It shows a lack of vision not to
acknowledge that there are other kinds of TV and that some of it is
kind of good. Shows may have no snob appeal, but they still have
appeal. People who write about TV often forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Masius, creator and executive producer of ``Providence,''
about a doctor who returns to her Rhode Island hometown after her
mother's death, and previously a writer on ``St. Elsewhere,''
offers this: ```St. Elsewhere' was never on the cover of TV Guide
in the six years it was on the air,'' he points out, ``but they
released this list recently and picked it as the best drama of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Marsh, co-author of ``The Complete Directory to Prime Time
Network and Cable TV Shows,'' says that family shows of this nature
traditionally are the Rodney Dangerfields of network programming.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Waltons' was originally scheduled as a throw-away
opposite `The Flip Wilson Show,' which at the time was the No. 2
show on television,'' Marsh says. ``CBS figured, `This little show
can't possible compete with Flip; we'll lose. In its first year,
`The Waltons' knocked `Flip Wilson' out of the top 10, buried it in
its second season and went on to run seven more years.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to shows that seek to appeal to the lowest common
denominator or the series' creator's friends, the people behind
these shows think in terms both personal and with an eye on viewers
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is always to entertain,'' Bellisario says.
``I've been in Hollywood 20-some years, but still have the same
values and judgments as when I was a kid in a small town in
Pennsylvania. The shows I write reflect that. I don't do urban
angst shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``JAG'' aired its first season on NBC, where Bellisario endured
much network interference. ``NBC wanted an all-action show,'' he
recalls. ``They basically said, `If this is a cross between `Top
Gun' and `A Few Good Men,' we want `Top Gun.' They pressed for that
a lot.'' The network also insisted on a blonde actress, Tracey
Needham, who Bellisario says ``didn't fit the style of the show.''
Once NBC canceled the series, CBS quickly picked it up. ``Les
Moonves (CBS president) said, `Do the show you want to make,''' and
Needham was quickly replaced by Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal was just trying to make ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' a
winsome depiction of the lives of his and Romano's families. ``The
early comparisons to `Seinfeld' were weird _ we purposefully tried
not to imitate `Seinfeld,''' he says. ``If our show is hip at all,
we stumbled onto it just trying to be truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Says ``Amy's'' Hall, who was brought in to retool a concept
based on star Amy Brenneman's mother, ``I think of myself as the
audience. What I changed when I came in was the tone of the story.
It was a woman's story; I told it from a woman's point of view.
This particular one really spoke to me _ it's a personal story
about single motherhood. It's so much like my own life: single
motherhood, being in a male-dominated profession. I don't get into
these issues in big ways, we get into them in subtle ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven's'' Hampton's motivation was simple: ``When I dream
of watching TV with my daughter _ that's the show I wanted to
pitch.'' It happened to come at a time when The WB was aiming for a
family audience, which quickly evolved into the teen-heavy
demographic of today. ``By the end of the first year, they were
asking if I could make Matt and Mary bad teens,'' she recalls with
a laugh. ``At that point, I couldn't. If someone hires you to do a
job, you want to do what they hired you to do. At that point, the
character development had been established _ we couldn't just make
them the bad teens.''
</P>
<P>
   When devising ``Providence,'' Masius says that ``given the
nature of the emotional issues, we knew our core audience would be
women, but we weren't going to be so heavy-handed as to alienate
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably no accident that most of these programs feature
tight-knit families _ three of them feature multiple generations
living under the same roof or in very close proximity, and another
is about a close, large nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our show, the thing that's not real is that no one's family
is this good,'' Hampton says.
</P>
<P>
   ```7th Heaven' struck a chord in a time when schools have armed
guards and metal detectors,'' author Marsh points out. ``In the
real world, families are scattered to the four winds _ nobody knows
from relatives. There's a need to look at things as not as
confrontational as they've become, even on sitcoms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important element on `Judging Amy' is the family _
the extended family is not seen on TV,'' Hall adds. ``It's
significant that people are interested in that again. We show
different kinds of families _ not all look alike. It's a hopeful
show, showing a single mother doing well in a supportive
environment. It shows that a broken home doesn't have to be
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, `Providence' is entertainment and a fantasy,''
Masius says. ``It's obviously an attractive one. If people had druthers, they'd get along great with their siblings and
their parents and their kids. Instead, they're thousands of miles
away and not having support systems that are traditional.
</P>
<P>
   ```Providence' evokes a kind of a simpler time. The bottom line
_ friends and family are all you're left with, and people like the
opportunity to revisit that. It's strikes a chord in basic human
nature. You want to get back to the people most important to you,
to re-examine and re-evaluate those relationships.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FBC-BOWDEN _ NEW ORLEANS _ It's been quite a year for Florida
State coach Bobby Bowden. In November, he became only the fifth
Division I coach in history to win 300 games. Bowden beat his son,
Clemson's Tommy Bowden, to do it. Now the 70-year-old coach has a
chance to reach another milestone by winning his second national
championship and posting the first perfect season in this, his 34th
year as a head coach. A lot of guys have won one national
championship, but only a handful have won two or more. Bowden would
love to join that group. ``It (winning two national titles) sort of
puts you at another level,'' said Bowden. ``I'd like that.'' This
will be the third time in the past four seasons that Bowden has
played for the national title. (Barnhart, Atlanta

last two games _ 10 more than he had been scoring _ providing
assistance desperately needed by teammate Tim Duncan. Robinson also
grabbed 27 rebounds in the two games. Skeptics suggest Robinson's
performances were indicative of little except the caliber of
competition _ Golden State and Vancouver, each so inept that its
coaches were recently fired. Robinson has bigger obstacles in front
of him. San Antonio faces Minnesota tonight, Seattle on Wednesday,
Phoenix, Orlando and Utah after that, opponents that will prove
whether the Spurs' 21-10 record was inflated by the likes of Golden
State and Vancouver. (Rosner, Austin American-Statesman)

<P>
   Tony Hillerman knows a lot about how to make American Indian
culture and mythology interesting to an eclectic audience; his
dozen bestselling mystery novels featuring Navajo policemen Joe
Leaphorn and Jim Chee are ample testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillerman also recognizes these same themes come across in
their most pristine form when presented as close to the source as
possible. That's why he recommends N. Scott Momaday's ``The Way to
Rainy Mountain'' to every reader who has enjoyed Hillerman's tales
of Leaphorn and Chee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momaday's ability to use plain, elegant language sets him
apart,'' Hillerman says. ``He's (Kiowa) himself, and his respect
for the tribe's old customs and religion comes through in every
word. Because he cares, he makes the reader care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way to Rainy Mountain'' is far from Momaday's best-known
work. That distinction belongs to his novel ``House Made of Dawn,''
which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1969. But ``Rainy Mountain,'' based
on his tribe's history, may be the work closest to the author's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtaposing tribal legend with real-life travel, Momaday begins
with remembrances of Aho, his late grandmother, who ``belonged to
the last culture to evolve in North America.'' Aho followed the old
ways, and encouraged her grandson to do the same. Ten years old in
1890, when U.S. soldiers would not allow reservation Kiowas to
enact their beloved Sun Dance ceremony, Aho prayed to tribal god
Tai-me all her life, and when she died was buried at the foot of
what her people call ``Rainy Mountain'' in Oklahoma's Wichita
Range.
</P>
<P>
   In Momaday's skillful hands, Kiowa legends about tribal origins
blend smoothly with history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything had to begin,'' the old tale goes, and the Kiowa
tribe entered the world through a hollow log in what is now called
the American Northwest. After a few people had come through the
log, a woman got stuck and no one else could squeeze past her. That
is why the Kiowas ``are a tribe small in number.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the better part of two centuries, beginning in the 1600s,
the tribe gradually moved south and east. Its people evolved from
survivors of mountain life to worshippers of the sun they found
beating down on the Great Plains. Although their animal companions
included only dogs, they took quickly to horses and horseback
riding, becoming proud of their ability to raid other Plains tribes
for mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Their folklore reflected this, and also the lands in which they
traveled before eventually winding up mostly in Kansas, Nebraska
and Oklahoma. Devil's Tower, the square-topped mountain in the
Black Hills that later would figure prominently in Steven
Spielberg's ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' is especially
key.
</P>
<P>
   But Rainy Mountain is most important, as elemental to Kiowa
beliefs as the stable in Bethlehem is to Christianity. It is the
place the tribe was led to by Tai-me, a bird/man who came to the
Kiowas just when it seemed their migration would stall amid despair
and starvation. In addition to its physical manifestation in
Oklahoma, Momaday writes, Rainy Mountain and the path leading there
``is pre-eminently the history of an idea, man's idea of himself
... and of course the idea itself, as crucial and complete as it
ever was. That is the miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, amid tales of ``grandmother spider'' and ``the
storm spirit'' and ``a buffalo with horns of steel,'' a grand human
epic emerges. As Momaday notes, interspersing his own comments
between short tribal fables, the Kiowas remade themselves and their
culture, adapting to new places and circumstances and surviving
nicely until the encroachment of white settlers into the Southern
Plains. Even then, he notes, the tribe wouldn't have minded had the
newcomers considered war a sport rather than a means to completely
eradicate their enemies. When soldiers forbade the defeated Kiowas
from enacting the Sun Dance ceremony in 1890, it marked the end of
the tribe's ability to control its own culture, and, therefore, its
future.
</P>
<P>
   With an inexplicably low price of $8.95, ``The Way to Rainy
Mountain'' is a great purchase for readers who either love American
Indian history or simply enjoy perusing words set down by a fine
writer.

 &HT;    Cox says not to Fox transmissions
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications last weekend stopped carrying the
signal of several big-market Fox TV stations as part of a larger
dispute between the two media giants.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nearly 90,000 Cox Communications cable TV
subscribers in Dallas, Texas, could not see Fox's telecast of a
National Football League game between their hometown team and the
New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Cox Communications also stopped carrying the
signal of Fox stations in suburban Washington, D.C. and Cleveland.
In total, some 425,000 Cox Communications subscribers have lost
access to Fox television stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the dispute remained unresolved. ``We're working
on trying to come to an agreement,'' said Cox Communications
spokeswoman Amy Cohen. ``But there are no active negotiations at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two seemed far apart as of Sunday. Fox took out ads
in the Washington Post that blamed Cox Communications for the lost
of its signal in the D.C. suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the dispute is how Cox Communications should
compensate Fox for the right to carry the signal of its 22 owned
and operated stations. Under federal law, Cox Communications is
required every three years to seek renewed consent from
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The company has reached agreements with 99 percent of the
broadcasters in its systems, which serve some six million
subscribers nationwide. But Cox Communications has been unable to
strike an agreement with Fox, one of the world's largest TV
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is Fox won't give its consent unless Cox
Communications agrees to carry two new cable TV channels. The
channels are FXM, a moive channel, and Fox World Sports.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially tough right now to establish a new cable TV
channel, and Fox is infamous within the television industry for
such hardball tactics.
</P>
<P>
   While cable operators criticize Fox's negotiating tactics, they
also carry most of the programmers shows and channels, which
include Fox Family and FX.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications has steadfastly refused Fox's terms for
renewing its retransmission agreement. The company wants to retain
control when and where it introduces any new channels.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Cox Communications announced Monday that it had
registered with the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission to sell five
million of its 19.1 million shares of Sprint PCS. the registration
doesn't indicate when, if ever, the sale will take place.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not reveal its plans for the proceeds other
than to say it would be used for general corporate purposes.

&HT;     WHITE HOUSE Y2K CHIEF DECLARES VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House Y2K chief John Koskinen declared
victory Monday after millions of Americans experienced few computer
problems as they returned to work and school for the first time in
the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view thisas a great accomplishment in meeting what I view
as the most significant management challenge the world has met in
the last 50 years,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended himself against criticism that the federal
government overstated the significance of the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt about the magnitude of the problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the world rolled over into the year 2000 this past
weekend, officials here and abroad have reported only a smattering
of Y2K computer failures. Some experts had feared the so-called Y2K
computer bug would cause widespread disruption in financial markets
and electric power-grids, especially in places like China and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   When Jan. 1 came and went without problems, officials then
warned that Y2K computer problems could crop up Monday when world
financial markets opened and millions of businesses transactions
were conducted for the first time since the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But as of the end of the first business day of the year,
financial markets operated without a hitch, as did most other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A few minor problems, however, did pop up that are believed to
be Y2K related.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen reported that a Godiva chocolate store in New York City
opened for business without problems on Jan. 1. But when it opened
on Jan. 2 _ the start of its first work week in the new year _ a
Y2K glitch caused the cash registers to stop working. The registers
were fixed after a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol and
Firearms also has experienced computer problems since Jan. 1 when
the electronic link between gun dealers and the ATF went down. This
link allows gun dealers to electronically register guns with ATF.
The agency has since switched to a manual system. Koskinen stressed
that the ATF's computer problems do not affect background-check
systems.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Housing and Urban Development computer system
that handled Federal Housing Administration mortgages temporarily
went down, but it has since been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the glitches as evidence that the Y2K problem, indeed,
was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will show,'' Koskinen said, ``that the glitches that
continue to come out will continue to remind people that those are
glitches today that would have made major system failures'' if
government and private industry hadn't spent billions fixing their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem. The potential problem was posed by out-of-date computers
that could incorrectly interpret the digits 00 as 1900 rather than
2000, causing the computers to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, is it estimated that governments and private industry
spent close to $400 billion fixing their computers. Koskinen put
the federal government's Y2K tab at $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We geared up for a major potential set of problems and I think
all of us view it as a great victory that we can sit here and talk
about, `Was it money well spent (and) did we have to do it?''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While declaring victory, Koskinen cautioned that Y2K glitches
would likely keep surfacing over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a number of small retailers and small businesseswill
find some glitches but we don't think any of that is going to
accumulate in any way to have a noticeable economic effect on the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Y2K center _ which has been operating on a
24-hour basis since last Wednesday _ will scale back its operations
from about 400 people to a core staff of 30 next week. The center
will gear up again in February to monitor whether there are any
computers glitches on Feb. 29 _ a date that occurs only every four
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As scientists look back at all the discoveries made in the
1990s, the so-called Decade of the Brain, one finding stands out as
the most startling and, for many scientists, the most difficult to
accept: people are not necessarily born with all the brain cells
they will ever have.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, from birth through late adolescence, the brain appears
to add billions of new cells, literally constructing its circuits
out of freshly made neurons as children and teen-agers interact
with their environments.
</P>
<P>
   In adulthood, the process of adding new cells slows down but
does not stop. Mature circuits appear to be maintained by new cell
growth well into old age.
</P>
<P>
   Although the congressionally mandated ``decade'' produced many
other discoveries, from ways to obtain images of fleeting thoughts
inside a person's head to new drugs for a wide variety of mental
disorders, the finding that the brain develops and maintains itself
by adding new cells is the most revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   If these findings hold up to further scrutiny, the next decade
of brain research promises to generate a total revision of how
scientists think human minds are organized and constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Findings have already shed new light on mechanisms of learning,
memory and aging in normal brains and suggest daring new ways to
treat strokes and other brain disorders. Moreover, they may provide
solutions to some abiding mysteries _ including the way young
children who have half their brains surgically removed to treat
severe epilepsy go on to develop normally, as if they had whole
brains in half the usual amount of space.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have begun isolating special cells that
continue to divide and produce new brain tissue, with the hope of
implanting such cells into areas of the brain that are damaged by
disease or accidents.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, it was axiomatic that people were born with all the
brain cells they would ever have. Unlike the bones, the skin, the
blood vessels and other body parts, where cells divide throughout
life to give rise to new cells, it was believed that the brain did
not renew itself.
</P>
<P>
   Though the brain did add vast amounts of new connections early
in life and could compensate somewhat for many injuries, it was
thought that no one could be expected to grow more brain cells with
age. Quite the opposite. People were told that the only thing they
could look forward to was gradual mental deterioration as cells
died off and were never replenished.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas were so firmly established that many scientists have
a hard time believing the findings, reported in the last couple of
years by a number of investigators, that the human brain makes new
cells after birth, said Dr. Fred H. Gage, a neuroscientist at the
Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they accept the idea that such cells may exist, they
argue there is no proof that they do anything important, he said.
And those skeptical of the new developments, like Dr. Pasko Rakic,
a neuroscientist at Yale, say that if scientists expect others to
change longstanding thinking about brain development, the standard
of proof must be set very high.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Per Andersen, a neurobiologist at the University of Oslo in
Norway, said neuroscientists had responded to several of the new
findings with ``resounding silence.'' This is probably not because
of ``active neglect,'' he said, but ``it takes some time to let
unexpected results sink down in the mutual consciousness of
neurobiologists.'' In short, the new findings are simply too
startling and revolutionary to digest all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Morten Raastad, also from Oslo, compared resistance to the
idea of brains' growing new cells to the way scientists once
resisted the idea of plate tectonics and continental drift. The
theory was first proposed in 1915, but it was not until scientists
completed sea-floor magnetism studies in the 1960s that it was
accepted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional view of human brain development is based on
experiments done in the mid-1960s on macaque monkeys by Rakic. He
said then that based on available techniques for detecting dividing
cells in brain tissue there was no evidence that new cells were
being born in the monkey brain. He and others inferred this must be
true of all primates, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory, brains grow as new connecting fibers,
called synapses and dendrites, proliferate around a fixed number of
brain cells after birth. Cells not connected into circuits through
these growing fibers would die off.
</P>
<P>
   Thus brains develop by pruning and sculpturing, not by building
networks with billions of new cells, Rakic and others theorized.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many people do not recover the ability to speak or
walk after having strokes or other traumatic brain injury cemented
the view that adult brains did not add new cells. If they did,
people thought, recovery would be more common.
</P>
<P>
   The first crack in this belief occurred in 1965, when scientists
reported that new nerve cells were generated in a region of the
adult rat brain called the hippocampus. This is where memories for
places and things are first formed. A year later, they discovered
that new cells were migrating to the olfactory bulb, where smells
are decoded.
</P>
<P>
   These researchers identified a zone within two hollow cavities
of the rat brain, called ventricles, where new cells are born and
then migrate to the brain's interior. The zone contains so-called
stem cells that give rise to many other cell types, including
neurons and glial cells that nourish neurons.
</P>
<P>
   The new cells seen in the rat brains appear at a higher rate
after challenges like intense training, injury or an infection,
Raastad said. Within a few years, researchers found the cells in
adult mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys. In the mid-1980s,
other researchers found irrefutable evidence that new cells were
born in the brains of adult canaries learning new songs and
chickadees that were remembering where they had stashed their
winter seeds. But researchers still did not believe that new cells
were created in human brains, Raastad said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Dr. Elizabeth Gould, an assistant professor of
neuroscience at Princeton and colleagues showed that neurogenesis,
or the birth of new cells, occurred in the hippocampuses of tree
shrews and marmoset monkeys. But Rakic and others said this was not
possible in humans.

A SHOT AT YOUTH: IT'S POISON, YES, BUT IT SMOOTHS THE WRINKLES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BOTOX-SIDE EFFECTS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They can't frown effectively or reflect anger, surprise or
disapproval, but some celebrities are smiling over theibiological warfare weapon against wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you see her in concert, get out your binoculars
and focus in on Celine Dion's forehead. Insiders say the reason
it's frozen as smooth as vanilla ice cream is because she gets it
treated with Botox every six weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted as the safest, least invasive and least expensive
treatment in anti-aging medicine, Botox is a weakened and purified
form of botulinum toxin, a bacteria that thrives in rotten meat and
causes food poisoning. Injections of the poison in the upper face
temporarily paralyze the muscles responsible for lines and
wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Botox injections are the latest extreme in how far women _ and
men _ will go to fight the aging effects of time and gravity.
Although doctors are currently using Botox to treat everything from
crossed eyes and sweaty armpits to twitchy vocal cords and migraine
headaches, it's the purely cosmetic use by dermatologists and
plastic surgeons _ a use still not approved by the FDA _ that has
skyrocketed in popularity, more than doubling from 1997 to 1998,
according to a survey conducted by the American Society of
Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, where the superficial is essential, rumors have it
that Cher, Madonna and Sylvester Stallone are all fighting
crow's-feet, forehead wrinkles and frown lines with Botox.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Rivers offers glowing testimonials to the deadly poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had it done, and it's great,'' Rivers quips in last
summer's edition of Women's Quarterly magazine. ``True, it's a
voluntary muscle paralysis from a poisoned Fountain of Youth. If
the needle hits the wrong muscle, I can't close my eyes. Oh, well.
I'd only be awake for six months because then the treatment wears
off, and beauty demands fresh paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the treatment is becoming increasingly popular
and is often used in conjunction with facial resurfacing or in
addition to collagen injections, which smooth out lines and
wrinkles around the mouth without immobilizing the lower face. Most
doctors won't inject Botox too far below the eyes because it can
limit the ability to smile, eat and talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has taken off. We have a lot of people who come in
for repeat treatments,'' says Molly registered nurse who
gives Botox injections at Southwest Cosmetic Dermatology
Associates. ``When we started, we did Botox injections one day each
month. Now we have a Botox day once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Two to six appointments are clustered together on Botox days
because the expensive poison is highly perishable and each vial
contains enough to treat up to six patients, depending on how many
sites (creases between the eyes, wrinkles across the forehead or
crow's feet at the outer corners of each eye) each wants treated.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is between $300 and $900, depending on how many areas
are treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come in at lunch for Botox and go right back
to work. There's no down time,'' says Dr. James McCarty, a cosmetic
dermatologist who began offering his patients Botox about 2 1/2
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Patients leave the office with what looks like a tiny mosquito
bite at the site of injection and instructions to keep their heads
upright for four hours and make a few faces, stretching the muscles
to insure quick and even distribution of the paralyzing toxin. It
usually takes four to five days for the injected facial muscles to
relax completely and the crinkles they control to smooth out.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a patient will get a droopy eyelid for a couple of
weeks, but the treatment is considered safe and without adverse
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ophthalmologists and neurologists have used Botox for about 15
years to treat conditions characterized by uncontrolled twitching
or spastic muscles, including some complications of cerebral palsy
and stroke. It was first approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for marketing in this country for the treatment of
strabismus (crossed eyes) and blepharospasms (eye spasms) in 1989.
(Botox is still not FDA approved for the treatment of anything but
crossed eyes and muscle spasms.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a Canadian ophthalmologist who was using Botox to treat
eye spasms when one of her patients commented on how it smoothed
out her crow's feet. The ophthalmologist told her husband, a
dermatologist, and he began testing it on wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   In the same serendipitous way, Dr. William Binder, a facial
plastic and reconstructive surgeon, was using Botox injections on
wrinkles back in 1992, when several of his patients reported that
they were not bothered by migraine headaches in the months
following their Botox treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use a lot of Botox because I was the first one offering it
out here. Now everyone is using it,'' says Binder, clinical
professor of cosmetic surgery at UCLA and attending physician at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a huge patient population of starlets,'' Binder said in
a recent telephone visit. ``A lot of people in the soaps have been
doing Botox for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Botox _ including those who admittedly can gain
financially through its use for cosmetic purposes _ say its ease
and effectiveness make it popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for things that work _ that are easy, safe
and have no down time. Botox fits right in with all of that,''
McCarty says.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty had his own forehead treated wix, and he loves
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've had it done, you will certainly want it again.
It's very addictive,'' he says. ``I think it surprised even me.
Most of us in dermatology grew up thinking all wrinkles are sun
damage, but these muscles get used to tightening into wrinkles and
sometimes result in a perpetual frown. If you keep up the Botox,
and the muscles get used to being relaxed instead of being
contracted, the effect can last a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Lavine, a Fort Worth plastic surgeon who offers Botox
injections, says the treatment is especially good for forehead
wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps improve the forehead wrinkles much better than
getting collagen injections, and it's really a less invasive
deal,'' Lavine says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Potts, popular co-star of the Lifetime channel's ``Any Day
Now,'' says she tried Botox treatments. The former Designing
Womencast member didn't like it, though, because she couldn't lift
an eyebrow on demand during a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's something to frown about.

INDIA, THOUGH LACKING EVIDENCE, WANTS PAKISTAN DECLARED A TERRORIST
STATE  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Facing sharp domestic criticism of his
government's decision to negotiate with the hijackers of an Indian
jetliner, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee accused Pakistan on
Monday of being behind the incident and called on major nations,
including the United States, to declare Pakistan a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   But Vajpayee offered no evidence to prove his charge. The United
States has refused similar requests from India over the past five
years, American officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials have said over the last week that their
government played no role in the hijacking and _ in the on-going
war of words between these two hostile nuclear-armed neighbors _
have made the improbable suggestion that India engineered the
incident to discredit Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks on Monday in Pune, in western India, Vajpayee called
the hijacking of Indian Airlines flight 814 on Dec. 24 ``an
integral part of the Pakistan-backed campaign of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``India, therefore, strongly urges major nations of the world to
declare Pakistan a terrorist state,'' he said. ``Our government
will work systematically towards this objective.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-day-long hijacking crisis ended on Friday in Kandahar,
Afghanistan, when India agreed to the hijackers' demand for the
release of three jailed militants in exchange for the freedom of
more than 150 hostages. The Taliban, which rules most of
Afghanistan, played a crucial role in bringing about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Released hostages quoted the hijackers as saying that they
sought the independence of Kashmir, a Himalayan territory that both
India and Pakistan claim as theirs. The three released militants
were involved in opposing India's current rule over most of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Some hostages said they thought at least three of the five
hijackers, who spoke Urdu, were either Pakistanis or Kashmiris,
while the other two may have been an Afghan and a Nepali.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has faced harsh criticism at home from
opposition parties and leading newspapers, not only for cutting a
deal with the hijackers, but also for responding sluggishly to the
crisis; for allowing the lax security that enabled the hijackers to
board the plane in Nepal with guns, grenades and knives; and for
letting the flight leave Indian territory after landing in Amritsar
on the first day of the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   K. Subrahmanyam, the convenor of the government's National
Security Advisory Board, called the release of the three militants
``a victory for terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Indian Express said in an editorial on Monday that the
deal with the hijackers was ``a defeat, no matter what the
government's spinmeisters may say about the move being only a
`tactical retreat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Monday whether his government had compromised the
national interest by releasing the three militants, whom it
considers terrorists, Vajpayee told reporters: ``I emphatically
deny this charge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, of course, paid a certain price in securing safe
release of the hostages,'' he said. ``But it was the best decision
under the given circumstances.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prime minister's statements laying blame for the hijacking
at Pakistan's door were an escalation of comments made on Saturday
by Jaswant Singh, India's foreign minister, who insisted that India
had proof that the hijackers were Pakistanis and that most of the
jailed militants they wanted freed were Pakistanis, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Singh did not offer proof for those charges. In any case,
evidence of the Pakistani nationality of the hijackers and the
jailed militants would not necessarily mean that the Pakistani
government was behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Singh also stated categorically on Saturday that the hijackers
were headed for Pakistan, citing as proof a statement to that
effect attributed to the Taliban's information minister in Jang, a
Pakistani newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Taliban officials said that the man quoted in
Jang was not their information minister, and that they did not know
where the hijackers had gone.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of the hijackers are still unknown. The Taliban
gave them 10 hours to get out of the country after the crisis
ended.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that the Indian government has been
trying to have Pakistan added to the United States' list of state
sponsors of terrorism for five years without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of state must determine that a country's
government has repeatedly provided support for acts of
international terrorism,'' a State Department official said. ``The
secretary has not made that determination with respect to
Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials said on Monday that in coming days they will
come forward with evidence to prove their charges. C. Raja Mohan, a
respected correspondent covering defense issues for The Hindu, a
newspaper in India, wrote in Monday's editions that the government
needs to do just that if it is to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If India does not quickly and credibly justify its allegation
against Pakistan, Singh's statements will be dismissed by the
international community as typical, knee-jerk reactions from
India,'' Mohan wrote. ``The world is tired of the usual trading of
charges between New Delhi and Islamabad.''

BOTOX SIDE EFFECT A PLEASANT SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies BOTOX-YOUTH) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   When his patients first started telling Dr. William Binder that
the Botox injections he was giving them to remove lines and
wrinkles in their foreheads was relieving their migraine headaches,
he was incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a neurologist. I'm a facial plastic surgeon. I
specialize in rhinoplasty,'' says Binder, who first offered Botox
treatment for wrinkles in 1990 and began a study on volume
relationships for cosmetic purposes in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was injecting a lot of foreheads, and patients began coming
back with no headaches,'' he said in a telephone visit. ``My
patients first told me about their headaches going away before I
began looking into it. It took a two-year study for me to prove it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A clinical professor of cosmetic surgery at the University of
California at Los Angeles and attending physician at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, Binder enlisted the help of three other physicians
to study his serendipitous finding further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contacted a professor of neurology at Columbia and several
other top doctors who were already using Botox for other
indications, and I said I have a cure for migraine, and they
laughed. I said, you try it and let me know what you find. If you
can't replicate my results, I'll go away. The studies took two
years, but their results were the same as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that Botox shows ``significant usefulness in relieving
migraine headaches'' were first presented in April at the American
Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Binder then presented his initial study results in September at
the annual meeting of the American Academy of Otolaryngology/Head
and Neck Surgery in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In his studies, involving 106 people, 60 percent of the patients
who were getting Botox injections for forehead wrinkles and who had
migraines experienced total relief of symptoms for an average of
three to five months, the same amount of time they experienced
wrinkle relief. Thirty percent had partial relief of at least 50
percent _ their migraines were cut in half both in number and
severity, Binder says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonable to suspect an effect on tension headaches
because we mistakenly think they are related to muscle contractions
or tension, but that's not true, anyway,'' Binder says. ``We don't
know why Botox works on migraines.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies are now under way in about a dozen large headache
clinics nationwide to identify which patients will benefit most
from Botox and determine whether the product should have Food and
Drug Administration approval for marketing as a migraine treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Botox cannot be promoted as a treatment for wrinkles
or headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, Botox was only known to be a muscle-relaxing
agent. Now we know it works through the parasympathetic nervous
system, and is related to sweating, smooth muscles and even some
skin conditions,'' Binder says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it definitely works differently on headaches than it
does on wrinkles,'' Binder says. ``It works even better on acute
migraine attacks. For patients experiencing a migraine crisis, I
can almost guarantee relief within an hour and 15 minutes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The year 2000 has come, but not Armageddon. All is quiet at the
battleground the writer of the Book of Revelation may have had in
mind for the millennial clash between good and evil, a place in
northern Israel known as Megiddo.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists are familiar with almost every inch of this
mother of all battlefields. They have known for a century that a
25-acre mound 18 miles southeast of modern Haifa is the site of
Megiddo (meh-GEE-doh), an ancient city mentioned eight times in the
Bible. The word ``Armageddon,'' appearing in Revelation 16:16, is
thought by many scholars to be a corruption of the Hebrew ``Har
Megiddo,'' meaning the hill or mound of Megiddo.
</P>
<P>
   But recent research has drawn new attention to Megiddo and its
environs, a place that has known repeated warfare over more than
4,000 years, supporting its apocalyptic mystique. The last six
years of systematic excavations have also revealed startling
evidence that threatens to touch off a pitched battle among
biblical scholars, an Armageddon not to end the world but to
rewrite the history of Israelite royalty, possibly toppling David
and Solomon from their lofty pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Megiddo owes its place in history and its association with
doomsday to its strategic location on one of the most important
military and trade routes of the ancient world, linking Egypt in
the south with Syria and Mesopotamia to the north and east. In the
Bible and also in Egyptian and Assyrian texts, the city and the
adjacent Jezreel Valley are cited as scenes of bloody battle for
pharaohs and kings, Canaanites, Philistines and Israelites. The
walls of the Karnak temple in Egypt describe the victory of
Thutmose III in 1479 B.C., when he charged through a narrow pass in
the Carmel mountain range to surprise the King of Kadesh at
Megiddo.
</P>
<P>
   Long after Megiddo itself was a buried ruin, sometime after 500
B.C., Byzantines, Crusaders, Mongols and, in more recent times,
Napoleon, the British in World War I, and Israelis and Arabs fought
there, as if rehearsing for the world's climactic war.
</P>
<P>
   Combing the archives to research a book, ``The Battles of
Armageddon,'' to be published later this year, Dr. Eric H. Cline,
an archaeologist at the University of Cincinnati, who has excavated
at Megiddo, counted 34 battles fought at the city or its
surrounding valley. About a dozen of the wars occurred in biblical
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder a writer of the New Testament concluded that the
final battle between good and evil would take place there,'' Cline
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last and most fateful battles fought at Megiddo in
biblical times matched Josiah, a king of Judah and the last royal
descendant of the House of David, and the Pharaoh Necho II in 609
B.C. Josiah's defeat and death paved the way for the Babylonian
exile of the Jews beginning in 586 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``This defeat also raises the interesting question that since
the last member of the House of David was killed in battle there,
perhaps that is where the next member will show up in the Second
Coming,'' Cline said, referring to Jesus, who was said to be a
descendant of King David.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence linking Megiddo to Armageddon is all
circumstantial, and some scholars are skeptical of associations of
the battle site with any specific place. The writer of Revelation,
possibly John the Apostle, is thought to have had Rome in mind as
the evil empire that would be vanquished in battle, a vision
perhaps meant to comfort first-century Christians that good would
ultimately triumph over their Roman persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the end is not nigh, excavations at Megiddo, one of the
richest archaeological sites in Israel and the entire Middle East,
have brought scholars to the brink of a battle of their own over
one of the most crucial periods in biblical history. Impressive
architecture that had seemed to underscore the glory of Israel
under David and Solomon is now suspected of having been built a
century later, in the 9th instead of 10th century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The revised chronology, if proved correct, would cast doubt on
the Bible as a reliable document of the history of early Israel.
The united kingdom that David the Hero and Solomon the Wise were
supposed to have forged out of Israel and Judah might not have been
as grand and powerful as depicted. The first full-fledged Israelite
kingdom may instead have emerged under Jeroboam I, Omri, or even
Ahab, who is vilified in the Bible as the idol-worshiping husband
of the notorious Jezebel.
</P>
<P>
   Describing their last eight years of digging at Megiddo, Israeli
and American leaders of the expedition wrote in the
November-December issue of Archaeology magazine that ``many of the
most basic archaeological and historical conclusions about the city
are now in dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Israel Finkelstein, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University,
said that the excavations had exposed the shakiness of the
chronological framework of biblical history from the 11th through
the 9th centuries B.C. Lower dates by as much as a century on
everything, he argued recently in the journal Near Eastern
Archaeology, ``better fit the direct archaeological evidence and
liberate our chronological structure from too heavy a dependence on
an uncritical reading of the biblical text.''
</P>
<P>
   The Megiddo team also discussed its findings in interviews and
in reports at conferences last month in Cambridge, Mass., of the
American Schools of Oriental Research and the Society of Biblical
Literature.
</P>
<P>
   One of the archaeologists, Dr. David Ussishkin of Tel Aviv
University, discovered that the large city gate, usually associated
with the biblical references to Solomon's building activity at
Megiddo, actually rested in a layer of ruins from the century after
Solomon, even according to the standard chronology. This surprise
set in motion further research, including revised estimatpottery dates, leading to Finkelstein's unsettling attack on
biblical credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein contends that the palaces and other monumental ruins
of Megiddo are confined to a narrow layer, dated to the first half
of the 9th century B.C., a generation or more after Solomon's
reign. Two volumes on the excavation findings are to be published
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of inscriptions in those ruins leaves room for
doubt about Finkelstein's chronology, and considerable controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Another leader of the expedition, Dr. Baruch Halpern of
Pennsylvania State University, is one holdout, believing that the
gate and several other palace buildings were indeed constructed
during Solomon's rule and that the biblical description of
Solomon's influence at Megiddo is reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``These `Solomon' gates haunt us,'' Ussishkin said, discussing
Finkelstein's revised chronology. ``I feel he's largely right. But
my view is that we archaeologists are the technologists, and the
historians and other scholars should give the interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the view of many biblical scholars, Dr. Ann Killebrew,
an American, who is an archaeologist at the University of Haifa,
said that because of insufficient evidence, ``the jury's still
out'' on the issue of whether or not the palace and gates of
Megiddo were built by Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a group of mostly European scholars, called
``biblical minimalists'' by their critics, has seized on the
Megiddo findings and Finkelstein's interpretations to support their
view of the Bible as a poor source of historical knowledge. Any
record of King David independent of the Bible was bare until 1993,
and the translation of the inscription found then, referring to the
``House of David,'' is disputed by some scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip R. Davies, a professor of religious studies at the
University of Sheffield in England, has said: ``The figure of King
David is about as historical as King Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   David's position in history is a foundation of some Zionist
claims to Palestine as a homeland for Jews and of Christian
theology, since Jesus was said to be a descendant of the House of
David.
</P>
<P>
   The minimalist position, say scholars who profess to be neutral
on the issue, is in part a reaction to earlier practices of many
archaeologists whose main goal in digging was to establish the
credibility of the Bible as history and who sometimes bent their
interpretations accordingly.

   Megiddo's storied past has emerged over the last century through
successive excavations first by Germans before World War I and the
University of Chicago after the war, then mostly by Israeli
archaeologists in recent decades. Digging deep into the mound, they
uncovered remains from 6,000 years of continuous settlement,
beginning around 6500 B.C. The ruins revealed the transition from
the Bronze to the Iron ages, from Canaanite to Israelite
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Two distinct layers of ruins have provoked the smoldering
controversy. The lower layer contains remains of two or three
palaces and many houses, probably a major Israelite administrative
center and usually ascribed to Solomon. When it was destroyed by
fire, another city rose at the site, this one with all the marks of
a heavily fortified military center. It, too, was eventually
destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   While they have been digging, archaeologists have also been
developing Megiddo as a tourist attraction. This spring, the Israel
National Parks Authority, working with the archaeologists and the
Ename Center for Public Archaeology, in Belgium, will begin
offering visitors virtual-reality reconstructions of the excavated
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to see biblical archaeology, Megiddo is the
place,'' said Dr. Killebrew, an adviser on this project. ``And the
view from Megiddo is spectacular, one of the few remaining biblical
landscapes. From there you can see the entire Jezreel Valley, Mount
Tabor, the hills of Nazareth and Mount Gilboa on a clear day.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists plan to resume excavations at Megiddo this
summer, investigating ruins that may or may not be from Solomon's
reign and ever bearing in mind the site's association with
end-of-the-world prophecies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at Megiddo,'' Finkelstein said, ``not only because of
its beauty and the archaeology, but because of Armageddon.''

 &HT;    Forecasts for 2000 optimistic
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last big batch of economic and investment
forecasts for 2000 is showing up on the newsstands, and the message
is upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. economy, just off a spectacular 1999, is poised to
confound the pessimists again in 2000,'' says Business Week (Jan.
10) in its annual industry outlook edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth has averaged more than 4 percent for the past three
years, yet inflation has been dormant. ... Expect more good news in
2000, as companies find new ways to produce more with less,'' the
magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy also means the bull market in stocks will
continue, say the editors of Barron's (Jan. 3).
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, the long-running party in U.S. equities will end, but
it may not be any time soon,'' the weekly says. ``As the new
millennium dawns, Wall Street seers predict another record-breaking
year for stocks. A robust economy will boost earnings, they say,
while restrained inflation keeps interest rates in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the question gnawing at investors today is how
long this crazy stock boom can last, says Money (January), in its
forecast 2000 edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, there's only one thing you need to know about the
market: Over a decade or longer, stock prices inevitably follow
corporate profit growth,'' says Money. ``And investors can expect
companies to keep boosting earnings, even if not at quite the same
rate they have achieved during the past five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Business Week: Two Atlanta executives are among the
magazine's ``top 25 managers of the year'': Arthur M. Blank,
president and chief executive of Home Depot, the Atlanta-based
retailer of home improvement products, and James P. Kelly, chief
executive officer of Atlanta-based United Parcel Service. Among
``managers to watch in 2000'' is Douglas Daft, tapped by Coca-Cola
to succeed M. Douglas Ivester at the helm of the world's biggest
soft drink firm.
</P>
<P>
   A century on Peachtree
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the Great Crash of 1929 may have devastated Wall
Street immediately, but its impact came more slowly to Peachtree
Street. The day after Black Tuesday, the monthly report of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta noted ``a significant improvement
in business conditions.'' A day later the financial crisis competed
for front-page coverage with legendary golfer Bobby Jones,
participating in a convention.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the fascinating facts about Atlanta's
business, economic and political history in the 20th century, the
topic of Business-to-Business (January), an Atlanta business
magazine. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is on the cover of the
magazine's ``millennium issue.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   Inc. (January) offers readers a clue to what it's like to start
a business, with five stories of ``entrepreneurs in the trenches''
and what they had to go through to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Worth (Winter), a personal finance magazine, is out with a bonus
issue on ``Chic Tech,'' devoted to articles on a wide range of
technology products and to the stocks of companies that make them.

 &HT;    Bowden in search of perfection
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Tucked away in his office, Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden keeps an empty picture frame that few people have
seen. Only a handful of friends and players know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told some of us that he's saving that frame for a picture
of his first undefeated team,'' quarterback Chris Weinke said.
``Before the year, he asked us if we would be the one. I think it
was his way of challenging us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, 70, has accomplished almost everything in his 34 years
as a head coach. He is one of only five coaches in Division I
history to win 300 games. He won a national championship in 1993.
Only Penn State's Joe Paterno with 19 has won more bowl games than
Bowden's 16. Each of his last 13 teams has won 10 games or more, an
NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Bowden has not done in his illustrious career is
go through an entire season undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say that's the one missing piece to my
career,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden could find that missing piece and in the process fill
that empty picture frame tonight when his No. 1-ranked Seminoles
(11-0) meet No. 2 Virginia Tech (11-0) in the Nokia Sugar Bowl in
the Louisiana Super Dome (8 p.m., ABC).
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in seven seasons, Bowden goes into a bowl
game for the national title. Bowden won in the 1993 season at the
Orange Bowl but lost the past two tries, in the 1996 season to
Florida State in the Sugar Bowl and to Tennessee in last season's
Fiesta Bowl. Bowden's family and friends, who have gathered here in
New Orleans, desperately want him win another title before the end
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy will joke about it, but I do feel a sense of urgency
from him about this game,'' said son Terry, the former head coach
at Auburn now an analyst for ABC. ``At this point in his life, he
doesn't know how many more chances he's going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden made light of his situation Monday during the final press
briefing before tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, people are going to say, `He's so old. When is he going to
win another one? Is it going to be before he dies?' '' Bowden said,
chuckling. ``I won't feel all that bad if we lose, but I know you
all will feel bad for me.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it has been a good week for the father of six and
the grandfather of 21. Both Terry and Tommy, the head coach at
Clemson, have been here to lend support. They remind him, not so
gently, that they both have undefeated seasons on their resumes.
Terry was 11-0 at Auburn in 1993. Tommy was 12-0 at Tulane in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, there's a lot of pressure on him,'' said Tommy Bowden,ame to New Orleans on Friday after his team lost to
Mississippi State in Atlanta in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl. ``We've
set a pretty high standard for him to live up to.''
</P>
<P>
   In 24 years at Florida State, eight of Bowden's teams have
finished with one loss. In 1996, the Seminoles went 11-0 during the
regular season but then lost to Florida in the Sugar Bowl 52-20 for
the national title. That's the closest Bowden has come to
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you realize how dadgum hard it is to go undefeated,''
he said. ``You've got to be good, but you also have to be lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's players and coaches have spoken very openly this
week about their desire to give Bowden the one gem missing from his
coaching crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can you think of that deserves this more than coach
Bowden?'' offensive coordinator Mark Richt asked. ``He has won so
much, but something has always kept him from being perfect. Now,
we've got a chance to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we want to win the national championship for
ourselves,'' defensive tackle Corey Simon said. ``But we would also
like to be remembered as the team that gave coach Bowden his first
undefeated season. That would be something that people would never
forget. That's really important to this group of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has 303 career wins and is on track to catch Alabama's
Bear Bryant, who leads the list with 323. Depending on longevity,
either he or Penn State's Joe Paterno (316 wins) will end their
careers as the top coach in the history of Division I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get up there with coach Bryant, but if I can't get
Joe to retire, I'm probably going to finish behind him,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another reason why Bowden wants to add an undefeated
season and the national championship that goes with it. A lot of
good coaches have won one national title. The list of those who
have won two or more is significantly shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy doesn't have to be in a class all by himself, but he
deserves to be in one where it doesn't take long to call the
roll,'' Terry Bowden said. ``Winning that second national
championship would put him in a very elite group. A lot of us think
he really belongs there.''

KILLING THE FATTED PIG: HUNGARIANS REAP A HARVEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UJFEHERTO, Hungary _ Like most public executions, it happened at
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was just rising in this small Hungarian village as
Jozsef Aranyos and his friends downed shots of palinka, a clear,
locally brewed brandy that scorches the throat and prepares the men
for the task ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   The pig, caged and waiting, squealed nervously, seeming to know
its fate: to become a Hungarian family's dinner for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Aranyos trudged to an outdoor wooden table, examining nine
knives and an ax assembled for the ritual. His rubber boots were
splattered with blood. ``I've done 1,000 pigs in these boots,'' he
said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The pig tried to resist, and ultimately it took five strong men
to hold the squirming animal down. Aranyos stuck one of the knives
in the pig's throat, slicing with a practiced hand while a neighbor
collected the blood, thick as house paint, in a bucket. The blood
would later be used for sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in rural Hungary, where the life expectancy of a
pig is measured in pounds _ somewhere between 300 and 450.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an experience for the animal rights activist, the
merely squeamish, or those who might prefer not to think too deeply
about where pork chops come from.
</P>
<P>
   The ``disznovagas,'' or annual pig-killing, is a centuries-old
tradition in Hungary, a ritual that has survived many changes in
politics, borders, and economics. The event involves the whole
extended family, and it generally takes place around Christmas and
New Year's, when the bitter cold eases the meat processing.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians love pork. They continue to eat the pig and its
products heartily, despite high levels of heart disease. It is not
just the lean pork roast Hungarians like; they eat everything
except the hooves.
</P>
<P>
   Pork fat is used in cooking, and many Hungarians keep,
literally, a tub of lard in their pantries.
</P>
<P>
   The lard is spread thickly on bread, a snack that the Hungarians
call ``zsiros kenyeret,'' and that they insist is the proper
accompaniment to Hungary's other famous culinary offering, ``egri
bikaver,'' or bull's blood, a fortified, heavy red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Aranyos, a local butcher brought in to help the Anducska family
with its disznovagas, was not just there for his expertise. Many
Hungarian families get attached to their pigs, and the owners find
they don't have the stomach _ or the heart _ to do the deed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay inside and turn the radio up high, because I don't like
the sound'' of the pig being slaughtered, said Lajos Anducska, a
construction worker and architect. He looked disconsolate as
Aranyos completed the job of dispatching the pig.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs typically aren't named, so the owners can affect some
detachment when it's time for disznovagas. But they develop a bond
with the pigs, considered to be among the most intelligent of farm
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Erzsebet Gajdocsi, who lives in the southern Hungarian town of
Pecs, had a hard time talking about one family favorite, a pig so
well-liked that it had been spared the usual fate of being served
up for dinner. But eventually, she said, the pig just got too fat
to live; at 550 pounds, it couldn't hold up its own massive belly
with its short, chubby legs.
</P>
<P>
   Gajdocsi said her sister cried when this pig was slaughtered,
and later chose a piglet as a pet, even carrying it with her to the
market in a small basket.
</P>
<P>
   Anducska wasn't about to cart a pig around with him, but he
still couldn't put the knife in himself. ``Neighbors always help
each other with this,'' Anducska said. ``It's too hard to kill your
own pig.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bitterly cold day in Ujfeherto, near the Ukrainian and
Transylvanian borders, Aranyos had been summoned for a two-pig job.
Once he slaughtered the first one (the second, by kind
happenstance, was facing away from the episode), the local men set
about turning the animal into food.
</P>
<P>
   First, the skin was scorched and scraped off, then the carcass
was split lengthwise down the middle _ carefully. The intestines
must be protected, as they are rinsed out and used as sausage
casing _ a distasteful task done by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women, we always have to do the most disgusting jobs,''
Gajdocsi said.
</P>
<P>
   The men took a break for hot mulled wine, then turned their
attention to the second pig, which was now agitated and squealing
loudly. The animal had caught on, sniffing at the blood of the
first pig. Futilely, the second animal backed up in its cage.
</P>
<P>
   Then came more wine, and then Aranyos got to the main work of
the day: turning the pigs into bacon, pork roast, and sausage
material. The steam rose from the meat in the sub-freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the garage, Aranyos, Anducska, and several neighbors
shared more palinka, as well as more hot spiced wine, and took the
first taste of their work: meat from the stewed head. Another
neighbor worked at cleaning the pig's stomach with coarse salt. The
stomach would later be stuffed with sausage meat, hung up to dry
and to be smoked.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the day brought ``disznotor,'' the traditional first
supper featuring the pig meat.
</P>
<P>
   The meal is meant to honor the pig, as well as to celebrate the
successful efforts of the day.
</P>
<P>
   It had been long and messy work, and the memory of the two pigs
alive just hours before faded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two pigs, yes,'' Aranyos said. ``But it's also 440 pounds
of food.''

<P>
   What's at stake: The winner of the game automatically will be
declared national champions by the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll. The
winner probably, but not automatically, will be declared national
champion in the Associated Press media poll.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Bobby Bowden is 303-85-4 overall, 230-53-4 in 24 years
at Florida State; Frank Beamer is 130-82-4 overall, 88-59-2 in 13
years at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   GAME ANALYSIS
</P>
<P>
   RUSHING OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Florida State running back Travis Minor had 815 yards rushing
this season but usually plays well against ranked opponents. In 13
career games against Top 25 teams, Minor has averaged 97.2 yards.
Florida State averaged 112.8 rushing yards a game, 83rd in Division
I. Virginia Tech was eighth nationally in rushing offense,
averaging 253.9 yards per game. Running back Shyrone Stith ran for
1,119 yards and 13 touchdowns behind a solid offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: VIRGINIA TECH.
</P>
<P>
   PASSING OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Chris Weinke (232/377, 3,103 yards, 25 TD) was
seventh in the nation in passing efficiency. Wide receiver Peter
Warrick (71 catches, 934 yards, 8 TD) was eighth nationally in
receiving yards per game (103.8). The Seminoles averaged 302.9
yards passing per game. Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick was
the nation's most efficient passer, with a rating of 180.4. Vick
finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting after gaining 2,425
yards in total offense and scoring 20 touchdowns. Wide receiver
Andrew Davis averaged 87.4 yards receiving per game.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: FLORIDA STATE.
</P>
<P>
   RUSHING DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Led by defensive tackle Corey Simon, Florida State was 12th
nationally in rushing defense, giving up 98.8 yards per game. The
Seminoles, not as strong against the run as in years past, have
been giving up about 3.4 yards per rushing attempt. Virginia Tech
was third nationally in rushing defense, giving up only 75.4 yards
per game and 2.2 yards per rush. Opponents converted only 25
percent of their third down attempts (41 of 167) against the
Virginia Tech defense, which led the Big East in every major
category.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: VIRGINIA TECH.
</P>
<P>
   PASSING DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Florida State led the nation with 22 interceptions. The
Seminoles allowed 205.8 yards passing per game but allowed only 13
touchdown passes all season. Virginia Tech ranked seventh
nationally in passing-efficiency defense, giving up 171.4 yards per
game and only 10 touchdown passes. The Hokies intercepted 10
passes. Defensive end Corey Moore, who had 17 sacks, is a major
factor in the pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: NONE.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has one of the top weapons in college football in
placekicker Sebastian Janikowski. Almost 70 percent of his kickoffs
were not returned. Janikowski made 23 of 30 field goals. Florida
State blocked six kicks this season. All-America wide receive Peter
Warrick might be used on some kick returns. Virginia Tech's special
teams suffered a major loss when punt returner Ricky Hall suffered
a broken bone in his foot during practice. Hall, who averaged 12.8
yards on 40 punt returns, is not expected to play. Placekicker
Shayne Graham, the Big East special-teams player of the year, has
converted a conference-record 97 consecutive extra points. He made
17 of 22 field goals during the regular season, including a
44-yarder as time expired to beat West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: FLORIDA STATE.
</P>
<P>
   COACHING
</P>
<P>
   This national championship game is the fourth this decade for
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden. Bowden wants what be his only
undefeated season. His staff has worked hard to get this team ready
after a 45-day layoff. Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer has proved
to be one of the most solid coaches in college football. Offensive
coordinator Ricky Bustle is one of the rising stars in the game,
and defensive coordinator Bud Foster has turned down several
opportunities to leave Virginia Tech. The only thing missing is
big-game experience. ADVANTAGE: FLORIDA STATE.
</P>
<P>
   FINAL ANALYSIS
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech is a very talented and confident football team,
but the Hokies have not seen the kind of overall team speed,
especially on defense, of Florida State. Virginia Tech's Vick is
especially dangerous when he gets flushed out of the pocket and
outruns defenses, but he will not be able to do it as effectively
against Florida State. Florida State coaches have been saying
privately that this team is the most focused they have taken to a
bowl game in a long time and seems determined to deliver Bobby
Bowden's first undefeated season. The Seminoles will make one more
big play _ a punt return, a big pass or a long field goal _ and
that will be the difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   PREDICTION: FLORIDA STATE 28, VIRGINIA TECH 24.

 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new century is off to a provocative start with
that sinful lame duck, President Clinton, seizing the initiative by
trumpeting a legislative agenda for his last year in power that
warns congressional Republicans he does not intend to go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   There are contradictory ways of looking at this.
</P>
<P>
   _ He is so blind to his own weaknesses he will end his
presidency as an aggressive but irrelevant nuisance who fatally
undercut the candidacies of his two political heirs, his wife
Hillary and his vice president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   _ He is smarter than the clueless Republican conservatives who
threw away their majority advantage with an unpopular impeachment
drive and an extravagant tax cut that hardly anybody wanted. Now he
is continuing the ideological confrontation in hopes of making
Democrats look good and the GOP look bad in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can't help himself. He has spent his entire adult life
campaigning and he doesn't know how to do anything else. The
political focus may be on the presidential primaries, but he's
still the fat lady and his song isn't over yet. The winners of the
2000 presidential competition may represent the future, but Clinton
and his Republican opponents are the present. There is still a
leftover year to kill inside Washington's power circles. And
ambitious folks abhor a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Wasting no time, the president's agents rushed out to spread his
message during the first days of the new year. Among other
initiatives, he will propose targeted tax breaks to help people
without health insurance, more aid for education and poor families
and ways to prop up Social Security and Medicare. The Republicans,
missing an opportunity to regain the offensive, were still on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, not much is likely to be achieved in the nation's
capital. Partisan divisions perpetually hobble common sense and
compromise. The angry voters that produced the 1994 right-wing
revolution led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich are gone, as is that
hypocrite Gingrich himself. But widespread disdain for the act of
governing remains.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can be personally maddening, but the Republicans take
the trophy for professionally messing up. Although they narrowly
control both houses, they have not produced a popular agenda since
the balanced budget demolished their favorite message of pinching
fpennies. The country has moved on, but Republican
congressional leaders are mired in the old rhetoric and the notion
that their only duty is to block whatever Clinton wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of measurable legislative progress, however,
noise matters. And a president, speaking with one voice, can
dominate the debate with opposition leaders babbling in many
voices. As Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott says, unifying his
partisan troops is often like herding cats.
</P>
<P>
   His problem helps explain why the Democrats are on the verge of
taking back control of the House, if not the Senate. A shift of
only five seats will enable Minority Leader Richard Gephardt to
become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are scrambling. But the Democrats have been more
successful in persuading incumbents to stay on, adding the campaign
advantage of constituent familiarity and the implication of victory
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Pew Research Center reported that 49
percent surveyed said they would vote for their district's
Democratic candidate while 43 percent would vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   A voter's identification with a party can be changed later by
the pull of presidential nominees or the strength of individual
congressional candidates or last-minute issues. But the survey
provides a good clue.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew poll also showed that Republican Party approval ratings
stand at 53 percent favorable and 43 percent unfavorable, compared
with Democratic standings of 59 percent favorable and 37 percent
unfavorable. In 1994, the year the GOP took over Congress, that
party's favorable rating was 67 percent, its unfavorable rating,
only 27 percent. The Democrats, by contrast, had only a 50 percent
favorable rating and a 44 percent unfavorable ranking. There's a
substantial trend at work here.
</P>
<P>
   At this early point, the surface congresssiional campaigns are
being carried out on a separate track from the presidential
primaries. (Helping hands behind the scenes are a different
matter.)
</P>
<P>
   All the presidential candidates, in fact, behave as though they
never heard of Congress. They are going to save the world all by
themselves once they're in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The interests of presidential and congressional candidates have
yet to converge. After the bulk of the presidential contests are
over in late March, when the nominee choices will be obvious, the
dynamics will change. It will be pretty much all for one and one
for all within each party _ so long as the local constituents can
swallow the party's choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clinton still has a voice and a platform. The
Constitution doesn't say a disgraced president who has no shame
can't use both.

COUNTRY STAR ALAN JACKSON TAKES A STAND FOR TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ This is how it went down:
</P>
<P>
   As the hours ticked closer to 7 p.m, when the Country Music
Association awards were scheduled to be broadcast live on CBS, Alan
Jackson, a solidly built 6 foot 4 country star of few words, sat in
his tour bus outside the Grand Ole Opry debating with his band. He
had planned to perform his new single, a version of the Jim Ed
Brown drinking song ``Pop a Top.'' But in the back of his mind he
had another idea: George Jones, his friend and one of country's
greatest living musicians, had been snubbed by the awards show. And
Jackson wanted to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' comeback hit, ``Choices,'' had been nominated as best
single, and he was asked to sing an excerpt for the broadcast. But
he declined to appear unless, like many younger performers on the
show, he could do the whole song. When the producers would not
relent, Jones stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson told his band he was considering stopping ``Pop a
Top'' halfway through and segueing into ``Choices'' to protest the
way Nashville treats its living legends. Yet he warned his band
that he might change his mind, especially if others brought up the
George Jones controversy.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical in the world of country music, where even stars
step carefully for fear of rocking the boat, no one had spoken a
word about Jones when it came time for Jackson to perform. As
Jackson and the band walked onstage, they still were not sure what
they would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all so nervous,'' Jackson said recently, sitting in a
converted garage on his Nashville estate and recalling that evening
in September. ``The guitarist had this solo in the middle of ``Pop
a Top,' and the song sort of modulates up at the end of the solo. I
signaled to him that we were going to do it, and he just stopped. I
looked over at him and he was sweating. The boy looked like he was
going to bite his lip off. Then I hit that C chord to start
`Choices.'''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, as it dawned on the audience what Jackson had done,
applause rang out in the hall. By the end the audience was on its
feet, giving him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   And so Jackson, known in Nashville as a man who keeps to himself
and tends not to get involved in music industry politics, took a
stand. With country's biggest stars, Garth Brooks and Shania Twain,
busy chasing rock and international pop audiences, respectively,
Jackson cemented his reputation as the lone traditionalist, as he
is sometimes called. Of course many other singers believe in the
genre's roots and the idea of making country music for country
people, but none have approached Jackson's success: 26 No. 1
country singles and estimated sales of 27 million albums in his
10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my songs have ended up No. 1 or in the Top 10 on the
strength of my career,'' Jackson said. ``Radio wouldn't play those
songs for a new artist. If I was starting over today with my same
sound, I don't know if I would make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the impression that Jackson's music is a return to
Hank Williams or Johnny Cash. It is very much the sound of
contemporary Nashville, but at the same time it is a logical sequel
to the classic country that came before it. (Fans in the New York
region can judge for themselves when he performs at Irving Plaza in
Manhattan on Jan. 19.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson sings in a deep, booming voi the force of Ernest
Tubb and the homespun humor of Tom T. Hall. His songs (many written
by Jackson or nonestablishment songwriters) tell of small-town
life, chasing working-class dreams and the vagaries of love.
Although the production sparkles with Nashville polish, and some
songs are oversentimentalized, the instrumentation is traditional,
full of steel guitar, fiddle and mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the few contemporary country stars whom the old
guard respects. ``Since I had the pleasure of meeting Alan Jackson
many years ago,'' George Jones said, ``I'm still amazed at how he
continues to honor traditional country music. He writes and
performs what I think is the very best music. I always kid him and
tell him to keep it country, which he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his contemporaries, Jackson does not seem to have
ambitions outside of country, whether it be MTV or Hollywood. A
giant with a thick blond mustache and shoulder-length blond hair
perpetually sticking out of a spotless white cowboy hat, he has a
will of steel. He often seems like the human equivalent of a steam
locomotive, unstoppable in his tracks and slightly out of date. On
his new CD, a collection of country remakes called ``Under the
Influence'' (Arista Nashville), he performs two songs associated
with Merle Haggard that sum up his personality best: ``The Way I
Am'' and ``My Own Kind of Hat.'' ``I'll stand right where I'm at,''
he sings, ``'cause I wear my own kind of hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dungan, the general manager of Arista Nashville, said: ``I
think he may be the last of his kind. He believes in tradition, and
sometimes it becomes an issue. A well-rounded Nashville label has
to have all kinds of music on it, and Alan doesn't always
understand why we sign the acts we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim DuBois, the president of Aristalle, agreed: ``He and
I have run head to head more thanreatively on things. But I
give him more creative control than any other act I've worked with
because he has that keen sense of what works for him and what he's
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The label will probably not be too pleased with what Jackson has
planned for this year. He is performing a duet with George Strait
(a singer who rarely agrees to a duet) on a song called ``Murder on
Music Row'' for Strait's next album. The song, written by the
bluegrass singer Larry Cordle, alludes to Jones' treatment at the
awards show and lashes out against contemporary Nashville for
squelching traditional country. One verse begins, ``The almighlar and the lust for worldwide fame/Slowly killed tradition, and
for that someone should hang.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is probably the only current star in Nashville who could
get away with singing those lines without sounding hypocritical.
Pouring salt on the wounds the song is intended to inflict, he
wants to cut a Bobby Braddock composition called ``Same Old Song''
for his next album. Jackson describes it as ``criticizing
songwriting and being about how it's all turning into a factory,
and there's the same old guy in the same old cowboy hat singing the
same old song.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is quick to deny that he's getting on a soapbox; he says
he's just speaking his mind. He often uses Popeye-like expressions
_ ``I do what I do,'' ``I am what I am,'' ``Music is music'' _ that
frustrate interviewers but say a lot about his inflexible,
instinctual ways.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke for this interview, he sat in an armchair in his
garage, which was filled with old automobiles, Harley Davidson
motorcyles, wooden boats and a seaplane. Outside, a huge American
flag flapped in the wind, and a horse grazed near the banks of a
stream on his property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been attracted to classic things,'' he said,
``whether it's a movie or a guitar or furniture or a house or a
boat. I don't know why exactly. I've always loved an old
collectible classic. My first car was one of those. I don't know if
it's the workmanship that I like as much as it's a piece of art to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 41, was born in a small Georgia town, Newnan, with four
older sisters, a mother whose maiden name was Musick and a father
who worked as a mechanic at a Ford plant.
</P>
<P>
   While other students in school were listening to disco, he was
singing in small-time country outfits. After graduating he sold
Ford cars (he would later tout them in television commercials) by
day; by night he performed at parties and beer halls, singing many
of the songs that appear on his CD ``Under the Influence.''
</P>
<P>
   At 21 he married a flight attendant, Denise (her maiden name was
Jackson), who gave Jackson his first lucky break when she ran into
Glen Campbell in an airport and got his card. Within a year the
couple were living in Nashville, and Jackson was signed to
Campbell's publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   At first it seemed as if Jackson's timing could not have been
worse: Nashville was in the midst of a musical drought. But while
he was signing with Arista Nashville as its first country act,
Garth Brooks and Clint Black were recording their first country
albums. Together, these three singers sold millions of records,
triggering a boom in Nashville that made the record industry gasp
as country acts outsold their pop counterparts. Today that boom has
ended, and Nashville is finding itself caught off balance as its
music grows even slicker and its radio formats narrower, widening
the gulf between traditional and contemporary country.
</P>
<P>
   Upon releasing his previous record, ``High Mileage,'' Jackson
was surprised to discover that one of the strongest singles of his
career, ``Little Man,'' was r by several major radio
stations. They said that the song was ``too country,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there are a lot of people who want to hear what
I call real country music,'' he said. ``And I just think there
needs to be more of a balance out there. I don't have anything
against other forms of country music. It just happens that the kind
of country music I do is different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Man'' provides a good summation of Jackson's
sensibility: It is an epitaph for independent shopkeepers who have
been driven out of business by superstores. Like some of rock and
country's greatest songs, it turns the ordinary working man into a
hero, with Jackson closing the song with the blood-rushing,
fist-in-the-air farewell of ``God bless the little man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I came from, the town was just a little court square and
privately owned businesses around it,'' Jackson said. ``But as
everything got bigger, the big chains started coming in and
building out on the four-lanes near the Interstate, putting the
little man out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I actually tried to go ahead and write the song, my wife
and I were going through a rough time. I was pretty bummed out. So
I got into a car and just took off. I didn't hardly know where I
was going. And I started heading south, to Georgia and northern
Florida and almost to Fort Lauderdale before I stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on a lot of two-lane roads and through little towns,
and I saw a lot of those same images and scenes where the two-lane
highway wasn't the main road anymore, and the service stations were
closed up, and there were little Kwic Sacs'' _ convenience stores _
``everywhere. And that's when I started writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Arista recently fell victim to the corporate forces Jackson
describes in ``Little Man.'' As fallout over an internal power
struggle in which BMG Entertainment, Arista's corporate parent, is
trying to force the retirement of Clive Davis, the maverick founder
of Arista who talked Jackson into signing with the label, BMG has
been attempting to shut down Arista Nashville and absorb some acts
into RCA.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he thought he was established enough that it would
not affect his career. He was more worried about the employees of
Arista Nashville, he said, and, in the larger picture, the future
of country music. He pointed to the consolidation and lan
the industry and to the transformation of Nashville itself into a
featureless metropolitan sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're shutting down live music on Broadway,'' Jackson
said, referring to a cluster of downtown Nashville honky-tonks that
are being singled out by the police because of noise violations.
``The police are writing them tickets if it's too loud. They're
trying to make it a big tourist trap down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson shook his head, and a bemused smile spread across his
face, as if he were an experienced angler watching a novice try to
catch fish by draining the lake. ``Awww,'' he said with a resigned
chuckle, ``they're going to kill it all.''

 &HT;    Road to Atlanta bumpier for Jacksonville
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The march to Super Bowl XXXIV in the Georgia Dome
still goes through Jacksonville, Fla., but the Jaguars are facing a
few more obstacles than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville on Monday lost Pro Bowl offensive tackle Tony
Boselli, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee
in Sunday's 24-7 victory over the Bengals. Boselli will miss the
playoffs and faces seven months of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of injuries, and this is another,''
Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin said. ``Obviously, it's a huge blow to
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars (14-2) can certainly use the bye week they secured
by finishing with the NFL's best record. Jacksonville won't play
until hosting an AFC divisional playoff game on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Mark Brunell missed the Cincinnati game
with a sprained left knee, but he hopes to practice Wednesday.
Right offensive tackle Leon Searcy (high ankle sprain), another Pro
Bowler, and rookie cornerback Fernando Bryant (hamstring) also were
hurt against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Searcy said. ``It's a little disturbing.
All our hard work will go in vain if we don't make the most of it.
This bye week will give a lot of guys an opportunity to get
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars also seemed to lack the killer instinct late in the
season. They struggled in a 24-14 victory at lowly Cleveland on
Dec. 19, were blown out by the Titans the next week and squandered
several opportunities against the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cincinnati game, the Jaguars made six trips inside the
Bengals' 20-yard line but scored only three touchdowns, with two
missed field goals and a lost fumble in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year long, people have been questioning whether we're this
or that or whether we have the right chemistry,'' Jacksonville
linebacker Lonnie Marts said. ``I could (not) care less about that.
That's naysayers. It takes a lot of courage and scrap to win 14
games in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   It might take even more grit for the Jaguars to play in the
Super Bowl. They probably will face a long, tough road, despite
being the AFC's top seed and having home-field advantage throughout
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans beat the Bills and the Seahawks beat the Dolphins
in AFC wild-card games this weekend, Jacksonville hosts Tennessee
in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   And Tennessee could be a daunting assignment. BoJacksonville's losses this season came against the Titans _ 20-19
on Sept. 26 and 41-14 in Nashville on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have won four games in a row and seem to be peaking.
With Sunday's 47-36 victory at Pittsburgh, Tennessee scored 40
points in consecutive games for the first time since 1961, a span
of 552 games.
</P>
<P>
   Titans quarterback Steve McNair, who missed five games in
midseason after undergoing back surgery, has thrown six touchdowns
while playing just more than five quarters the past two games.

   ``That's big-time,'' Titans strong safety Blaine Bishop said.
``We're going in with momentum, and we've got to continue to win.
It's the playoffs now, and we know that once you lose it's over.
Every play is crucial, and this gives us more confidence going in
that we can't be beat.''

   Meanwhile, the Colts will be a sizable favorite over the
Dolphins-Seahawks winner in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills have won three games in a row, including a 31-6
blowout of Indianapolis on Sunday. But Buffalo would probably have
to win three games on the road to advance to the Super Bowl.

<P>
   In the NFC, the Cowboys-Vikings winner must slay St. Louis, the
NFC's top seed, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (11-5), which won eight of its last nine games, might
have an easier route to Atlanta. The Bucs face the Lions-Redskins
winner in a second-round game on Jan. 15. Detroit has lost four
games in a row, and Washington surrendered 41 more points than any
other playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers are 13-3 in games at Raymond James Stadium the
past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp said, ``I pity the fool who

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDELLIN, Colombia _ Just the mention of this city conjures up
images of drug cartels, guerrillas and gangs of kidnappers and
hired killers.
</P>
<P>
   But Medellin is also the hometown of Fernando Botero, 67, Latin
America's most celebrated living artist, and he is now putting the
full force of his renown behind a wide-ranging effort to overhaul
the city's reputation and skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months the painter and sculptor intends to
install 79 of his paintings, drawings and sculptures that he has
just donated to the Museo de Antioquia here. The gift by Botero,
who spends most of his time in Italy, will make the collection the
largest of his work anywhere, and the local authorities hope it
will be a new calling card for this metropolis of 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Botero's gesture is very important to us,'' said Juan Gomez
Martinez, the mayor, ``because it makes it possible for us to
undertake a process of physical and spiritual recovery, and so we
are grateful to him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city known around the world for all the wrong
reasons, stigmatized for all the problems we have had, but now we
have an opportunity to be known culturally, to have people think of
us as the city of Botero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Museo de Antioquia, which takes its name from the province
of which Medellin is the capital, already had an impressive
assemblage of pieces by Botero, whose work is instantly
recognizable for the extravagant corpulence of his subjects. Since
the late 1970s, two galleries have housed 16 of his sculptures and
16 paintings, including ``Miss Rubens,'' a sly satire on his
penchant for fleshy figures, and a chilling 1977 portrait called
``Minister of War.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist donated those works in memory of his young son Pedro,
who was killed in an automobile accident in 1974 and whose name has
been given to the section of the museum in which the works are
exhibited. Museum staff members had always hoped that he would make
the institution the permanent repository for the bulk of his other
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Botero is a very important part of our cultural identity, so
of course we have always wanted him here,'' said Pilar Velilla
Moreno, the director. ``He may live in Italy, but he has never
stopped being from Antioquia for a single day of his life, so that
his work has always portrayed us and who we are: our customs,
architecture, food, landscapes, flowers, leading personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the larger Botero bequest, Medellin had to fend off
Bogota, the nation's capital, which had been even more aggressively
pursuing the artist.
</P>
<P>
   After officials here were slow to come up with a site, Botero in
fact donated 61 pieces from his collection, including works by
Picasso, Miro, Braque, Chagall, Degas, Matisse, Calder and
Giacometti and several of his own paintings, to the National Museum
in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medellin felt a bit let down when they lost that, but I
couldn't wait all my life,'' Botero said in a telephone interview
from his New York City studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things kept dragging out, and I wanted to do it right away. I
don't blame anybody, it wasn't ill will on anyone's part. It is
just that it is difficult and costly to find a piece of prime real
estate in a city of 2 million people, and I wasn't willing to wait
another 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Gomez and a senator from the province visited Botero in
Paris in an effort to persuade him not to leave his hometown
empty-handed. Anecture student in Medellin led a petition
drive that collected more than 150,000 signatures, which may have
been even more decisive in persuading the artist to collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tremendously moved by that, because I love my native
region and want to do as much as I can for it,'' he said. ``I left
many years ago, long before all the problems started, and have
lived in New York, Paris, Monte Carlo and Italy. But I still feel a
great spiritual connection to Colombia and want, after all the
terrible things that have happened, to provide a bit of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Botero agreed, there were formidable bureaucratic
barriers to be overcome. Because the museum is a private, not a
public, institution, said Ms. Velilla, it is subject to a 16
percent tax and 20 percent tariff on imported ``cultural
material.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Botero was donating his own property and was
willing to make an additional grant of $1 million to help renovate
the museum. For insurance purposes, the value of his gift, 65
paintings and drawings and 14 large sculptures, had been declared
as $60 million, and government tax collectors wouldn't budge: They
wanted their share before the paintings and sculptures could be
sent to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, however, there was a change of government, with
both the new minister of culture and minister of finance being
natives of Antioquia. With their support, an accord was negotiated
that exempted Botero's donation from the tax levy, opening the way
for the first shipment of 15 pieces to arrive in January.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an absurd situation to have to pay an entry tax for
something that is going to benefit the people, but they assure me
that the problem has now been solved,'' Botero said. ``So I am
sending the biggest and most costly of my works as a showdown, and
we will see if that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Botero has also donated several large sculptures
to his hometown, and they are prominently displayed in downtown
plazas and have become local landmarks. ``If you have to arrange to
meet someone, you suggest getting together at `La Gorda' and
everyone knows exactly what you mean,'' said Marcela Restrepo, a
university student, referring to a statue of a fat woman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 one of the pieces, ``The Bird,'' was destroyed in a bomb
attack that killed 27 people and injured more than 200. None of
Colombia's leftist guerrilla groups, right-wing paramilitary death
squads or drug cartels took responsibility. But because Botero's
son Fernando Botero Zea was defense minister at the time and the
bird was the dove of peace, it has always been assumed that the
bombing was political.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the gift he is offering now, Botero made a
replacement for the bird, asking that it be placed next to the
pedestal where the blasted remains of his original sculpture still
sit. The result, installed in early December, is even more
powerful, Gomez argues, because ``we have a symbol of peace and a
symbol of war and barbarism side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   Botero said he planned to spend 10 to 15 days in Medellin to
welcome the arrival of the initial shipment and supervise the
installation of those works. He plans to return for the dedication
and opening of the complete Botero collection, which is tentatively
scheduled for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very enthusiastic about this project and think that we
can put together something extraordinary,'' he said. ``I have been
given full control to do what I want. I want the rooms to be
simple, to be minimalist, so that the focus will be on the art and
not on the room.'' To assure that, he said, he has been in contact
with architects and light technicians in both Medellin and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Botero's grant is part of a larger plan to revive a run-down
section of downtown Medellin and transform it into what he calls
``an open space that will change the skyline and allow the city to
breathe.'' The project, called Medellin Cultura Viva, envisions
turning the former city hall, built in Art Deco style, into an
extension of the museum and converting a nearby area frequented by
alcoholics, glue-sniffers and prostitutes into a sculpture park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a cultural complex with bookstores,
theaters, antique dealers, cinemas,'' Ms. Velilla said, ``and
Botero's contribution is the cornerstone of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the political situation in Colombia remains so unsettled and
violent that security, both for Botero and his works, continues to
be a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm going to have to go around with bodyguards and in an
armored car,'' he acknowledged. ``It's dangerous and not the kind
of life I want, but I still believe in Colombia. Eventually this
country will be civilized and have peace.''

 &HT;    Rhodes, Carroll among NFL departees
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It didn't take long for the NFL's firing season to
begin. Two coaches were fired and one retired Monday, the same day
the league's regular season officially ended.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was the firing of Packers coach Ray Rhodes,
who led his team to an 8-8 record in his first season in Green Bay.
The Packers crushed the Cardinals 49-24 on Sunday, but they missed
the playoffs when Dallas beat the Giants for the final NFC
wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired him to succeed,'' Packers general manager Ron Wolf
said of Rhodes, who had three years remaining on a $4 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he a different coach than I thought he was?,'' Wolf said.
``Yes. The answer to that is yes. But what we need to have is a
well-disciplined, tough, hard-nosed football team. That's how you
win in this league. We have to get that here. We don't have that
here.''
</P>
<P>
   New England coach Pete Carroll was dismissed after the Patriots
finished 8-8 by losing six of their final eight games. Carroll, who
had two years left on his contract, had a 27-21 record in three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business of accountability, and two years ago we won
the division,'' Patriots owner Robert Kraft said. ``Last year, we
barely made the playoffs, and this year we're 8-8. We need a
momentum change.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can't hire Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, once
considered the favorite to replace Carroll. Belichick was named the
Jets' head coach after Bill Parcells retired. Parcells, 58, will
remain with the team as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were a popular pick to contend for a spot in the Super
Bowl this season, but injuries crippled the defending AFC East
champions. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde was lost in the opener when
he ruptured his Achilles' tendon, and the Jets started a woeful
1-6. But New York rallied to win seven of its last nine games to
finish 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who won two Super Bowls with the Giants and got to
another with the Patriots, had hedged about returning next season.
But he told the Jets his decision in a late-morning meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells read a poem titled ``The Man in the Glass,'' dropped a
microphone and left the silent room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stunned,'' Jets running back Curtis Martin said. ``A
lot of people didn't know what to think. I would imagine it was
emotional after being a head coach all those years and giving a
speech about leaving footr leaving after being a head coach
all your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Saints coach Mike Ditka canceled a news conference
Monday and won't address the media until after a meeting with owner
Tom Benson on Thursday.

   LOS ANGELES _ When Gary Zeidenstein and Amine Bitar made
``Triangles and Tribulations,'' they encountered the usual brick
walls met by first-time independent filmmakers. They tried in vain
for a year to interest Hollywood studios in the 84-minute film,
about a man who sacrifices career and family in pursuit of his
dream to play the triangle in an orchestra. They tried entering it
in film festivals, but there was so much competition that they were
often rejected.
</P>
<P>
   So Zeidenstein and Bitar set up a Web site to publicize their
film and show it online. They also opened the site to other
filmmakers and were besieged with submissions. ``It just started to
snowball,'' said Zeidenstein, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Always Independent Films (www.alwaysif.com) offers over
375 movies and trailers. It is one of at least two dozen sites
showing films as filmmakers flock to what could be a new means of
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent filmmakers hope the Web will let them bypass
Hollywood and reach viewers directly. Or they hope to use the Web
to drum up huge publicity, as seen with ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' a low-budget amateur film that became a blockbuster in
movie theaters after generating a buzz with a clever and alluring
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Most independent filmmakers will never duplicate the success of
``Blair Witch,'' and there are drawbacks to distributing movies on
the Web, like particularly poor image quality and long transmission
times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts predict the Internet will have a profound
effect on the movie business, especially when combined with new
digital video technology in which movies are shot on digital tape
instead of film and edited on personal computers. Together, digital
production and Internet distribution promise a sharp reduction in
the cost of making and distributing their product, allowing for an
explosion in filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you lower the bar, more voices can be heard and be
profitable,'' said Ray Price, president of American Zoetrope, the
studio owned by Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   Such a popularization has already happened in music, with garage
bands now distributing their music directly over the Web by using
the MP3 protocol. ``The whole indie film world is the next MP3
opportunity,'' said Joseph A. Cantwell, executive vice president
for new media at Bravo Networks, which runs the Independent Film
Channel on cable television and is developing a Web site to show
and sell films online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet could also provide a market for short films, which
now have few outlets. Short films are more suitable for the Web
than full-length features because it take hours to download a long
film using a conventional personal computer modem. And many people
won't want to watch a full two-hour movie at a desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't know what to do with short films,'' said
William Azaroff, 29, whose first short film can be seen at
Atomfilms.com, which specializes in short films. ``Hopefully, the
Web will bring them back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not yet a good place to see a movie. In addition
to long download times, the picture is often blurry and appears in
a little box on the computer screen. And the movie sometimes
pauses, waiting for more of the signal to arrive. Such problems,
however, should diminish as more people get high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   There is also little or no money to be made by showing movies on
the Internet. Most Web sites do not pay filmmakers for their movies
because many are happy just to get the exposure. And most sites do
not charge viewers to see the movies, hoping instead to support
themselves with advertising. Some of the sites plan pay-per-view
services or offer videocassettes for sale. But it is far from
certain that any of the movie sites will be self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
   One site that does charge viewers, Sightsound.com, allows people
to view a film for a day or a few days for a price similar to those
at a video store. Its most popular title, ``The Perfect 10 Model of
the Year'' video, is rented about 60 times a month, fewer than a
hit movie at a single Blockbuster outlet. In April the site offered
the movie ``Pi,'' which had been in theaters, and fewer than 200
people viewed it.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the technical limits of the Internet is to use it
to sell videocassettes. Sam Sokolow and Rob Lobl, fledgling
filmmakers in New York, have sold more than 800 copies of their
first film, ``The Definite Maybe'' on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   It cost them about $2,000 to have the cassettes and cover art
made and to set up a Web site for their film with a link to Amazon.
The tape sells for $14.95, and they keep about $5 after expenses,
or a total so far of over $4,000. This has not gone very far toward
recovering the $100,000 it cost to make the movie. But Sokolow said
the exposure helped them land another job directing a sitcom for a
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sidestepping the whole movie business,'' Sokolow said.
``I don't need Hollywood anymore to have 35 million people take a
look.''
</P>
<P>
   For most budding filmmakers, having the film appear on the Web
is not an end in itself, merely a stepping stone to the more
established entertainment world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day they'd like to be seen on a TV screen or
even better in a theater,'' said Mika Salmi, president of
AtomFilms, which is based in Seattle and receives 50 to 100 films a
week.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Todd Lincoln, a 23-year-old from Tulsa, Okla., parlayed his
exposure on the Web into a job making music videos. ``There's just
a lot of people watching the progress of films on there,'' he said.
``It's just a real kind of digital democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln made two films, ``Honeypot'' and ``Xavier,'' that are
among the most widely watched on Ifilm.com, a site in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While most of its films can be viewed by the public, Ifilm also
set up a separate site, Ifilmpro.com, that can be seen only by
movie industry professionals and is a conduit for filmmakers who
are trying to shop their films around.
</P>
<P>
   The first film put on that site, ``Sunday's Game,'' is a
nine-minute dark comedy about elderly women who gather on a Sunday
and play Russian roulette. David Garrett, a writer and producer of
the film, said he and his partner, Jason Ward, had received many
inquiries since the film appeared and had closed a deal to produce
a pilot for Fox TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Internet exposure definitely increased our
visibility and got people talking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the odds are very long. Ifilm can point to only a handful
of success stories among the 1,000 films it shows. Always
Independent Films says that three films on its site have attracted
distributors, including Zeidenstein's ``Triangles and
Tribulations.'' It was licensed by a company that will try to place
it in video stores.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the very advantage of the Web _ its low
barrier to entry _ is also a disadvantage because so many films are
being shown there that it is hard for one to rise above the crowd.
And having a film freely available on the Web can discourage a
profit-minded distributor from picking it up. Then there is the
image quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people's first exposure to it, if we think we
can make a sale, to be on the Web,'' said Azaroff, commenting on
the picture quality. He said he put ``Checkmating,'' his short film
from 1996 about a woman who sizes up potential boyfriends while
playing chess with them, on the Web because it was made mainly as a
calling card and had little chance of commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Meher Gourjian said that it is mainly children who contact him
after seeing previews of his short film ``Plug'' on the Web. The
inquiries he has received from movie industry executives resulted
from festival screenings or his videocassette mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Making oneself heard on the Web can require aggressive
marketing. Two first-time filmmakers, Terry Keefe and Michael
Wechsler of Los Angeles, not only put trailers of their ``Slaves of
Hollywood'' on some movie Web sites but they also sent out hundreds
of e-mail messages with links to those sites.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe also used the Web site of the Chicago Sun Times to send an
e-mail to the critic Roger Ebert, who told him to send along the
film. ``I would never have gotten Roger Ebert any other way, and he
answered my e-mail in an hour,'' Keefe, 29, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ebert has not reviewed the film, which is about the
abuses endured by Hollywood production assistants. And it was a
conventional test screening that got Filmopolis, a small
distributor, to agree to try to place the movie in theaters. It ran
for a week this fall in a single theater in Santa Monica, Calif.,
and might run for a weekend at a theater in New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   To get people to the theater, Keefe and Wechsler relied not on
the Net but on a more old-fashioned medium: flyers they posted
around town.

 &HT;    SEC, ACC finally get down to business By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida State kicks off the 2000 ACC season, or,
rather, tips it off tonight against Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball Seminoles will have no television conflict with
their football brethren, however. To avoid the national
championship Sugar Bowl, the basketball team starts at 6 p.m.,
while the football 'Noles play at 8.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC office swears that the game time was in place as early
as October, in order for the basketball game to avoid the Sugar
Bowl, no matter who would be playing.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, all nine ACC basketball teams and all 12 in the
SEC will have started league play, with all roads leading to
Indianapolis in March for the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Both leagues have been through a steady diet of Woffords, Elons,
Tennessee Techs, Mercers, High Points and Belmonts before the games
begin to count. Some teams have been warriors and have taken on top
programs. For instance, Kentucky has played Utah, Maryland,
Arizona, Indiana, Louisville, Michigan State and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Tubby Smith says it helps to find out early who you are and
strengthen your team.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, LSU has played _ and defeated _Grambling State,
Southeastern Louisiana, Oakland, Alcorn State, Tennessee-Martin,
Sam Houston State, Centenary, Nicholls State and Howard.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kentucky is 8-4 record, and Louisiana State has a
12-0 mark. But guess who will get the better NCAA seed, if both are
invited?
</P>
<P>
   Florida, ranked No. 6, has played and beaten New Hampshire,
Florida A&AMP;M, Bethune-Cookman, High Point, Rutgers, UNC-Wilmington
and VMI.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Donovan says some upper-echelon programs hesitate to play
the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has played 146 non-league games, but only 12 against
teams ranked in the Top 25, and Kentucky faced six of those in
compiling a 3-3 record. Georgia and LSU each had one win against a
Top 25 opponent: The Bulldogs beat then-ranked Wake Forest, and the
Tigers stopped Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC has played 104 non-conference games and went 7-10
against Top 25 teams.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina faced four teams in the Top 25; Duke, Maryland
and Florida State played three each; and Wake and N.C. State had
one apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of competitive schedules even forced the ACC and Big 10
to come up with the ACC/Big 10 Challenge, a made-for-TV event that
pitted nine Big 10 teams against nine Big 10 teams. The ACC
squeaked out a 5-4 composite win.
</P>
<P>
   The polls, however, aren't reflecting the caliber of opposition.
In the AP poll, Auburn, for example, is ranked No. 4, yet the
Tigers lost to the only ranked team they played, Stanford. Auburn's
12-1 record is inflated by wins over UAB, Belmont, Coppin State,
Arkansas-Pine Bluff and Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   But now the games not only get tougher, they count more. Too
many losses in league play could cost a big NCAA pay check. Those
unskilled and unlucky programs could be relegated to making an NIT
appearance or, even worse, staying home.

BUSH CAMP HOPING DOLE ENDORSEMENT PROVIDES SPARK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a tougher-than-expected race in the early
primaries, the Bush campaign is hoping that an endorsement by
Elizabeth Dole will boost the Texas governor's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former Red Cross chief who dropped out of the
presidential race last fall, will announce her support of Bush on
Tuesday at an event in Bedford, N.H., his campaign confirmed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is honored to have her support,'' said Bush spokesman Scott
McClellan. ``Governor Bush looks forward to the announcement
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   After the New Hampshire event, Bush and Dole will fly to Iowa
and appear together at events in Des Moines, Davenport and Cedar
Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush campaign had been negotiating with Dole for about
a month, the governors' aides said that no promises had been made
to secure her backing, including the prospect that she would be his
vice-presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, who quit the Dole campaign last summer and now is
a spokesman for Bush, said it would be premature for the governor
to talk about naming Dole as a running mate before the primaries
are over.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign believes that Dole's support will help with
women and independent voters who had been drawn to her campaign.
The Texas governor may need that additional support to overcome a
strong challenge by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who polls show is
now beating Bush in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign dismissed the expected Dole announcement,
saying the Bush campaign specialized in collecting high-profile
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is another endorsement for the endorsement campaign. Our
campaign is about Senator McCain's reform message, not about our
bank account or list of endorsements,'' said McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky, who noted that McCain's support rose when Dole
dropped out of the race in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't spend a lot of time courting Mrs. Dole. We would
have been happy to have her support. But we spent more time on
trying to win the support of her backers, and we have done that
successfully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has drawn the backing of most in the Republican
establishment, including a majority of GOP governors. But one
prominent Republican he has yet to snare is Elizabeth Dole's
husband, Bob Dole, the former Senate majority leader and
unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not prepared to endorse anyone just yet,'' said Bob
Dole's spokesman Doug MacKinnon.``The only thing the senator has
been saying is he is proud of the Republican field.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bob Dole stunned political observers and embarrassed
his wife by remarking that he would consider contributing to
McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elizabeth Dole enjoyed high voter interest when she
launched her presidential effort last winter, her campaign quickly
fizzled because of rocky management, a muddled message and an
inability to raise money. By the time she dropped out in October
she was registering in the single digits in New Hampshire polls.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dole dropped out, McCain has surged in New Hampshire. He
is making strong efforts there and in South Carolina, where his
campaign announced Monday it will air new radio and television
spots that feature the state's popular GOP congressman, Lindsey
Graham, touting the candidate's military credentials, Senate record
and character. Opinsky said McCain will soon start airing ads in
Michigan, where polls show he has cut into Bush's lead.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Ezer Weizman, a crotchety outspoken
political veteran, faces pressure to resign over his endorsement of
an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and revelations that
he has accepted substantial undisclosed financial gifts from a
French executive.
</P>
<P>
   A blunt opinionated man who has ignored the constraints of his
supposedly nonpartisan post, Weizman outraged the right wing last
week when he announced that he would ``go home'' in disappointment
if the public voted down an eventual Israeli-Syrian peace deal.
Several legislators demanded that he immediately resign instead.
</P>
<P>
   He came under fire again when an investigative journalist
revealed last Thursday that Weizman had received some $450,000 in
the form of monthly cash allowances between 1988 and 1993 from the
executive, Edouard Zaroussi.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, Weizman, who has been a public figure since the
state was born, was a legislator and Cabinet minister. The
journalist, Yoav Yitzhak, did not publish a story but called a news
conference to release his findings. He contended that Weizman had
broken the law by failing to report the money to the Parliament and
to the tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Weizman acknowledged receiving the money but
rejected the idea that he should have disclosed it. The statement
said the money was a personal gift from a friend who has no ties to
Israel, and that it was not considered taxable income by law.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zaroussi does not have known business ties here, he
does own a house here and has been linked with political and
business ventures here, according to Israeli news reports. He tried
to found an English-language newspaper here about 10 years ago, the
reports said. He could not be located for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The president's associates told Israeli newspapers that Zaroussi
gave Weizman the money partly to help finance medical care for
Weizman's son Shaul. As a soldier in 1970, Shaul Weizman suffered a
serious head wound from a sniper's bullet in the Suez Canal. He
died in 1991 in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein asked Weizman,
who is serving his second five-year term as Israel's seventh
president, to turn over all related financial documents. Weizman
said he welcomed the investigation, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial Monday, Haaretz, a liberal newspaper, urged
Weizman to resign, saying that it didn't matter whether the gift
was legal or illegal and that politicians had faced trial for
receiving less substantial presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public expects its representatives to make do with their
monthly salaries and not to be tempted by gifts,'' the newspaper
said. ``Nor was this a reasonable one-time gift that one friend
gives another: It was in fact a second, and very hefty, monthly
salary that was given to Weizman while he held a highly influential
public position.
</P>
<P>
   ``With high-ranking public positions,'' the editorial continued,
``it is impossible to come to consensus as to the distinction
between private gifts and those that are given for purposes of
bribery. Weizman must step down as president now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the political spectrum, Hatzofe, the
National Religious Party paper, also called Monday for his
resignation because of his unequivocal support for the peace
efforts being made by Prime Minister Ehud Barak. ``So Weizman is
threatening to resign?'' the editorial's long headline said.
``Another reason to vote against the withdrawal!''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a rich career, Weizman, a former air force
commander and hard-line defense minister, evolved from hawk to dove
and switched from the Likud Party to Labor. His blunt assessments
have skewered political figures across the board.
</P>
<P>
   But he is firmly entrenched in the political establishment. And
he has become almost beloved by some for his colorful irascibility.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Likud Party leaders have been loath to exploit the
revelations, which is unusual here. Reuven Rivlin, a Likud
legislator, described the financial allegations as a ``private,
human story that should not be exploited for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's lawyer, Yaakov Weinroth, said that the president had a
``deep personal relationship with Mr. Zeroussi that does not have
to be publicized to the whole world.'' Weinroth said that Weizman
does not want to use his late son as a defense in discussions about
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not use the Shaul case, which is a very tragic case,
if it is true, or if it is not true'' that the money was intended
for his care, Weinroth said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Then Weizman's lawyer, who has represented prominent right-wing
politicians including Ariel Sharon and former prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, offered a qualified endorsement of his client,
the president. A radio reporter asked him if he would counsel
Weizman to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this specific issue, I would not advise him to resign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some here speculate that there is a connection between the
timing of the 6-year-old financial revelations and Weizman's
partisan campaign for the Israeli-Syrian peace.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's outspokenness has been the hallmark of his six years
in the presidency, which was established as a position supposedly
above the political fray. It is hardly out of character for him to
have taken a clear public position on the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks. He has never been adverse to using the power of his platform
to sway public opinion. He purposefully butted heads with Netanyahu
and openly worked to elect Barak. He is considered by the right
wing, which used to count him as a member, as a leftist possessing
the extra ardor of a convert.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Weizman played a vital role in the
Israeli-Egyptian peace negotiations at Camp David as Israel's
defense minister. Today he has said that he feels Israel has
reached a similar critical juncture with Syria, and he has placed
the office of the presidency behind the emerging campaign in
support of Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Last week, he
actively lobbied Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the
Shas political party, whose support is considered crucial.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's partisanship has brought calls not only for his
resignation but the dissolution of the office of the presidency.
Jewish settler leaders said he had stabbed them ``in the heart.''
They met him and demanded, echoing Barak's campaign promise, that
Weizman be the president of ``ev-er-y-body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to be president of all the nation,'' Weizman
quipped. But he was serious.

NATIONAL MATCHUP? NOT ACCORDING TO THE COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NENS _ So we're here for _ what? _ oh, yeah, the faux
National Championship Game, even though we can't actually call it
that since there really is no such official thing.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, no one has ever come up with any good reasons
why there isn't a more efficient system (the operative word back
there being ``good'') to determine a proper champion of Division 1A
football. The pooh-bahs have offered phony reasons, ludicrous
reasons, bogus reasons, and absolutely hypocritical reasons
(Academics? Puh-leeze), but never a good reason, not one.
</P>
<P>
   The National Championship Game in college football should pair
teams that have fought their way to this juncture on the field, be
it Astroturf or God's green grass. What we have now is a Florida
State-Virginia Tech game, courtesy of something called the Bowl
Championship Series computer! Now these may very well have been the
two best teams in college football this year, but that is not the
point. The system is the point. And the system smells.
</P>
<P>
   Would appointing an eight-team postseason field, selected in
very much the same way the at-large teams for the two Division 1
basketball tournaments are now chosen, be all that difficult? You
already know the answer to that. Wouldn't you rather have the field
selected by human beings with the aid of computers, if they can be
deemed useful, than have a computer actually spit out the identity
of the two finalists? Does a computer know from a key injury? Does
a computer know from weather? Does a computer know from a killer
bad call? No. All a computer knows is the final score, plus
whatever statistics you choose to feed into it.
</P>
<P>
   That all being said, a legitimate 1A football tournament is not
even on the proverbial radar screen, so we are stuck with this
cockeyed Bowl Championship Series format for years to come. They
may even have lucked out. The first Sugar Bowl of the mill _ Whoa!
May we agree to ditch the dreaded M-word? Make that century _ could
be pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   But you must understand something. This is no David-Goliath
deal. Florida State may be the reigning program of the '90s, with
the unbroken succession of Top 4 finishes and the relentless run of
10-win seasons, but this is hardly the greatest of all Florida
State teams. Circumstance dictates an awful lot in sports, and the
circumstances were very good for the Seminoles to enter the Sugar
Bowl as an unbeaten team. It's generally a given that they will run
the table in the ACC, and this year the Florida State nonleague
biggies weren't all that big. Specifically, Miami is good, but
hardly great, and Florida is basically in the same category.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that Virginia Tech must be respected, if for no
other reason than the presence of a dangerous and explosive force
in freshman quarterback Michael Vick. Had I more guts I would have
emulated colleague Mark Blaudschun and done the right thing by
following my instincts and voting for this kid as the Heisman
Trophy winner. Sadly, I wimped out, giving him a third-place vote,
which, frankly, I thought was rather daring. It turned out that 24
other people were as sagacious as Mr. Blaudschun, making the rest
of us look pretty gutless. That wasn't a good way to conclude the
mill, er, century.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vick is a terror, and there is no reason to believe this
superb running and passing talent will freeze up in the spotlight
game.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech has much more to offer than Michael Vick. The
Hokies have every base covered, from offense to defense to special
teams, where they nright legendary. The only reason for
concern is an unfortunate practice injury sustained by standout
return man Ricky Hall, who broke a bone in his left foot Friday.
Hall is also a reliable receiver. At this level, true depth is a
must, so we will see about the Hokies in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't been paying attention, Virginia Tech is not
the Indiana State of football. Coach Frank Beamer has been there
long enough to construct a major program. You cannot get this far
unless you are very, very, shall we say, aggressive in pursuit of
your goal. In other words, you push envelopes, you cut those
corners closely, you take in some, um, borderline people if need
be. In Virginia Tech's case, you ride out very bad headlines when
some of your players are accused of rape, assault, and the like.
You don't kid anybody by pretendbe Oberlin. If you want to
play in the Bowl Championship Series title game, you must do what
the big boys do. If you're still playing college football on Jan.
4, you're no virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech has been hanging on the fringe of collegiate
football greatness for a few years now. The Hokies have even been
here before, having dusted off Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl. Of
course, that wasn't The Game, the way this one is. But this is no
one-shot program. These guys are big, quick, and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is on Florida State, which, with all those Ws this
past decade, has but one cheesy and highly debatable national
championship and no undefeated teams in the entire Bobby Bowden
era. They may increase each of those totals Tuesday night, but they
will surely have to earn it in what will have to suffice as a
National Championship Game until common sense pravails and we get a
real one.

IN SIBERIA, THE WORLD MOVES IN WITH LENIN'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ Not that long ago it was one of Russia's
largest Lenin museums, five stories devoted solely to the first
Soviet leader and his Communist state. It is now one of Russia's
most unconventional, multifaceted museums, serving not Moscow or
St. Petersburg but a swath of Siberia better known for
concentration camps than culture.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was completed in 1987 to commemorate Lenin's exile in
this region by Czar Nicholas II. When the curtain went down on
communism, officials considered turning the building into a
commodities exchange or a Siberian nature museum. Today, thanks to
its director, a philosophy professor, and a staff of young
architects and intellectuals, it is the Krasnoyarsk Museum and
Historical Center and the region's cultural heart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Council of Europe designated it the best museum in
Europe _ all of Russia being considered Europe _ although
geographically Krasnoyarsk is in Asia. The museum topped 60 other
candidates, including Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, one of seven
Russian entries.
</P>
<P>
   The staff, by all accounts, achieved something of a miracle in
turning the Lenin Museum into a contemporary museum, said Patrick
Greene, director of the Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester, England, who was one of the judges. ``In Krasnoyarsk we
saw an exhibition of quality we would be proud to show here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Shoubsky was teaching Marxism-Leninism in 1991 when he
was appointed director of the white elephant. It was the spring
before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and attendance was down to
a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want this job. No one wanted this job,'' said
Shoubsky, who with his bald pate and goatee looks a bit like Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the deal, he was promised the apartment his family
desperately needed. With Lenin and his ideology losing favor,
Shoubsky counted on plenty of time to complete a dissertation on
his true love, Russian religious philosophy. He got his apartment
ae his dissertation but found hardly any time to spend at
home. He had to master a new specialty: modern museum management in
a fledgling capitalist economy.
</P>
<P>
   As director, he oversees up to 100 new exhibitions a year on
subjects as diverse as Siberian history, the war in Chechnya and
modern art. Many are interactive multimedia displays.
</P>
<P>
   To help finance the museum's operations, he rents out space for
everything from cat shows to political meetings. The Communist
Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, for example, pays for space when
he comes to Krasnoyarsk and holds a news conference there. In 1999
the museum raised more than $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   While money remains a problem, Krasnoyarsk has managed to start
up a successful biennial exhibition. The third, held in September,
included exhibits from nearly 80 museums from across Russia and
several from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea was that the museum is not a preserver of the ancient
but is something that must develop,'' Shoubsky said. ``It must
attract cultures, subcultures and youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Of major Lenin museums (it retains its Lenin collection),
Krasnoyarsk's is the only one to draw crowds in post-Communist
Russia. In 1999 nearly 500,000 people visited the museum, though
Krasnoyarsk has a population of just 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are scrambling to keep pace. Last year Krasnoyarsk's
governor, Gen. Alexander Lebed, not a fan of modern art, sponsored
a biennial prize for loyalty to traditional museum values.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from the stereotype of Russian provincial museums,
which are generally viewed as musty, dusty guardians of an ossified
past controlled by a stodgy culture ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The region's bumpy history offers some creative advantages,
Shoubsky said. The region is a melting pot of Poles, Lithuanians
and ethnic groups from the Caucasus deported by various regimes,
and Siberia has hundreds of indigenous ethnicities. The Jewish
Agency for Israel keeps its local offices in the museum. The mix is
reflected in the museum's exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial drew attention to other provincial museums that
could not compete with those in Moscow and St. Petersburg but are
showing creativity and resourcefulness. An exhibit from Togliatti,
an auto industry city on the Volga River, took visitors through a
maze of aggressive words and images depicting the horrors of drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Many art critics complained that it was not so much an art
exhibit as an attempt at social outreach, but the young came in
droves. Young people are also drawn to clubs and concerts in the
museum, and to a new department at a local university that trains
museum workers.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Lenin has been erased or evicted. A 65-ton statue of
``Lenin and His Brothers-in-Arms,'' too heavy to move, stands in
the cathedral-ceilinged foyer. So the museum designers work around
Lenin and with him. Turn any corner in the mazelike split-level
building and Lenin is there, his image rendered on carpets,
paintings and statues, his words carved into the marble walls.
Shoubsky says that's the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't destroy the past,'' he said. ``We're not trying to
turn it into something political. We don't say that Lenin is bad.
Lenin is a subject with which we often hold a dialogue in artistic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Lenin and his comrades were surrounded by children's
paintings and whimsical paper-and-tape sculptures of that other
national symbol, the 19th-century poet Alexander Pushkin. A
graceful wooden footbridge led up from the statue, alluding to the
``bright future'' Lenin promised.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The museum also organized an exhibition of Moscow
conceptualists, with works ranging from stylized reproductions of
Russian Orthodox icons with blank spots where the faces of saints
should be to mangled teddy bears to stark photographs depicting
what might be bearded terrorists beating a child, or might just be
roughhousing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many were angered by the exhibition, but iconoclasm is not the
museum's main emphasis. One of the most successful exhibits last
year, said Shoubsky, featured traditional Orthodox iconography.
</P>
<P>
   As the museum has evolved, some staff members have left. But
encouraged by Shoubsky's philosophical, tolerant bent, many of the
original members stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The museum has some typical Soviet drawbacks, like a leaky roof.
The impenetrable walls were not suitable for hanging works and
museum equipment was unavailable in Russia, so Sergei Kovalevsky,
the museum's deputy director and a professor of architecture, and
other designers created portable aluminum structures. The solution
was practical and cheap, as aluminum is the local industry.
Recently they have designed interlocking wooden pieces like the
bridge in the foyer, and they are taking orders from other Russian
museums at their new wood shop on the site.
</P>
<P>
   So Kovalevsky possibilities in hardship. ``Frank Gehry is now
rich, but he became famous on the aesthetic of poverty,'' he said.
``He made art from garbage _ that's why he is attractive to us. The
role of the museum is to take simple objects and show their
essence.''

POETIC PARCELLS TURNS JETS OVER TO BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bill Parcells read a poem.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning that Parcells gathered his New York Jets players
at Weeb Ewbank Hall on the campus of Hofstra University to tell
them of his retirement fromng, he recited, ``The Man in The
Glass,'' to explain the ever-present ``Why?'' that has defined
these moments with the Giants, the Patriots, and now the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells time and again returned to the theme that a man can
fool many people, but never himself.
</P>
<P>
   The poem, an anonymous composition, begins, ``When you get what
you want in your struggle for self/and the world makes you king for
a day/Just go to a mirror and look at yourself/and see what that
man has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after addressing the players, Parcells was relaxed
and loose, far from maudlin or sentimental, as he explained to the
media why he was leaving the sidelines once and for all _ ``Write
it on your chalkboards; I'm not coaching any more games'' _ and
turning the Jets over to longtime assistant Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The news was shocking to many. When running back Curtis Martin
gave linebacker Bryan Cox the word early in the morning, Cox said
he didn't believe Martin. Linebacker James Farrior said, ``I think
everybody was pretty much shocked with what happened. This has been
our coach for three years and we all came in together. I like him a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani weighed in, suggesting
Parcells as a possible candidate for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Because I'm so long on patience?'' replied Parcells.
``I'm flattered, but I'm not a political animal.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the shock in New York was immense, Parcells's reasons for
leaving were personal. The Jets may be as close to next year's
Super Bowl as any team, and, said Parcells, ``We do have a credible
franchise here now,'' but he said he looked in that mirror and no
longer could give his all to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I could probably do it for 16 games or 32 or 48,'' said
Parcells, who coached the Jets for three years, ``but you have to
have the committed energy to do it at the level I want to do it. I
demand commitment from the players and they have the right to
demand the same commitment from me. At this point in time, I don't
feel I can give it the way it has to be given.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time. In fact, I know it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he had told late Jets owner Leon Hess a year ago
that the 1999 season might be his last, and he was ``99 percent
sure on Saturday,'' the day before t game against Seattle.
And the poem, he said, explained why:
</P>
<P>
   ``For it isn't your father, mother or wife/whose judgment you
must pass;/The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life/is the
one staring back from the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells felt he no longer could look in that mirror and see a
truly dedicated NFL coach. So he told Belichick Sunday night of his
decision, then told his wife and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You . . . you've just got to pull the trigger,'' said
Parcells. ``I knew it was time to go. And I know that I'm not
coaching football again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some close to the Jets feel the delay in selling the team after
the death of Hess last May was an irritant to Parcells and may
explain why he chose to move so quickly. Others felt it was one
last chance for Parcells to deal a setback to Patriots owner Bob
Kraft, who was hoping to court Belichick to replace Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Under NFL rules, Kraft could not contact the Jets for permission
to talk to Belichick until there was a vacancy in New England. It
was learned Monday that the Patriots faxed the Jets Monday morning
seeking such permission.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells left no time for Kraft to move because Parcells
left his job an hour or so after Kraft fired Carroll. Under terms
of his contract, Belichick automatically moved up as the Jets'
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if New England's interest in Belichick hastened his
announcement, Parcells said, ``No, not really. I felt I owed it to
the organization to move quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Patriots had sought permission to talk, Parcells
said, ``It's a moot point now.'' His more direct answer had come
Sunday evening when asked the same question. ``Know the rules,'' he
had said then.
</P>
<P>
   The public comments notwithstanding, Parcells's one last chance
to trump Kraft clearly seemed to be a factor in the rapid
transition of power. Parcells and Kraft are still fierce foes after
their messy divorce four years ago, when the Patriots reached the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the job, Mr. Hess said I could coach the team one
year, two years, three years, or whatever I wanted to do,'' said
Parcells. ``And that at any point in that time I could move into
the operations end of the organization. At the end of last season,
I had a conversation where I informed Mr. Hess that _ win, lose, or
draw _ there was a good chance this was my last year in coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was how the Jets recovered from losing
quarterback Vinny Testaverde in the first game _ while losing to
the Patriots _ that led to Parcells's decision. Hne of his
best coaching jobs in bringing the Jets back to 8-8 after a
horrendous start, and that comeback, said Parcells, made it easier
for him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact,'' said Parcells, ``if we hadn't finished
the way we had, I think I probably would have considered even more
strongly staying on. I think one of the things that I've always
prided myself is that where I've gone, when I left there, there was
a better operation.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one uncertain area in Parcells's announcement, it
was his new role with the team. He will now go upstairs in the Jets
organization and do . . . well, little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill (Belichick) will be making the football decisions,'' said
Parcells, who will have the title of head of football operations.
``I will be available to him, to consult with him in any manner
that he deems necessary. But Bill will be making all football
decisions.'' That includes the draft.
</P>
<P>
   As he did with the Giants and Patriots, Parcells brought out
fierce loyalty in many of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a list of 10 former guys who I've coached who've
called this morning,'' said Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there is some sadness. But there's no `poor me'
syndrome. I'm not looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   And his legacy?
</P>
<P>
   He wants it to be that he brought out the best in players, that
all his players ``knew I would do anything to win a game,'' that
``you see something in somebody, you're not sure what it is but you
become infatuated with somebody,'' and that ``something'' in
somebody, nourished by Parcells, results in an NFL player.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned former Patriots Sam Gash and Ray Lucas and current
Patriot Troy Brown as examples of such players. Just as he
mentioned the ``development of Drew (Bledsoe) as a quarterback.''
It was clear that Parcells retains fondness for the players he had
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   The final verse of the anonymous poem Parcells read to his
players explained all: ``You may fool the whole world down thway of life/And get pats on your back as you pass./But your
final reward will be heartache and tears/If you've cheated the man
in the glass.''

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Shepherdstown, W.Va.) _ President Clinton on
Monday began a fresh round of negotiations between Israel and
Syria, seizing on a ``historic opportunity'' to reach a
land-for-peace deal and end 50 years of enmity between the two
Mideast countries. Clinton held a separate meeting with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and planned a similar one with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, before a three-way session
anticipated later in the day. (Summary from wires) By John M.
Broder.

<P>
   JAPAN-WEALTH (Tokyo) _ The gap between rich and poor Japanese is
widening, spurred by changes in the economy and in society. By
Stephanie Strom. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BRADLEY (Undated) _ Playing the anti-Washington themes that
have won New Hampshire primaries for Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan
and Pat Buchanan, Bill Bradley today portrayed Vice President Al
Gore as timid and out of touch with the American people, who he
said are tired of partisan politics and think that Washington has
nothing to do with their lives. Gore, meanwhile, tells 1000
students in Iowa that the nation needs a tried-and-true leader,
capable of addressing more than a few national problems. His
reference is clearly to his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds, this story supercedes the separate GORE and BRADLEY
stories scheduled earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-FAMILIES (Washington) _ A current Supreme Court case on
whether grandparents, other relatives, and even non-relatives
should be able to gain a court-ordered right to visit with children
over the parents' objection has opened the door not only to an
examination of the stresses besetting the generations, but to a
profound debate over the very definition of family. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-SUITS (Undated) _ HMO companies _ like cigarette,
lead paint and gun manufacturers _ are under a growing legal
bombardment. The assault includes at least 16 recent class-action
lawsuits, most filed by some of the same lawyers who won huge
settlements from the tobacco industry. Several new state laws and
measures in Congress could open the industry to still more
lawsuits. And the federal law that has long protected many managed
care companies is being whittled away in a series of court
decisions in various malpractice cases. That is why the industry is
looking to guidance from the Supreme Court, which will hear an
important test case in February. By Milt Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   DIVIDENDS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Dividends, corporate America
appears to be concluding, are an unnecessary cost of doing
business. Investors do not appear to be interested in getting
dividend payments, so why bother paying them? For the first time in
recent history _ and probably the first time since the Depression _
a quarter of the value of the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks
now comes from companies that do not pay dividends. Two decades
ago, only 2 percent of the value of the index came from such
companies. By Floyd Norris.
</P>
<P>
   reefer: FBN-JETS-PARCELS (Hempstead, N.Y.) _ Bill Parcells
announces he not coach the Jets next season. His decision comes in
the wake of a rousing finish by his team, which started the season
1-6 but then swept their final four games from teams headed to the
playoffs. Gerald Eskenazi.

FINALLY, SCORE WILL BE SETTLED

   NEW ORLEANS _ Finally.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of hype and hoopla, after six weeks of idleness,
after a season filled with debate, controversy, and, most
signficantly, games, college football will crown its national
champion in the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the event Tuesday night will be called the Bowl
Championship Series Sugar Bowl game _ winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   For No. 1 Florida State it is just another piece of a puzzle
that has virtually remained unchanged over the past decade. This
game will be the Seminoles' third appearance in the title game in
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   For No. 2 Virginia Tech, it is more of a coming-out party. Even
with an 11-0 record, the Big East champion Hokies still hear the
familiar refrain that they don't belong here.
</P>
<P>
   easy a league, too soft a schedule, it's said. ``I know
people are used to seeing Florida State for sure,'' said Virginia
Tech coach Frank Beamer, ``and they're not used to seeing Virginia
Tech. But hopefully they will get to see what we're all about.
We're not the new kids on the block, but we're going to try to
uphold our end of the championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Hokies have paid their dues. They have been to an
Orange Bowl and a Sugar Bowl in non-championship game situations.
Since 1993 they have the eighth-best record in Division 1A (54-19).
</P>
<P>
   They also have the ingredients necessary for a championship
team. An outstanding defense and a diverse offense, with arguably
the best quarterback in college football in redshirt freshman
Michael Vick, who finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's beautiful that the Sugar Bowl has matched up a
Cinderella team like Virginia Tech and kind of an old-timer like
Florida State,'' said Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden, who turned 70
during the season and shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida State is also on a mission. Although they are not
chasing respect the way Virginia Tech is, the Seminoles are going
after their first unbeaten season under Bowden, as well as their
second national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one would definitely mean more,'' said Bowden, who won
his first crown in 1993, but saw his team lose title opportunities
to Florida in 1996 and Tennessee last season. ``In '93 we had gone
seven years in a row being close, but never getting it. So when we
won it, it was a bigger relief than anything. Now it's been six or
seven years and everybody is saying, ``He's only got one . . . but
he's so old. I've made everybody else a national champion. I made
(Tennessee coach Phil) Fulmer one, I made (Flordida coach Steve)
Spurrier one. It's time I got another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden understands how the Seminoles have changed their image
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to Florida State (in 1976) we were the
homecoming queen to everybody,'' said Bowden. ``I prefer the
underdog role. You can tell the team, `Look what they're saying
about you.' If you're the favorite, you talk about defending your
ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Florida State has had to defend more than that. The
Seminoles have been plagued by a series of off-the-field problems,
lowlighted by the now infamous PeterWarrick discounted shopping
spree at a Tallahassee department store that led the wide receiver
to a plea bargain arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems, despite a couple of New Year's Eve curfew
violations, seem to be behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids do things,'' Bowden said with a shrug and then a laugh as
he stepped through the minefields of talking about incidents such
as Warrick's. ``Idon't condone the things that they do, but I don't
kill them. Some of these kids, we're the closest thing they have to
a father. If a kid commits murder, I have to let him go. If he gets
a discount, I'd want to know how he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles have seem more focused this week than a year ago.
They are used to the hoopla of championship game week, in which
questions are repeated over and over again while the players are
going stir crazy waiting for game time.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the teams are a mirror image. Both play
aggressive, push-the-envelope defense, with outspoken players; both
have quarterbacks who are regarded as the key to success; both are
opportunists that turn the other team's mistakes into points
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come down to fundamentals,'' said Florida State
running back Travis Minor. ``When a play is there, we need to take
advantage because it might not be there again. We can't miss
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have had opportunities to lose. Virginia Tech narrowly beat
West Virginia and Florida State had to go-all out to beat Georgia
Tech and Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   If Florida State wins, fewuestion the Seminoles' claim on
No. 1. If Virginia Tech wins, there no doubt still will be a few
critics who question the Hokies' credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But with no playoff system in place, or being planned, this is
the best the BCS has to offer. And the winner will indeed be a
fitting champion for the final season of the 20th century.

WHILE SOME FEAR JAPAN'S WIDENING INCOME GAP, OTHERS WELCOME IT 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Park Hyatt Hotel here is a favorite watering hole of
the well heeled, known for its fantastic views of the city and the
marbled, melt-in-the-mouth Maezawa beef cooked to order.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the street in Shinjuku Chuo Park, homeless people,
more visibly concentrated here than in most parts of the city,
spend the day sipping from half-empty juice boxes and picking
through the garbage discarded by children using the playground.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasts like these are rare in Japan, which has long regarded
itself as the world's most egalitarian industrialized nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between rich and poor Japanese is widening, spurred
by changes in the economy and in society. People are living longer
and accumulating more wealth. Increasingly, pay is being set by
performance rather than seniority. Women, once relegated to the
home, are trooping to office jobs. Tax laws have been changed to
let the the rich keep more of their money, and loopholes once
exploited by the middle class are closing.
</P>
<P>
   Where once everyone seemed to be treated more or less the same,
merchants and marketers are focusing on the affluent. And it is
paying off even during Japan's prolonged recession. Mercedes-Benz
luxury cars are selling at a brisk pace while overall car sales
have slumped. Private banking services offered to the wealthy are
also proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, everyone's pay increased as they got older,'' said
Shoji Hiraide, general manager of Mitsukoshi's flagship department
store branch in central Tokyo, which has begun a campaign to woo
the wealthy. ``It made everyone think that we are all in the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``But lifetime employment is crumbling and salaries are based
more on merit and performance,'' he said. ``In seven or eight
years, Japanese society will look much more like Western society,
with gaps between rich and poor that can be clearly seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing income stratification raises potentially troubling
questions for Japan, where sameness, or the perception of it,
greatly contributes to the social harmony that is so prized here.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials concede privately that greater income
disparity is inevitable as the economy becomes more competitive.
But they fear that differences between the rich and the poor will
lead to more theft, petty crime in general and a host of other
social problems that hardly concern Japan now.
</P>
<P>
   And politicians fear that a wider income gap could threaten the
power of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan
virtually unchallenged since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really controversial issue in Japan,'' said Hiromitsu
Ishi, president of Hitotsubashi University and a member of the
prime minister's tax panel. ``Company owners and big company
presidents are complaining about the tiny gap between their
salaries and the salaries of new employees, but most Japanese
people like the notion of a not-so-uneven income distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``a less egalitarian attitude is spreading
because the average level of income has continued to increase. In
Japan, extremely poor people don't really exist much now _ although
after the restructuring of the labor market, that may change, and
with it tolerance.'' Thus he believes that the government's fears
may be overblown, a sentiment shared by several economists and
policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's income distribution has always been wider than
policymakers were willing to admit. Forbes magazine's annual list
of the world's wealthiest people features a fair share of Japanese,
who have become famous for spending large amounts of money on
luxury goods, Impressionist paintings and beachfront property in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last 30 years, about 90 percent of the people
responding to surveys on income have said that they regard
themselves as middle class. Being rich, or even well-to-do, is
rather unseemly here, and wealth is not flaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought that income and wealth distribution in Japan
was equal, and maybe that was true 20 years ago,'' said Toshiaki
Tachibanaki, an economics professor at Kyoto University. ``But I
say that kind of myth should be abandoned. Japan has become a
normal country.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparities that exist now are far less pronounced than they
are in the United States and Britain. In the average big Japanese
company, the chief executive made 35.7 million yen, or roughly
$350,000, according to one estimate, while the Labor Ministry puts
the average salaryman's pay at 5.5 million yen, or roughly $56,000.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, total compensation in 1998 for chief executives
at the 500 largest American companies averaged about $8 million,
according to Graef Crystal, a compensation consultant.
</P>
<P>
   And since World War II, the Japanese government has used one of
the world's most progressive tax codes as a social leveler, so
there was no point in striving to make more money. The higher the
remuneration, the more the government took away.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is changing, although the government is quick to
point out that the leading factor behind Japan's widening income
disparity is aging. Income and wealth differences are generally
more pronounced among the elderly, as some have saved and invested
better than others. Japan increasingly has more older people as a
percentage of its population than other developed countries, and it
faces the growing problem of providing social security benefits for
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the major contribution to the rising income
differential comes from the population aging, it is a function of
aging, not a real rise in inequality resulting from government
policy,'' said Hiroko Tada, an official at the Economic Planning
Agency who wrote a white paper confirming the widening income gap.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Tada and her colleagues note, however, that research by
private economists and academics suggests the phenomenon is driven
by government policy as well as changes in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   They also insist that the changes are necessary if Japan is ever
to recover economic momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for a government official to advocate income
inequality,'' said Kenji Umetani, director of the social policy
research division at the planning agency. ``But when we are
designing the future structure of the Japanese economy, we have to
make some adjustments to the existing structure that will
necessitate an acceptance among Japanese people of greater income
dispersion.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is already happening. Seiko Takahashi's family in Sendai, a
city about 185 miles north of Tokyo, can afford computers, cars and
a private school education that would have been out of their reach
if she was not working as a stockbroker at a firm where her pay is
increasingly reliant on her performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any embarrassment about it,'' Mrs. Takahashi
said, when asked whether her relative affluence bothered her.
</P>
<P>
   She said most of her friends and neighbors work, too, albeit
mostly part-time, which has helped mitigate any resentment that
might arise over her good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, there were some kids who were obviously poor
because they didn't have money for their school lunch,'' said Mrs.
Takahashi, who is 39. ``We never hear of such things now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, her daughters' friends tell them they are rich, in
part because her oldest daughter, Naoko, 17, goes to an expensive
private school and her other daughter, Maiko, 16, has particularly
nice clothing and all of the accouterments that teen-agers consider
vital. ``It seems kids feel this kind of difference in a very
straightforward way,'' Mrs. Takahashi said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some industries are also beginning to tie pay to performance.
When the Sony Corp. set up Sony Computer Entertainment, the
subsidiary that created the phenomenally successful Play Station
video game, employees of the new unit were paid for performance,
and the pay scale more closely resembled that of American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the subsidiary get none of the traditional noncash
allowances for housing and transportation that are common in Japan.
The software developers who create games have revenue-sharing
agreements, a system Sony Computer adopted because the competition
for talented game creators is so intense. ``It's dictated by the
market,'' said Yasuhiro Ito, a manager in the human resources
department at Sony Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Sony Computer's unorthodox pay structure caused some
grumbling at Sony Corp., where pay is more closely linked to tenure
and seniority, although to a lesser extent than at other Japanese
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Sony is now in the process of carving the corporation into
discrete units, which will pay their employees based on formulas
related to performance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist here, thinks that as long
as the rising tide lifts all boats, greater income disparity will
be acceptable. ``Look at what happened in England,'' he said.
``Income disparity increased, but mostly people's incomes rose and
everyone felt they were better off.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the government hopes to accomplish with changes to
tax policy that benefit the wealthy and push less affluent citizens
to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   The highest income tax rate has been cut to 50 percent from 65
percent and will be further reduced. At the same time, the
government would like to begin taxing people of lower income
levels, who were previously exempted. And it is seeking to
eliminate some of the special tax breaks used by one-third of
Japanese wage earners to avoid income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also considering reducing Japan's exorbitant
inheritance taxes, which have been the prime mechanism for leveling
incomes. ``Among every one hundred people who die, only five or six
of them would be subject to the inheritance tax,'' said Ishi, the
prime minister's adviser. ``So the inheritance tax is not so
important in terms of revenue but very important in terms of
redistributing wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, wealthy Japanese welcome the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden of taxes falls much too heavily on wealthy people
here,'' said Yoshiro Okada, president ofa construction company in
Fukuyama, a city in southwestern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He considers himself affluent but not vastly more so than his
neighbors and friends. He does, however, see an increase in wealth
discrepancies, and he welcomes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Japan is an egalitarian society,'' he said. ``I
sometimes think that the gap is expanding, and I think the
environment in which one can accomplish one's dreams by striving to
reach ever higher is growing in Japan.''

JEROME (Jerome, Ariz.) - Jerome, that old mining town atop a hill
in northern arizona, has long been a haven for hippies, who
resurrected it from a ghost town in the '60s. The flower children
effectively have run the town since. Now, bikers are claiming
Jerome as their own, occupying restaurants and shops and, in some
cases, moving into the town. The two groups are locked in a clash
of cultures, among others. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TCE (Phoenix) - A $24.5 million settlement is proposed in a civil
action involving TCE in the Phoenix area's groundwater. Dealing
with the same subject as the 1999 movie, ``A Civil Action,'' this
is one of the most important civil cases of the decade in the
Valley. Story will show how the lives of key people involved have
been affected by the groundwater pollutions and the suit. Three
major defendants including the city of Phoenix and Motorola are not
part of the settlement and remain in the lawsuits. By CHRIS FISCUS.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) - We now have proof that, in America, it's
worse being a baseball pitcher who shoots his mouth off than a
baseball player who threatens to shoot his wife. The pitcher
packing the IQ of 45 is Atlanta Brave John Rocker. The pitcher
packing the actual .45 is . . . someone you couldn't pick out of a
lineup, unless maybe you lived in Phoenix. He's the Diamondbacks'
Bobby Chouinard. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and
``K'' categories. &QL;

HOKIES GETTING USED TO THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Maybe if they win they will get respect,
recognition for what they have accomplished. Maybe the jokes about
their schedule will go away.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if they lose, the critics will call them frauds,
saying they didn't deserve to be here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Tech Hokies and their fans have heard all of this
before, of course. But the perception is beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The perception) is best explained by my wife,'' said Virginia
Tech coach Frank Beamer at Monday's final news conference before
Tuesday night's Bowl Championship Series title game against Florida
State in the Sugar Bowl. ``She said it's like reading about
somebody new every day. We get two and three stores a day in USA
Today. There were years when we didn't have our scores in USA
Today.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Virginia Tech has come under Beamer's watch. In the
past seven seasons, the Hokies have a 64-19 record, which includes
two trips to the Sugar Bowl, an Orange Bowl appearance, and seven
straight bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The school's climb in stature also has helped the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of a sudden all the doomsday-ers have gone away,''
said Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese. ``We had a period where
we struggled a little, and all of sudden we feel better. Tech's
success put a new face on it.'' But not even Tranghese could
project the speed of the Hokies' climb. ``I've seen it happen in
basketball,'' Tranghese said. ``But I didn't know if it was
possible in football this quickly. I don't think anyone could have
predicted this.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer says the goal has been a simple one from the time he came
back to his alma mater 13 years ago. ``It's not so much where
you're from, but where you're going,'' he said. ``There's a thin
line from being OK in this business to not being OK in this
business. We hope to stay among the best in college football.
That's hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago we were ahead of seven teams in the fourth
quarter and went 2-8-1 (in 1992). Now we've been to seven straight
bowl games. We've got some good players. Then we got some
confidence and we won games in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden knows how Beamer feels. ``I've
been here 24 years,'' Bowden said. ``Frank's pretty much at the
same place at Virginia Tech as I was at Florida State after 10
years. We went to the Orange Bowl in 1979-80. We lost a couple of
those games during those years by 1 point. Then we hit a lull. In
1987, we began to hit that string (of success).''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer says he has used Florida State as a role model. ``No
question about it,'' he said. ``Florida State is exactly in the
position we are trying to get to. We worked to get in on the
national level for a long time and I am proud of the fact that we
are one of only eight programs to get to seven straight bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think consistency is the key element in trying to get to
where Florida State is. I think we have everything we need at
Virginia Tech to play at a high level year in and year out. We've
got a great academic school to sell. We are in a good state for
football. We've got great facilities. We are in a great conference.
Our athletic director (Jim Weaver) has plans to enlarge our stadium
in a consistent fashion, to add boxes and so forth. That needs to
happen. As long as we continue to grow in that direction, I don't
see why Virginia Tech shouldn't be able to play at the top level.
That's our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies have gotten much of the talent from Virginia _ 65
players on the roster are from the state. ``We recruit as hard as
we can in Virginia,'' said offensive coordinator Ricky Bustle.
``Then we recruit to replace certain areas. We have four coaches in
Florida _ 16 players come from Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer says the Virginia-first philosophy will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see me going somewhere other than Virginia to
recruit first,'' he said. ``It's tough to get in somewhere and
learn about the players. If you're going all around the country,
you're dealing with unknowns. I want to deal with knowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a people guy. A player has to have a certain talent level,
but I'm just as interested in what he's all about. I want to go
back to the same high schools where the coaches know us and we know
the coaches. We know the coaches will be truthful about their
players. If we do the best job of getting players out of our state,
this won't be the last time we'll be playing for the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   With exposure like that provided by the Sugar Bowl, Virginia
Tech has become more of a national program, despite the remoteness
of its Blacksburg campus in the western part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is as close-knit a community as you will find, from
Beamer, a Tech alum; to the university president, who has worked at
Tech for 33 years; to the mayor, a Tech grad; to the thousands of
Hokie fans who have come to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   And the turnaround has been as quick. In Beamer's early years,
few people cared about or knew of Tech football. They had a home
game scheduled against Florida State in 1991, but switched it to
Orlando for the cash guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Their nickname, the Hokies, which came from a student-written
cheer in 1896, seemed to fit the school.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with All-American and Heisman Trophy vote-getters such
as defensive end Corey Moore and redshirt freshman quarterback
Michael Vick, the Hokies' roster still has a blue-collar feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said Florida State has like 13 guys who were Parade
All-Americans,'' said Beamer. ``I said we had two guys that have
been in a parade.''
</P>
<P>
   More players should be coming to Blacksburg now, which will
mean, among other things, more scrutiny. Virginia Tech had a
problem during a 13-month period in 1995-96 when 19 football
players were arrested 22 times on a series of charges from drunk
driving to rape.
</P>
<P>
   It was not headline news outside of Blacksburg because the
Hokies were not national championship contenders. As Bowden, who
has had to deal with a series of off-field incidents this season,
noted, ``If you don't want other people to know, don't be No. 1. Be
No. 50. I learned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's response to its problems was to institute a
program that issued harsher penalties for transgressions and also
to set up more restrictive character requirements in recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer, like Bowden, says some mistakes have been made. ``When
you deal with 115 guys,'' he said, ``not everyone is going to do
exactly what you want them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies have done what Beamer has asked of them. Moore had an
outburst last week that caused a stir, but for the most part,
Virginia Tech has played its role as a newcomer in the national
spotlight fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   What happens will either enhance that role or diminish it.

 &HT;    CNN Interactive plans to double employees within year
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN Interactive says it plans to nearly double its
staff of online writers, editors, Web developers and multimedia
producers in the United States and overseas by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The growth, says General Manager and Editor-in-Chief Scott
Woefel, reflects the increasing depth and breadth of content on
Atlanta-based CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, CNN.com has about 300 employees, including 100 in the
news division and 50 each at CNN's online sports and business
sites. Rivals ABCNews.com and MSNBC.com have similar staffing
levels. Woefel declined to say how many new hires are expected, but
says a major expansion is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Since CNN launched its Web site in 1995, Web news junkies have
come to expect more than text and pictures from online news
sources. RealAudio, multimedia slide shows and streaming video are
all part of the online news experience.
</P>
<P>
   CNN.com already draws much of its news from its well-known
roster of national and international staffers. However, Woefel says
it takes more than just a handful of people to assemble a
content-rich Web news story. CNN has always been a leader in online
breaking news, but Woefel admits there are places where CNN.com
could do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what CNN.com does on a daily basis, there's a
lot there. There are a lot of sections. In some places, we can't
rely on CNN television, so the best way is to hire a good,
competent staff and reliable partners. The other consideration is
to look at our international needs and make sure it matches our TV
interest. That's why we are looking at hiring domestically and
internationally,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every story we do, we have to have background materials
and links and chat,'' he says. ``All this hiring is about catching
up in some of the areas we've neglected in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Preston Dodd says CNN's online
staff expansion is part of an effort to better integrate the Web
brand with its TV counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now breaking news is all about the Internet, and that's a big
challenge they face. When you think of the number of people they
have on the TV side, 300 people (on the Web side) is laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet is part of their business and part of the
relationship CNN has with its consumers. They have to react and
change accordingly. If they don't, their competitors will get ahead
of them,'' Dodd says.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews and MSNBC have always worked to integrate TV and Web
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews, for example, is nearly always ready for any major news
event with an array of charts, graphs, chats, explainer boxes,
glossaries and background materials that give users added depth.
Meanwhile, MSNBC has always made extensive use of personalization
and chat as well as links to other Microsoft and NBC properties
such as Slate and NBC news programs.
</P>
<P>
   While CNN has always been a leader and innovator in online news
coverage, Woefel knows it has to expand its staff to make the best
use of the Web as well as the extensive resources of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are another network of CNN,'' says Woefel. ``The one place
we didn't have a dedicated Internet team was in the field. We don't
need two people the White House or two people in Sarajevo, when we
have such well-known on-air talent as Christianne Amanpour and Wolf
Blitzer.'' What's needed, he says, are Web producers who can
assemble the audio, the video, the story and the related links and
graphics to back up the on-air staff. ``We aren't close to having
interactive producers everywhere,'' he says, ``but we are moving in
that direction.''

 &HT;    Y2K: What the millennium cost
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Hallock spent six hours baby-sitting over the Y2K
weekend and took home $500 _ equal to half of his regular weekly
pay at Cablevision Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old contract worker volunteered to work New Year's
Eve, from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., at one of Cablevision's facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked the phone system to make sure they were working. We
had to make sure the connections to the billing systems were still
intact, and we basically had to be sure the computer network stayed
up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it (the new year) passed through Japan and Europe with
no problems, we had an understanding of what was going to happen,''
said Hallock, who joined Cablevision a month ago as an information
technology manager overseeing the company's local area network
system.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad way to spend a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While the impact of increased staffing has yet to be fully
tallied by many companies, Y2K turned out to be a financially
fruitful weekend for many workers. Even if they didn't get overtime
pay, many workers went home from their Y2K watch with extra days to
tack onto vacation time later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Information technology workers _ especially people with computer
and network skills _ earned about $700 for a day's work during the
Y2K weekend, estimates Joe Koscik, chief executive of MDI, a
high-tech outsourcing firm that placed Hallock at Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   MDI said it has temporary tech workers at telecommunications
firms, banks, credit-card and payroll companies. Most of them were
at their desks New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In the extreme
cases, some workers were on call from last Thursday through today.
</P>
<P>
   For workers who spent the past year on Y2K matters, it is
turning out to be a springboard to other work. MDI said it has
already placed three-fourths of its Y2K staff in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preparation (cost of Y2K) was astronomical,'' Koscik said.
``The staffing cost is probably about medium. For most of the
companies, this was an unknown. We've never gone through this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Barnes agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not just a day at the office,'' said Barnes,
an Atlanta-based consultant in performance and reward at the human
resources consulting firm William M. Mercer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the New Year's weekend, most
companies used a combination of measures to make sure there were
enough people on hand, according to a Mercer study of 250
organizations' plans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies built a contingency workforce using in-house
employees. ``You can assume the compensation will be in overtime
pay or extra time off,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 20 percent of the companies were bringing
in extra help. Another 20 percent had people to focus solely on Y2K
matters. ``It ranged from having people working for a few days to
several months,'' Barnes said. ``Basically, they're people brought
in from other departments within the company, not outside help.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, most of the people
working over the weekend were salaried _ management and
professionals _ and some people who would have been working anyway.
About 125 people worked over the weekend, spokeswoman Jean Tate
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of elusive,'' Tate said of trying to pin down the
cost of staffing at the Fed. ``What probably will happen is many
workers will receive comp time for their hours, but it's not
something that's actually been written out as a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   AGL Resources has no idea what it cost to have extra staff
Friday night at the natural gas utility. Many of the workers in the
command center were exempt from union requirements for
compensation, said Y2K project director Michael Hutchins.
</P>
<P>
   A BellSouth spokesman said the company had not broken out its
Y2K weekend staffing costs.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Hallock plan to do with the extra $500?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay off Christmas bills,'' he said.

   SHEPERDSTOWN, West Va. _ President Clinton met into the night
Monday with Israeli and Syrian negotiators, opening a critical new
phase in his efforts to broker an end to a half-century of
bloodshed and enmity in the fractious Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on talks he began in Washington last month, Clinton
hosted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in a day of meetings at a secluded
conference center in this rural village on the banks of the Potomac
River.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met separately with Barak, then Sharaa, in the
afternoon, and came out encouraged that both men had come prepared
for brass-tacks talks over issues centered on territory and
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president came out of his two meetings believing that ...
both sides are serious about being here,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``He believes the talks are off to a good
start.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief break for dinner, Clinton was expected to convene
a trilateral meeting with Barak and Sharaa at the semi-secluded
Clarion Hotel and Conference Center just outside Shepherdstown,
before returning to Washington late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were expected to continue, under the auspices of U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, at least through the week.
Barak, Sharaa and the battery of issue experts each man brought
along were expected to assess the talks' progress at week's end and
determine whether to continue or to head back to their respective
capitals to consider each other's positions.
</P>
<P>
   As promised when the talks were announced last month, Lockhart
declined to discuss the substance of Monday's talks. The
negotiations are being held under a news blackout _ Syrian and
Israeli delegates were stripped of their cell phones to deter
clandestine chats with reporters _ in an effort to avert public
controversy at each juncture of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin cautioned reporters,
though, against expecting the Shepherdstown talks to resolve all
the differences between Israel and its giant Arab neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect to achieve a core agreement with one round of
talks,'' Rubin said. ``We're at a time for decisions, but those
decisions don't get made in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton regards this round as ``an important next
step,'' in a negotiating process analysts expect will take months
to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was easy,'' Lockhart said, ``it would have been done a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   There's much riding on the talks for Clinton. He sees the
Israeli-Syrian negotiations as a key part to the larger quest for
Mideast peace, one of the top foreign policy priorities for his
final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges to that goal were apparent even as the talks got
under way, however. In Syria, about 50 protesters, mostly
university students, staged a sit-in at the offices of the
International Committee for the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and
demanding the release of Syrian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men
imprisoned,'' Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been
jailed in Israel since 1985, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high, also, for the United States, which counts
Israel as its closest strategic ally in the oil-rich Mideast
region.
</P>
<P>
   Americans would certainly be called upon to provide billions of
dollars in military, economic and humanitarian aid to help cement
any peace deal between Israel and Syria. U.S. troops might also be
deployed to help police a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin stressed that no such arrangements have been agreed upon,
but he suggested that Americans should be ready to accept a
peacekeeping role should an Israeli-Syrian accord be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, big deal,'' Rubin told reporters at a news
briefing, ``and a deal this big is going to carry a price tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived at this two-century-old town at the edge of the
Appalachian Mountain range shortly before noon, putting down in the
presidential helicopter, Marine One, in a muddy baseball diamond at
Shepherd College after a half-hour flight from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded immediately into separate meetings with Barak and
Sharaa at a conference center in a secluded, wooded retreat
operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton, who has cleared his weekly schedule to
monitor the talks, would be available throughout the week to return
to Shepherdstown whenever Albright decides his presence would help
move the talks forward.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate track, Barak is pursuing a peace agreement with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The two men have pledged to
hammer out a framework for so-called ``final status'' talks by
mid-February and to nail down a comprehensive agreement _ to
include such contentious issues as the future of Jerusalem and the
question of Palestinian statehood _ by October.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's talks with Syria are centered on a plan under which
Israel would return to Syria the Golan Heights in return for
security guarantees, and normalized diplomatic and economic
relations between the two Mideast neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are such matters as how to structure security
guarantees _ possibly using United Nations and U.S. peacekeeping
troops _ for Israel; a timetable for Israeli withdrawal from the
strategic Golan Heights; how to allocate precious fresh water
supplies from the Sea of Galilee, in the Golan; and how to set up
the first-ever commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and a
country that has been its avowed foe since the birth of the Jewish
state in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops seized the strategic Golan territories from Syria
during the 1967 war, after Syria joined Egypt and Jordan in
attacking Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the talks here was Syria's aging President Hafez
al-Assad, who is reported to be in uncertain health.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said U.S. officials are confident that Sharaa is
negotiating with Assad's full confidence and authority, however,
Assad's personal attention is likely to be required to seal any
comprehensive accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do expect him to be involved,'' Rubin said, though it was
too soon to say whether Assad would make an appearance in
Shepherdstown.

TAIWAN CANDIDATE URGES PARTY TO GIVE UP CONTROL OF BUSINESSES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a proposal that could foreshadow new rules for
Taiwan's politics, the faltering presidential candidate of the
long-ruling Nationalist Party has proposed that the party's vast
business holdings be placed in a trust and that it end its direct
role in managing hundreds of companies in which it owns shares.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes could reduce the widely resented advantages enjoyed
by the Nationalist Party as it pulls in hundreds of millions of
dollars in profits each year and, according to critics, wields its
shares in everything from banks to oil companies to secure the
allegiance of key groups and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Lien Chan made the surprise proposal on Sunday as
he inaugurated his Taipei campaign headquarters for the
presidential elections scheduled for March. Lien has fared poorly
in what is shaping up as a close three-way race for the presidency,
and his proposal was widely interpreted as a gesture to win back
disillusioned voters.
</P>
<P>
   As Taiwan has moved over the last decade toward a full-fledged
democracy with a probing press, the Nationalist Party's
multibillion-dollar business holdings and evidence of pervasive
cronyism have become sore points with much of the electorate. The
assets of its main competitor, the Democratic Progressive Party,
are meager by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let all of our parties cease any further profit-making
activities, and let it begin with the Nationalist Party,'' Lien
told his supporters. ``Political competition should be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics said that a major transformation of the party's role in
business could take years, and that abuses could continue as long
as the party owns many assets bringing in profits that can be used
in campaigns. But Lien's statement implicitly suggested how strong
the pressures for change have become. In the same speech, he also
proposed new rules to fight election-related corruption and the
political involvement of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Lien is the hand-picked successor of President Lee Teng-hui, 76,
who is the country's first directly elected president and enjoys
popularity for his assertive stance toward mainland China. Lee
asserts that Taiwan has sovereign status, but he has not risked a
Chinese military attack by formally declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has repeatedly declared its goal of reunification, by
military force if necessary, with Taiwan, the seat of Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalist forces since their defeat in the Chinese
civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Progressives' standard bearer is Chen Shui-bian,
the former mayor of Taipei. Chen was scornful of Lien's proposals,
saying they would only mean cosmetic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pour fresh water into a cesspool, the cesspool still
stinks,'' he said at a rally on Sunday night, arguing that only a
wholesale change in the government could clean up Taiwan's
politics. Chen and his Democratic Progressives originally called
for Taiwan's formal independence from China, but he has moderated
the position to avoid losing the many voters who are afraid of
dangerously provoking the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The third major candidate, until recently the front-runner in
polls, is James Soong, formerly a popular Nationalist Party leader
who feuded with Lee and recently broke away for an independent run.
</P>
<P>
   Soong has been hurt by accusations that he controlled a large
personal slush fund, in part derived from his party's corporate
profits. Soong has denied any wrongdoing but has suffered in public
polls. He has not yet commented publicly on Lien's new proposals,
but his spokesman questioned Lien's credibility.

 &HT;    Oddsmakers none too keen on Cowboys chancesBy Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys have a better chance of
winning the Texas lottery than beating Minnesota in the playoffs.
Or so they've been told.
</P>
<P>
   History has an unkind reminder for the Cowboys. In the previous
century, no NFL team won a playoff game with an 8-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   But Instead of waving a white flag and staying in 70-degree
Dallas, the Cowboys have confidence their mediocre season will not
end Sunday under a dome in 20-degree Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is told it has no chance to win, it just adds
incentive to do so,'' safety George Teague said Monday. ``When I
played at Alabama, no one gave us a chance in history of beating
Miami in the (1992) Sugar Bowl, and we went out and kicked their
butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are seven-point underdogs against the 10-6 Vikings,
but Dallas' players and coaches are convinced they have a chance to
write a unique story. It no longer matters that Dallas barely
reached the playoffs, owns a combined 24-24 record the last three
years, lost to Minnesota 27-17 two months ago and finished the
season with a 1-7 road mark.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Cowboys tried to convince critics that a victory
in Minnesota is not as far-fetched as many think it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the playoffs as a stage, a tremendous platform,''
cornerback Deion Sanders said, ``and everyone is watching. I get
excited just thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys watched film Monday of their Nov. 8 loss to the
Vikings. Emmitt Smith rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns,
helping the Cowboys take a 17-0 lead, before breaking his hand in
the second quarter. Smith missed the entire second half,
quarterback Troy Aikman suffered his second concussion is
successive weeks in the third quarter and the big-play Vikings
scored the game's final 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tale of two halves, and the Cowboys think they would
have won had Smith and Aikman not gotten hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play both halves (Sunday) like we did the first
half (on Nov. 8),'' Coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be easier said than done, but a healthy Smith gives
the Cowboys an obvious lift. The 10-year veteran finished the
season with 1,397 yards, ranking fourth in the league. That is a
nice accomplishment, considering that Smith missed a game after
breaking the bone beneath his right ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not the only Cowboy who will be healthier in the
rematch. Sanders no longer has the groin and hamstring problems
that hurt him last time in Minnesota. Gailey said Monday that two
cornerbacks who have been dogged by injuries, Kevin Smith and Kevin
Mathis, should return for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has spent much of his time trying to explain the Cowboys'
roller-coaster season. They have had a knack of blowing
fourth-quarter leads, and most of their games were close. Dallas
has not lost a game by more than 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very emotional season,'' he said. ``Every game
has been a gut-wrencher all the way to the fourth quarter. That
takes a lot out of you emotionally. From now on, anything you
accomplish now must be proven.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to beating the Vikings, Gailey said, is preventing them
from making big offensive plays. Randy Moss and Cris Carter might
be the best tandem of receivers in the league. They have combined
for 170 receptions, 2,654 yards and 24 touchdowns. Against Dallas
last time, they combined for 15 catches, 207 yards and three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   So, which receiver does Gailey worry about most?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like asking which kid you love most,'' Gailey said.
``You can't pick one. Both are real talented guys.''

   WASHINGTON _ A Supreme Court case on whether grandparents, other
relatives and certain nonrelatives should be able to gain a
court-ordered right to visit with children over the parents'
objection has opened the door to a profound debate over the very
definition of family.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, all 50 states have adopted grandparents' rights
laws, permitting grandparents, and sometimes others, to seek
court-ordered visitation under various circumstances. On Jan. 12,
the justices will consider one of the more far-reaching variants, a
Washington state law that permits anyone, without any defined
relationship to the child, to petition for visiting rights and to
succeed if the family court concludes that visitation would be in
the child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Supreme Court concluded in a 1998 decision that
the law violated ``a parent's constitutionally protected right to
rear his or her children without state interference.'' In the
absence of any indication that visitation was necessary to prevent
harm to the child, the parents' rights were ``fundamental'' and
should not be overridden, the state court said, adding that ``the
parents should be the ones to choose whether to expose their
children to certain people or ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices' decision three months ago to review that ruling,
in an appeal brought by a husband and wife seeking to regain access
to their late son's young daughters, galvanized a wide spectrum of
organizations and interest groups that saw implications, for good
or ill, in the state court's categorical assessment of parental
rights. Dozens of organizations have filed or joined briefs in
Troxel vs. Granville, No. 99-138, making it one of the
high-visibility cases in a Supreme Court term already packed with
potential landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   What the briefs have in common is a focus on the centrality of
families in the lives of children. What divides them are very
different views of what it means to be a family.
</P>
<P>
   Briefs representing the interests of the older generation,
including one filed on the grandparents' behalf by the
30-million-member AARP note that the number of children whose
primary caretakers are their grandparents is growing rapidly in the
face of nuclear family dissolution; for 1.4 million children today,
their grandparents are their functional parents.
</P>
<P>
   Briefs representing the Christian right, filed on the parents'
behalf, hold up ``the traditional family, consisting of married
parents and their children'' and ``inextricably linked to the union
of husband and wife'' _ in the words of a brief filed by the
American Center for Law and Justice _ as society's essential
building-block.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups, groups advocating parental choice in
education, organizations concerned with families struggling in
poverty, all have come into the case in an effort to make sure the
justices at least understand the implications of a ruling one way
or another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund a gay-rights legal organization, neither side's position is
sufficiently protective of the needs of children being raised in
nontraditional families where a functional parent may have neither
biological nor legal ties to the child. Courts should take into
account ``the quality and security of the relationship between
individual children and adults rather than blood ties or labels,''
the Lambda brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court could decide the case rather narrowly _ by
limiting its holding, for example, to grandparents or by requiring
certain pre-existing conditions before the law can be invoked _
``there's really no dodging the need to define family,'' according
to David Meyer, a law professor at the University of Illinois and
the author of a recent article on the constitutional concept of
family privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, who is not involved in the case, said in an interview
Monday that the justices should take ``a very flexible and careful
approach to this case'' to avoid binding the court to an analysis
that fails to recognize ``that families as a matter of social
reality are changing dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while on the surface the case presented a
contrasting pair of rather easily described images of family life,
one with the parents in unquestioned control and the other with
grandparents involved in the children's lives, ``as you peel back
the layers of legal and social issues, it's an awful lot more
complicated than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those inclined to support the parents `'are forced to deal with
the implications of a hard-line decision that cuts out a lot of
other interests,'' Meyer said. For example, the main brief filed on
behalf of the grandparents, Jenifer and Gary Troxel, warns that to
accept the Washington Supreme Court's notion of parental control
over ideas to which children should be exposed would have
``revolutionary implications'' for parental veto power over the
curriculum in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Meyer continued, ``those who think it's a
travesty to shut out the grandparents are taking a position that
has a lot of implications they may find less palatable than the
Norman Rockwell image of the traditional family at the Thanksgiving
table.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A number of the briefs seek to focus the court's attention on
implications of the case that may not be intuitively obvious to the
justices. For example, a brief filed by Legal Services of
Southeastern Michigan, on behalf of the parents, asserts that poor
people's family integrity is at risk under a law that ``opens the
door for subjective value judgments concerning the court's view of
family'' under a standard that appraises the best interests of the
child, because ``poorer, less educated parents will always look
worse in relation to older, seemingly more established and settled
grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the intense interest in the case is the fact that the
Supreme Court will be making a constitutional ruling in an area
where its decisions have been few and far between and, recently,
heatedly contested. A pair of decisions in the 1920s established
the right to direct the education of one's children as an aspect of
parental ``liberty'' protected against state interference by the
due process guarantee of the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the court has been wary of the branch of
constitutional analysis known as substantive due process. Its most
recent decision in the family law context was a splintered 1989
ruling, Michael H. vs. Gerald D., rejecting a biological father's
due process challenge to a California law's presumption that his
child was legally the child of the man to whom the mother was
married at the time of the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia's plurality opinion said that because
there was no historic pedigree for the biological father's claim,
it should not be recognized as an aspect of due process.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court now is a poignant one. The Troxels'
son, who was not married to the mother of his children, committed
suicide. The mother, Tommie Granville, married a man who adopted
the children.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparents, wanting more access than the new family was
willing to permit, brought suit and initially won a detailed
visitation order that was overturned on appeal. In her brief, Ms.
Granville said she had been obliged to spend her children's college
money on the cost of ``defending the fundamental right of all
families not to have the state micromanage their affairs.''

COMMENTARY: WHITHER Y2K? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's achievement in guiding the nation
through the perils of Y2K is a little like Mayor Rudy Giuliani's
accomplishment in bringing down New York City's crime rate. It's
very nice, but it would look even better if other people hadn't
managed to do the same thing with less hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Our first challenge in the new millennium is deciding how to
respond to the remarkable ease of the transition. Everybody worried
that all those zeroes would cause computer crashes around the
world. Nuclear power plants might explode, missiles might launch
themselves, water and electricity shut down. There hasn't been so
much disaster preparedness since the bomb shelter era. Now a lot of
people are sitting around with two years' supply of peanut butter
on hand and Sears is charging a premium to take back those
generators.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, of course, wanted a Russian nuclear reactor to implode
just so Americans could feel the $100 billion we spent on Y2K
compliance was worth it. But as the year 2000 moved across one
dateline after another, our officials must have started yearning
for something to go wrong someplace. Even in the United States,
effort didn't seem to matter. The ants and the grasshoppers both
had their computers humming on Monday morning. The Social Security
Administration, the Y2K readiness star, reported no problems. But
neither did the Justice Department, which got a D on every
congressional report card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know that they don't have a problem,'' insisted Rep.
Stephen Horn, the head of the House subcommittee on government
management, information and technology. ``This was only the first
day of business and a lot of people weren't there because they take
a four-day weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   This thinking _ call it Y2K YTK _ is a widespread explanation
for the uneventful turn of the millennium. Just wait until next
week. Or next month. Soon they'll be saying that the computers have
bought into the classicists' theory, and are postponing the crash
until Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another extremely popular theory among the experts is that
nothing happened because we stopped it. ``I think all of us view it
as a great victory that we can sit here and talk about `Was the
money well spent,''' said John Koskinen, head of the President's
Council on Year 2000 Conversion. Edward Yardeni, a famous Wall
Street alarmist, suggested that ``alarm bells ringing over the past
few years'' persuaded the world to get its Y2K act together.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings to mind a very old joke:
</P>
<P>
   Why are you beating your head against the wall?
</P>
<P>
   To scare away the elephants.
</P>
<P>
   There are no elephants around here.
</P>
<P>
   See! It works.
</P>
<P>
   Personal all in favor of erring on the side of caution,
even when I'm worried about being played for a sucker. This is
basically the same feeling I get when a mechanic announces that the
car is in desperate need of new ball joints.
</P>
<P>
   We know the Y2K threat was not fiction because things did
happen. A guy in upstate New York got billed $91,250 for a late
video because the store's computer thought he'd kept the movie out
for 100 years, and employees at another store had to fill out their
rental slips by hand when the computers crashed. If business
executives had not been so diligent, heaven knows how many other
video rental crises we might have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, Skandiabank reported that several hundred clients had
been unable to check their bank accounts on the Internet over the
weekend. Our Government Services Administration reported that a
frozen security system left all the doors open on an unoccupied
building in Omaha. Bartenders in Greece had trouble getting their
cash registers to work.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gribben, a spokesman for the President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, said the problems that had popped up involved
either ``systems that weren't fixed'' or ``systems that were fixed,
which the organization tested and thought was compliant, but which
nonetheless had a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected that,'' he added.

   MOZDOK, Russia _ Fighting is raging in the streets of Chechnya's
capital, but some stories have a happy ending. Viktor Dolgalyov
ought to know. He was a kidnap victim in Chechnya, and the
ferocious Russian assault on Grozny led to his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kidnapped in September and locked away in a cellar in
the city until last week,'' he said Monday, still seemingly a bit
stunned by the abrupt turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   As international criticism of Russia's military tactics in
Chechnya has increased, Russians have responded by citing the
problem of kidnappin insisting it is doing battle against
``bandits'' and ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Dolgalyov was Exhibit A in the Russian public relations
campaign. He was made available by officials of the Russian
government to a small group of reporters at the Russian air base
here, a sprawling compound northwest of Chechnya where Russian
warplanes and helicopters take off on their missions.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappings have indeed been a major hazard in southern Russia _
and a major business for many of the lawless gangs that have roamehnya and the region. More than 800 people have been kidnapped
in the last few years, often by armed bands that left Chechnya in
search of captives and then hauled their victims back to the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Many journalists had stopped going to the region before the
latest war broke out, for fear of becoming another kidnap victim.
And a group of British communications workers were beheaded by one
gang after efforts to free them failed.
</P>
<P>
   The captives also include Maj. Gen. Gennady Shpigun, the Russian
Interior Ministry's senior representative to Chechnya, who was
abducted in March. Sergei Stepashin, Russia's prime minister at the
time, vowed to track down the culprits and free the officer, but it
is believed that he is still being held at an undisclosed location
in C.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappings were not the only sign of the lawlessness that
infected Chechnya. Gangs seized oil wells or tapped into the oil
pipeline and stole fuel. Russian authorities estimate that
thousands of cars have been stolen from regions throughout Russia
and taken to Chechnya. The authorities are mounting a campaign to
track down the missing vehicles in the Russian-controlled regions
of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Dolgalyov, however, was more fortunate than most kidnap victims,
probably because he did not have a high-ranking position and maybe
because he was plain lucky.
</P>
<P>
   While he was locked away in a dark cement basement, his captors
sometimes amused themselves by playing a came they called the
``wheel of fortune.'' They fired their automatic weapons into the
basement to see which of their captives managed to find a safe
corner and survive.
</P>
<P>
   Dolgalyov, 44, was born in Mozdok, just over the Chechen border
that is the home to a major Russian air base located amid acres of
farm land. Dolgalyov had worked as the director of a local
agricultural trading company, and had a good connection in Chechnya
who was close to the local government. In September, he negotiated
an agreement to export scrap metal from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Dolgalyov drove from Mozdok into Chechnya on September 3 _ just
several weeks before the Russians began their military campaign
against the Chechen militants _ to sign the contract. But he had
barely entered the republic when his car was surrounded by a gang
of armed men and he was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I later found out that they knew I was coming and were waiting
for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolgalyov said his abductors were a gang from the neighboring
republic of Ingushetia that had fought on the Chechen side in the
1994-1996 war and later went into the kidnapping business. The gang
called Dolgalyov's wife and two sons and demanded a $2-million
ransom. When Dolgalyov's family did not pay, the kidnappers reduced
their demand to $200,000, still a princely sum for most Russians.
</P>
<P>
   To elude detection, the kidnappers moved Dolgalyov to
Achkhoi-Martan, a city in western Chechnya and then to several
locations in Grozny, the capital city, eventually ending up in a
cellar near the city center.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely had enough to eat and lost so much weight that his
clothes do not fit.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological pressure, however, was worse. After the
Russian military campaign started, Dolgalyov said that his captors
tried to exchange him for Chechen prisoners. And if the Russians
refused, they hinted, they would kill him and sell his kidneys to
patients who needed an organ transplant.
</P>
<P>
   As his ordeal continued, the Russians mounted their military
campaign against Islamic rebels. The Russian bombardment of Grozny
has jeopardized thousands of civilians. The rebels have yet to be
destroyed, though both sides have suffered serious losses.
</P>
<P>
   As a thick fog settled on Chechnya Monday night, a group of 30
militants tried to break out of the encircled city, sparking a
firefight in the small settlement of Krasnopartizansky, a few miles
southwest of Grozny, according to Col. Vasily Chirman, the deputy
chief of operations of the Russian troops in the Caucasus. Each
side claims to have come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal fighting, however, has sometimes led to the release
of some of the kidnap victims as kidnapers have abandoned their
captives. Others have come up against Russian troops and police,
who have been moving house to house within the city, searching for
militants, caches of arms and kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run across hostages practically every day,'' said Maj. Gen.
Vladimir Pronin, the senior commander of the Russian Interior
Ministry troops fighting in Chechnya. ``They are not only Russians.
We have freed Armenians and Ukrainians. We found them as we were
mopping up the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolgalyov does not exactly knoaved him, but he believes
his rescuers were from a Russian Interior Ministry unit set up to
fight organized crime that had been tipped off to his whereabouts.
He was sitting in his basement prison when the door suddenly opened
and he was told to go outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was December 26,'' he said Monday. ``I heard a voice say,
`Viktor. It's time to go.'''

TREASURY PRICES FALL AS FEARS OF RATE INCREASE RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices fell sharply Monday on the first
trading day of the new year. As investor fears about the Year 2000
problem eased, they were replaced with a new one: that the Federal
Reserve will begin raising interest rates aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds came under pressure early, falling victim to the selling
of issues bought as a safe haven before the changeover to 2000,
sending yields to their highest levels in more than two years.
Yields inched higher when the National Association of Purchasing
Management's index of factory activity showed it had expanded for
the 11th month in a row, and an index of prices paid by
manufacturers rose.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond posted its biggest decline since
May, dropping 1 23/32, to 93 20/32, while its yield, which moves in
the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.62 percent from
6.48 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's purchasing report provided more evidence of a strong
economy and raises concern that the Fed, which meets next month,
will increase short-term rates to keep the economy's nine-year
expansion from causing inflation to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at
Banc One Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, said that the
overall fundamental issues regarding the economy were still fine
and that consumer confidence remained high for the right reasons.
That indicates continued economic growth of more than 4 percent in
the first quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donne said he thought the Fed had been holding back on raising
rates in case any year 2000 problems emerged. But with the smooth
transition, companies will continue strong capital spending in
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market appears to be en route to pricing a 50-basis point
move by the Fed in the first quarter,'' Donne said. ``Some futures
market participants feel it will come in two 25-basis point moves,
while others think it could happen in one step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, people expect that the Fed will begin to take back all
that extra liquidity it provided the market in anticipation of the
millennium turn in the fourth quarter,'' he added. ``And just as
they provided that liquidity gradually they will likely withdraw it
slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was improved global economic performance, Donne
said. That will make non-U.S. assets more appealing than they have
been recently. Monday, the dollar fell against the euro and the
Japanese yen, which Donne said produced a more balanced
distribution of global investment dollars. That kept many foreign
investors from buying U.S. securities.
</P>
<P>
   The market is now waiting for employment numbers on Friday, with
many market watchers expecting the average number of jobs added to
the economy at 240,000. The 12-month moving average has been just
more than 225,000 a month, an indication of strong economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pyschologically, last year was not a good year for bonds in
the face of the strong stock market. Asset allocations could be a
factor now,'' Donne said.

 &HT;    Book addresses women's needs according to age group
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At age 16, Judith Reichman first experienced the
medical lie, ``Relax, this won't hurt,'' during her first pelvic
exam from a male family internist. Now, 38 years later, and, after
having spent half her lifetime as a gynecologist examining,
listening to and advising women, Dr. Reichman named her third book,
``Relax, This Won't Hurt: Painless Answers to Women's Most Pressing
Health Needs'' (William Morrow, $24).
</P>
<P>
   It reviews women's health and changing bodies through each
decade from the teens to 70 and beyond. Reichman terms it a
``user-friendly guide'' complete with tips for staying healthy and
a list of recommended screening tests for each decade. She's also
the author of ``I'm Not in the Mood: What Every Woman Should Know
About Improving Her Libido,'' and ``I'm Too Young To Get Old:
Health Care for Women After Forty.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichman frequently appears on NBC's ``Today'' reporting on
women's health issues, and she'll be off on a book tour this month.
However, Reichman insists her practice at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles remains her top career priority. Married with
two adult daughters, Reichman, 54, knows firsthand the traumatic
decisions women face regarding their health; she recently had both
breasts removed and reconstructed because of abnormal overgrowth in
breast duct cells that turned out to be noncancerous. Reichman
spoke by telephone for this interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your new book, you call the age of the 40s a woman's
``most negotiable decade.'' What do you mean by that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 40s are a time when we need to really sit up and pay
attention to our health. It's the time of wake-up calls with
perimenopause since the average age of menopause is 51. The changes
in the reproductive system are fairly significant. And weight
becomes a bigger issue because we can't get by with eating what we
used to eat and not gain weight. Women also tend to diminish
exercise in this age group.
</P>
<P>
   The woes in our 60s and 70s often start in our 40s, such as
weight gain leading to Type 2 diabetes, coronary vascular disease
and osteoarthritis. Twenty percent of women in their 40s also
develop gallstones or gallbladder inflammation, whereas only 8
percent of men do in the same age group. The decade of their 40s is
when women need to become aware and negotiate change in their
health patterns. It's not too late by then and new habits can
really make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A slow, steady gain of weight seems to be inevitable with
women in menopause or following surgical removal of the ovaries.
Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: As we lose estrogen, changes occur in our weight gain
pattern. The gain becomes more like male-patterned obesity _ with a
pot belly. However, women on estrogen replacement often say, `I got
fat because I took estrogen.' But it's not the ERT, (estrogen
replacement therapy) it's the menopause. There is an average 3-to-5
pound increase in the first few years of estrogen deprivation,
regardless of whether or not you take ERT.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You stirred up some controversy with your ``I'm Not in the
Mood'' book because of your solution _ giving women with low libido
the male hormone, testosterone, particularly in ointment form.
</P>
<P>
   A: A woman's libido can be affected at any age and with
different estrogen fluctuations. For some women, the change can
create a real calamity. They just don't have any libido. It's
affecting them and their marriage and the sense of who they are.
Adding a very small amount of testosterone to their system can
dramatically help. But it's not a hormone I throw at anyone. Their
testosterone levels need to be checked before I consider
supplementing. There's only a pill, Estratest, made by a
pharmaceutical company, but I prefer other forms of testosterone
available in lower doses, such as lozenges, cream, ointments. But
these have to mixed up by compounding pharmacies with a doctor's
prescription. (Call the International Association of Compounding
Pharmacies at 1-800-927-4227 for Atlanta area locations.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your book ends with a genetics lesson, and the importance of
women knowing their family health history. Also, for the first
time, you disclose how your own family history fed into your
decision to undergo a prophylactic mastectomy. Did you undergo
genetic testing for the breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2?
</P>
<P>
   A: The genetic tests were negative. However, my mother developed
breast cancer at age 47 and underwent a mastectomy. She's doing
just fine now at age 75. As a physician, I always take a very
complete family history with my patients. Nowhere can I get a
better sense of their fhan from taking a look at their
first-degree relatives, who share with us 50 percent of our genes.
It's a wonderful mirror and it allows me to be a brilliant
fortune-teller. My own decision was based on that and the results
of a Mammotome biopsy. (No early cancer was subsequently found in
either breast, Reichman writes in her book. She estimates removing
her breasts reduced a 35 percent to 40 percent risk of developing
invasive cancer in the next five to 10 years to a ``negligible
one.'')
</P>
<P>
   Q: No doubt, it was one of the hardest personal decisions you've
ever made?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but we all make tough decisions about our health
everyday. If you think about it, living is making a health
decision. But this book is not a personal book or breast-health
book. I've tried to address the most frequently-asked questions
I've heard over the years and the ones patients are too embarrassed
to ask about _ aging, skin, sex.

 &HT;    INTERNET SITE OF THE WEEK
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of cyber-innovations, and you're likely to imagine junk
food-fueled 20-somethings writing code in garage-based startup
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. Sometimes the Internet can surprise you; sometimes
innovative presentation and trustworthy content come from the old
reliables.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, www.healthfinder.gov. A project of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, the 2-year-old
consumer-health gateway provides both consumer-friendly health
information and access to additional sources of data such as
medical journals and databases. The site is both reliable and
popular: In each of its years of operation, it has registered an
average 2 million visits.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the site expanded its accessibility, in a way that is
sorely needed on the Net. It has translated the majority of its
content into Spanish, making it accessible to the millions of
Americans for whom English is not a first language.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the basics, Healthfinder En Espanol
(www.healthfinder.com/justforyou/espanol
</P>
<P>
   /default.htm) addresses important concerns for Latino readers
who may be economically disadvantaged and thus lack access to
complete health care. Articles about cancer, diabetes and infant
mortality top the list.

 &HT;    Setting off fireworks for the nonevent of Y2K
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time ($3.95) and Newsweek ($3.95) each published commemorative
issues for the new century this week with reports on the
noneventful Y2K issue along with colorful photo spreads of
worldwide New Year's celebrations. Time's pictures are more
spectacular, with a dramatic three-page foldout of Russell Goomes
and his granddaughter Shontelle holding hands and watching the
year's first dawn in New Zealand's Chatham Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, however, has a compelling article on self-help gurus
such as Anthony Robbins, Steven Covey and John Gray and Americans'
obsession with improving themselves. More than $563 million worth
of self-help books are sold each year, and millions more are spent
on seminars. According to Newsweek reporter Daniel McGinn, the
biggest consumers are female baby boomers who feel something is
missing in their lives. People who used to go to their priests or
pastors for guidance, McGinn says, are now reading ``Chicken Soup
for the Soul'' or signing up for Robbins' $6,995, weeklong ``Life
Mastery'' course.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mixed bag: This week's New Yorker ($3) is an eclectic
collection of finely crafted articles, including author Bobbie Ann
Mason's report on the safety problems at a nuclear plant in
Paducah, Ky., Pete Hamill's profile of pulp fiction master Ed
McBain and Malcolm Gladwell's analysis of several books on early
childhood. In a thought-provoking essay, Gladwell questions the new
theory supported by Hillary Rodham Clinton and a number of experts
that the first three years of a child's life determine how he or
she will turn out. Comparing the new theory to the genetic
determinism espoused in ``The Bell Curve,'' Gladwell asserts that
``an ideology that holds that your future is largely decided at
birth by your parents' genes is no more dispiriting than one that
holds that your future might be decided at three by your parents'
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   _ High-tech: Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) talks with Bill Gates
about the future of Microsoft and the convergence of technology and
entertainment. Gates foresees a future with digital music instead
of CDs, customized TV access and expanded online shopping where you
can simply share your Christmas list with all your friends. That
way, Gates says, ``if somebody's going to take something off your
list, other people know and you don't get three or four of the same
things.''
</P>
<P>
   _ More than smoke: Cigar sales are down, according to the latest
figures, but Cigar Aficionado ($4.95) doesn't seem to be hurting.
The 226-page February issue is packed with ads. In addition to a
profile of cigar-puffing actor Laurence Fishburne, the magazine
offers provocative columns by political guru Dick Morris on the
upcoming presidential primaries and futurist Faith Popcorn on
changes in the 21st century. Actually, Popcorn says, people are
becoming so afraid of the future they yearn for the security of the
past. That's why, she writes, they secretly wished for a Y2K
disaster that would have made everything stop. Many of Popcorn's
predictions, of course, should be taken with a grain of salt.

BRADLEY, GORE KEEP UP THE BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The duelling Democrats were at it again on
the first official campaign day of the final month before the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   With Bill Bradley and Al Gore scheduled to meet face to face
Wednesday at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, each
candidate began upping the ante Monday, offering a contrast of
leadership style and vision for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bradley declared that the 2000 election is
about the future, and about strengthening the nation by improving
health care, education, ``and our capacity for justice.'' Without
mentioning his opponent by name, he criticized the vice president
for not being willing to do ``big things.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in Davenport, Iowa, Gore took the countervailing approach,
saying America needs good leadership on a range of matters, not
just one or two proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges
is enough. All of them are well within our reach if we believe in
the idea of America, if we trust one another, and if we make good
decisions with good leadership,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   As he usually does, Gore called Bradley ``a good and decent
man,'' but one with poorly thought-out proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that on many ihe has the wrong plans,'' Gore
said. ``And on some critical issues he has no plans...Senator
Bradley seems to believe America can address only one thing at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, described a bolder approach to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need leadership that is prepared to take risks,'' Bradley
said, citing universal access to health insurance, the elimination
of child poverty, adding more new teachers in public schools,
tightening gun control and overhauling campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say we can never achieve our special destiny, but
I say, in a world of new possibilities guided by goodness, we can
and we will,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where anti-Washington sentiment often finds a
receptive audience, Bradley sought to turn Gore's White House
pedigree against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only those who have never left Washington have missed the
lessons of the last decade,'' said Bradley, himself an 18-year
Senate veteran.

MORE FEDERAL JUDGES NEEDED IN BORDER REGIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress must add federal judges to the Houston and
El Paso areas because courts there cannot handle the large and
increasing number of criminal cases brought in those border
regions, Texas' top federal appellate judge said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just in serious need of help,'' said Carolyn Dineen
King, chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans. ``I think when our senators and congressmen look at the
numbers they will support our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures that concern King include a 145 percent rise in the
number of criminal cases filed in the U.S. District Court for
Southern Texas between 1995 and 1999. During that span the number
of judges assigned to the Houston-area court remained constant at
18, she added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the number of criminal cases in the U.S. District
Court for Western Texas rose 181.5 percent between 1995 and 1999.
The number of assigned judges in the El Paso-area court remained
steady at 10, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts.
</P>
<P>
   King's comments followed Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's
New Year's Day call for Congress to add two judges to the federal
court in Southern Texas. Rehnquist said that court faces an
``unmanageable'' trial schedule due to illegal immigration and drug
crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual report on the state of the U.S. judiciary,
Rehnquist said federal courts in Arizona, Southern California and
New Mexico face similarly large criminal dockets and should also be
assigned more judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal courts in U.S. border areas face a crisis in workload
created by an unmanageable number of immigration and drug-related
cases,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice specifically mentioned the U.S. District Court
for Southern Texas as needing additional jurists. The court, which
has 18 judges, sits in Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Galveston,
Houston, Laredo, McAllen and Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 3,387 criminal cases were filed in that court, an 8.1
percent increase from 3,134 in 1998, from the previous year, the
administrative office reported.
</P>
<P>
   King, while praising Rehnquist's call for more federal judges in
the Houston-area, said the federal court in Western Texas also
needs at least two more jurists.
</P>
<P>
   That court, which has 10 judges, sits in Austin, El Paso,
Midland, San Antonio and Waco. Last year, 4,301 cases were filed in
the court, a 14.6 percent increase from 3,753 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   King, who keeps her office in Houston, said Congress has
exacerbated the judicial workload at the Texas-Mexico border.
Lawmakers have beefed up law enforcement in the region to catch
more criminals but have failed to increase the number of judges to
preside over the additional trials, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, has proposed legislation that would add the
sought-after two judges each to the courts in Southern and Western
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure faces opposition from Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, who stated in the panel's end-of-year report on the
U.S. judicial system that ``the federal judiciary is once again
sufficiently staffed and funded to perform its function under ...
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Judicial Conference of the United States, which
Rehnquist heads, is urging Congress to add 58 district court judges
to the current roll of 645 authorized positions. Of those
authorized slots, 42 are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   In his year-end message, Rehnquist also reiterated his call for
Congress to refrain from turning local crimes, such as murder, into
federal offenses. The needless expansion of the U.S. criminal code
further burdens already overworked judges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist and several fellow justices, including Anthony M.
Kennedy and David H. Souter in past years, have urged Congress not
to expand the criminal code to include local offenses. But recent,
highly publicized and especially brutal killings have created
public support for congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the brutal 1998 slayings of James Byrd Jr., a black
man in Jasper, Texas, and Matthew Shepard, a gay University of
Wyoming student, spurred congressional proposals to expand federal
laws that already outlaw attacks based on the victim's race. A
Democratic proposal, which Congress rejected last year, would have
expanded the federal prohibition on ``hate crimes'' to attacks
rooted in hatred toward women, homosexuals and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the spurned congressional legislation, such as
Sens. Charles Schumer, D-New York, and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., say
such national laws reflect the public's disdain for brutal displays
of prejudice. But opponents of federal intervention, such as
Rehnquist, counter that Byrd's and Shepard's attackers were
successfully prosecuted under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 59,923 criminal cases were brought in federal court,
a 4 percent increase from 57,691 in 1998. That increase was
relatively small compared to the 15 percent climb in criminal cases
brought between 1997 and 1998, Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal judiciary were at full strength each district
judge would have on average presided over 93 criminal trials in
1999, compared to 89 the previous year, the chief justice added.
</P>
<P>
   But the average number of cases each judge actually presided
over was significantly higher due to the 42 vacancies.

BELL TO OFFER NEW YORK LONG-DISTANCE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phone giant Bell Atlantic is expected to roll out a flat-rate
calling plan in New York state Tuesday, one with no monthly minimum
fee.
</P>
<P>
   The New York plan appears to reflect a consensus view among Baby
Bells that as they begin to return to the long-distance business,
they can profitably target low-volume long-distance customers who
have been irritated by the $6 and $7 monthly fees AT&AMP;T, MCI, and
Sprint charge as a condition of getting flat-rate calls as cheap as
5 or 7 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Bell Atlantic's
plan will offer New Yorkers long-distance calls for 10 cents a
minute. Bell Atlantic officials would not confirm that, and they
stressed the ``surprise-free'' flat-rate plan is only one of
several they will unveil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to very aggressively offer plans in all market
segments,'' said Bell Atlantic Massachusetts spokesman Jack Hoey.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's World Wide Web site indicated Monday it will
also offer in New York a long-distance calling plan charging 9
cents a minute, and 5 cents on weekends, to people who sign up over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were disappointed that the first foray by a Baby
Bell into the long-distance market since the 1984 AT&AMP;T breakup
could be, as Atlanta telecommunications analyst Jeffrey Kagan put
it, ``a yawner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten cents per minute might be a bit disappointing if consumers
were expecting a long-distance price war,'' Kagan said, adding that
he sees Bell Atlantic wanting to compete to retain customers with a
bundle of services rather than waging a margin-shaving price war.
</P>
<P>
   But others noted that no one is in a better position than Bell
Atlantic to make money going after people who make few toll calls.
The company is already carrying the biggest expense _ maintaining
accounts and sending bills _ and because actual call completion is
now so cheap, getting another $3 or $4 a month from millions of
low-volume customers can be mostly gravy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already got the billing relationship, and that's where
all the cost is,'' said telecommunications analyst Fred Voit of
Yankee Group in Boston. ``AT&AMP;T and MCI are going to be delighted to
lose customers who spend $3 or $4 a month. If they could send a
list of those customers to Bell Atlantic and say `Take them,' they
would.''
</P>
<P>
   Voit also said he thinks ``all Bell Atlantic has to do is come
out and say `We've got long distance,' and their phones are going
to be ringing off the hook. I don't think they have to come out
with killer prices. Ten cents is a very good price, especially
without a fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoey said Bell Atlantic thinks it can hope to get 25 to 30
percent of Massachusetts' long-distance market within five years.
``We think that's realistic given that we have a strong existing
relationship with the customer that will allow us to go after what
some people call the lower end of the long-distance market,'' Hoey
said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which is fighting in court to block Bell Atlantic from the
New York long-distance market, already offers a 10-cents-per-minute
plan with no monthly fee to people who sign up over the Internet
and pay by credit card.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, AT&AMP;T has drawn more than 60,000 customers already
with a ``Local One Rate New York'' plan that charges $24.90 a month
for 75 hours of local calling, 7 cents per minute interstate long
distance and 5 cents for in-state toll calls, spokesman Gary
Morgenstern said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Corp., the Texas-based Baby Bell that plans to offer local
service in Eastern Massachusetts as soon as this fall, has
indicated its offerings will include a similar no-monthly-fee
long-distance calling plan and perhaps a fixed-fee ``all you can
eat'' calling plan for residential customers.

<P>
   A growing portion of corporate America appears to be concluding
that dividends are no longer needed to attract investors and are
therefore an unnecessary cost of doing business. Fewer companies
are raising dividends, and more and more major companies do not
bother to pay them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Dividends used to be a virtual requirement to convince investors
that a company was successful and worthy of investment. Some
institutional investors were barred from buying stocks that did not
pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for the first time in recent history _ and probably the
first time since the Depression _ a quarter of the value of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks comes from companies that do
not pay dividends. Two decades ago, only 2 percent of the value of
the index came from such companies.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, a company in the S&AMP;P 500 that did not pay a
dividend probably had been forced to stop doing so because of
financial problems. These days, however, dividends are out of
favor, and it is the hottest companies that don't pay them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, stocks were considered riskier than other asset
classes, so they had to pay dividends,'' said Arnold Kaufman, the
editor of the Outlook newsletter published by Standard &AMP; Poor's.
But now, he said, investors see stocks as less risky, and thus do
not demand such protection.
</P>
<P>
   While 402 of the 500 stocks in the index did pay dividends last
year, only one of the top 15 performers, and 14 of the top 50, did
so. Of the 14 that paid dividends, only one _ Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter _ is paying out at least 1 percent of its share value. Since
the company's share price doubled last year, that payout obviously
made up a very small portion of the shareholder return.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 that are not paying
dividends are successful technology companies that have profits,
not hot Internet start-ups. The five largest nondividend payers in
the S&AMP;P _ Microsoft, Cisco, America Online, Oracle and MCI WorldCom
_ are all profitable.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1997, 90 percent of the value of the index came
from companies that paid dividends. But that fell to 85.2 percent
in 1998 and to 74.8 percent last year, said Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the decline reflects the fact that S&AMP;P has been
more willing to add technology stocks that do not pay dividends to
the index. But it also reflects an investor attitude that puts
little pressure on companies to make payouts. While companies can
still be penalized for reducing or eliminating dividends, they get
little credit for introducing or raising dividends.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most companies still pay dividends, and many raise
their payouts every year. But the trend is unmistakable. Standard &AMP;
Poor's reported Monday that 1,701 dividend increases were reported
by American companies last year, or 16.9 percent fewer than in
1998. There were smaller declines in 1997 and 1998 as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a sharp decline of 15 percent or more in the number
of companies with dividend increases usually came during
recessions, when many companies were financially strapped. But the
latest downtrend has come as the economy has boomed. The only
similar trend occurred in the late 1960s, another time that small
technology companies were all the rage and the market for new
issues was red hot. Some of the hot issues of that era, such as
Electronic Data Systems, became successful companies, but most did
not.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of reasons are given for the trend away from
dividends, including the tax disadvantages. Dividends are taxable
to investors as ordinary income but are not deductible from
corporate income, and thus face double taxation. But that has
always been true, and the effect presumably should have been
greater two decades ago, when tax rates were much higher. Some
companies say they instead return money to shareholders by
repurchasing shares, allowing the sellers to pay lower capital
gains tax rates on the money. But in many cases those purchases
only offset the shares being issued to employees who exercise
options.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that corporate officials are far more likely
than in the past to have a large part of their wealth in stock
options. Such options become more valuable as the stock price
rises, but do not benefit from dividend payments, arguably
providing an incentive to companies not to pay dividends. Moreover,
if a company runs into a cash squeeze, cutting back on its share
repurchases is far less obvious than reducing its dividend.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely explanation, however, would seem to be the most
obvious. Investors, after seeing year after year of huge capital
gains, no longer see much of a need for dividends as an assured
return if the market declines.
</P>
<P>
   The best performing stock in the S&AMP;P 500 to pay a dividend last
year was Nortel Networks, which ranked fifth in performance with a
gain of 304 percent. It last raised its dividend in 1997, when its
stock price was one-fifth of today's level. At its current payout
rate of 3.75 cents a quarter, Nortel stock yields 0.15 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward lower dividends can be seen in the overall
dividend yield on the S&AMP;P 500. Once it was a rule of thumb that
caution was warranted if stock prices rose so high that the
dividend yield fell below 3 percent. At the height in 1987, before
that year's crash, the yield had fallen below 2.65 percent, then a
record low yield.
</P>
<P>
   But the yield on the S&AMP;P 500 last year, based on payouts by the
companies during the year and the year-end level of the index, came
to just 1.14 percent, down from 1.32 percent in 1998 and 1.6
percent in 1997. The rate has been below 3 percent since 1991, as
the stock market recorded its best decade ever.

EX-FBI-AGENT, MOB FIGURE APPEAR AS CODEFENDANTS

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For decades they appeared to be on opposite sides, one
a notorious gangster, the other a decorated FBI agent. One an FBI
informant, the other his longtime handler.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi and retired FBI
Special Agent John J. Connolly Jr. came together in US District
Court in Boston as codefendants in a federal racketeering case.
</P>
<P>
   As federal marshals removed handcuffs from Flemmi's wrists,
Connolly jumped to his feet and walked to the other end of the
defense table to shake Flemmi's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, 65, dressed in a navy and white jogging suit, and
Connolly, 59, wearing a dark suit, crisp white shirt and tie,
chatted briefly, then Connolly returned to his seat alongside his
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Missing was the third defendant in the case, South Boston crime
boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger, also one of Connolly's prized
informants, who has been a fugitive since a warrant was issued for
his arrest five years ago today (Jan. 4) in another racketeering
case.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, Flemmi and Bulger were charged three days before
Christmas in a federal racketeering indictment that alleges that
Connolly protected them from prosecution and tipped them to the
earlier indictment five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation should have been dubbed, if it wasn't
already, Operation Scapegoat,'' said Boston attorney R. Robert
Popeo, who represents Connolly. ``They have rewritten history.''
</P>
<P>
   Popeo insists Connolly's handling of Bulger and Flemmi was
overseen and authorized by his FBI superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before US Magistrate Judge Robert Collings lasted
less than 30 minutes. Connolly had pleaded not guilty to
racketeering and obstruction of justice charges at his arraignment
Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Collings postponed Flemmi's scheduled arraignment after his
longtime lawyer, Kenneth Fishman, announced he wouldn't be
available to represent him in the new racketeering case. Collings
said he'll allow Flemmi, who is indigent, time to find a
court-appointed lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman told reporters that he can't take on the new case
involving Flemmi because of the ``tremendous time commitment''
required by the five-year-old racketeering case involving Flemmi
that has yet to go to trial before US District Judge Mark L. Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   And Fishman wasn't the only one claiming that he doesn't have
enough time to handle the new case.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who was randomly assigned to preside over the
Connolly-Bulger-Flemmi case, recused himself, citing a heavy
caseload, including the 1995 racketeering case.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had been poised to seek the removal of Wolf, who
had concluded in a 661-page decision last September that Connolly
had committed numerous crimes to protect Bulger and Flemmi --
including tipping the pair on the eve of the 1995 indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's order followed hearings throughout 1998 that exposed the
FBI's cozy relationship between Bulger and Flemmi from 1975 through
1995. Wolf refused to dismiss the indictment against Flemmi, who
claimed the FBI promised him immunity from prosecution in exhange
for providing information about local Mafia leaders. But Wolf has
ordered more hearings in that case.

 &HT;    Georgia residents in the money, win Big Game jackpot
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A ``good life'' got richer for Katheryn and Paul Lowry
of Norcross, Ga., on Monday. The couple walked out of the Georgia
Lottery offices in downtown Atlanta with a $14.8 million check.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowrys won a $46 million Big Game jackpot just after 11 p.m.
on New Year's Eve, two days after their 10th wedding anniversary.
The jackpot was the fifth largest in Georgia Lottery history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to retire a year early and start making some plans
for us and the kids,'' said Katheryn Lowry, a 61-year-old loan
processor who bought the winning ticket from a Racetrac gas station
in Gwinnett County. ``I'd like to buy a lot in Michigan on a lake _
put up a summer home some place that we can go to fish and just
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lowrys, who won on a ``quik pic'' ticket, chose to be paid
all at once instead of over 30 years, whittling their win to more
than $22.4 million. They paid $7.6 million in state and local
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Katheryn Lowry plans to quit work, she and Paul, 71,
won't give up the three-bedroom, two-bathroom home that they bought
new more than three years ago for $154,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during an afternoon press conference how the money would
change their lives, 71-year-old retiree Paul Lowry leaned on his
cane and choked back tears: ``We already have a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lowry, who was forced into retirement from General Motors
10 years ago after a stroke, said the money will provide
higher-priced physical therapy to continue his recovery. He also
wants a pontoon boat for the Michigan log cabin the Lowry's will
build. Parents of six children between them, they intend to set up
college funds for their 16 grandchildren and several
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowry's watched the television drawing Friday night as their
winning numbers _ 4, 17, 32, 38, 46 and Big Game ball 26 _ were
chosen. They passed the ticket back and forth in disbelief. After a
fruit and toast breakfast Monday at home and a chat later with a
banker, the couple made it downtown to claim their prize after
lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Said Katheryn: ``We've been kind of relaxed about it.''

HANCOCK TO SPONSOR MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL FOR FIVE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. signed a
five-year sponsorship agreement with Major League Baseball Monday
that sources said is worth at least $10 million and probably much
more.
</P>
<P>
   The move extends a one-year contract that Hancock had in
connection with the 1999 MLB All-Star Game at Fenway Park and puts
the Boston-based insurance giant in the company of Adidas,
FleetBoston Financial Group, Gillette, Gulden's mustard,
MasterCard, Pepsi-Cola, and Ritz crackers, also Major League
Baseball sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   One source familiar with the Hancock-MLB negotiations said the
deal could be worth $35 million, but Hancock spokesman Steve Burgay
disputed that. ``In terms of what we are paying Major League
Baseball, that is wildly, wildly inaccurate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual number, the contract was seen within the
close-knit world of sports marketing as record-setting for a Major
League Baseball sponsorship, both in the dollar amount and in its
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Fleet Financial Group was reported to have paid
between $4 million and $6 million last April in a Major League
Baseball deal that extends into 2001, with an option to renew for
one additional year.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, which also sponsors the Boston Marathon, the Olympics,
and college sports events, said it's sure it will get its money's
worth during the 162-game season, played out in 30 venues from
coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we continue to expand our product and distribution lines in
the financial services business, Major League Baseball will be a
partner, a differentiator, and a way for us to sell,'' Hancock's
president, David F. D'Alessandro, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's ability to capitalize on such deals is respected in
the sports industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are among the companies that know how to make
sponsorships work well,'' said Sean Brenner, an editor at IEG
Sponsorship Report in Chicago. ``D'Allesandro and Hancock have a
lot of experience at this.''
</P>
<P>
   And the John Hancock brand is expected to help Major League
Baseball further regain stature lost during a 1994 labor dispute
between players and team owners that led to an abbreviated season
and cancellation of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``By their partnering with us they are telling their customers
something about the importance of our property,'' said Timothy J.
Brosnan, senior vice president for Major League Baseball
Properties.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, signed last week, makes Hancock Major League
Baseball's 18th ``official sponsor,'' a number that some say
approaches the limit of what fans can tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All professional sports have suffered somewhat in what
consumers see as overcommrcialism,'' said Jed Pearsall, of
Performance Research Inc. in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's long-term affiliation with professional baseball comes
as the company converts from mutual ownership by its policyholders
and races toward an initial public stock offering that could raise
$2.6 billion to finance further marketing efforts and growth. That
offering is scheduled for Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Baseball agreement certifies Hancock as an
exclusive sponsor in a broad ``financial services'' category that
ranges from pension management to long-term care insurance,
investments, and a portfolio of stock and bond mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, this blocks others in similar fields _ for example,
Fidelity Investments, Merrill Lynch, or Prudential Life Insurance _
from also winning sponsorship agreements with Major League
Baseball. Such competitors remain free, however, to bid for local
sponsor rights, as Coca-Cola has done in Atlanta in spite of a
nationwide agreement between MLB and Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock may seek team-by-team local agreements to augment its
MLB sponsorship pact, Burgay said, pointing out that John Hancock
is already an official sponsor of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   About the only subcategories not included in the Hancock-MLB
sponsorship agreement are retail banking, held by Fleet, and credit
cards, shared by MBNA Financial and MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the ability to display its name prominently in
connection with games, playoffs, the All-Star Game, and the World
Series, Hancock also gains priority in obtaining tickets for its
employees and clients and in recruiting ballplayers to endorse
insurance plans, mutual funds, and other investment instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific marketing platform for us,'' Burgay said.
``Baseball demographics tend to cut fairly broadly, but as you get
closer to the playoffs it gets to be more upscale.''

PUTIN BOOSTS RUSSIAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There was a time when news of Boris N. Yeltsin's
resignation would have send stocks tumbling. But when Russia's
mercurial president abruptly left office on New Year's Eve, handing
power over to Vladimir V. Putin, the opposite happened: the markets
soared.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's long-stagnant stock market rose by more than 19 percent
on the news of Yeltsin's resignation, while Russian stocks trading
on foreign exchanges also posted significant gains.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a steely and straight-talking former KGB officer who is
now Russia's acting president, seems to provide what investors want
most: stability. After a decade of uncertainty under Yeltsin's
erratic rule, investors and financial analysts say Russia will now
become a more predictable place to do business with Putin in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am cautiously optimistic that we will see improvements in
the business climate. There will be more stability than under
Yeltsin,'' said Margot Jacobs, strategist for the United Financial
Group, a Moscow investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs added that she expects Putin to be a more hands-on leader
than Yeltsin, who left the day-to-day business of government to his
aides and bickering Cabinet ministers. ``I expect Putin to be more
accessible and this breeds stability and confidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But while financial analysts are upbeat about the prospects for
stability under Putin, few expect the new Kremlin leader to attack
the rampant corruption and cronyism that have plagued Russia for
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the real business climate, as opposed to the stock
market which is driven by expectations, we are probably looking at
a continuation of the status quo. Things won't get much worse
because they can't get much worse,'' said Leonid Bershidsky, editor
of Vedomosti, a daily Russian business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his second term, the ailing Yeltsin was an absentee
president prone to odd behavior and frequent shifts in policy. When
he appeared at the Kremlin after long periods of convalescence at
his country residence, it was often to fire his government _ which
he did four times during his last two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as a small group of tycoons, known here as ``the
oligarchs,'' used their Kremlin connections to build fortunes,
fledgling Russian entrepreneurs and foreign investors were
suffocated by a corrupt and arbitrary bureaucracy. Left at the
mercy of bribe-seeking bureaucrats, a punitive tax system, and
courts that could not or would not enforce contracts and property
rights, investors have fled Russia in droves.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent statement, Putin pledged to reform Russia's bloated
civil service, instill ``discipline'' in government, and fight
corruption. Nevertheless, many remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say that to improve Russia's business climate and
attract investment, Putin also needs to lower taxes and simplify
the country's arcane tax system, protect property rights, and
strengthen the judiciary so it can enforce contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is not some anticorruption crusader and he isn't
somebody who understands that taxes need to be lowered, Bershidsky
said. ``As prime minister he has done nothing about corruption and
he has actually raised several taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is commonly believed that corruption in Russia stems from
the very top and in this sense we need to wait and see. A lot
depends on where Putin's power base is,'' Jacobs said, adding that
Putin's relations with Russia's politically connected os is
still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, say Putin has no choice but to tackle corruption.
If he doesn't sooner or later the country will face economic
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling corruption and making Russia's opaque public finances
more straightforward would also help Moscow obtain badly needed
Western credits. Disbursement of a $640 million loan installment
from the International Monetary Fund has been held up since
September. The IMF has said Russia has yet to implement the fiscal
reforms required for the loan to be released. The delay, however,
came right after a money laundering scandal in which as much as $15
billion in pilfered Russian funds was alleged to have been diverted
through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia suffers from a lack of transparency, which is another
way of saying that people are stealing like crazy,'' said George
Friedman, chairman of Stratfor Inc., a political and financial
consulting firm located in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia also suffers from a shortage of capital. Right now
nothing is good for business in Russia because a dollar invested
there is a dollar lost. If Putin can introduce some accountability
this would improve the business climate, but there are powerful
interests that will oppose that accountability,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, however, that Putin was uniquely qualified to
tackle Russia's corruption problem. A KGB spy in East Germany in
the 1980s, Putin was responsible for facilitating Western
investment to revive the ailing Soviet economy. Later, as deputy
mayor of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, Putin was
the point man on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Putin's experience has been probusiness. He understands
the psychology of Western investors and he knows what they need,''
Friedman said. ``Putin also knows that nobody is going to invest in
Russia unless he gets corruption under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some here say that the stock market's positive reaction to
Putin's ascent to power was more due to relief that Yeltsin left
the Kremlin without major upheaval than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been nervous that the end of Yeltsin's presidency
_ his second and final term was scheduled to end in June _ would be
anything but smooth. Many here feared Yeltsin would either try to
cancel elections and stay in power, creating a political crisis; or
that opposition forces would win the Kremlin and initiate reprisals
against the old regime and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   But now Putin, who enjoys a startling 70 percent popularity
rating, will serve as acting president for three months and is
widely expected to win elections tentatively scheduled for March
26. Russia's much anticipated _ and feared _ transition of power
seems to have passed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors were waiting to see what would happen when Yeltsin's
term ended. There was fear that the end of the Yeltsin era would
lead to instability and this has not happened,'' said Tom Adshead,
a political analyst at Troika-Dialog, a Moscow investment bank.

PUTIN MOVES TO FRESHEN UP KREMLIN REGIME
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting President Vladimir Putin began to put his own
imprint on the Kremlin administration Monday, showing the door to
Tatyana Dyachenko, who wielded considerable influence in the
administration of her father, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also moved aside several other staff members who had been
loyal to Yeltsin. But as one television commentator said Monday
night, the changes amount to a ``freshening up'' of the
administration rather than a revolution inside the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Long vilified by anti-Yeltsin forces as a palace intriguer, Mrs.
Dyachenko, 39, had served as Yeltsin's official image maker since
his re-election campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment effectively ended when Yeltsin resigned on
Friday. On Monday, even before Putin issued a decree removing her,
she was already packing her papers, said Dmitri Yakushkin, who
served as Yeltsin's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, the previous Soviet president, said in an
interview published Monday that Mrs. Dyachenko and other members of
the ``family'' _ as Yeltsin's inner circle was dubbed _ were
responsible for persuading Yeltsin to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to,'' Gorbachev said in an interview published
in the Italian newspaper La Stampa. ``He resisted with all his
might. Essentially they pushed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev was quoted as saying Yeltsin had finally been
convinced that he should quit by doctors who told him that to stay
on as the Russian leader could prove ``fatal.'' Yeltsin had
frequent health problems throughout his years in office, including
multiple bypass heart surgery in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dyachenko, the younger of Yeltsin's two daughters, used her
influence in the Kremlin to control access to her father. She was
an essential figure in a circle that also included Boris
Berezovsky, a financier and media magnate, and Anatoly Chubais,
designer of Russia's privatization program. The two men played
important roles last fall in helping Putin's campaign for this
year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dyachenko's name was mentioned in several financial
scandals that enveloped the Kremlin last summer. She allegedly made
tens of thousands of dollars of purchases on a credit card supplied
to her by a Swiss company that held lucrative Kremlin contracts.
And her husband, Leonid, an oil trader connected to Kremlin-favored
oil companies, was reportedly linked to foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with La Stampa, Gorbachev said that the
architects of Yeltsin's resignation were Mrs. Dyachenko,
Berezovsky, and the Kremlin chief of staff, Alexander Voloshin.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's press secretary, Yakushkin, said in an interview
Monday on a Moscow radio station that Yeltsin made up his own mind
to leave office early and to give Putin, Yeltsin's recently
appointed prime minister and heir apparent, a head-start in the
upcoming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the president listens to opinions, but makes
decisions himself,'' said Yakushkin. ``And this decision was not
discussed in the family circle. Of course, he considers Putin an
ideal choice for Russia's further development. To an extent he felt
that he had become a factor curbing Putin's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin said that Yeltsin would be given office space in one
of the buildings in the Kremlin and was expected to take trips
abroad and within Russia as the country's president emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 5, Yeltsin is to visit Bethlehem, a which had already
been planned. He will celebrate a Russian Orthodox Christmas Eve
service there with Aleksy II, patriarch of the Russian church.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as Yeltsin eases into retirement, spending his ``happiest''
New Year's holiday ever, Yakushkin said, Putin had a full schedule
of official meetings Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He met with the Central Bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, and
with Nikolai Koshman, Moscow's envoy to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also met Monday with Marat Baglai, chairman of the
Constitutional Court. Baglai indicated in remarks afterward that
presidential elections might take place earlier than anticipated,
as the constitution stipulates only that they be held ``within''
three months of the president's resignation. A final date will be
set later this week by Parliament's upper house, Baglai said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a senior aide to Putin said his chances in that
election had been enhanced by Yeltsin's signing of a new law
raising the barrier for challengers in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before he resigned on Friday, Yeltsin signed the extensive
rewrite of election laws, one clause of which requires presidential
candidates to amass 1 million signatures on petitions to gain spots
on an election ballot. The law previously had lowered that barrier
by half, to only 500,000 signatures, in the case of an early
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's first deputy chief of staff, Igor Shabdurasulov,
said the restoration of the 1-million-signature requirement would
make it extremely difficult for Putin's challengers to land a space
on the ballot by the closing of the registration period for the
election, probably in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first decrees, Putin reappointed Voloshin as chief
of staff. But Monday Putin relieved several top aides from their
official positions.
</P>
<P>
   They include Vladimir Makarov, a deputy chief of staff; Vladimir
Shevchenko, director of the Kremlin protocol office, and Valery
Semenchenko, director of the president's chancellery. The last two
have been retained as informal advisers to Putin, said Alexei
Gromov, director of the presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
   A top Kremlin official, quoted tonight by the Interfax news
agency, said that both Shevchenko and Semenchenko would be
transferred to Yeltsin's personal staff, where they would provide
the services ``essential for the first Russian president to keep on
with his active political work and maintain his government role.''
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin, who is expected to take a job as Yeltsin's personal
spokesman, was relieved Monday of his position as presidential
press secretary, and given another job as assistant to Voloshin.

PARCELLS SAYS DECISION MADE WITHOUT PATRIOTS IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells laughed at the thought that he would give up his
coaching career just so the Patriots would not get Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Patriots wanted to do had nothing to do with my
decision to leave coaching _ nothing whatsoever,'' said Parcells.
``I had known pretty much for the last month that I was going to
give up coaching at the end of this season, and Saturday I spoke
with Belichick about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been talking with Belichick all the way along throughout
the season. Saturday morning I met with him and asked him if he
wanted to be the next head coach of the New York Jets. He told me,
`I've been planning on it,' and he said this is the job he wanted.
If he was upset about not having the chance to go to New England,
he's never said anything to me about it. I don't think that's the
case at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, the Patriots sent a fax to Steve Gutman,
president of the Jets, asking permission to speak with Belichick
about becoming head coach and general manager in New England. But
it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had resigned Sunday night, informing Gutman, and under
the terms of a contract that had been signed three years ago,
Belichick automatically went into place as head coach of the Jets.
That preempted the Patriots' attempted strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, the question (of permission) was moot,'' said
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the situation, a league official said, ``This
time, the Jets had the contracts on their side. The last time, they
didn't. The contracts were in New England's favor.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Patriots and Jets got into a major fight over
Parcells. He wanted to leave New England for the Jets after the
Patriots' Super Bowl season. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
intervened, settling the matter by awarding the Patriots four draft
choices in return for giving up their coaching rights to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reported Monday that Belichick was upset because he did not
have the chance to entertain the Patriots' offer.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was not available for comment. However, it seems
highly unlikely that he was upset. First, since the Patriots had no
way of talking to him without violating league rules, Belichick
would have no way of knowing what the New England offer was in
terms of money. Second, he is the general manager of the Jets,
without the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is going to be in complete control of the football side
of the business,'' said Parcells. ``I'm giving him everything that
I had here as a coach. He'll call all the shots. I'm stepping
completely away from the coaching end. I have coached my last game.
I will never coach another football game in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is a Machiavellian conspiracy theory afloat that
Parcells set up the Patriots _ that he arranged it so that the
Patriots would have to give the Jets compensation (i.e. draft
picks) if they want to hire their top candidate, Belichick. And
then, if this transpired, Parcells would return to coaching the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said today that I have coached my last game,'' said
Parcells. ``I will never coach another. That is it. I don't know
where some of you guys come up with some of this stuff, although I
will say it is creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who now has the title of head of football operations,
says he intends to stay on the perimeter of the Jets' front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Bill (Belichick) if he wants me to help in any way I'll

offering any advice. When the new owner shows up here, I'll help
him any way I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``My future is going to be month to month. Each month I'll
evaluate my life and see if I am happy with what I am doing. But
let me say it again: I'll never coach another football game, so
people can start all the rumors they want, and it just isn't going
to happen.''

HANCOCK TO SPONSOR MAJOR LEAGUALL FOR FIVE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. signed a
five-year sponsorship agreement with Major League Baseball Monday
that sources said is worth at least $10 million and probably much
more.
</P>
<P>
   The move extends a one-year contract that Hancock had in
connection with the 1999 MLB All-Star Game at Fenway Park and puts
the Boston-based insurance giant in the company of Adidas,
FleetBoston Financial Group, Gillette, Gulden's mustard,
MasterCard, Pepsi-Cola, and Ritz crackers, also Major League
Baseball sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   One source familiar with the Hancock-MLB negotiations said the
deal could be worth $35 million, but Hancock spokesman Steve Burgay
disputed that. ``In terms of what we are paying Major League
Baseball, that is wildly, wildly inaccurate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual number, the contract was seen within the
close-knit world of sports marketing as record-setting for a Major
League Baseball sponsorship, both in the dollar amount and in its
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Fleet Financial Group was reported to have paid
between $4 million and $6 million last April in a Major League
Baseball deal that extends into 2001, with an option to renew for
one additional year.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, which also sponsors the Boston Marathon, the Olympics,
and college sports events, said it's sure it will get its money's
worth during the 162-game season, played out in 30 venues from
coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we continue to expand our product and distribution lines in
the financial services business, Major League Baseball will be a
partner, a differentiator, and a way for us to sell,'' Hancock's
president, David F. D'Alessandro, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's ability to capitalize on such deals is respected in
the sports industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are among the companies that know how to make
sponsorships work well,'' said Sean Brenner, an editor at IEG
Sponsorship Report in Chicago. ``D'Allesandro and Hancock have a
lot of experience at this.''
</P>
<P>
   And the John Hancock brand is expected to help Major League
Baseball further regain stature lost during a 1994 labor dispute
between players and team owners that led to an abbreviated season
and cancellation of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``By their partnering with us they are telling their customers
something about the importance of our property,'' said Timothy J.
Brosnan, senior vice president for Major League Baseball
Properties.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, signed last week, makes Hancock Major League
Baseball's 18th ``official sponsor,'' a number that some say
approaches the limit of what fans can tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All professional sports have suffered somewhat in what
consumers see as overcommrcialism,'' said Jed Pearsall, of
Performance Research Inc. in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's long-term affiliation with professional baseball comes
as the company converts from mutual ownership by its policyholders
and races toward an initial public stock offering that could raise
$2.6 billion to finance further marketing efforts and growth. That
offering is scheduled for Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Baseball agreement certifies Hancock as an
exclusive sponsor in a broad ``financial services'' category that
ranges from pension management to long-term care insurance,
investments, and a portfolio of stock and bond mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, this blocks others in similar fields _ for example,
Fidelity Investments, Merrill Lynch, or Prudential Life Insurance _
from also winning sponsorship agreements with Major League
Baseball. Such competitors remain free, however, to bid for local
sponsor rights, as Coca-Cola has done in Atlanta in spite of a
nationwide agreement between MLB and Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock may seek team-by-team local agreements to augment its
MLB sponsorship pact, Burgay said, pointing out that John Hancock
is already an official sponsor of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   About the only subcategories not included in the Hancock-MLB
sponsorship agreement are retail banking, held by Fleet, and credit
cards, shared by MBNA Financial and MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the ability to display its name prominently in
connection with games, playoffs, the All-Star Game, and the World
Series, Hancock also gains priority in obtaining tickets for its
employees and clients and in recruiting ballplayers to endorse
insurance plans, mutual funds, and other investment instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific marketing platform for us,'' Burgay said.
``Baseball demographics tend to cut fairly broadly, but as you get
closer to the playoffs it gets to be more upscale.''

`NATURE': SEEING IF A PIGEON CAN TELL A PICASSO FROM A MONET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at the end of the review; check listings
for local times.) 
(HLW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What does it mean to call an animal intelligent? Or
to say that it experiences emotions? Or enjoys the sort of
consciousness that humans claim for themselves? ``Inside the Animal
Mind,'' a three-part ``Nature'' mini-series beginning Tuesday
night, delves into these tantalizing matters through often
ingenious experiments by animal watchers.
</P>
<P>
   We are cautioned early in the first hour that what seems to be a
show of intelligence in, say, a dog, may be just a matter of trial
and error; the dog keeps trying until it gets a reward. But for
some researchers, that doesn't quite explain the ability of a rat
to find its way through a maze that it hasn't previously explored
or of an elephant to find its way to water across a huge desert,
where the chanciness of trial and error would be fatal. Scientists
trace mapping ability to a part of the brain called the
hippocampus, and it seems to work for bird brains, too.
</P>
<P>
   For something closer to the sort of intelligence that humans
call insight, which enables people to come up with novel answers to
novel questions, researchers have turned to the ever useful
chimpanzees. Their use of tools is not so surprising for these
close relatives of humans. But what about the similar talent found
in ravens and crows and dolphins? And how are we to explain the
apparent ability of a pigeon to tell a Picasso from a Monet? (No,
the pigeon doesn't need a master's in art appreciation.)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are divided on what such displays of apparently
innovative intelligence signify, but none of their findings, though
intriguing, come close to the more expansive reaches of human
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   As for animals' emotional life, the subject of next week's
program, we are cautioned not to confuse an animal's facial
expression, which may seem to signify happiness or sadness, with
inner feelings. Instead scientists are concentrating on the brain.
They have been attracted, for example, to a section of the brain
called the amygdala that acts as a sort of panic button to keep its
owner from danger. And what works for humans also seems to work for
so unlikely a relative as the snake. If you're looking for a sex
button, try dopamine, which does wonders for female sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the pleasure and pain experienced by animals is
difficult, but it's a snap compared with probing the mystery of
consciousness, the subject of the final hour. Here speculation
abounds. Friends of the elephant, for example, attribute to that
popular creature an ability to sense the passage of time and even
to mourn the death of a fellow elephant, and the program ends with
a question: ``Could animals comprehend immortality?''
</P>
<P>
   But then, can a human comprehend immortality?

   Q -- My manager works at another site. When he asked if I wanted
his ticket to a seminar he was unable to attend, I said yes. The
next day I found out that he led my co-workers at the other site to
think that he was not at work due to the seminar. Later, when
discussing my merit, he said I deserve an ``exceeds expectations,''
but having missed the deadline for submitting paperwork, he had to
give me a ``meets expectations.'' Seeing I was unhappy with this,
he cited the seminar ticket as a perk he offered exclusively to me
because I am a valued employee. How does this sound to you? L.D.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When it comes to assessing performance, your manager merits
poor ratings in two categories. First, to put it nicely, he is
truth-challenged. Second, having missed the deadline for your
review and then underrating you, he must also be described as
management- challenged. You should address both of these issues.
</P>
<P>
   As for dealing with the truth, once you hear one lie, it is
difficult to know whether anything he has been saying is fact or
fiction. At some point, his lack of honesty is going to create
problems for you and your associates. At such a point, several of
you should meet with him. Tell him that you are confused over what
may have happened and need his help in deciphering it. The idea is
to send a message that you are not going to take his lying behavior
lying down.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of underrating your performance because of his error,
you should tell him that you want written documentation from him
indicating that you deserved the highest rating, and this
documentation should be placed in your file. Frankly, his rationale
for not giving you the highest rating sounds a little fishy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I responded to an ad by sending a cover letter and my
resume. I received a letter back saying that in order to receive
further consideration, I needed to provide letters from my previous
employers verifying my experience, and proof of authorization to
work in the United States. Is this as unusual as I think it is?
S.D.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Asking for this information is not unusual, but asking for
it before having any significant contact with an applicant is
highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Employers have a right to know about an applicant's legal right
to work in the United States, as well as a right to verify previous
work experience. However, it makes more sense for an employer to
advise the applicant at the outset that an offer of employment will
be contingent upon verification of work experience and proof of his
legal right to work in the United States. Applicants who cannot
provide such information tend to eliminate themselves at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is easier for the applicants, and it prevents
their having to bother previous employers unnecessarily. Previous
employers should be asked for such references only as one of the
final points in the screening process.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tight labor market, and most employers today are
trying to treat applicants professionally and comfortably. When
employers do unusual things during the hiring process, it is
unusual for the better applicants to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I work at a company in a position that I love, and my
superiors are just wonderful. I work alone, but the problem is the
co-workers. Some of them play games and say things to me that are
hurtful, and others just ignore me. I talk to my co-workers, but I
don't get very far. I would like to get along better. What should I
do? T.W.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When you have game-playing co-workers who say hurtful
things or just ignore you, perhaps the real question is whether you
even want to be friends with these people. It is possible that you
are in a work environment composed of closed little groups with
closed minds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, when there is a personality conflict between
you and all of your co-workers, it may also be helpful to take an
honest look at yourself. Is there anything about your behavior that
may be annoying your co-workers? If you are uncertain in this area,
perhaps you should ask for feedback from some of your personal
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Another step that can help in this type of environment is for
you to try to befriend the informal leaders among your associates.
Once they become friendly with you, the rest of the troops are
likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
   You should also look around the organization for some
co-workers. It is possible that there are some friendly employees
out there who do not click with the cliques.

PUTIN BOOSTS RUSSIAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There was a time when news of Boris N. Yeltsin's
resignation would have send stocks tumbling. But when Russia's
mercurial president abruptly left office on New Year's Eve, handing
power over to Vladimir V. Putin, the opposite happened: the markets
soared.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's long-stagnant stock market rose by more than 19 percent
on the news of Yeltsin's resignation, while Russian stocks trading
on foreign exchanges also posted significant gains.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a steely and straight-talking former KGB officer who is
now Russia's acting president, seems to provide what investors want
most: stability. After a decade of uncertainty under Yeltsin's
erratic rule, investors and financial analysts say Russia will now
become a more predictable place to do business with Putin in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am cautiously optimistic that we will see improvements in
the business climate. There will be more stability than under
Yeltsin,'' said Margot Jacobs, strategist for the United Financial
Group, a Moscow investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs added that she expects Putin to be a more hands-on leader
than Yeltsin, who left the day-to-day business of government to his
aides and bickering Cabinet ministers. ``I expect Putin to be more
accessible and this breeds stability and confidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But while financial analysts are upbeat about the prospects for
stability under Putin, few expect the new Kremlin leader to attack
the rampant corruption and cronyism that have plagued Russia for
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the real business climate, as opposed to the stock
market which is driven by expectations, we are probably looking at
a continuation of the status quo. Things won't get much worse
because they can't get much worse,'' said Leonid Bershidsky, editor
of Vedomosti, a daily Russian business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his second term, the ailing Yeltsin was an absentee
president prone to odd behavior and frequent shifts in policy. When
he appeared at the Kremlin after long periods of convalescence at
his country residence, it was often to fire his government _ which
he did four times during his last two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as a small group of tycoons, known here as ``the
oligarchs,'' used their Kremlin connections to build fortunes,
fledgling Russian entrepreneurs and foreign investors were
suffocated by a corrupt and arbitrary bureaucracy. Left at the
mercy of bribe-seeking bureaucrats, a punitive tax system, and
courts that could not or would not enforce contracts and property
rights, investors have fled Russia in droves.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent statement, Putin pledged to reform Russia's bloated
civil service, instill ``discipline'' in government, and fight
corruption. Nevertheless, many remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say that to improve Russia's business climate and
attract investment, Putin also needs to lower taxes and simplify
the country's arcane tax system, protect property rights, and
strengthen the judiciary so it can enforce contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is not some anticorruption crusader and he isn't
somebody who understands that taxes need to be lowered, Bershidsky
said. ``As prime minister he has done nothing about corruption and
he has actually raised several taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is commonly believed that corruption in Russia stems from
the very top and in this sense we need to wait and see. A lot
depends on where Putin's power base is,'' Jacobs said, adding that
Putin's relations with Russia's politically connected oligarchs is
still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, say Putin has no choice but to tackle corruption.
If he doesn't sooner or later the country will face economic
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling corruption and making Russia's opaque public finances
more straightforward would also help Moscow obtain badly needed
Western credits. Disbursement of a $640 million loan installment
from the International Monetary Fund has been held up since
September. The IMF has said Russia has yet to implement the fiscal
reforms required for the loan to be released. The delay, however,
came right after a money laundering scandal in which as much as $15
billion in pilfered Russian funds was alleged to have been diverted
through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia suffers from a lack of transparency, which is another
way of saying that people are stealing like crazy,'' said George
Friedman, chairman of Stratfor Inc., a political and financial
consulting firm located in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia also suffers from a shortage of capital. Right now
nothing is good for business in Russia because a dollar invested
there is a dollar lost. If Putin can introduce some accountability
this would improve the business climate, but there are powerful
interests that will oppose that accountability,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, however, that Putin was uniquely qualified to
tackle Russia's corruption problem. A KGB spy in East Germany in
the 1980s, Putin was responsible for facilitating Western
investment to revive the ailing Soviet economy. Later, as deputy
mayor of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, Putin was
the point man on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Putin's experience has been probusiness. He understands
the psychology of Western investors and he knows what they need,''
Friedman said. ``Putin also knows that nobody is going to invest in
Russia unless he gets corruption under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some here say that the stock market's positive reaction to
Putin's ascent to power was more due to relief that Yeltsin left
the Kremlin without major upheaval than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been nervous that the end of Yeltsin's presidency
_ his second and final term was scheduled to end in June _ would be
anything but smooth. Many here feared Yeltsin would either try to
cancel elections and stay in power, creating a political crisis; or
that opposition forces would win the Kremlin and initiate reprisals
against the old regime and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   But now Putin, who enjoys a startling 70 percent popularity
rating, will serve as acting president for three months and is
widely expected to win elections tentatively scheduled for March
26. Russia's much anticipated _ and feared _tion of power
seems to have passed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors were waiting to see what would happen when Yeltsin's
term ended. There was fear that the end of the Yeltsin era would
lead to instability and this has not happened,'' said Tom Adshead,
a political analyst at Troika-Dialog, a Moscow investment bank.

LAW SUITS POSE BASIC CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ga., Ill., Mo., Texas)  (sw) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cindy Herdrich, a part-time legal secretary, said she suspected
all along that the sharp pain in her lower abdomen was
appendicitis. But Lori Pegram, a doctor at her husband's HMO in
Bloomington, Ill., did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen painful days later, the health maintenance organization
finally authorized an ultrasound scan. Too late. Ms. Herdrich's
appendix ruptured. She contracted peritonitis and required
emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herdrich, then 33, sued the HMO in 1992. And what began as a
simple malpractice claim has grown into the first direct challenge
to managed care to be accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means the only challenge. Managed-care companies
_ like makers of cigarettes, lead paint and guns _ are under
growing legal attack. This includes at least 16 recent class-action
suits, most filed by some of the same lawyers who won huge
settlements from the tobacco industry. Several new state laws and
measures in Congress could open the industry to still more suits.
And the federal law that has long protected many managed-care
companies is being whittled away in a series of judicial decisions
in malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care is under a very fundamental attack in the
judicial system right now,'' said William G. Schiffbauer, a
Washington lawyer who advises insurance companies and employer
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in many of these cases comes down to this: Does an
HMO, by linking what it pays its doctors with their success in
holding down costs, ignore the best interest of patients in a way
that violates its legal duty as defined by a federal law governing
employer-sponsored health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimacy of financial incentives, and whether health plans
have a legal obligation to disclose them, is at the heart of a
number of recent suits against big managed-care companies filed by
prominent class-action lawyers. The HMO industry itself urged the
Supreme Court to resolve this matter, hoping that a ruling in its
favd undermine the class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in the case in
February and a decision is expected by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law is the same one that has effectively barred
state jury trials and huge punitive-damage awards in malpractice
suits by transferring most cases to federal courts. A related
question is whether this will be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides see the Herdrich case as a fundamental
test of the underpinnings of managed care. Those on the
managed-care side warn of dire consequences for health maintenance
organizations if the Supreme Court upholds the idea that they can
be sued on this basis. And insurance executives say that financial
incentives are a crucial method of preventing wasteful practices
and do not interfere with necessary care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's employer-based health care system simply cannot
function or indeed survive if every treatment decision made while
implementing a managed-care program is treated as a fiduciary
decision,'' an industry group argued in a brief in the Supreme
Court case.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care executives said they did not intend to let
plaintiffs' lawyers determine their policies. ``This is the way the
industry has worked for some years,'' said Richard Huber, chief
executive of Aetna, the biggest managed-care company. ``To allege
that practicing according to the norms of the industry is criminal
strikes us as absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna is the defendant in six class-action and 40 other cases.
Similar class-action suits have been filed against Humana, Cigna,
United Healthcare, Foundation Health Systems, PacifiCare Health
Systems, Kaiser Permanente, a number of Blue Cross/Blue Shield
plans, and the Prudential unit of Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herdrich won $35,000 in damages in federal district court in
Peoria, Ill., a paltry amount compared with some recent
multimillion-dollar awards in state courts. The judge rejected the
argument that her health plan had not met its obligations under the
federal law. But an appeals court, while not resolving the matter,
ordered a trial on that very issue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herdrich refused all requests for interviews, her lawyer,
James P. Ginzkey, said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pegram also did not respond to requests for comment. L.J.
Fallon, a lawyer for her group, the Carle Clinic Association of
Urbana, Ill., said there had been no clear signs of appendicitis at
first, and a sonogram did not seem appropriate until a mass in her
abdomen became apparent a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John L. Coffey of the federal appeals court in Chicago
suggested in 1998 that doctors at Ms. Herdrich's HMO might have
been caught in a conflict of interest between safeguarding her
health and protecting their chances of getting a year-end b
a reward for keeping down medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where physicians delay providing necessary treatment, or
withhold administering proper care to plan beneficiaries for the
sole purpose of increasing their bonuses,'' Coffey said, a
managed-care company may be breaching a ``fiduciary duty'' to serve
its members and patients.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel voted 2-1 to order a trial on the issue. The
full appeals court declined to review that ruling, and lawyers for
the managed-care industry persuaded the Supreme Court to take the
case.
</P>
<P>
   One widely accepted theory is that market forces will ultimately
result in the best care at the lowest cost, because health plans
and providers of care will compete to attract business. But Coffey
took a dim view of such reasoning, writing, ``Market forces are
insufficient to cure the deleterious effects of managed care on the
health care industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Joel M. Flaum said that he shared
those concerns, but that judges should not ``pre-empt legislative
and regulatory efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Financial incentives are among a weakening arsenal of
cost-control tools as managed-care companies maneuver to calm
criticism. A number of companies have eased requirements for
previous approval of medical treatments and established external
review boards that can reconsider the denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawsuits also made claims of fraudulent marketing,
accusing the providers of advertising that their care met high
standards but not making clear that financial incentives might
undercut those standards. Some suits seek triple damages under the
federal antiracketeering law, based on claims that the companies
engaged ``in a nationwide fraudulent scheme'' to mislead the public
about the essential nature of their business.
</P>
<P>
   me lawyers have filed suits in state courts in California
contending that the companies violated provisions of the state's
business code.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks may grow more intense. California, Georgia and
Missouri have passed laws permitting suits against the managed-care
companies. A two-year-old Texas law permitting such suits is being
tested in the courts. And the attorneys general of Connecticut and
Missouri also jumped in recently with separate suits against
managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the House passed a bill in October that would
permit malpractice suits in state courts against managed-care
plans; such suits could not, however, be class actions. A
House-Senate conference is expected to take up the House measure
this year, said John Stone, a spokesman for Rep. Charlie Norwood,
R-Ga., and a principal sponsor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Richard F. Scruggs, the lead lawyer in several recent suits, is
a Mississippi-based specialist in class-action suits who played a
big role in winning huge awards against tobacco companies in 1997
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of class-action lawyers in various managed-care suits
include such well-known names as David Boies of Armonk, N.Y., who
is also assisting in the Justice Department's antitrust case
against Microsoft; Ronald L. Motley of Charleston, S.C.; John Eddie
Williams of Houston; Fred Furth of San Francisco; Russ Herman of
New Orleans; and Edith Kallas, of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP;
Lerach in New York.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Scruggs predicted that the new lawsuits would
force managed care companies to agree to change their business
practices in exchange for legal protection against potentially
ruinous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors drove down HMO stock prices when the latest suits were
filed in October, which Scruggs interprets as adding to the
pressure for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief for the Supreme Court, insurance industry trade
associations and lobbyists for employers laid out the arguments the
companies are likely to use there and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The brief was signed by the American Association of Health
Plans, the Health Insurance Association of America, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, and the Association of Private Pension and
Welfare Plans. It said that doctors, when making medical decisions,
were not acting as administrators and therefore were not subject to
the fiduciary duty provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, or ERISA, the federal law that governs employer
health plans and mandates that the plans act in the best interests
of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in a separate brief by the Labor
Department, agreed with the industry argument, but in December, 18
state attorneys general urged the Supreme Court to uphold the
appeals court's order for a trial on whether Ms. Herdrich's HMO
placed its own financial interests ahthe interests of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, industry lawyers said that if the door was opened
wide to malpractice lawsuits against HMO's, they would have to
charge higher premiums, driving away customers and adding to the 43
million people without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On another tack, the industry argued that encouraging managed
care was a public policy legislated and regulated by Congress and
the states. Changing such a policy should be left to legislatures
and to commercial decisions that reflect market forces, not decreed
by courts, the industry said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts cautioned against trying to predict how the
Supreme Court might resolve this issue. It could shore up the ERISA
shield, or it could weaken it. The court could also issue a narrow
opinion without addressing larger policy issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, ERISA has protected health plans by requiring
that most malpractice suits be heard in federal courts, where
damages are strictly limited. But in a number of recent cases,
federal courts made exceptions that permitted suits in state
courts.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled in 1998 that a New
Jersey couple had the right to bring medical negligence charges in
state court against their HMO, doctor and hospital. Steven and
Michelle Bauman blamed the plan when their baby died in 1995, the
day after Mrs. Bauman and the baby were sent home under a 24-hour
maternity policy then in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are human; they want to be generous,'' said Clark
Havighurst, a health law expert at Duke University law school.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook is murky for the class actions. Legal experts
say that, for one thing, it may be difficult to persuade judges
that health plan members have enough in common to be certified as a
class.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts ruled against class action lawyers in two recent
decisions. On Sept. 29, a federal district judge in Philadelphia
denied class-action status in a suit accusing Aetna of fraudulently
advertising that its primary concern was quality of care, not cost
controls. The judge said the plaintiffs could not sue because they
had advanced ``a vague allegation'' and failed to show that they
had been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, a district judge in Houston denied a request for
class-action status in a suit against Nylcare that also argued that
advertising to consumers was misleading. The judge suggested it was
not clear whether ``a particular consumer saw a particular
advertisement'' and was misled by that advertisement or induced by
it to join a Nylcare HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Supreme Court says in the Herdrich case will make a
big difference,'' said Peter D. Jacobson, an associate professor of
health policy at the University of Michigan School of Public
Health. &QL;

DOW AND S&AMP;P 500 LOSE, NASDAQ GAIN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks began the new year with a topsy-turvy
performance Monday, as technology and Internet shares bolted to new
records even as broad swaths of the market slumped in the wake of a
sharp rise in long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Observers who note only the closing quotes for major market
averages would probably comment that the Nasdaq composite index
continued to perform as it did throughout much of December, when it
rose in what seemed like a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which ended 1999 with a record, did so again Monday.
Led by companies like JDS Uniphase, Yahoo and CMGI, the index
gained 61.84 points, or 1.52 percent, to 4,131.15.
</P>
<P>
   But the road to the close was bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the opening, the Nasdaq was up more than 122,
to as high as 4,192.19. The index then reversed and fell as low as
3,989.71 _ a swing of 202.48.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was more consistent: Both
measures moved lower shortly after the opening bell, and stayed
down throughout the session.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market's bad day hit financial service stocks
particularly hard as investors feared that the Federal Reserve
might raise interest rates now that year 2000 computer glitches
have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed at 11,357.51, down 139.61 points, or 1.21
percent. American Express, General Electric and J.P. Morgan were
the Dow's biggest losers. Cyclical stocks like Minnesota Mining &AMP;
Manufacturing and Alcoa _ companies whose businesses are also
sensitive to rising rates _ also registered declines. Weakness in
bank and brokerage stocks, as well as oil and big retailers, helped
to drag down the S&AMP;P 500 index by 14.03 points, or 0.95 percent, to
1,455.22.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russell 2000 index of smaller cap stocks was also
hammered. The index fell 8.33 points, or 1.65 percent, to 496.42.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to back out an investment thesis from
today's session, even though the backup in bond yields was
dramatic,'' said Satya Pradhuman, director of small cap research at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this might be an unwinding of the fast run-up we saw
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while many spent much of December worrying that the
Federal Reserve would move to raise short-term interest rates at
its February meeting, nearly as many said they expected to see
investors take advantage of the strong move in December stock
prices and take some profits n the new year, thereby
delaying capital gains taxes until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people have expected tremendous tax selling,''
said Fred Kobrick, president and chief executive of Kobrick Funds,
a Boston-based mutual fund company. ``This was one pie in the face
of the market that was welltelegraphed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the big swings in prices, traders said the market was
fairly quiet.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, more than 931.8 million shares
changed hands. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.48 billion
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volatility would connote there was more activity than was
actually going on,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at
Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase led the rise in the Nasdaq, climbing 26 11/16, to
188. The stock jumped after the manufacturer of parts used in
fiber-optic equipment announced plans for its third 2-for-1 stock
split since July.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI gained 49 9/16, to 326 7/16. America Online was up 7 5/16,
to 82 3/4. And Yahoo jumped 42 5/16, to 475.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in technology was not limited to companies whose
corporate history did not begin at some point in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   IBM gained 7 9/16, to 115 9/16. Hewlett-Packard was up 3 1/2, to
117 7/16. And Intel rose 4 11/16, to 87. All three companies are
components of the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial stocks, American Express slid 9, to 157 1/4.
J.P. Morgan fell 5 3/16, to 121 7/16. Citigroup fell 2 13/16, to 52
7/8. And General Electric, whose GE Capital subsidiary is the
largest nonbank finance company, shed 4 3/4, to 150.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks also fell. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter tumbled 7
3/4, to 135. Merrill Lynch fell 2 11/16, to 80 5/8. And Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lost 1 7/16, to 46 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for biotechnology stocks. Amgen rose 2 7/8, to
62 15/16, on expectations that it will beat fourth-quarter earnings
estimates and is on track to win approval of two new drugs.
Genentech rose 1 1/2, to 136. Biogen was up 3 1/2, to 88. And
Millennium Pharmaceuticals jumped 17 15/16, to 139 15/16.

FEW YEAR 2000 GLITCHES ARE REPORTED ON FIRST WORKING DAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn, Tenn., Mass. N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Year 2000 computer glitches began appearing as much of the world
headed back to work Monday after the New Year's holiday, but they
remained scattered and, for the most part, trivial.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's financial institutions, including the New York
Stock Exchange, opened trading without a hitch. The relatively
smooth sailing continued not just in the United States, which spent
over $100 billion on computer preparations, according to government
estimates, but also in foreign nations that had spent far less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing that there were no threatening effects in the
companies,'' Salvador Bellido, vice president of the Spanish
Confederation of Medium and Small Businesses, told the news agency
Europa Press. ``We're beginning to think that all this has been set
up for someone's benefit. I don't know if it was Bill Gates or
who,'' he added, referring to Microsoft's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   As they have been doing ever since the rollover to 2000 occurred
with no major disruptions, computer experts and government
officials repeated their convictions that testing in recent years
had amply proved that the threat had been real.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that the similar outcomes around the world for
such varying investments were not surprising once the different
levels of dependence on computer technology were taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
   Basic services like power, telephones and water run with little
or no help from computers in many countries, said Bruce McConnell,
director of the International Y2K Cooperation Center, the
U.N.-sponsored year 2000 information clearinghouse in Washington.
And late starters at home and overseas benefited from the
experience of others. ``It was possible to catch up with a modest
expenditure because the tools had become very efficient,''
McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, where computers are used overseas, they are often
older systems with much simpler programming and fewer links to
other equipment, making repairs simpler, according to the Gartner
Group, an information technology consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell and others monitoring year-end computer incidents
said the continuing good news did not close the books on such
computer risks. He cited as an example the unknown status of
government systems in numerous developing countries. ``We haven't
seen their payrolls run yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others cautioned that even in the United States, things have not
been going quite as flawlessly as the public reports to date might
suggest. Gartner Group said it had received confidential reports of
about 400 computer flaws by midafternoon, mostly among mid-sized
and smaller clients and nearly all of them fixed within hours of
their discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a significant increase over yesterday, about 50
percent,'' Louis Marcoccio, Gartner's Year 2000 research director,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the flaws showing up are too silly even to be
irritating. For a time Vice President Al Gore's Town Hall Web page
(www.algore2000.cormed visitors it was Jan. 3, 19100 if they
arrived via a Netscape browser and Jan. 3, 192000 if they came to
the site using Microsoft's Internet Explorer. An automated
selection program of a telephone service that reads The New York
Times and other newspapers to blind New Yorkers informed clients
they would be hearing the Jan. 3, 1900, issue.
</P>
<P>
   But some problems reflect the kind of flaws that consultants
fear could put pressure on some computer users as the days go by.
One electronics company told Gartner that it had discovered a Year
2000 glitch that generated faulty orders. It caught the mistake
before any shipments went astray but not before the bad data had
been sent to a larger database, including records used for other
activities like telemarketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take several days to clean up the database,''
Marcoccio said. ``Meanwhile, they have set up a temporary database
to handle orders and they will eventually have to go back and mix
the two.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marcoccio said his concerns about small business were reinforced
Monday morning when he visited his dentist in suburban Boston and
encountered an apparent problem. He was the first patient of 2000,
and when the secretary tried to set up his next appointment, the
computer system crashed. Efforts to get it started generated error
messages suggesting that some patient records may have been
destroyed, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, though, Gartner and others say the news continued to
be encouraging. The Tokyo stock exchange, which was closed Monay,
opened without trouble Tuesday morning. Hubs in the distribution
system like McKesson HBOC, a San Francisco-based pharmaceutical
distributor, reported no problems with orders and shipments.
Industrial giants like General Motors began manufacturing with no
discernible hitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely looking good,'' said Jeffrey Cripps, who has
overseen DaimlerChrysler's year-end computer 2000 interactions with
its many suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   One problem cited by government officials Monday morning as
potentially critical prevented kidney dialysis equipment
manufactured by Gambros, a Swedish company, from running through an
automated cleaning cycle at the end of the day. But that failure
was actually discovered during testing Saturday in Scotland in two
models that are not sold in the United States, according to Tim
Schoenberg, a Gambros spokesman in Aliso Viejo, Calif., who added
that no patients had been harmed and that it was easily
circumvented.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most widely reported problem over the weekend _ the
failure Friday night of a ground station that processes information
from military satellites _ was put to rest when the Pentagon
reported it was operating normally.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, said he did not expect any of the disruptions likely to
arise from here on to be broad enough to have any impact on the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs of growing confidence included a trickle of
consumers returning propane heaters and other devices bought as
insurance against disruptions. Sears is charging 20 percent of the
cost for ``restocking.'' Charity groups like Second Harvest began
collecting food donations from consumers who had decided they no
longer needed some of the food supplies they had put aside.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Earl, director of development for the Second Harvest
chapter in Nashville, said, ``The calls started coming in right
after we arrived at 9 a.m.''

EXCHANGES, OTHERS UNFAZED BY Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American businesses and workplaces cleared a major test of the
technological era Monday, as the first business day of the new
century passed with little significant fallout from the once-feared
Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans returned to work after the New Year's holiday, the
nation's stock markets, financial institutions, manufacturers and
other major organization reported few computer problems caused by
the calendar rollover to 2000. The results suggested that years of
preparation and billions of dollars spent by large corporations to
head off the potential disruptions had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Even small businesses, which had been seen as the least
prepared, seemed to have exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of scattered glitches emerged, however. At South End
Video in Boston, a database struck by the Y2K bug incorrectly
determined 400 customers didn't meet age restrictions for PG-13
movies like ``The Waterboy.'' ``I made a lot of people feel young
again,'' said Alex Pinck, the video store's owner, who quickly
found a way to override the problem.
</P>
<P>
   So went reports from around the country as officials including
John Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, called the
most worrisome aspects of Y2K beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we continue to find that the extensive
time, effort and work devoted to this problem . . . have resulted
in the fact that while there are glitches around the edges, the
systems are running well and we have made a successful
transition,'' Koskinen told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a UN-sponsored monitoring center cancelled briefings for
lack of new data.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's financial institutions, including stock markets and
banks, said they averted major problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, institutions including FleetBoston Financial, Thomson
Financial, the Massachusetts Bankers Association and the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston reported no troubles. The Boston Stock
Exchange said it handled a record number of trades, about 100,000,
which it attributed to confidence that most computers had survived
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   In Lexington, Mass., defense contractor Raytheon Co. reported
only a few problems with security-card readers that were resolved
early Saturday morning, within an hour after the glitches surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   State utility officials and regulators called systems normal.
</P>
<P>
   The overall prospects of small businesses, the most difficult
area of the economy to measure, may not be known for weeks. For
most ``mom-and-pop'' businesses, ``the jury's still out,'' said
FleetBoston spokesman Jim Schepker.
</P>
<P>
   But early returns were cheering. In Gaithersberg, Md., a hotline
set up by the Small Business Administration to assist in
last-minute fixes had received just 200 calls nationwide since
Thursday, said Scott McIntyre, a manager for the service. ``I think
everybody's done their homework,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem stemmed from the habit of many older computers
to use just two digits to represent the year; left unfixed,
``2000'' could have been misread and caused many systems to shut
down or malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem turned out to be more complicated than originally
estimated; in many cases companies doubled their initial estimate
of the cost to fix bugs. The federal government once estimated it
would spend $2.7 billion and wound up spending about $8.5 billion
on Y2K work.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen estimated that global spending on Y2K totalled around
$200 billion, although other estimates vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, it seemed the massive worldwide spending campaign
had succeeded in minimizing the bug's impact. A random telephone
survey by the Boston Globe of about 20 businesses around New
England found four that reported problems, though none seemed
serious.
</P>
<P>
   At Architect's Studio Inc. i Easton, Mass., designers
Monday mornnd they couldn't ship drawings over the Internet
because computers made by Gateway Inc. were running old software.
</P>

   Bookkeeper Mary Dixon said several customers granted extensions
and, by the end of the day, Gateway had promised to send floppy
disks with new code by overnight mail. ``People have been very
gracious,'' she said.

   In Cambridge, Mass., attorney Jim Rafferty grumbled after
discovering he couldn't log on to legal databases, despite spending
about $12,500 last year on Y2K software upgrades and consulting
fees. ``In terms of productivity, we're not affected,'' Rafferty
said.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other firms had nothing to report. ``Things are
fine,'' said Liz Kay of South End Realty in Boston, who updated
software on 10 computers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after thousands of merchants in England reported
problems with credit-card machines, US Petroleum gas stations in
Massachusetts put up notices they would only accept cash. But
Monday George Artin, manager of one such station in Cambridge, said
the chain would resume accepting cards on Thursday, the first day
possible under the terms of the company's network contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing, but it was better to be safe than sorry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The limited fallout has led to defensive comments from some
experts and officials, worried they would be accused of overblowing
the problem. Deustche Bank economist Ed Yardeni, once one of the
most pessimistic observers, wrote on his Web site that some risk
remains but added that ``if no significant problems occur by the
end of January, then I will concede I was wrong about a Y2K global
downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   At Raytheon Co., computer-systems director Saul Fisher said he
didn't regret the $121 million Raytheon spent over two years in the
name of preventing damage related to Y2K. The company spends
roughly $700 million on technology annually, and Fisher said the
Y2K program helped ``rationalize'' what had been a hodgepodge of
computer systems and accounts around the company.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company discovered it was doing business with
Compaq Computer Corp. using 30 different accounts, and consolidated
them into one to gain more negotiating leverage. ``There were a lot
of other benefits'' aside from preventing obvious Y2K shutdowns,
Fisher said.

SECOND ROUND OF ISRAELI-SYRIAN PEACE TALKS OPEN 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Israel and Syria opened a second round of
peace talks Monday in hopes of ending more than 50 years of
hostilities and setting a course toward a final comprehensive
settlement of Arab-Israeli disputes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was on hand to kick off negotiations between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa, who held their first historic meeting last month
at the White House. They agreed in that meeting _ the first ever
high-level Syrian-Israeli discussions _ to enter intense
negotiations aimed at producing a peace agreement by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Israel on Sunday night, Barak told reporters he
still feels a ``burden of responsibility'' to reach an agreement
this year. Syrian officials said they had come to this rural
college town with ``open minds'' and a ``true desire'' to settle
their differences with Israel over the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured during the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department spokesman James Rubin sought to play down
speculation about a quick settlement of the long-standing problems
that have kept the two countries in a state of war since Israel was
established in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our view that progress can be made ... But we have no
reason to expect that a core agreement can be reached in a couple
of days,'' Rubin told reporters. He added that the Shepherdstown
talks could run a week or more and may, in the end, produce only a
promise to meet again later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of the Syrian-Israeli dispute would finally close
``the circle of peace in the Middle East,'' as Rubin put it, that
began with the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel in 1978
and has since led to Israeli agreements with Jordan and, most
recently, the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would like to see a comprehensive settlement between
Israel and all its Arab neighbors before he leaves office next
January. He set to work on that task by meeting separately with
Barak and al-Sharaa early in the afternoon. He later presided over
a face-to-face session between the two men held in the secluded
confines of the National Conservation Training Center here run by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the quiet community of Shepherdstown, located about
70 miles northwest of Washington, was chosen as the site for the
talks so the participants would be somewhat isolated and better
able to ``focus on narrowing the differences that divide them.''
Both the Israeli and Syrian delegations are being housed in the
nearby Clarion Hotel and Conference Center, many of them in rooms
on the same floor. Rubin said the arrangements, including communal
dining, are designed to keep the two sides together and talking as
much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to create a ``climate'' conducive to success,
Rubin said both sides are also being encouraged to show restraint
during the talks. He said the Syrians were asked specifically to
use their influence in Lebanon with the militant Arab group known
as Hezbollah to curb terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique and historic opportunity and the kind of
opportunity that may never come again,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and al-Sharaa, who is representing Syrian President Hafez
Assad at the talks, began their discussions by joining Clinton in a
short stroll around the grounds of the training center, which sits
along the Potomac River. The three looked to be deep in
conversation at one point. They refused to answer questions shouted
at them by a handful of reporters. Clinton waved and smiled for the
cameras, and then herded Barak and al-Sharaa back into the
conference center.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton hopes to act
``as a facilitator'' and ``honest broker'' in the talks as they
proceed over the next week or so and, quite likely, into the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
He also cautioned against speculation of an immediate breakthrough
in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take it day-by-day. At the end of the week
we'll take stock of where we are,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to shuttle back and forth by helicopter
between Shepherdstown and Washington ``as needed.'' But Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and special Middle East envoy Dennis
Ross planned to remain behind to help keep the talks on track.
</P>
<P>
   Albright called the Shepherdstown talks ``the beginning of a
process'' that could lead to a land-for-peace deal giving Syria the
Golan Heights in return for security guarantees to Israel. Those
issues are the most difficult, but other issues, including water
rights and normalization of relations, could prove to be equally
hard to resolve for the two long-time enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, seem determined to make the effort work.
Evidence of that could be seen in the size of their respective
delegations. Barak, for example, brought along his government's top
legal, national security and military officials, as well as
representatives from Israel's tourism and cultural agencies.
Syria's delegation was large as well. Altogether, the influx of the
U.S., Syrian and Israeli delegations _ not to mention several dozen
reporters _ nearly doubled the Shepherdstown population of 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said talks would be taking
place ``at various levels'' between the two countries even as Barak
and al-Sharaa are meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barak seemed to stress the urgency of moving the peace talks
along on a number of tracks before arriving in Sstown. ``We
don't need to wait for another millennium, another century or even
another 10 years to find a way to make peace with our neighbors,''
he told Israeli journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Although al-Sharaa is Assad's most trusted aide and has been
authorized to speak for him in the talks, Israeli Foreign Minister
David Devy said Israel would insist on the Syrian leader joining
the talks at some point before anything is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who makes only rare public appearances and travels
infrequently, has never participated in any peace talks with
Israel. Al-Sharaa led the Syrian delegation in 1996 when it held
low-level talks with Israeli officials. Those talks broke down in
1996 after a series of terrorist bombings in Israel. They were
revived last month at the White House after Clinton spent months
talking to Assad and Barak by telephone urging them to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who has reportedly been ill, would like to oversee the
return of the Golan Heights to Syria before he dies or turns over
power to his son. Barak has indicated that he is ready to give up
much of the disputed territory bordering Lebanon and the Sea of
Galilee, but has refused to say whether he will return all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants assurances that Israel will still have access to the
Galilee, an important fresh water source for the Jewish state. He
also wants assurances that the Syrian army will be withdrawn from
the immediate area of the Golan Heights and that ``listening
posts'' will be established on Mt. Hermon to monitor any movement
of Syrian forces toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to play an important role in any
final agreement, both financially and, possibly, militarily.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said, however, that it would be
``premature'' to discuss the amount of funding Clinton might ask
Congress for to help implement any agreement or whether U.S. troops
would have to be committed to the region to help keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Damascus, Syrians staged a sit-in denouncing the
Jewish state and demanding the immediate release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The government-sanctioned protest, held annually for three years
but this year timed to coincide with the negotiations, was a
reminder of the numerous thorny issues facing negotiators and the
need for both sides to take steps to build each other's confidence.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Cowboys' season is now just as good as last year's.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the Cowboys' record is just as good as any of the teams
still playing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Cowboys slid into the playoffs at 8-8. But they woke
up Monday morning with a fresh start and a 0-0 record to match
those of the other 11 playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   The .500 record means the Cowboys won't get a bye and, barring a
Dallas-Detroit NFC Championship Game, won't be playing again at
Texas Stadium this season. But that's all it means. From here on
out, it doesn't matter that the Cowboys lost to the Jets and the
Saints. It doesn't matter that Dallas won only once on the road
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, the slate was wiped clean, and the Cowboys have
as good a chance as anybody to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Cowboys see it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've had as good a season as we had a year ago,''
quarterback Troy Aikman said, referring to the fact that Dallas
made the playoffs but went no further after a first-round loss to
Arizona. ``That's it. That's the reality. All that matters now is
what happens in the playoffs. It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go out and play like we're capable of playing, I think
we've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's believable if you buy into that theory that each team
starts fresh in the playoffs, or that the regular season is solely
a means of positioning for the playoffs. The problem with that line
of thinking is that a 16-game schedule, whether the Cowboys choose
to admit it or not, generally is indicative of a team's talent
level.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Dallas went 10-6 with an easy schedule but fooled no
one, losing at home to the Cardinals in their playoff opener. And
the postseason road, which begins at 11:35 a.m. Sunday at
Minnesota, would appear even more difficult this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different feeling, going to the playoffs at 8-8,''
safety Darren Woodson said. ``Back in '92 and '93, we pretty much
dominated teams and always had the bye week. So this is different,
going to Minnesota to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Had they slipped in with another mediocre victory, perhaps the
Cowboys would be less positive. But after Sunday's 26-18 win over
the Giants, they had several reasons to be optimistic:
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense, which had struggled against seemingly
lesser opponents this season, put up 437 yards against New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is as healthy as it has been all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have big-game experience.
</P>
<P>
   And they scored 17 unanswered points in the first half against
Minnesota before losing Emmitt Smith (broken hand), Aikman
(concussion) and eventually the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you like to do when you're David fighting
Goliath is make sure you have a good sling and good rocks,''
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``I feel like we have that.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there's nobody in the NFC who looks untouchable.
The St. Louis Rams have been the only team to set itself apart from
the pack in the NFC, but the Rams proved beatable Sunday as they
fell to the Philadelphia Eagles. Tampa Bay (11-5) won has won eight
of its last nine games but was blown out 45-0 by Oakland two weeks
ago. The Vikings (10-6) seem to be improving each week but have
been far from dominating all season. And Washington (10-6) and
Detroit (8-8) have been hot and cold, much like the Cowboys, this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of super teams, but most of them are in the AFC,''
Dallas offensive tackle Erik Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The postseason experience factor could even the playing field.
The top-seeded Rams haven't been to the playoffs since 1989, and
the second-seeded Buccaneers have been once previously since 1979,
losing in the first round two years ago. Washington's last
appearance came in 1992, and although Detroit is playoff-bound for
the sixth time in nine seasons, the Lions haven't won a postseason
game since 1991. Minnesota owns the NFC's longest streak of playoff
seasons at four, but the Vikings failed to turn last year's 15-1
regular season into anything more than a loss to the Falcons in the
NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy to go to the Super Bowl, and this team has been
there more than any other team,'' Aikman said. ``I think anyone can
win this thing. It is more trueear than any other year that
I have been here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys are still convinced they're far better than an
8-8 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a miscarriage of something if we would have
had what we've got here, as far as our talent, and not have gotten
to the playoffs,'' Dallas owner Jerry Jones said. ``It would have
been a sad sight with all of the talent on this Cowboys team to
have them sitting at home watching the playoffs on TV. I don't know
if we can shove this much talent on the table again with the salary
cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the last intangible is the Cowboys' ``mystique.'' It's
not enough to pull them through if they play a bad game. But all
else being equal, it could help tip the scales in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of talent,'' Woodson said. ``Teams see that we
have Emmitt, Deion (Sanders) and Troy, and they don't want to see
us. We've got players who have been to the show. Teams that play us
know they're going to have a tough game.''

<P>
   GOMITOGO, Mali _ Slumped in the shadow of a mud wall, any desire
he might have had to stand up drained by the midday sun and the
Ramadan fast, Mamadou Tombo explained the simple truth about his
village of rice farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there was good flood and rain,'' said Tombo, the mayor,
``there was no exodus.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rains came late this year and brought a poor harvest.
The rivers overflowed before much of the rice could germinate,
setting many young people here off to more fortunate parts of
Mali's Niger River basin.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the great Niger and Bani rivers have flooded the
flat stretch of West Africa at this time of year, turning scorched
soil into fertile ground for a few months. Areas that could easily
be crossed on foot or by donkey abruptly grow inaccessible, except
to pirogues that slowly navigate the innumerable channels and
creeks.
</P>
<P>
   And medieval villages like this one, built on plateaus in the
basin and seemingly unchanged in centuries, become islands
surrounded by water and rice paddies. From a distance, as the
outline of their labyrinthine mud houses and castlelike mosques
becomes clearer against the vast blue sky, the villages look like
Disneylands lost in the Niger River basin.
</P>
<P>
   This one about nine miles west of the ancient town of Djenne is
home to 3,000 peasants. In years of meager harvest, the population
drops as villagers strike out to hunt for jobs in Bamako, the
capital, or in more fertile corners of the basin.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern _ what people here call the seasonal exodus of the
able-bodied _ began with the droughts of the 1970s, which affected
the entire north-central region of Africa south of the Sahara. As
desertification forced nomads to the Saharan fringes north of here,
the lack of rain in this region _ or disruption of the age-old
cycle of rains and floods _ has changed the way the people live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing rice was very easy before the droughts,'' said
Boukadari Diakite, one of the few men in the village to speak
French, as he sat a few feet from the mayor. ``In the last two
years, we have had great floods because it rained in the south, but
it did not rain early enough here. As long as we are not masters of
nature, we will never be able to feel secure.''
</P>
<P>
   So only the old and the very young could be found in Gomitogo
earlier in December. Donkeys meandered alone through the maze of
dusty narrow alleys, braying occasionally, as women pounded rice,
dull thuds resounding against the walls. The quiet was otherwise
broken only by children reciting verses at Koranic school and the
muezzin's calls to prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the heads of seven villages, including this one,
gathered in a field and formed an association that eventually
grouped 30 villages across 74,000 acres, said Tombo, who has served
as the organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little rice we had grown was being threatened by the
Peuls, who were letting their cattle graze in our areas,'' Tombo
said, referring to the nomadic herdsmen with whom the rice farmers
share a centuries-old rivalry and partnership that grew
increasingly strained after the droughts. ``If we stopped them in
one village, we know they would move to another village. But by
uniting, we felt we could chase them away.''
</P>
<P>
   The association also began digging channels to control the flow
of water. The efforts intensified in the last year, when the aid
group CARE built about $150,000 worth of dikes and canals in the
region, said Boubacar Coulibaly, an official with CARE in Djenne.
</P>
<P>
   While the organization was waiting to collect productivity
results at the end of this season, Coulibaly said CARE's five-year
goal was to help triple rice production levels in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their remoteness, the villages have changed little
during the lives of the men and women there now. Far from lands
where changes are measured in faster Pentium chips, people here
note instead that at some point this century the production and
weaving of cotton was largely abandoned in favor of ready-made
cloths bought in Djenne. A primary school opened in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Gomitogo's population has grown faster than the people's
capacity to fill land on the plateau's edges and build houses _
limited as they are by the mud bricks to one-story structures. But
there is hope, Diakite said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy,'' he explained, ``I would go into the field
and bring back mud in baskets on my head for landfill. Now we have
oxen and carts.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no written records in Gomitogo, or in its neighboring
villages, Soa and Kossouma, so questions about the history of the
villages merely draw stares. In general, though, the villages are
believed to have been founded around the time that Djenne came into
existence in the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   For the chief of Kossouma, Djanguino Karankou, a cheerfully
ebullient man who greeted a visitor to his island with endless
welcomes, such questions about history were unimportant. Life is
good here, he said. His only complaint was, naturally, that the
rains had come too late this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we cannot blame God, because God decided so,'' Karankou
said. His smile conveyed the belief that so long as faith remained
strong and unquestioning Kossouma would endure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though the rains had arrived late, the last two years had
brought floods unseen since the droughts of the 1970s, Karankou
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the floods and rains have returned and that they
will stay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of Africa, arguably the continent least
concerned with dates and time, the people in Kossouma showed little
regard for such details. Asked how old he was, Karankou said 110,
though he hardly looked older than 70.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted. Some confirmed his age; others denied it; one man
said with great authority that the chief was actually 85.
</P>
<P>
   In Gomitogo _ which now boasts its 68th chief _ Karankou's claim
drew smiles, the kind someone from a big city might bestow on
someone from the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know him,'' Diakite said. ``He's not 110.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a contemporary of my father, in his 60s,'' Tombo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in agreement on that,'' another elder, Cisse Kampo,
said, as the men sitting in the shade of the mud wall nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his own age, Diakite said immediately that he was 44. But
a look of doubt quickly spread across his face. His forehead
wrinkled, he looked down at his hands and busily drew and withdrew
his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I made a mistake,'' said this lifelong resident of
Gomitogo. ``I'm 47. No, I was born in 1947. That's it. So I'm 52 _
52 years old this year.''

UAW CHIEF USES CONTRACT ISSUES TO RECAPTURE POLITICAL SWAY

(Attn: Mich., Wash.)   (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In the past, presidents of the United Automobile
Workers union, men like Walter Reuther and Douglas Fraser, were
well-known national figures not just because they could shut down
the world's largest companies but because they were politically
influential and frequently on television.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yokich, the union's president since 1995, has taken a
very different approach, shunning the limelight and focusing on
contract issues. Believing that he can communicate most effectively
with his members through local union leaders, he has said virtually
nothing in public during strikes and other showdowns with
automakers. While he has visited Washington frequently to discuss
issues like trade and global warming, he has favored private
meetings with politicians to parades and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But now Yokich is trying to rebuild the political power of the
union, most notably by negotiating paid holidays for 400,000
workers at General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler on Election Day
in 2000 and 2002. The prospect that more union workers might turn
out to vote, hand out pamphlets and drive other Democrats to
polling booths has alarmed Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part for Yokich, pollsters and politicians said, will
be persuading the rank and file to vote for candidates endorsed by
union leaders. Earning $50,000 to $120,000 a year, the union's
members are too affluent to benefit from many Democratic social
spending programs and are prosperous enough to be concerned about
income tax rates. Many members are conservative on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the leadership has tended to support Democrats, particularly
for president, perceiving them as more friendly on workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich said the union must emphasize political concerns that
apply to all members and transcend partisan politics. ``We support
those who support us; the party doesn't matter,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Two such concerns, he said, are international trade and global
warming. The problem is that neither former Sen. Bill Bradley nor
Vice President Al Gore has taken his positions on either issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich advocates balancing free trade with what he calls ``fair
trade,'' requiring other countries to follow rules on safety, the
environment, and workers' rights to form unions that are similar to
rules in the United States. He is particularly critical of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which he says has destroyed
more high-paying jobs than it has created, an assertion questioned
by many economists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley and Gore have long track records of supporting free
trade. Yokich said he was disappointed that they were not at a
peaceful protest by union members at the recent meeting of the
World Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming is another difficult issue for Yokich.
Automobiles contribute to global warming with each gallon of
gasoline they burn, so environmentalists have begun lobbying for
more stringent fuel-economy regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But the union contends that tighter fuel economy rules are
unnecessary because many other industries contribute to the problem
and because developing nations have not agreed to limits on their
emissions of the gases linked to global warming. Bradley and
particularly Gore have both called for tighter fuel-economy rules.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has not been as outspoken as Gore on the
environment, he supported a Senate resolution calling for much
stiffer fuel-economy rules on sport utility vehicles and other
light trucks, which are allowed much worse fuel economy than cars.
The measure was narrowly defeated on Sept. 15 after the union
joined automakers in strenuous lobbying against it.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich said he had expressed concerns to Gore about the Clinton
administration's policies on global warming, but quickly added that
he considered himself a friend of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to the Sierra Club, so you can't just say, `he's about
jobs for his members','' Yokich said. ``I belong to the Sierra
Club, I belong to Ducks Unlimited.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fraser said that Yokich had to become more active politically
because the most pressing issues facing the union _ like
international competition, environmental protections and health
care _ could not be settled at the bargaining table with
automakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the members of the UAW rests with Congress and
the legislative process more than it ever did in the past,'' Fraser
said. ``That's why you have to get more involved in the political
process.''

PARCELLS LOOKS IN THE GLASS, AND MAKES A PERFECT HANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (With JETS-PARCELLS) 
(nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ With his commitment of credibility fulfilled,
with his personal legacy secure, all that was left for Bill
Parcells to do Monday was honor Bill Belichick's service, and Leon
Hess' trust. All that remained was for Parcells to let the clock
run out, without fumbling the handoff of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said, ``I coached as hard as I could, right to the
end,'' and that included his giving Belichick the ball with the
best chance of breaking away from Parcells' intimidating presence.
Super Bowl musings aside, the timing on this play was perfect,
after an 8-8 season that should not be difficult to improve on, and
before the detested Robert Kraft could lure Belichick back to New
England to replace the fired Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   North Jersey Renaissance man that he is, Parcells read a poem to
his players, and made a promise to the press. ``There'll be no
rumors about Bill Parcells,'' he said. ``I've coached my last
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Parcells at the afternoon news conference made me
think back to when Dean Smith stepped down before the 1997-98
season as the basketball legend-in-residence at the University of
North Carolina. Smith had two great returning players, Antawn
Jamison and Vince Carter, but he abruptly retired, boxing the
school in, leaving the job to Bill Guthridge, his longtime aide.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge didn't win the title, but Smith's caring manipulation
and personal sacrifice forged a smoother transition for an
unglamorous man whose entire career was spent in Smith's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be Bill Belichick's shadow,'' Parcells said,
meaning that all football-related decisions will be made by the
Belichick, and that Parcells, in all likelihood, will not hang
around with a fancy title very long.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe an uncomplicated departure with no recrimination means
more when you realize it is your last chance to get one right.
Parcells' escape from New England to the Jets three years ago
created a quarrelsome mess that had to be cleaned up by the league.
Even when he quit the Super Bowl champion Giants in 1991 for
legitimate health reasons, Parcells was chided for waiting until
May.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, who would have been the logical replacement from
Parcells' staff, had already moved on to become head coach of the
Cleveland Browns. Belichick would have preferred the Giants, and
the Giants would have avoided the forgettable Ray Handley era that
ushered in a mostly unhappy decade.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, Parcells did it his way, on his time clock. He
bared his teeth, bullied most everyone in his path. An old man who
had come to him with the last, significant request of his life _
make me a winner _ finally humbled the autocratic Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a very strong obligation to Mr. Hess,'' he said. ``It's
very hard to explain, what that guy was like, how he called me
every week, how he was in my corner.'' Parcells let that thought
dangle. Just for that moment, his eyes appeared moist.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is still two years away from 60, his self-imposed
retirement age. He apparently decided he could not put in those
15-hour workdays for Charles Dolan, expected winner of the Jets'
ownership sweepstakes, for the glory of the rising cable bill.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' mission was to make Hess' laughingstock Jets a team to
be proud of. No one would argue that he failed. The Jets weren't
quite Cinderella, winning 29 regular-season games but only one
playoff game in three years under Parcells. This was apparently
enough for the coach, and probably for Leon Hess, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see him after that playoff game last year against
Jacksonville _ I can still see what he was wearing, the expression
on his face,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Hess didn't live to see Vinny Testaverde go down in Game 1 this
season, or Parcells stumble around for answers in the ensuing
weeks, or the Jets march behind Ray Lucas back to the threshold of
grand expectation. Parcells could have stayed on, chasing a bigger
finish, but he doesn't need another Super Bowl ring for the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He understands that. He knows who he is. That's what the poem,
``The Guy in the Glass,'' is all about. Personally and
professionally, Parcells said he knew it was over when he left the
field Sunday afternoon. It was time, before Kraft moved in, before
a new Jets' owner arrived to assert his control. It was time to
think of Belichick, of the Jets' long-standing continuity, of what
was at stake here for people besides him.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to take a good, hard look at the guy in the glass,
in the mirror. Maybe, when Parcells did, he asked himself what Leon
Hess would have said was the right thing to do.t

PRUDENTIAL SETTLES INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance
Co. has agreed to pay a total of $200,000 to 16 Missouri residents
who say the company discriminated against minority homeowners in
its underwriting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential last week settled its portion of federal and state
lawsuits filed in February 1996 against 10 homeowners insurance
groups. Fifteen of the plaintiffs live in Kansas City; one lives in
St. Louis. Attorney fees will be paid out of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sprenger, a Kansas City lawyer whose firm represented the
16 plaintiffs, all of whom are black, said the settlement was ``a
positive for minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   While settling the case, Prudential officials defended the
firm's practices in urban communities. Company officials said
Prudential had demonstrated ``a commitment to fair access.'' They
say the number of customers Prudential serves in urban, minority
areas is proportionately more than its share of the residential
insurance market across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Laurita Warner also said Prudential _ which has
about 1 percent of the Missouri residential property insurance
market _ agreed to seek state authorization to offer discounts to
homeowners in certain urban areas who meet safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Sprenger said lawsuits were still pending against nine other
insurance groups accused of either denying homeowners insurance to
minorities or charging higher-than-normal premiums.
</P>
<P>
   All of the insurance companies have denied liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complaints in all the lawsuits say that because of a
variety of underwriting rules and marketing techniques, and other
sales practices, homeowners insurance has not been available at
all, or not in the terms available in white areas,'' Sprenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprenger said discrimination tactics included the denial of
insurance based on the age of a home or its market value.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Department of Insurance studies released in 1993 and
1995 showed that homeowners in predominantly minority neighborhoods
paid larger insurance premiums than white homeowners, and received
less in claims.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent 1998 state insurance study found that residents in
high-minority areas had less access to insurance agents, more
restricted policies and higher complaint rates than residents in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Insurance Department spokesman Randy McConnell noted a
national trend of cases being settled against homeowners insurance
firms.
</P>
<P>
   He said insurers were required to sign anti-discrimination
pledges to do business in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have tried in various ways to ensure coverage for
minorities. But McConnell said developing language that guarantees
results had proved difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, citizens and consumer groups have also pressed
regulators in various states to release more information about how
insurers decide whom and where to insure.
</P>
<P>
   Sprenger acknowledged that insurers had begun marketing more in
urban neighborhoods, but he said homeowners insurance remained
``widely unavailable'' in minority areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sprenger said litigation was continuing against nine insurers
that collectively make up about 75 percent of the Missouri market
for homeowners insurance coverage. The companies and their percent
of the market:
</P>
<P>
   Allstate, 4; American Family, 17; Chubb, 1.5; Farm Bureau, 2.5;
Farmers, 8.5; Liberty Mutual, 1; Safeco//American States, 6.5;
Shelter, 6.5; and State Farm, 27.5.

LOTTERY GAME HITS $2 MILLION LIABILITY LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Too many Missouri Lottery players wanted 2-0-0-0 and
1-9-9-9 in Friday's Y2K Eve Pick 4 game _ leaving plenty of others
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers were selling like hotcakes all day long, and the
game hit its $2 million liability limit shortly before the 6:59
p.m. televised drawing, said lottery spokeswoman Susan Goedde.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only happens a couple of times a year,'' said Goedde, when
the potential payout for a particular combination of numbers
reaches the $2 million mark _ and sales of that combination
automatically are halted by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Goedde said 9-9-9-9 sold out Sept. 9 last year and 0-6-2 hit the
Pick 3 game's limit and was declared sold out one day in the summer
of 1998 during Mark McGwire's chase for the season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every lottery has liability limits on their fixed-prize daily
games, just like casinos have limits on how much you can bet,'' she
said. ``It's to protect the organization from going broke.''
</P>
<P>
   In parimutuel games, such as the multistate Powerball, multiple
winners split the jackpot, which is determined by the total amount
bet.
</P>
<P>
   The Pick 4 game, with a $5,000 daily jackpot, has sold $5.6
million worth of tickets since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, 2-0-0-0 and 1-9-9-9 weren't very good plays
for the final Pick 4 game of 1999. The winning numbers were
4-1-3-9.

MIDEAST TALKS RESUME IN MOOD OF GUARDED OPTIMISM

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Talks between Israeli and Syrian leaders
on a comprehensive peace accord opened Monday behind sealed doors
with what American officials described as a sense of urgency and
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations resumed where the parties left off three weeks
ago in Washington, with both sides indicating a determination to
engage in days or weeks of round-the-clock discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest issues are before them, involving security,
borders, water rights and political relations.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday's session was the beginning of a
difficult process and warned against unrealistic optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect to achieve a core agreement in one set of
talks,'' said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``At
the end, we certainly hope we can achieve real progress toward
closing some of the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came by helicopter to open this round of talks
between Ehud Barak, the prime minister of Israel, and Farouk
al-Sharaa, the foreign minister of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and al-Sharaa made no public comment. Clinton said through
a spokesman that he believed the talks were ``off to a good
start.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are being held in Shepherdstown, a tranquil
town on the Potomac River about 70 miles from Washington. It was
selected for its isolation, depriving the negotiators of
distractions and increasing the pressure for serious talks.
</P>
<P>
   American mediators have successfully used the technique of
enforced isolation in Middle East peace talks before _ with
Israelis and Egyptians at Camp David in 1978, and with Israelis and
Palestinians at Wye River Plantation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israel has sent a delegation of about 55 officials, including
the country's foreign minister, David Levy; the attorney general,
Eliyakim Rubenstein; Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the minister of tourism
and a former army chief of staff; Zvi Shtauber, the prime
minister's security adviser; and dozens of lawyers, military
officers and technical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's delegation includes 25 to 30 officials, including two
deputy foreign ministers, Yusuf Shakkur and Majeed Abusaleh,
Syria's former ambassador to the United States, Walid Muallim, and
several generals and legal advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, the president of Syria, is not attending this stage
of the talks but his presence at a more decisive stage has not been
ruled out. Assad has assured Clinton that al-Sharaa carries
``plenipotentiary powers'' to conclude an agreement with the
Israelis, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that delegates were not being held
incommunicado, but the normally talkative Israelis have agreed to
turn off their cellular telephones to lessen the possibility of
news leaks. The Syrian government has never been particularly
leak-prone.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations began at the National Conservation Training
Center, which is operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Rubin and Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, provided
the only public information about Monday's meetings to the press
corps, which is sequestered at Shepherd College.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the talks started, Clinton strolled through the
grounds of the training center with Barak on his right and
al-Sharaa on his left. In what was clearly a made-for-television
moment, the three leaders stepped onto a 200-foot-long pedestrian
bridge over a 25-foot-deep gully, pausing about two-thirds of the
way across to gaze out at the Potomac River about 300 yards to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cameras clicked and reporters shouted, but Clinton only smiled
and waved. Te men then walked silently into the gray stone
Commons Building, where Clinton met privately with each leader for
about an hour to discuss a negotiating strategy for the next few
days, officials said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also
met individually with the Israeli and Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The American team that is expected to remain behind for
negotiations included Dennis Ross, the administration's special
Middle East envoy, and his deputy, Aaron Miller; Martin Indyk, the
assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs; Bruce
Reidel, the senior director for Mideast policy at the National
Security Council, and his deputy, Robert Malley; and a supporting
cast of regional experts, note-takers and translators.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Donald Carrick, military adviser to Albright, was also
present for Monday's talks, and additional Pentagon experts were
expected to arrive on Tuesday as the parties begin to grapple with
regional security arrangements and the expected U.S. role in
monitoring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these negotiations the devil is in the details, and the
detail men will be the men that are going to play a critical
role,'' Rubin said. ``And we do expect that during this round, that
all of the issues, one way or another, will be discussed in detail.
But that's a very different thing than expecting that, having
discussed them, that they will achieve agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No one would predict how long the talks here might last. Rubin
said he packed enough clean shirts for ``more than a week,'' and
Barak is said to be willing to stay as long as two weeks if
progress is evident. Clinton has said he will return to
Shepherdstown as often as is necessary to help resolve conflicts or
to offer top-level assurances of America support for difficult
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond serving as mediator and broker for the talks, the United
States is certain to emerge as guarantor and paymaster of any
accord reached here. Israel is expected to ask for military
upgrades to compensate for the loss of the strategic Golan Heights
and economic aid to help pay for the resettlement of some 17,000
Israelis who moved into territories seized from Syria in the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, for its part, is looking for a substantial package of
economic and technical aid to boost its dormant economy and bring
it into the age of computers and global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not yet begun to consult with
congressional leaders on the terms of any new aid package for the
Middle East. It is not certain whether the Republican-led Congress
will agree to pick up part of the tab, which is estimated to be
between $10 billion and $100 billion over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, big deal, and a deal this big is going to carry
with it a price tag,'' Rubin said. ``But we believe the peace is so
important, and our vital interests could so be strengthened by a
peace agreement, that it is worth our playing an important role.''

BRADLEY AND GORE RENEW BATTLE IN WARM-UP FOR DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President
Al Gore, 1,125 miles apart, argued about the virtues of experience
and accused the other of having a vision too limited to deal with
problems that concern most Americans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Only those who have never left Washington have missed the
lessons of the last decade,'' Bradley told an audience of 400 in
Manchester. The audience first giggled and then applauded at the
obvious reference to Gore, who has held office in Washington since
1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only those who have embodied the ways of Washington have
failed to notice that Americans see Washington as a place that has
nothing to do with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Gore told 1,000 students and supporters in
Davenport, Iowa, that Democrats should be proud of the
accomplishments of the last seven years. ``We balanced the budget
for the first time in a generation _ and turned record deficits
into record surpluses,'' he said. ``We reformed welfare, and cut
the welfare rolls in half.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic presidential hopefuls will debate in person
twice this week, on Wednesday in Manchester and on Saturday in Des
Moines, Iowa. On Monday they warmed up, in speeches their staffs
advertised as important, with the ideas they think will play best
in Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses and New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley approach reflected some of the anti-Washington
themes that won primaries here for Jimmy Carter in 1976, Ronald
Reagan in 1980 and Pat Buchanan in 1996. In a line that recalled
Carter's promise to provide a government as ``full of love as the
American people,'' Bradley said, ``I'm not prepared to settle for
anything less than America realizing the potential embodied in our
ideals, in the creativity of our minds and the goodness of our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Without directly naming his rival, Bradley called the vice
president no more than a tinkerer. He referred briefly to his own
major campaign proposals _ providing universal access to health
insurance, ending child poverty, putting 600,000 new teachers in
public schools, registering all handguns and reforming the campaign
finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a comment the audience took to be aimed at Gore, he
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those voices that say we cannot do big things any
more, that we must tinker around the edges offering small solutions
to big problems. But I say now is not the time to be timid. Above
all, now is not the time to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took on his rival much more bluntly, scoffing at his
emphasis on health care. He said, ``Senator Bradley seems to
believe America can address only one thing at a time, or only a
very small number, and that health care is the only challenge we
can handle.'' He added, ``The promise of America means more than a
single proposal, done in the wrong way, at a price that leaves us
helpless to take on other great national priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Bradley's approach was, if not un-American, at
least un-Democratic: ''Can you imagine John Kennedy saying, `We
have to fight the Cold War; we can't explore the heavens or put a
man on the moon?' He knew we would do more. Can you imagine Lyndon
Johnson saying, `We can wage war on poverty, but we'll have to
postpone the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. He knew we could do
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley's vision was too small, warning that ``the
presidency is not an academic exercise'' or ``a seminar where you
get to entertain a single grand theory.'' For his part, Gore cited
a much longer list of goals, helping farmers, expanding health
insurance coverage, revolutionizing public education, making
preschool available to everyone, raising the minimum wage, easing
the ability of workers to unionize, and protecting affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, cultivating the rocky New Hampshire soil of
anti-Washington feeling requires a bit of juggling, since he served
in the Senate for 18 years and boasts of his experience there as
evidence he can get things done. So he emphasizes the years since
he retired in 1995 as a time when he got reacquainted with a nation
that has ``an abiding sense that Washington doesn't have a clue as
to where people really live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a state where he may be ahead because independents
can vote in the Democratic primary, Bradley attacked Washington,
and, by implication, Gore, for excessive partisanship. ``Only those
who have been mired in the battles of partisanship have failed to
realize that Americans are tired of partisanship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he has before, Gore suggested on Monday that Bradley made a
cowardly retreat, not an intellectual exploration, when he retired
from the Senate. Speaking of the seven-year Clinton-Gore economic
record, he said, ''There were many good individuals _ even in high
places in our own party _ who thought it couldn't be done. When
Senator Bradley retired from the Senate during President Clinton's
first term, he spoke of a `budget stalemate,' of a political
process that was paralyzed on creating jobs, on reforming welfare,
a continual deadlock. And he said that part of the problem was that
Democrats `cling to old programs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also criticized Republicans as he sought to rally
Democratic loyalists in Iowa, where polls suggest he is stronger
than Bradley. He said, ``When the Gingrich Congress tried to cut
education and slash Medicare and we stopped them, it didn't just
happen _ it happened because we took on Republicans, we fought
long, we fought hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And he criticized all Republican presidential candidates for
``endorsing tax cuts for the wealthy.''

</P>
<P>
   Bradley's other main topic on Monday, raised perhaps as a
counter to Gore's experience in the area, was the contradictions of
technology, which ``brings us closer and makes us distant at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With cell phones and pagers and e-mail, we're never out of
touch, but we're not face-to-face, either,'' he said. ``We're both
more connected and more isolated. Now we have so many different
avenues of communication that about the only thing Americans do at
the same time any more is watch the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said this did not worry him because ``every new form of
information and knowledge creates more liberty, not less. Democracy
always benefits from more information, more transparency, more
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate closed with an effort at inspiration, though
Gore's was more programmatic. The vice president said, ``Imagine
what this country will be like when every child has health
coverage, when we save Medicare and Social Security, when we invest
in world-class public schools, when we make bold new strides for
opportunity and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's raise our sights and broaden our vision. Let's reach for
the America that is in our dreams _ and also within our grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley concluded by saying: ``What does it profit us to expand
the boundaries of knowledge if we don't expand the circle of
justice. For though we're expanding the frontiers of knowledge, the
coordinates of the human heart remain the same, and that is the
ultimate challenge of politics, to touch the goodness that is in
all our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in an age of new possibilities,'' he said.
``Some people say we can never achieve our special destiny, but I
say, in a world of new possibilities, guided by goodness, we can
and we will.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators and governors from the West Coast and
Alaska, as well as oil executives and lawyers, have been flocking
to the Federal Trade Commission in recent weeks in what has quickly
turned into one of the most contentious political and regulatory
campaigns of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the FTC approved the largest industrial merger in
history a few weeks ago _ Exxon's $81 billion acquisition of Mobil
_ the agency's staff recommended that a second large oil merger be
blocked. Negotiations ensued between government officials and the
two companies involved, BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield. But the
gap over the proposed $29 billion deal remains wide, with the
companies and government officials unable to agree on what impact
the merger would have on gasoline prices on the West Coast, the
primary recipient of crude oil from Alaska's North Slope.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are preparing for what would be the biggest courtroom
challenge to a corporate merger in American history. Yet even as
they do so, the companies and their allies in Congress, in state
capitals and from their Alaskan oil operations are waging an
intensive lobbying effort to try to force a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Pitofsky, the FTC chairman, ponders whether to try to
block the deal, he has been besieged by hundreds of e-mail
messages, telephone calls and visits from lawmakers, as well as
from an array of corporate executives and consumer groups. He has
heard conflicting views about the deal from senators, governors and
state officials from Alaska, California and Oregon, some lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a full-court congressional press to get this deal
approved quickly from BP and ARCO and their supporters, folks who
carry a tremendous amount of influence,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore. Wyden met recently with Pitofsky to present what he said was
clear evidence of antitrust problems and to urge him to reject the
merger on any terms.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue is whether Alaska and the West Coast are such
closely related markets that production in Alaska affects prices in
California and neighboring states. BP Amoco and ARCO together
control about 70 percent of the Alaska oil production. FTC
officials have concluded that Alaska production and California
prices are indeed closely related, while the companies and a number
of private analysts maintain that prices on the West Coast are,
instead, set by the world market.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, joined by the state's two
Republican senators, Frank H. Murkowski and Ted Stevens, has told
FTC officials that any delay in completing the merger could have a
devastating effect on the state's economy. The state's oil
production has sharply declined over the last decade, to 1.1
million barrels a day from more than 2 million, as prices have
plummeted. New investment in exploration by BP Amoco holds the
promise of sharply increasing supply and heading off thousands of
layoffs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that the FTC has a different responsibility than
we do,'' Knowles said in a recent interview. ``We also have a
strong antitrust act. But I also have other concerns, such as the
long-term health of the industry, and the economy of the state, and
none of those are the responsibility of the FTC. They have just a
narrow antitrust issue. Their focus is solely on the downstream, on
the California gas pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the deal say the commission's staff has
fundamentally misunderstood the realities of the market, and that
there is no legitimate reason to fear that the domination of the
oil fields on Alaska's North Slope by BP Amoco, if it acquires
ARCO, would affect prices at gas stations on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is talking ideology and theory, not reality,''
said Roger Diwan, managing director of Petroleum Finance Co., an
industry consultant in Washington. ``There is no evidence of a
connection between production in Alaska and the price in
California.'' Diwan said gasoline prices were higher in California
largely because of higher taxes and a state requirement that
consumers buy cleaner, more expensive gas.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal reply that the ties between Alaska
production and West Coast prices are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that there is no connection between the North Slope
and Oregon is absolutely preposterous,'' Wyden said. ``It's
laughable.'' He said Oregon was a good laboratory of how prices at
the pump are dictated by North Slope crude. Oregon has neither
California's high local taxes nor its requirements for cleaner gas,
but prices are still among the nation's highest, by some
calculations as much as 31 cents above the national average last
year.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy the states, the two oil companies have offered a
variety of benefits _ what one lawyer has called ``grease'' _ that
have nothing to do with antitrust issues. They have pledged to
spend at least $15 million to clean up ``orphan'' environmental
sites caused by other companies. They have agreed to give $2
million annually, in perpetuity, to the University of Alaska. And
they have vowed to raise their charitable contributions in
California by more than 25 percent, to at least $100 million over
the next decade. Sir John Browne, BP Amoco's chief executive, has
also pledged to California's governor that he will continue ARCO's
program of providing gasoline at lower prices than competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The merger's critics, meanwhile, have been seeking to embolden
the FTC to take on the oil companies and undo the deals struck by
state officials in Alaska and California. They say the deal would
give the newly merged company a stranglehold on Alaskan production,
leading inevitably to price gouging on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, though, needs little to lift its confidence. It
is coming off its strongest year in decades, exemplified in recent
weeks by a stream of multibillion-dollar deals that cratered after
running into skepticism from antitrust officials. BP Amoco and ARCO
executives insist they will not cave in, as the other companies
did, and are so confident of their legal arguments and their view
of the marketplace that it makes little sense to propose huge
divestitures when the odds are strongly in favor of a court
victory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the FTC and BP Amoco and ARCO are still negotiating,
as government officials and the companies' executives try to reach
an accommodation and close a deal that would greatly realign power
over Alaska's vast reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is clearly in the hands of Pitofsky, a former
antitrust law professor whose grip on his agency is perhaps best
illustrated by his voting record. In his nearly five years on the
job, he has not cast a single dissenting vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and others who follow his agency closely say it is
inconceivable that his staff would recommend barring the deal
without coming to believe that such an action had the support of
Pitofsky, who has taken an active role in negotiations with the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Pitofsky declined to answer questions about the
merger. In general comments about the industry, though, he has
hinted at his skepticism about the merger unless there are more
significant divestitures. He noted in particular that the spate of
oil mergers in recent years was reaching the point that requires
particularly careful scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand how de-concentrated oil was
just five years ago,'' he said. ``It used to be that the top eight
companies barely controlled even 40 or 50 percent of the market.
Then Texaco and Shell did a joint marketing venture. BP merged with
Amoco. Exxon bought Mobil to become Exxon Mobil. Now the top four
firms have 40 to 50 percent of the market in the United States.
We're approaching the zone of moderate to high concentration under
the antitrust guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives at BP Amoco and ARCO were reluctant to talk on
the record while the deal is pending. Privately, however, some
executives expressed deep frustration and anger with Washington,
saying they are the victims of a particular hostility toward big
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of anger and frustration, and a strong
conviction that we have a strong legal case,'' one executive said.
``There is a limit to how much this procrastination can go on. We
have made it clear that we won't roll over and die.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have also made it clear that since North Slope
production is a crown jewel of the merger, they will not make any
huge concessions beyond those already made to the state of Alaska.
The largest concession is the divestiture of 175,000 barrels a day
of the 800,000 they produce. That divestiture would leave the
merged company _ which some in Washington refer to as BP ARCO, even
though no official name has been settled on _ with about a 60
percent share of production, which is still too much for the FTC.
The companies also say they haveameliorated any potential problems
through long-term contracts with independent West Coast refiners
for an additional 100,000 barrels or so a day.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal say Alaska's interests as the owner of the
oil fields are different from those of West Coast states that
consume the refined oil.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's staff has apparently rejected the argument that
Alaska and the West Coast have not been a single market for a long
time. In making that argument, the companies have noted that the
decline in North Slope production forced West Coast refiners to
look to other sources for crude oil and that the government ended
the ban on exports of Alaska crude to foreign countries three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the companies say, they have no power over West
Coast prices because the market is competitive enough and refiners
would look to other sources. In addition, ARCO has employed a
highly successful strategy of marketing gasoline at a discount by
using higher volumes and lower margins and has no interest in
abandoning that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics of the deal, like Wyden, Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., and a group of consumer organizations in Alaska and
California, say the divestiture still leaves BP Amoco with too much
control over North Slope crude, and would inevitably result in
still higher prices on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said he had told Pitofsky the deal was fatally flawed,
would do great harm to consumers in Oregon and adjoining states and
could not be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pitofsky is asked to approve it in some other form, they
will have to attach so many conditions and riders that the FTC
would not have the resources to monitor it,'' he said. ``The
companies would run circles around everybody. It may be bad news
now, but it would be even worse. We would need a new federal
department of BP ARCO to supervise it.''

 KCP&AMP;L calls off merger with Western Resources  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER and STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. has called off
its $2.1 billion merger with Western Resources Inc., saying
Western's falling stock price left them with no good reason to do
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his counterpart at Western Resources, KCP&AMP;L Chief
Executive Drue Jennings said shareholders in increasing numbers had
been asking that the deal be terminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger agreement is no longer in the best interest of KCPL
and its shareholders,'' said the letter from Jennings to David
Wittig, Western's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L exercised a provision in the agreement that allowed either
side to cancel the merger if it was not completed by Dec. 31, 1999.
The company had a special meeting Sunday in which board members
voted to kill it. Under the agreement, there were no fees to be
paid to or by either side if the deal was not completed.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was announced in early 1997, dragged through the
regulatory approval process, and Western's shares fell 49 percent
last year as the value of its investments in the Protection One
home security company and Oneok, a natural gas producer, declined.
Ironically, the deal had to be reworked in 1998 because Western's
stock price was so high Western was faced with paying more for
KCP&AMP;L than it had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Western's shares closed the year at $16.94, the lowest price
since the merger was announced. If the deal had closed with
Western's stock being so low, KCP&AMP;L shareholders would have
received a third less than they had been told to expect. Shares in
Western Resources closed Monday at 16.50, down 43 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also was pulling down KCP&AMP;L's stock, which lost 26
percent in value in 1999. The utility's management already had
cashed out most of its stock options when the price was nearly $30
a share. It closed the last trading day of 1999 at $22.06 a share.
KCP&AMP;L's board of directors, which has fiduciary duties to serve the
best interests of its shareholders, was under mounting pressure.
KCP&AMP;L shares closed Monday at 22.43, up 37 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings could not be reached Monday for comment. KCP&AMP;L
spokeswoman Phyllis Tilden said the company was reviewing its
alternatives and would comment in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Wittig said Western was ``disappointed'' the
deal had been canceled. He said the proposed merger made sense
``but it simply took too long to complete the process.''
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L's decision was not unexpected in the financial community,
said Edward Tirello, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown in
New York. The question is what is next for KCP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have laid out a number of possibilities, but at the end
of the day I think another merger is in order,'' Tirello said.
``That is what I think they will do. They are too small to be
successful on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Tirello said he would not be surprised to see UtiliCorp United
Inc. make another offer for KCP&AMP;L. Kansas City-based UtiliCorp and
KCP&AMP;L announced merger plans four years ago, but they were
disrupted by a hostile bid by Western Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was their merger partner of preference. I am sure they
will be chatting again,'' Tirello said. ``They could do it as a
merger of equals and not have to worry about the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cosley, a spokesman for UtiliCorp, said the company had no
comment on the dissolution of the deal or whether it would be
interested in a merger with KCP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L's decision to end the Western merger completes a decade of
frustration for the utility's strategy of trying to become a larger
company by merger or acquisition in order to withstand the rigors
of deregulation.

   More and More Companies Deciding Against Dividends
</P>
<P>
   A growing portion of corporate America appears to be concluding
that dividends are no longer needed to attract investors and are
therefore an unnecessary cost of doing business. Fewer companies
are raising dividends, and more and more large companies do not
bother to pay them at all. Dividends used to be a virtual
requirement to convince investors that a company's stock was worth
buying. Some institutional investors were barred from buying shares
that did not pay dividends. But now, for the first time in recent
history, a quarter of the value of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index comes from companies that pay no dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Humana Plans to Take Big Charge
</P>
<P>
   Humana, the troubled managed-care company, said that it would
take a pretax charge of $400 million to $500 million in the fourth
quarter, the latest in a series of charges and one-time items. The
latest charge will result in a loss for 1999, wiping out operating
profits projected at 63 cents a share. The task of turning around
the company has fallen to David A. Jones, a founder and former
chief executive, who returned as interim chief executive last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Managed Care Comes Under Fire
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care companies are under growing legal attack, including
at least 16 recent class-action suits, most filed by some of the
same lawyers who won huge settlements from the tobacco industry.
Several new state laws and measures in Congress could open the
industry to still more suits. And the federal law that has long
protected many managed-care companies is being whittled away in a
series of judicial decisions in malpractice cases.

   Manufacturing Grew in December
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing expanded for the 11th consecutive month in
December, and more companies reported paying higher prices for

businesses reported improved conditions.

 KCP&AMP;L calls off merger with Western Resources  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER and STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...the rigors of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   The first try was KCP&AMP;L's bid to purchase Kansas Gas and
Electric Co., which was snapped up by Western Resources. The second
attempt, announced in 1996, would have been a friendly merger with
UtiliCorp.
</P>
<P>
   Western Resources foiled KCP&AMP;L's plans by offering more money
and forcing UtiliCorp to withdraw. When Western and KCP&AMP;L came to
terms in early 1997, it was the first successful hostile bid for a
utility in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, KCP&AMP;L's chairman, said the transaction would have
benefits for all, including shareholders, employees and customers.
John Hayes Jr., then Western's chairman, also was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to be working together to take advantage of the
tremendous opportunities this merger presents,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   The price for KCP&AMP;L was $2.1 billion. The deal would have
created a company with more than $8 billion in assets and 1 million
electricity customers. Western's utilities, KGE and KPL, and
KCP&AMP;L's electric operations would have been combined in a Kansas
City-based company called Westar Energy.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the remainder of the planned company that especially
dazzled analysts and investors. The unregulated businesses,
including Western's Protection One monitored security company,
would have been separate from Westar but would have been key in
forming a corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to create a consumer services company that would go
beyond operating an electric utility. Indeed, the response to the
KCP&AMP;L and Western deal was so positive that Western's stock
increased so much that in 1998 the deal had to be redone so that
KCP&AMP;L's shareholders would not get more than originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   The only major concerns about the merger were over what
regulators would do. Missouri, Kansas and federal regulators would
have to approve the merger.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the regulatory proceedings did prove contentious.
Western sought to get as much as $1 billion _ the premium it paid
for KCP&AMP;L _ from ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the staff of the Kansas Corporation Commission agreed
to give them part of the premium. But Missouri refused and Kansas
regulators then took the same route. Both states agreed to let the
merged company retain a portion of the merger savings resulting
from the combination of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1999, Missouri and Kansas had approved the deal. As the
year closed, only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was
considering the deal, and its approval was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig, who had succeeded Hayes as chairman and chief executive
of Western Resources, said at the time that there was nothing in
the regulatory conditions that would cause financial harm to the
merged company.
</P>
<P>
   But by then there were greater problems. Wittig, a former
investment banker, had been one of the architects of making Western
into a consumer-services company through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, had begun to lose its luster. Protection One
was losing money, and the Securities and Exchange Commission was
questioning how it accounted for the cost of acquiring new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all of that, Tirello said he expected Western to do
well. He said that the company had made changes at Protection One
to get it turned around, and that he expected the company to look
for another electric utility with which to merge its energy
operations.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Perhaps no trend has made its mark on Sao
Paulo's changing cityscape more than the proliferation of
foreign-owned banks. After a wave of takeovers and heavy
investments in recent years, many Brazilian banks have been nudged
aside by institutions with un-Portuguese sounding names, like
Santander, HSBC and BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   However, the growth of these banks, with their colorful
nameplates, billboard advertisements and increasing clout in this
nation's financial services industry, are coming under criticism.
Fearful of the encroachment of foreign financial institutions, some
of Brazil's most powerful bankers are urging the government to
limit the power of foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The richest countries of the world are wise enough to realize
that national interests coincide with a strong, domestically led
financial system,'' said Fernao Bracher, a former central bank
president who now heads Banco BBA-Creditanstalt, a Sao Paulo bank
with Austrian shareholders, thjority owned by Brazilians.
``Why should Brazil, a developing country, be run roughshod over?''
</P>
<P>
   A reminder of the foreign banking industry's expansion in Brazil
came Monday with news that the government had approved a request by
the Bank of New York, one of the biggest and oldest banks in the
United States, to buy a controlling interest in Credibanco, a Sao
Paulo bank with large corporate lending and asset management
operations. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the
Bank of New York had owned 50 percent of Credibanco for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the simmering debate over limiting foreign banks has to
do with the privatization planned for later this year of Banco do
Estado de Sao Paulo, one of the country's largest banks.
Institutions as diverse as Citigroup's Citibank unit, and Banco
Bradesco, the largest Brazilian bank not owned by the government,
have shown interest in buying Banespa, as the bank is called.
</P>
<P>
   After the central government said last month that it would
authorize foreign institutions to bid for Banespa, domestic
competitors grew nervous. According to local reports, they began a
behind-the-scenes lobbying effort to ensure that foreigners would
be limited in trying to buy Banespa by, for instance, being forced
to bid in a consortium controlled by a Brazilian partner.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasoning is based on what they view as excessive foreign
bank incursions in recent years. There have been
multibillion-dollar acquisitions by Britain's Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp. and ABN-Amro NV, the Dutch giant. Other institutions,
notably Spanish banks like Banco Santander Central Hispano and
Banco Bilbao-Vizcaya, have also made large forays into Brazil's
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreigners have extremely deep pockets,'' said Paul
Bydalek, the president of Atlantic Rating, a Brazilian banking
analysis company. ``They don't necessarily understand the nuances
of Brazil's magnificent chaos.`
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, this means that Brazilian banks tend, in some
instances, to support the stability of the financial system in
times of crisis. For instance, in the tumult that followed the
devaluation of the currency nearly a year ago, some foreign banks
counseled their clients to avoid buying Brazilian government bonds
and other securities, citing the risk of default.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the largest Brazilian banks, such as Bradesco and Banco Itau
S.A., continued to refinance government bonds much as they had done
during the last several decades. In fact, the Brazilian
institutions that buy more than 90 percent of the country's
domestic bonds made out well in 1999 since most of these securities
were linked to the dollar or to interest rates, which remained high
for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the government is acknowledging this type
of argument. ``Foreign banks could cause a problem in not wanting
to roll over our debt so some type of ceiling on their share of the
system might be a good idea,'' Rubens Barbosa, Brazil's ambassador
to the United States, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of opening the banking system to greater foreign
participation say this thinking is misguided and exaggerates the
influence of foreign banks in Brazil's economy. Foreign banks
account for about 30 percent of banking assets in Brazil, but they
account for more than half of assets in neighboring Argentina,
where privatization and deregulation have been carried out to a
larger degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is pure self-interest in avoiding competition,''
said Gustavo Franco, a former president of the central bank who was
responsible for engineering Brazil's opening of the financial
system to foreign investment during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask the consumer if he prefers a foreign or Brazilian bank and
you'll be told his choice is the one which provides the best
service,'' Franco said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate surrounding foreign banks is largely limited to the
area of consumer banking, which providess with services like
checking and savings accounts. In the more exclusive world of
investment banking, foreign institutions have made enormous inroads
in Brazil, including the purchase of the country's leading
investment bank, Garantia, by the Credit Suisse Group.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas two or three years ago Brazilian investment banks like
Garantia, or Banco Pactual of Rio de Janeiro, dominated areas like
trading equities on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, or underwriting
stock and bond issues for Brazilian companies, today foreign banks
account for much of these business areas.
</P>
<P>
   This trend shows few signs of letting up, as reflected in the
Bank of New York deal for Credibanco.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal is completed, 53 of the 118 banks in Brazil that
are not controlled by the government, whether in the areas of
consumer or investment banking, will be foreign-owned.

DEFENSES TO FORCE ISSUE IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Virginia Tech playing in its first national
championship game. ``Pressure.'' Redshirt freshman quarterback
Michael Vick, age 19, being expected to make the big play at the
right time for the Hokies. ``Pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Florida State, No. 1 all season, seeking its elusive
second national title. ``Pressure.'' Junior quarterback Chris
Weinke, age 27, operating behind an offensive line that allowed two
sacks a game and will be facing a relentless Virginia Tech defense
that averaged five sacks a game. ``Pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   National championship games, like Tuesday's Sugar Bowl tussle
between Florida State (11-0) and Virginia Tech (11-0), carry their
usual stress-test levels of excitement, nerves, fear and
anticipation. But this game, even with the Hokies a solid underdog,
figures to overload the pressure points.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the players on both sides of the ball on both teams, the
potential for big plays is great,'' Virginia Tech coach Frank
Beamer said Monday. ``Preventing those plays will be a key. It will
be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting. That's a coach talking.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams, but especially Virginia Tech, push the envelope with
their defenses. The Hokies often crowd eight defenders to the line
of scrimmage. Their front four, led by defensive ends Corey Moore
and John Engelberger, usually don't need help harassing the
quarterback. If they do, Tech blitzes. A mistake _ a missed
assignment, a poor tackle, a sack or a fumble _ could result in
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it going to be a shootout? That's a big question,'' said
Weinke, who has thrown for 25 touchdowns this season. ``Both
defenses take a lot of chances. That would tell you there will be
an opportunity for big plays. That's how we're looking at it. It's
going to be a game where they're either going to get to the
quarterback _ me _ or we're going to make some big plays. It's not
going to be a boring college football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially with Peter Warrick on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' senior wide receiver/kick returner could be the
deciding factor. In last year's national championship loss to
Tennessee, Warrick was almost a nonfactor, totaling 69 yards on one
reception, one rushing attempt and one punt return. Even if they
have to put him in the shotgun and snap him the ball, the Seminoles
will try to get the ball in his hands at least a dozen times
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warrick's the most dangerous player I've seen with the ball in
his hands,'' Tech coach Frank Beamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said his team will counter
Virginia Tech's pass rush with draw plays. Tailback Travis Minor,
who averaged 74 yards rushing per game this season, has a history
of giving the Seminoles a ground boost in big games. In 13 games
against ranked opponents, he has averaged 97 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia Tech's pass rush is the best I've seen,'' Bowden
said. ``One of the ways to slow that down is with draw plays and
we've worked hard on that. We've got to have some success with that
to slow down their rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech allowed just 75.9 yrds per game and 2.2 yards per
rushing attempt. For the Hokies, stopping Florida State's running
game is Job One.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start running the ball effectively, mixed in with
their passing game, that's when they start toying with you,''
Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles hope they can toy with Vick, who thus far in his
career has shown the poise of a ... well, a 27-year-old
quarterback. He displayed his poise in Virginia Tech's biggest
victory. Trailing West Virginia 20-19, 1:15 remaining and no
timeouts, Vick moved the Hokies from their 15-yard line to the
game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being calm is just the type of person I am,'' he said. ``It's
kind of tough to get to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech has allowed just 26 sacks. But Vick's ability to
avoid tackles and make big plays has Bowden concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the ability to take a play that breaks down and beat
you,'' he said. ``He's the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as the Hokies hope to harass Weinke, the Seminoles want to
confuse and confound Vick with changing coverages and blitzes. The
risk/reward aspect is this: If Vick avoids the first wave, he could
break loose to either throw or run for big yardage. Or, he might be
hurried into a bad decision; the Seminoles led the nation with 22
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an attack defense, we're not a read-and-watch defense,''
said Florida State nose guard Corey Simon, the Seminoles' defensive
leader. ``We go out there to attack the quarterback, attack the
running back and attack the line of scrimmage. We're not gonna sit
back and watch anything. This is not a watching game. This is a
game where you go out and bring your hitting shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   And it figures to be a game, as both coaches have pointed out
all week, where the difference between victory and defeat could be
razor-thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's pretty simple,'' Florida State senior guard Jason
Whitaker said. ``If we keep (quarterback) Chris Weinke vertical, we
win. If we don't, they win.''

 &HT;    Robinson needed at go-to position again
 &HT;    BMark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ David Robinson is on schedule, and that makes
the San Antonio Spurs worth inspection during the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has become a notoriously slow starter in his old age, a
battered 34. So when he scores 28 points and 19 in consecutive
games, as he did did last week, it is time to monitor his impact on
a team struggling more than its 21-10 record would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say Robinson's performances were indicative of little
except the caliber of competition _ Golden State and Vancouver,
each so inept that its coaches were recently fired. A more focused
picture of Robinson will develop as the schedule becomes tougher.
The Spurs face Minnesota tonight, Seattle on Wednesday, and
Phoenix, Orlando and Utah after that.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson provides new-age explanations for why it takes him so
long to get going: teammates learning to trust each other; the
elusive rhythm he must find after ceding primary-scorer status to
Tim Duncan last season. Others believe Robinson's chronic back
problems inhibit him more early in the season than later, when
tight muscles become loose. Few people, if any, know Robinson's
condition from one day to the next, because he barely acknowledges
injuries, refusing to use them as an excuse. But he looks stiff
much of the time, ready to shatter like glass from the slightest
shove in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs need him in one reasonably functioning piece to
contend for a second straight NBA championship. Robinson is no
longer the player who has averaged 24.4 points and 11.5 rebounds
during his career. His 14-point average this season is
insufficient; he is shooting 47.3 percent, on pace to hit below 50
percent for the first time. That is why he scores less even while
taking the same amount of shots as last season, 10 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Robinson averaged 15.6 points, and even that might
not be enough in the juiced-up NBA, where scoring per team has
increased by nearly six points a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have allowed the fewest points in the league, but they
rank only 20th in scoring. Point guard Avery Johnson said Robinson
needs to produce about 16 points a game, adding that others should
contribute a little more. But Johnson, like anyone who knows the
Spurs, understands that Robinson is the best candidate to supply
the necessary boost.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs starters Johnson, Mario Elie and Jaren Jackson have each
averaged fewer than 10 points a game during their careers. And
while top reserve Terry Porter has provided kindling for the
offense, he is a 13-point-per-game scorer for his career.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Robinson as the man most likely to lift some of the
responsibility that has fallen on Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is no J.R. Rider. You won't find him whining about
teammates after a defeat or in need of transportation to the next
game, having missed the flight. But Duncan, on his way to an
eight-for-23 night during a six-point loss to the Lakers on
Christmas, looked frustrated by the lack of support. Robinson hit
two of eight shots, spending nearly half the game on the bench in
foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have to take the pressure off Tim,'' Robinson said.
``I've got to look for my shot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' offense runs through Duncan, who takes 18 shots a
game. But there are opportunities for Robinson on fast breaks, as
he runs a pick-and-roll with Johnson when Duncan is double-teamed
and must relinquish the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Against Golden State, Robinson hit 14 of 19. At Vancouver,
Robinson made four of nine, misleading figures because he
frequently was sent to the free-throw line, converting 11 of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has saved the Spurs more than once during his 11-year
career. After he was drafted by the team in 1987 out of the U.S.
Naval Academy, he spent two years in the Navy. When he was
discharged, Robinson had an option to re-enter the 1989 NBA draft.
Instead, he signed with the Spurs, a move that some people believe
allowed a franchise suffering from fans' indifference to remain in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Robinson relinquished to Duncan his role as go-to
guy on offense, agreeing to concentrate on defense. The formula
produced an NBA championship. Now they need Robinson to score. For
all anyone knows, Robinson might again be in a position to save the
franchise from disaster. Duncan becomes a free agent after the
season. When he looks at the Spurs, he will consider several
factors, not the least of which is the man playing next to him.

   Two head coaches were dismissed, another resigned and his top
assistant took charge, a playoff quarterback was benched, another
is injured and was replaced, and a Pro Bowl tackle is injured and
will miss the postseason in what evolved into a black-and-blue
barrage of National Football League moves on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll of the New England Patriots and Ray Rhodes of the
Green Bay Packers were dismissed after their teams failed to reach
the playoffs. Bill Parcells resigned as the New York Jets' head
coach and his longtime defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, is
the new Jets leader.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, quarterback Doug Flutie had started all but one of
the 16 regular-season games but was benched in favor of his backup,
Rob Johnson, for the Bills' wild-card playoff game at the Tennessee
Titans on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit quarterback Charlie Batch reinjured his right thumb, on
his throwing hand, and cannot play in the Lions' wild-card playoff
game at the Washington Redskins on Saturday. Gus Frerotte, a former
Redskin, will start for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   And Tony Boselli, a four-time Pro Bowl left offensive tackle for
Jacksonville, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee
against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday and was lost for the
playoffs. The Jaguars, however, have an extra week to solve the
problem because they have a bye this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, five head coaches were dismissed on the day after
their regular-season finales. This year, the action was nearly as
furious, and more head coaches _ chief among them Mike Ditka in New
Orleans _ are expected to be let go later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll earned a 27-21 record in three seasons in New England.
But each year under his leadership, the Patriots faded. They
produced a 10-6 record and reached the second round of the playoffs
in his first year, were 9-7 and reached the first round in his
second year, and crashed to 8-8 this year after starting 4-0 and
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll replaced Parcells, who moved to the Jets, and inherited
a Patriots team that had reached the Super Bowl the previous season
and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Patriots fans have come to expect a quality
football team and quality results, and we have not achieved that,''
Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots' owner, said. ``We need a momentum
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said, ``I'll forever be disappointed that we didn't win
more.'' He is expected to resurface soon as a defensive
coordinator, perhaps for Washington or the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who previously coached Philadelphia for four seasons,
coached only one season in Green Bay. He, like Carroll, replaced a
Super Bowl coach, Mike Holmgren, now coach of the Seahawks. Rhodes'
Packers finished 8-8 but had two three-game losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an excuse maker; we can blame ourselves,'' Rhodes said
about his dismissal and about missing this season's playoffs. ``We
missed out on too many opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so in a city and with a team where history consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great franchise; this is the cornerstone of this
league,'' Ron Wolf, Green Bay's general manager, said. ``Every time
I walk down these hallways, I am reminded of the great tradition.
This is a great responsibility. It's all about winning and losing _
that's why they keep score.
</P>
<P>
   `I was hoping this would be a smooth transition. But after the
second three-game losing streak, it was clear it was not. Our
players did not respond. There was a different pulse that was
reflected in our play. I had a long discussion with Ray last night
and he was not pleased, but I think he understands. I wanted a
disciplined, tough, hard-nosed coach, and that is what it takes in
this business. We didn't have that here. Is he a different coach
than I thought he was? Yes. We underachieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kraft nor Wolf named a timetable for selecting a new
coach.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, Flutie had started the Bills' first 15 games.
Johnson started against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday to give
Flutie rest for the playoffs. Now that Johnson has passed for 287
yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions and completed 24 of 32
passes in Buffalo's spirited 31-6 victory over Indianapolis, Flutie
will get extra rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is, with either one of them we can win,'' Bills
Coach Wade Phillips said. ``It was a tough decision. It wasn't a
haphazard thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Batch has spent much of this season on the sideline with his
injured thumb, and he cracked it again, on a helmet while throwing
a pass, in Detroit's 24-17 loss at Minnesota on Sunday. Frerotte
beat Washington, 33-17, late in the season at Detroit, but the
Lions will play a team that has traditionally dominated them.
Detroit is 0-19 in Washington, including 0-2 in playoff games. The
last one was a 41-10 loss in the 1992 National Football Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Boselli was blocking on a routine running play in the third
quarter when he injured his knee. Jacksonville beat Cincinnati,
24-7, and won home-field advantage through the American Football
Conference playoffs, but the victory was definitely dimmed. Ben
Coleman, who will replace Boselli, has had a gimpy knee all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of injuries, and this is obviously a huge
blow to our team,'' Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said. ``It's a
shock today, but once the time comes, I think we'll be ready.'' &QL;

MORE SMUGGLED ALIENS MAY BE EN ROUTE TO SEATTLE FROM CHINA

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A cargo ship scheduled to arrive at the Port of
Seattle Tuesday is suspected of carrying illegal aliens smuggled
aboard in Hong Kong in two containers, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation came as federal agents cracked down on a rash of
smuggling carried out in the crowded, dirty confines of cargo
containers stacked by the hundreds on huge, ocean-going vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, federal prosecutors in Seattle charged three Chinese men
with smuggling 12 of their countrymen in a 40-foot-by-8-foot
container on the OOCL Faith, a cargo ship that had just arrived at
Terminal 18.
</P>
<P>
   To get to America, the stowaways had agreed to pay tens of
thousands of dollars apiece, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time immigration agents have arrested alleged
smugglers for bringing in Chinese immigrants in containers at West
Coast ports, said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   INS agents have linked the Seattle smuggling to the recent
discovery of boxed human cargo at a Southern California port, court
documents say. The same firm, Lap Kei Trading Co. of Hong Kong,
shipped the container carrying Chinese immigrants on the OOCL Faith
and shipped two containers that arrived in Los Angeles on Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   INS agents n Los Angeles detained 30 illegal immigrants from
China. They had crossed the Pacific in containers on two different
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Steele, an INS agent, also wrote in court documents that
Lap Kei Trading shipped two containers with Chinese stowaways that
are expected to arrive Tuesday at Seattle's Terminal 18, presumably
aboard the California Jupiter. Steele's affidavit identifies that
ship as being suspected of having stowaways aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the INS nor the U.S. Coast Guard would provide further
information about the California Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   According to computerized tracking information, the California
Jupiter left Hong Kong on Dec. 20, arrived in Vancouver, B.C., on
Sunday, and left Vancouver at noon yesterday bound for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The INS in Seattle learned about the California Jupiter and OOCL
Faith last Thursday, according to court documents. A fax from an
INS office in Hong Kong alerted Seattle agents to possible
stowaways in containers on the California Jupiter and OOCL Faith.
</P>
<P>
   Such smuggling operations have occurred regularly on the West
Coast over the last year. The first known smuggling of illegal
immigrants in a container occurred April 7, 1998, in Tacoma, INS
spokeswoman Kice said.
</P>
<P>
   Two others have since occurred in Tacoma; four in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a troubling trend,'' Kice said. ``Some of
these ships have over 1,000 containers. It is, in a sense, like
looking for a needle in a haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Faith, owned by Orient Overseas Container Line, can carry
nearly 1,800 freight containers and intended to unload several
hundred in Seattle before heading for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, INS agents found the ``needle'' they were looking
for in both California and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When a cargo ship arrived in Long Beach, agents found 18
stowaways _ all Chinese nationals _ in a container.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, INS agents waited as the OOCL Faith arrived at 5:30
a.m. Agents knew the number of the container they wanted to see,
found it and had it loaded off the ship, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   They found 12 Chinese men inside.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions inside the container were filthy, INS officials said.
The ship left Hong Kong around Dec. 19, stopped in Kobe, Japan,
then headed across the Pacific for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an international smuggling operation,'' said Bob
Coleman, acting director of the INS in Seattle. ``There are usually
lights. There's food and water, and there's ventilation. It's not
like they're just put in there. There's some thought that has gone
into sustaining them in the voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the canvas-covered container, the Chinese men had food as
well as lights, and a fan operated by car batteries. The men slept
on small mattresses, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   They used buckets for toilets and apparently tried to use
chemicals to break down their waste. Coleman said the container had
a strong order of camphor and that the first agents in the
container wore suits to protect them from possible hazardous
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he suspects that the 12 men agreed to pay around
$40,000 apiece to get to the United States. The money would be paid
later by their families in China and the men, some of whom could be
subjected to something akin to indentured servitude to pay off
their debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these are random things,'' Coleman said. ``Alien
smuggling is as sophisticated as drug smuggling. There is a lot of
money to be made. Because of our economy, a lot of people are drawn
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The dozen men, believed to be in good health, likely will face
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the Canadian navy seized four ships trying to
smuggled 600 Chinese immigrants into British Columbia. Almost all
of the immigrants intended to end up in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant smuggling is often associated with Fujian province in
China. Fujian has a long history of smuggling, federal agents say.
It is just across the Strait of Taiwan from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the INS ends up arresting only the smuggled
immigrants, not the smugglers. But not on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after agents searched the container, a Chevrolet
Astro Van drove on Habor Island toward Terminal 18. Its driver
seemed lost and told a federal agent that he was looking for
Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   The driver and his two passengers were the three Chinese men
charged Monday. One carried a New York driver's license. Another a
map of Seattle with Terminal 18 marked in ink.
</P>
<P>
   At a hotel room the three men shared, agents found a bill of
lading for two containers expected to arrive in Seattle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men are in the United States illegally, according to
federal officials. A third has applied for asylum in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The three have been identified as Sheng Ding, Ju Shu Huang and
Yu Zheng. They are thought to be in their late 20s or early 30s. If
convicted of trying to bring illegal immigrants into the United
States, each faces up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   They are being held in federal custody.

BELICHICK WILL BE SOLE PILOT OF JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Having learned from the master of public
relations, new Jets coach Bill Belichick chose to lie low Monday
and wait for another day to meet the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry I was unavailable to comment on today's events,''
Belichick said in a one-paragraph release. ``My intention was to
allow this to be Coach Parcells's day exclusively and I look
forward to meeting the media in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, whose public personality is the opposite of the
voluble Parcells's, had a rocky relationship with the media during
his five years as Cleveland Browns head coach.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, where he was assistant head coach, Belichick was
barred from talking to the media, as were all of Parcells's
assistants. Days before the Patriots' loss in the Super Bowl in
1997, the NFL required that all assistants be available to the
media, and Belichick's interview seemed little different from his
Cleveland days: cautious and stilted.
</P>
<P>
   But it is whether Belichick wins games in New York _ and not his
media presence _ that will determine his popularity. Belichick was
36-44 with the Browns, perhaps best known for his banishment of a
Cleveland icon, quarterback Bernie Kosar.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's any question whether Belichick, an outstanding
defensive coordinator, can succeed as head coach on his second try,
Parcells went out of his way Monday to assert that Belichick will
be his own man with the Jets, and that Parcells _ elevated to chief
operating officer of the Jets _ will not be a ``shadow'' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will he leave all football matters to Belichick, said
Parcells, but the draft choices also will be made by Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said the majority of Jets assistant coaches are under
contract for next year, and he expects the staff to more or less
remain intact. It is expected that Al Groh, the linebacker coach
and another former New England assistant under Parcells, will
become defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill will be making the football decisions,'' said Parcells.
``I'll be available to consult with him in any manner that is
necessary, but Bill will be making all decisions that are pertinent
to the football operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, Parcells went on, ``may want some different things
than what I want, but that's just the natural evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells's forte, clearly, was his ability to motivate players.
It remains to be seen whether Belichick, a superior X-and-O coach,
can do the same. Even clearer is the record of the last two coaches
who followed Parcells; Ray Handley had two unhappy seasons with the
Giants after Parcells left and Pete Carroll had three mediocre
seasons in New England after Parcells left.

LUNCH PAIL IS SYMBOL OF HOKIES' DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Virginia Tech's defense prides itself on its work
ethic. The Hokies consider themselves a blue-collar defense.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that the defense uses a lunch pail as
its talisman. The black metal box _ think of the type that
construction workers used to lug to work _ is painted with the
school's ``VT'' logo. Each week, the team's defensive player of the
week is in charge of carrying the lunch pail to meetings, practices
and the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents what we're about,'' said Virginia Tech defensive
end Corey Moore, who is in charge of the lunch pail at the Sugar
Bowl. ``It goes everywhere with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hokies defensive coordinator Bud Foster has become a lunch pail
expert. The original lunch pail has been retired and sits in his
office. He continues to search garage sales and antique shops
searching for the perfect pail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to have an identity,'' said Foster, whose
defense leads the nation in scoring defense and is third in total
defense. ``Just because we don't recruit the all-American type
players, that doesn't mean they're not good players. What the lunch
pail signifies is that you're going to put in a full day's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of pride in what they do and in each other.
We demand they give great effort. We've played 750 snaps and every
one of those snaps were critical for us to get here. There's not
one play this year where I can say I wasn't happy with the
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Before every game, the defensive unit writes down a list of
goals and places them in the lunch pail. Then, after a victory away
from home, the defensive players often claim a piece of enemy turf
to carry home in the pail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their turf is our lunch,'' senior linebacker Jamel Thomas
said. ``We're a blue-collar team, hard-working, hard-nosed,
get-after-it-for-60 minutes defense.'' BOWDEN'S BELIEF
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden fielded several questions
Monday on how he handles his players off-field problems. Bowden
readily admitted that he's probably not politically correct and
that his methods of dealing with players aren't always popular.
``We recruit the same types of players we recruited 20 years ago
when we won the Sunday School Award,'' he said. ``If they're bad
characters, we don't sign 'em. It's not the bad guys who are bad
all the time, it's your good guys. Kids getting in trouble has been
going on for 2,000, 3,000 years. It's just now, everybody knows
about it. If you don't want people to know about it, don't be No.
1. Be No. 50.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Bobby Bowden said that junior defensive end Roland Seymour
won't start. He was one of three players punished for curfew
violations. The others were backup defensive back Reggie Durden and
kicker Sebastian Janikowski. ``If we kick off to start the game,
Janikowski will be out there,'' Bowden said. ``Unless he has a
heart attack. And we play 20, 25 people on defense in the first
five, 10 minutes, so it really doesn't matter who starts.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hokies coach Frank Beamer is good friends with Rangers manager
Johnny Oates. They attended Virginia Tech at the same time. ``I've
followed Johnny's career really closely,'' Beamer said. ``Every
summer, we try to get down to Texas for some games.''
</P>
<P>
   _ More baseball connections: Seattle Mariners manager Lou
Piniella is expected to be at Tuesday night's game. His son Derek
is a sophomore defensive tackle for the Hokies.

KENNEDY EXPECTED TO ENDORSE GORE   SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After several months of wavering, US Senator Edward M.
Kennedy will soon announce he is throwing his support to Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, an endorsement the
Gore campaign has been assiduously seeking and badly needs.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic sources say Kennedy, with nudging from the White
House, has agreed to announce his decision this week or next to
maximize its impact in New Hampshire, where Gore trails former US
Senator Bill Bradley. The New Hampshire primary is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final negotiations are taking place on how it will be
done,'' said one top Democratic source. Sources say Kennedy had
been trying to keep his decision under wraps until his announcement
could be coordinated with the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's office declined to comment. The senator's decision to
endorse Gore now breaks his traditional pattern of waiting until
the Democratic convention to endorse the party nominee. Previous
exceptions have involved Massachusetts candidates. The convention
this year opens in Los Angeles on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, while initially planning to endorse Gore, had been
hedging over the past several months as the vice president, once
the heavy favorite for the nomination, seemed to be stumbling while
Bradley rose in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But party sources said Kennedy faced intense lobbying from the
White House, where top aides reminded him of help the Clinton-Gore
administration provided for federal funds for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all over him,'' one source said. ``They came at him
really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy in recent weeks sidestepped questions about an
endorsement, although most political observers still expected him
to declare his support for Gore. The Globe reported last month
Kennedy had told an associate last fall he would back Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Kennedy touched off speculation when, at a
meeting with Globe editors and reporters, he praised Bradley and
said he would consider supporting the former New Jersey senator in
addition to Gore. Kennedy said he would take the Christmas holio make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to endorse, of course I'm going to consider both
candidates,'' Kennedy told the group at the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the senator's thinking said he was
attracted to Bradley's positions on issues close to his heart _
health care, campaign finance overhaul, and antipoverty
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bradley started coming through on issues that mean a lot
to him, it made Kennedy stop and think,'' said one source.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with polls showing Bradley running well ahead of
Gore in primaries in New England, Kennedy, who is up for
re-election this year, saw a political downside in backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   An independent poll taken just before Christmas found Bradley
leading Gore among New Hampshire Democratic voters, 48 to 36
percent. The survey, taken by American Research Group of
Manchester, marked the first time that firm's polling showed
Bradley with a significant lead.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken in June by the University of Massachusetts'
McCormack Institute up the first clear indication of
Bradley's strength in New England when it showed him leading the
vice president in Massachusetts, previously a strong political base
for the Clinton-Gore ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was having second thoughts,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy endorsement is crucial to Gore's efforts to hold off
Bradley's surge. While the senator _ and former candidate for the
presidency _ may notly sway many votes, an endorsement of
Bradley _ or even a neutral stance _ would have been a major blow
to Gore, given Kennedy's close identification with the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's support might also shore up Gore's standing among the
party's liberal activists.

OPPOSITION PARTY IN CROATIA LEADS IN EARLY VOTE RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Preliminary results in Monday's
parliamentary elections in Croatia, released early Tuesday morning,
indicate that a six-party opposition coalition should be able to
form a new government, ousting the party founded by Franjo Tudjman,
the late pt.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than a quarter of the vote counted, the
election nonetheless appeared to be a serious defeat for Tudjman's
Croatian Democratic Union, the umbrella nationalist party that has
governed Croatia since it became independent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman died last month after a long illness, with his party
deeply unpopular because of economic distress, high unemployment
and widespread allegations of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister is likely to be Ivica Racan, 55, the
leader of the Social Democrats, the former Communist Party, who has
promised closer and less abrasive relations with the United States,
the European Union and the international war crimes tribunal in The
Hague. He promises more attention to human rights and press
freedom. In return,is seeking Western help to ease the pain
of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   While officials of the governing party conceded the loss of the
election, another senior party official, Vladimir Seks, the deputy
speaker of Parliament, warned: ``We all have to wait for the final
results to come first. I suggest that the temporary winners not
rejoice too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Croatia experts have warned about vote-rigging and other
irregularities. Foreign election observers will speak about their
findings Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which sees an opposition victory in
Croatia as a model for squabbling democrats in nearby Serbia, has
made no secret of its support for the Racan-led coalition. It is
expected that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make an
early visit to Zagreb if the results hold up. That would be a sharp
contrast to the low level of diplomatic representation at Tudjman's
funeral, at which the American ambassador was the only
representative of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of the Social Democratic Party and Social Liberals
will need support from another allied four-party coalition in order
to have a stable majority in the new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The state electoral commission, releasing the preliminary
results after midnight, said the opposition alliance was ahead in 9
of Croatia's 10 constituencies. An 11th constituency is made up of
votes by 350,000 expatriates who hold Croatian citizenship, most of
them Bosnian Croats; they tend to favor the governing party, which
has supported them with large subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, the vote for the governing party is down in a
high turnout of more than 70 percent of 4.2 million registered
voters. The party is getting about a quarter of the vote, down from
44 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition bloc of Social Democrats and Social Liberals
is getting about 40 percent of the early vote, while the second
opposition alliance is getting 16 percent. But the country's
proportional system of representation means that voting percentages
do not translate directly into numbers of seats, and the number of
seats for each party is unlikely to be known until Tuesday night or
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Racan expressed optimism about becoming prime minister, saying,
``Together with the other opposition bloc, I think we will have a
very stable majority.''
</P>
<P>
   In a concession statement, the moderate foreign minister, Mate
Granic, who lost in his own central Zagreb constituency, said that
on the basis of preliminary results, ``It is clear that we have
lost the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Elections to replace Tudjman as president will be held Jan. 24.
The opposition has pledged to reduce the constitutional powers of
the presidency, but will need the cooperation of the now-governing
party to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Granic is Washington's favorite for the presidency, but he has
had trouble getting his own party's endorsement and is considering
running as an independent in a large field. The main opposition
candidate will be Drazen Budisa, the leader of the Social Liberals
and Racan's coalition partner. The election is likely to require a
runoff, probably on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The results so far in these parliamentary elections are not
encouraging for the governing party, which some experts think might
break apart in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Nikica Valentic, the governing party's candidate for prime
minister, said: ``Although we are only talking about a small
sample, the results are realistically below our expectations.
Obviously the electorate has been critical of our rule.''

LAW SUITS POSE BASIC CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ga., Ill., Mo., Texas)   (Subs 3rd graf to correct Herdrich's age to 35 sted 33 and to add
clarifying material) 
 (sw) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cindy Herdrich, a part-time legal secretary, said she suspected
all along that the sharp pain in her lower abdomen was
appendicitis. But Lori Pegram, a doctor at her husband's HMO in
Bloomington, Ill., did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen painful days later, the health maintenance organization
finally authorized an ultrasound scan. Too late. Ms. Herdrich's
appendix ruptured. She contracted peritonitis and required
emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herdrich, then 35, sued the HMO in 1992. And what began as a
simple malpractice claim has grown into the first direct challenge
to managed care to be accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has
been asked to decide whether her challenge merits a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means the only challenge. Managed-care companies
_ like makers of cigarettes, lead paint and guns _ are under
growing legal attack. This includes at least 16 recent class-action
suits, most filed by some of the same lawyers who won huge
settlements from the tobacco industry. Several new state laws and
measures in Congress could open the industry to still more suits.
And the federal law that has long protected many managed-care
companies is being whittled away in a series of judicial decisions
in malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care is under a very fundamental attack in the
judicial system right now,'' said William G. Schiffbauer, a
Washington lawyer who advises insurance companies and employer
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in many of these cases comes down to this: Does an
HMO, by linking what it pays its doctors with their success in
holding down ignore the best interest of patients in a way
that violates its legal duty as defined by a federal law governing
employer-sponsored health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimacy of financial incentives, and whether health plans
have a legal obligation to disclose them, is at the heart of a
number of recent suits against big managed-care companies filed by
prominent class-action lawyers. The HMO industry itself urged the
Supreme Court to resolve this matter, hoping that a ruling in its
favor would undermine the class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in the case in
February and a decision is expected by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law is the same one that has effectively barred
state jury trials and huge punitive-damage awards in malpractice
suits by transferring most cases to federal courts. A related
question is whether this will be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides see the Herdrich case as a fundamental
test of the underpinnings of managed care. Those on the
managed-care side warn of dire consequences for health maintenance
organizations if the Supreme Court upholds the idea that they can
be sued on this basis. And insurance executives say that financial
incentives are a crucial method of preventing wasteful practices
and do not interfere with necessary care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's employer-based health care system simply cannot
function or indeed survive if every treatment decision made while
implementing a managed-care program is treated as a fiduciary
decision,'' an industry group argued in a brief in the Supreme
Court case.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care executives said they did not intend to let
plaintiffs' lawyers determine their policies. ``This is the way the
industry has worked for some years,'' said Richard Huber, chief
executive of Aetna, the biggest managed-care company. ``To allege
that practicing according to the norms of the industry is criminal
strikes us as absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna is the defendant in six class-action and 40 other cases.
Similar class-action suits have been filed against Humana, Cigna,
United Healthcare, Foundation Health Systems, PacifiCare Health
Systems, Kaiser Permanente, a number of Blue Cross/Blue Shield
plans, and the Prudential unit of Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herdrich won $35,000 in damages in federal district court in
Peoria, Ill., a paltry amount compared with some recent
multimillion-dollar awards in state courts. The judge rejected the
argument that her health plan had not met its obligations under the
federal law. But an appeals court, while not resolving the matter,
ordered a trial on that very issue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herdrich refused all requests for interviews, her lawyer,
James P. Ginzkey, said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pegram also did not respond to requests for comment. L.J.
Fallon, a lawyer for her group, the Carle Clinic Association of
Urbana, Ill., said there had been no clear signs of appendicitis at
first, and a sonogram did not seem appropriate until a mass in her
abdomen became apparent a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John L. Coffey of the federal appeals court in Chicago
suggested in 1998 that doctors at Ms. Herdrich's HMO might have
been caught in a conflict of interest between safeguarding her
health and protecting their chances of getting a year-end bonus as
a reward for keeping down medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where physicians delay providing necessary treatment, or
withhold administering proper care to plan beneficiaries for the
sole purpose of increasing their bonuses,'' Coffey said, a
managed-care company may be breaching a ``fiduciary duty'' to serve
its members and patients.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel voted 2-1 to order a trial on the issue. The
full appeals court declined to review that ruling, and lawyers for
the managed-care industry persuaded the Supreme Court to take the
case.
</P>
<P>
   One widely accepted theory is that market forces will ultimately
result in the best care at the lowest cost, because health plans
and providers of care will compete to attract business. But Coffey
took a dim view of such reasoning, writing, ``Market forces are
insufficient to cure the deleterious effects of managed care on the
health care industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Joel M. Flaum said that he shared
those concerns, but that judges should not ``pre-empt legislative
and regulatory efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Financial incentives are among a weakening arsenal of
cost-control tools as managed-care companies maneuver to calm
criticism. A number of companies have eased requirements for
previous approval of medical treatments and established external
review boards that can reconsider the denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawsuits also made claims of fraudulent marketing,
accusing the providers of advertising that their care met high
standards but not making clear that financial incentives might
undercut those standards. Some suits seek triple damages under the
federal antiracketeering law, based on claims that the companies
engaged ``in a nationwide fraudulent scheme'' to mislead the public
about the essential nature of their business.
</P>
<P>
   The same lawyers have filed suits in state courts in California
contending that the companies violated provisions of the state's
business code.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks may grow more intense. California, Georgia and
Missouri have passed laws permitting suits against the managed-care
companies. A two-year-old Texas law permitting such suits is being
tested in the courts. And the attorneys general of Connecticut and
Missouri also jumped in recently with separate suits against
managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the House passed a bill in October that would
permit malpractice suits in state courts against managed-care
plans; such suits could not, however, be class actions. A
House-Senate conference is expected to take up the House measure
this year, said John Stone, a spokesman for Rep. Charlie Norwood,
R-Ga., and a principal sponsor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Richard F. Scruggs, the lead lawyer in several recent suits, is
a Mississippi-based specialist in class-action suits who played a
big role in winning huge awards against tobacco companies in 1997
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of class-action lawyers in various managed-care suits
include such well-known names as David Boies of Armonk, N.Y., who
is also assisting in the Justice Department's antitrust case
against Microsoft; Ronald L. Motley of Charleston, S.C.; John Eddie
Williams of Houston; Fred Furth of San Francisco; Russ Herman of
New Orleans; and Edith Kallas, of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP;
Lerach in New York.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Scruggs predicted that the new lawsuits would
force managed care companies to agree to change their business
practices in exchange for legal protection against potentially
ruinous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors drove down HMO stock prices when the latest suits were
filed in October, which Scruggs interprets as adding to the
pressure for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief for the Supreme Court, insurance industry trade
associations and lobbyists for employers laid out the arguments the
companies are likely to use there and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The brief was signed by the American Association of Health
Plans, the Health Insurance Association of America, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, and the Association of Private Pension and
Welfare Plans. It said that doctors, when making medical decisions,
were not acting as administrators and therefore were not subject to
the fiduciary duty provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, or ERISA, the federal law that governs employer
health plans and mandates that the plans act in the best interests
of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in a separate brief by the Labor
Department, agreed with the industry argument, but in December, 18
state attorneys general urged the Supreme Court to uphold the
appeals court's order for a trial on whether Ms. Herdrich's HMO
placed its own financial interests ahead of the interests of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, industry lawyers said that if the door was opened
wide to malpractice lawsuits against HMO's, they would have to
charge higher premiums, driving away customers and adding to the 43
million people without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On another tack, the industry argued that encouraging managed
care was a public policy legislated and regulated by Congress and
the states. Changing such a policy should be left to legislatures
and to commercial decisions that reflect market forces, not decreed
by courts, the industry said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts cautioned against trying to predict how the
Supreme Court might resolve this issue. It could shore up the ERISA
shield, or it could weaken it. The court could also issue a narrow
opinion without addressing larger policy issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, ERISA has protected health plans by requiring
that most malpractice suits be heard in federal courts, where
damages are strictly limited. But in a number of recent cases,
federal courts made exceptions that permitted suits in state
courts.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled in 1998 that a New
Jersey couple had the right to bring medical negligence charges in
state court against their HMO, doctor and hospital. Steven and
Michelle Bauman blamed the plan when their baby died in 1995, the
day after Mrs. Bauman and the baby were sent home under a 24-hour
maternity policy then in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are human; they want to be generous,'' said Clark
Havighurst, a health law expert at Duke University law school.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook is murky for the class actions. Legal experts
say that, for one thing, it may be difficult to persuade judges
that health plan members have enough in common to be certified as a
class.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts ruled against class action lawyers in two recent
decisions. On Sept. 29, a federal district judge in Philadelphia
denied class-action status in a suit accusing Aetna of fraudulently
advertising that its primary concern was quality of care, not cost
controls. The judge said the plaintiffs could not sue because they
had advanced ``a vague allegation'' and failed to show that they
had been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, a district judge in Houston denied a request for
class-action status in a suit against Nylcare that also argued that
advertising to consumers was misleading. The judge suggested it was
not clear whether ``a particular consumer saw a particular
advertisement'' and was misled by that advertisement or induced by
it to join a Nylcare HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Supreme Court says in the Herdrich case will make a
big difference,'' said Peter D. Jacobson, an associate professor of
health policy at the University of Michigan School of Public
Health. &QL;

HUMANA QUARTERLY CHARGE WILL RESULT IN LOSS IN 1999
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky., Minn.)  (af)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humana Inc., the troubled managed-care company, said Monday that
it would take a pretax charge of $400 million to $500 million in
the fourth quarter, the latest in a series of charges and one-time
items. The latest charge will result in a loss for 1999, wiping out
operating profits projected at 63 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The write-off reflects disappointing results from Humana's 1997
purchase of the Physicians Corp. of America70 million in
cash and $130 million in debt. Humana indicated that it would lower
the value assigned to good will in the purchase, which suggests
that the price, which was considered low at the time, was still too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians Corp. provided coverage for 1.1 million managed-care
members, but almost half were in state Medicaid programs that
typically have slim profit margins. Humana, based in Louisville,
Ky., is one of the largest managed-care companies, with about six
million members.
</P>
<P>
   Lori M. Price, a health care analyst at CIBC World Markets, said
the company, which has had a string of setbacks that battered its
stock, wanted to clear the decks and improve its balance sheet by
taking as big a charge as could be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Humana fell 62.5 cents, to $7.5625, on the New York
Stock Exchange after the announcement. The price has plummeted 75
percent from $32 in 18 months since the collapse of a proposed $5.5
billion merger in 1998 with the UnitedHealthcare unit of the
UnitedHealth Group, based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Humana's executives spent several months preparing for the
United merger and were distracted further while they explored a
merger with the health care unit of the Prudential Life Insurance
Co., which was sold to Aetna Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Gregory H. Wolfe resigned after one year as chief
executive. David A. Jones, a founder and former chief executive,
returned as interim chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going through a transition,'' said Kenneth S.
Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ``Dave Jones will
do whatever he has to do to fix the company. He is a competent
experienced manager with a good track record for fixing things.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge includes $65 million of booked loss on the sale for
$125 million in cash of the marginally profitable workers'
compensation unit of Physicians Corp. to FolksAmerica Holding Co.
Inc. of New York, a unit of the White Mountains Insurance Group,
which is based in Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Humana said it had also agreed to sell its money-losing Medicare
supplemental coverage to the United Teachers Associates Insurance
Co. of Austin, Texas, for an undisclosed price. Analysts said
Humana would be glad to unload the unit, no matter the price.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Kumar, a health care analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said
Humana had not met Wall Street investors' expectations for the last
few years, but ``performance in 2000 should be substantially
better.'' The company ``is repositioning itself in its core market
and raising premium rates,'' he said. ``These are things that
should have been done last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Humana was boxed in by several multiyear contracts that delayed
premium increases. And its substantial Medicare business was also
affected when Washington put a lid on increases for Medicare health
maintenance organizations. Managed-care companies are now reporting
double-digit premium increases from many commercial, non-Medicare
customers this year. &QL;

DEMOCRATS VARY SUBTLY ON EDUCATION GOALS
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE, BRADLEY, BRADLEY-AD) 
(nk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to education, the difference between the
Democratic presidential candidates is not so much what they have to
say as how often they say it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley want to
expand early childhood education. Both would dangle dollars to
entice quality teachers to work in impoverished schools and would
pump money into after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore has made education a central issue of his
campaign, Bradley has subtly woven it through the themes of child
poverty and working families, which form two of the four pillars of
his platform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began the race with an education address and recently
rolled out what he has called a sweeping plan to ``revolutionize
American education'' with an infusion of $115 billion over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's education proposals add up to $90 billion for 10
years, but he has yet to devote a full speech to the subject or
release a comprehensive education plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley doesn't seem that interested in the topic,'' said
Michael D. Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great
City Schools, a coalition of the nation's 50 largest school
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seemed more focused on health care, Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a shrewd strategic decision in a primary fight where
there is little substantive disagreement. Gore, endorsed by the
nation's two teachers' unions, wants to mobilize a core Democratic
constituency on one of its favorite issues; Bradley hopes to
capitalize on voters' anger over health care, an issue on which the
vice president might be vulnerable because of the failure of the
Clinton administration's health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said both candidates ``have made the correct calculus for
their campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   With education topping the list of public concerns in several
polls, it has been a frequent focus of speeches and debates among
candidates in both parties, even though the Department of Education
represents only 7 percent of the federal budget and the federal
government controls only $1 of every $10 spent on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is running for any office, from dogcatcher to president
of the United States,'' said Arthur Levine, president of Teachers
College at Columbia University, ``you absolutely have to have an
education platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention, several education experts say they
are disappointed with much of what the Democratic candidates have
proposed for recruiting teachers and improving student achievement.
They say many of the ideas are incremental and avoid complex issues
_ from equity in financing to bilingual education _ that are vexing
school superintendents, mayors and governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we invest more money in doing the same stuff, we're likely
to get the same results,'' said Amy T. Wilkins of the Education
Trust, a Washington group that focuses on closing the race- and
class-based achievement gap. ``It's like old wine, new bottles, but
more old wine. So we get a bad hangover.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential headache is developing from the frequent
tangling over the question of taxpayer-financed vouchers for
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, backed by the two teachers' unions, which ardently oppose
vouchers, has hammered Bradley for his votes in the Senate to
support voucher experiments in Cleveland and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has said that, unlike several Republican contenders,
he does not see vouchers as the solution to public education's
problems. In any case, vouchers involve a fraction of the nation's
students and have little to do with who is president.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a distraction,'' said Susan Fuhrman, dean of the
school of education at the University of Pennsylvania. ``It doesn't
get to the core of serious educational problems in public
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   On the more substantive education questions, the two candidates
have similar philosophies but offer slightly different routes to
solving the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   Both are emphatic about the importance of prekindergarten
initiatives, which research has shown are crucial to long-term
success in school. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner
for the Republican presidential nomination, also wants to expand
preschool programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore promises to give states $50 billion over 10 years to set up
preschool programs _ some operated by private groups _ for every
4-year-old and an unknown number of 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes $2 billion a year for infant and toddler
programs, plus a doubling of money for the Head Start program over
four years so all eligible poor children can enroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan would help working-class families, whose children
currently have the lowest preschool attendance rates. But several
states already have aggressive plans in the works for 3- and
4-year-olds, so Bradley's program for birth to age 3 fills another
gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one talks about expansion, one can't escape the need to
improve quality at the same time,'' said Ms. Fuhrman, who also runs
the Center for Policy Research in Education. ``It's not just
prorating out what's currently spent by the numbers of children.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates also echo each other on the need for better
teachers in impoverished urban and rural schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley suggests a loan forgiveness program for 60,000 college
graduates and scholarships for 10,000 high school seniors who
commit to teach in disadvantaged schools for four or five years,
estimating the cost at $1.3 billion annually. Gore would go
further, using federal money to offer $5,000 and $10,000 bonuses to
teachers in impoverished districts, in addition to a loan
forgiveness program and money for training second-career teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But neither candidate deals with the questions of how to recruit
better candidates into the profession, retain quality teachers in
difficult schools or improve teacher-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need incentives for people to enter high-quality training
programs,'' said Tom Corcoran, co-director of the Center for Policy
Research in Education. ``We need incentives for universities to
treat teacher education seriously and not treat it as a cash cow.''
</P>
<P>
   For after-school programs, Gore vows to ``dramatically
increase'' federal spending, but offers few details. Bradley
suggests spending $1 billion to replicate a New York program at
2,000 sites nationwide, and another $300 million to get older
people to volunteer as mentors. In New York, an after-school
program has been used to reinforce lessons taught during the day.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In some areas the two candidates do not cross paths.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wants to spend $400 million on thn's network of
community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a list of proposals that lack clear price tags:
creating small high schools, charter schools and a Web site
offering advanced placement courses; establishing teacher
certification tests; and establishing a high school exit
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the biggest distinction is a strategic one, concerning
how a president _ or, at least, a presidential candidate _ should
consider education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sees it as a centerpiece, the key to his broader campaign
theme of extending prosperity throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will do more to help close the gap between rich and
poor than lifting up our worst schools,'' said Bruce Reed, the
White House domestic policy adviser. ``Education is too important
to the county's future foext president to leave it toocal level.''
</P>
<P>
   While talk of school reform fills two of the eight pages of
Gore's stump speech, Bradley rarely discusses the subject directly.
Typical of his approach was the anecdote with which he opened a
recent speech. Recalling a Minnesota fourth-grader who told him
that she had skipped breakfast that morning because it was not her
turn, Bradley focused not on education but on children too hungry
to concentrate and teen-agers who think they must carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with education, you are dealing with poverty and
you are dealing with hunger and you are dealing with preparation,''
said Eric Hauser, Bradley's press secretary. ``It's an attempt to
see education as part of a larger picture, because it is part of a
larger picture.''

U.S. INVESTIGATES NEW TREND IN IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal officials were investigating Monday what
was seen as a disturbing trend in smuggling illegal immigrants
after the discovery Sunday of 30 stowaways in containers on cargo
ships in Long Beach, Calif., and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries were made less than a week after two other
groups of illegal Chinese immigrants were found in similar
containers on cargo ships in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to court documents in Seattle, two more
containers with Chinese nationals were expected to arrive there on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a relatively new and troubling trend,'' said Virginia
C. Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent cases, soft-top containers about the size of a
tractor-trailer were used to carry Chinese stowaways who paid as
much as $70,000, more than twice the amount charged by people
operating ships devoted primarily to smuggling, Ms. Kice said.
</P>
<P>
   A cargo ship can carry as many as 1,000 of these containers,
which can make it difficult to detect stowaways. The smugglers
often lash down the heavy canvas covers on the containers using
ther grommet to make escape easier and provide ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kice said identifying the organizers of the
container-smuggling operations is more difficult because the
stowaways are not necessarily accompanied, as they were on previous
smuggling ships.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle case, though, the authorities have charged three
men who apparently went to meet the containers with attempting to
bring illegal aliens into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The exporter of all three of the containers sent to Seattle and
two of the containers that arrived in Los Angeles last week was
identified in court papers as Lap Kei Trading Co. of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kice said that while there was ence that the ship
owners were involved, federal officials were looking into making
shipping companies more responsible for stowaways by holding them
liable for some of the costs of detention.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Ms. Kice said, the conditions in the containers were
better than those of the old smuggling ships that carried more
people and took longer to make the journey across the Pacific.
Typically, a smuggling ship would carry about 200 people, she said,
but the containers usually carry fewer than 25.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who have seen both types of smuggling said the
containers tend to be more sanitary, with makeshift latrines and
better provisions, such as bedding and pillows. The detainees in
the recent cases were also better dressed, wearing clothing like
Nike tennis shoes. Some had portable phones and compact disc
players.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Kice said, it was unknown whether that meant that the
passengers were more well-to-do or that they had been provided with
items like proper clothing to blend in better on the street.
</P>
<P>
   While conditions might be better, authorities said that people
who choose such transportation still face a daunting journey. The
trailers can be stacked up to 10 high, which is like crossing the
ocean in a tractor-trailer 10 stories up.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have had a working group of agencies examining
container smuggling since early last year. The first such case
known to officials occurred in April 1998, when a Liberian-flagged
vessel arrived in Tacoma, Wash., with 18 to 20 stowaways from
China. Since then there have been eight cases, including four this
past week.
</P>
<P>
   While federal authorities said they would increase enforcement
efforts to combat container smuggling, Ms. Kice said the smugglers'
change in approach was an indication that other enforcement efforts
had been effective.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, authorities were faced with a spate of
smuggling of illegal immigrants on ships. One of the most notable
was the Golden Venture, which ran aground in June 1993 on a sandbar
near Far Rockaway, N.y. Ten passengers died after jumping into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese smuggling has been on our radar screen for years,''
Ms. Kice said. ``This is the smuggler adjusting their strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29, the authorities detained 21 people at the Port of
Long Beach and nine at Los Angeles Harbor as they emerged from
hiding in cargo containers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 18 stowaways were found by crew members inside a
cargo container on the Zim Shekou as it was coming into the Port of
Long Beach. The ship had apparently left Hong Kong about three
weeks ago and had a stopover in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, 12 men were found aboard the ship OOCL Faith, which
is owned by Orient Overseas Container Line of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said all those detained in the last week remained in
custody and were being interviewed. The process is complicated
because there are so many different dialects that it can be
difficult to find interpreters.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Jan. 2,

MINDFUL OF ITS IMAGE, COKE STRIVES TO RETAIN BLACK EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to repair some of the damage to Coca-Cola's public image,
the company's incoming chairman and chief executive, Douglas N.
Daft, has been negotiating intensely with Carl H. Ware, the
company's lone black senior vice president who in November
announced his intention to leave the company, in hopes of
persuading him to accept a high-profile job.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the situation said Monday that Daft began the
talks soon after he was named to succeed M. Douglas Ivester, who
shocked the company and the business world last month by abruptly
announcing his own resignation. The jobs under discussion for Ware,
who is president of the company's Africa division, include
``expanded responsibilities,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Ware's resignation, at 56, caused consternation within the civil
rights community in Atlanta, where Coke is based, because it
effectively removed the company's highest-ranking black executive
while Coca-Cola is being sued by current and former employees over
racial discrimination. Ware is also one of two executives heading a
diversity council at the company; the council was formed after the
lawsuit was filed last April. Without Ware, the senior management
at Coca-Cola is entirely white and male.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has three black vice presidents out of 24. Two new
vice presidents were named last month, along with two new senior
vice presidents; all of those are white. Coca-Cola Enterprises, the
largest Coca-Cola bottler, last month named its treasurer, Vicki R.
Palmer, special assistant to the chief executive and promoted her
to senior vice president; Ms. Palmer, who will continue as
treasurer, is black.
</P>
<P>
   A Coke spokesman refused Monday to comment on the talks. But two
civil rights leaders in Atlanta praised the effort. Persuading
Ware, a former Atlanta city councilman, to stay on ``would be the
wisest thing they could possibly do,'' said Joe Beasley, the human
resources director at Antioch Baptist Church North, a stone's throw
from Coca-Cola's headquarters. ``They should put him in as the No.
2 man. No question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ware's resignation has also been cited in news reports as one of
several incidents that may have upset key members of Coca-Cola's
board in the weeks before Ivester resigned. Directors have referred
calls for comment on what led to the resignation to Coke's public
relations department, and Coca-Cola spokesmen say they do not know
what happened, apart from what Ivester offered in a statement at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, 52, who spent just 25 months as chairman and chief
executive, said he was leaving ``to move on to the next stage of my
life.'' A brilliant planner who masterminded the interlocking
relationship between Coca-Cola and its bottlers around the world,
Ivester was criticized for what was seen as insensitivity and
arrogance in certain situations. His tenure was clouded by
declining worldwide profits, scuttled acquisition plans and the
biggest product recall in company history last June.
</P>
<P>
   He announced a management reorganization in late October, which
required Ware to report to Daft, then a senior vice president,
instead of Ivester himself. Ware announced plans to step down a few
days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put two and two together, one has to speculate that
it didn't go well with him,'' said the Rev. Joseph Wheeler, who
heads the Clayton County branch of the NAACP, near Atlanta. ``It
was a big shock to the black community after hearing Ivester talk
about putting this diversity council together.''
</P>
<P>
   One industry expert said the move would be positive for
Coca-Cola. ``It makes a lot of sense to try to keep an executive
like Carl Ware on the team,'' said John D. Sicher, editor of
Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ``I imagine there will be
more changes in the upper echelons of the company in the months to
come.''

AGIS SALPUKAS, TIMES REPORTER AND PAINTER, DIES AT 60
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ohio, N.J., N.Y., Mich., Mass., Va.)   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agis Salpukas, a reporter for The New York Times who covered
business news for much of his career, died Monday. He was 60 and
lived in Tenafly, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found in the Hudson River off Manhattan, said Eorakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner. He
was pronounced dead at 5:50 a.m. by the Emergency Medical Service.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Vincent Gravelli, a spokesman for the Police
Department, said the medical examiner's office was investigating
Salpukas' death, but he added, ``Foul play is not suspected.''
</P>
<P>
   Salpukas was being treated for depression at the New York
Psychiatric Institute, said his wife, the former Mary Carrington.
</P>
<P>
   Salpukas began working at The Times in 1963, and most recently
was a financial reporter. He was also a professional painter, known
for the vivid expression and intense colors of his canvases.
</P>
<P>
   His approach when he traveled to Youngstown, Ohio, to cover
developments in the steel industry was indicative of his twin
passions. After his reporting was done, he would return to the
steel mills with brush and easel to create dramatic scenes of
industrial inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Agis Francis Salpukas was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, on June 4,
1939. After his mother was killed in an explosion on a train, he
and her, a bookkeeper, went to Germany, where they stayed
until he was 9. After that, they came to the United States and
lived in the Bronx and Queens, where Salpukas attended public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Long Island University, he studied at
Columbia and received a master's degree in history. He joined The
Times as a news clerk in September 1963. In 1967, during a
three-week tryout as a reporter, he wrote a front-page article and
was assigned to work in the suburbs. He joined the national staff
in 1970 and became Detroit bureau chief in 1973, later returning to
New York to cover business topics.
</P>
<P>
   He began to paint during a 12-week newspaper strike in 1978
after his wife noticed that he was becoming restless and urged him
to sign up for a painting course. His teacher was Vincent Capraro,
an artist who now lives in Piermont, N.Y. In recent years,
Salpukas' art has been displayed and sold in galleries, including
the Jadite gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Stephen, of
Richmond, Va., and Michael, of Somerville, Mass.; a daughter,
Margaret Lesser of Tenafly, and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a restorer as well as a painter, he painstakingly
restored a portrait of the heavyweight champion John Sullivan in
Gough's, a gritty saloon that used to be across West 43rd Street
from The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Once almost invisible because of generations of darkness and
smoke, it eventually gleamed brightly. Salpukas charged nothing.

WAL-MART LOWERS ITS PRICES AT STORES ACROSS GERMANY
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has circled quietly
over German retailers for nearly two years. Monday, it attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which acquired two German supermarket chains in the
last two years, began its first big price-cutting campaign, on
products ranging from white chocolate to vacuum cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   The move sent a chill through German retailers, which have
already been battered by price wars and have been terrified about
Wal-Mart ever since it arrived in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Metro AG, which is based in Cologne and is Germany's
biggest retailer, dropped 4.4 percent on the news, to 51.05 euros
($52.37). Shares in KarstadtQuelle AG, another major competitor,
plunged 6.1 percent, to 37.5 euros ($38.47).
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had already been among Germany's worst performing
stocks in 1999, dropping sharply last year while the DAX index of
blue-chip German stocks soared 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, the world's biggest and most fiercely competitive
retailing company, was a big reason for that decline. Its prowess
in cost-cutting and inventory automation, as well as its friendly
customer service, contrast sharply with the sluggishness and often
grim countenance at Germany's biggest stores.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a German retail price war contributed to a
sell-off in Wal-Mart stock Monday as well. Its shares fell $2.25,
or 3.4 percent, to $66.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Although German stores have become much friendlier in the last
few years, even the biggest are unreliable about keeping products
in stock from one week toxt. Unlike American stores, they do
not ordinarily provide grocery bags. At many, customers have to pay
a one-mark deposit to use a grocery cart.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which deploys ``people greeters'' at the entrances to
all its stores, has thus far moved cautiously in Germany. After
acquiring the Interspar chain of supermarkets in 1997 and the
Wertkauf chain in 1998, it has spent most of its time overhauling
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The company has only converted 10 of its 95 German stores to the
complete Wal-Mart name and format, with another 40 to be remodeled
this year and the rest to be completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the company said that the installation of new
information-management systems and electronic-ordering links with
suppliers enabled it to start reducing retail prices on several
hundred items by about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The products, which range from baby clothing and food to
cordless telephones, account for a fraction of the 120,000 products
at many Wal-Mart stores.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said the reductions were merely the first in
a series of rollbacks aimed at enticing new customers. ``This is
just the beginning of our efforts,'' Ron Tiarks, president of
Wal-Mart Germany, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For all its success, Wal-Mart is nonetheless entering an
extremely combative market.
</P>
<P>
   Big German retailers have been under intense price pressure for
several years, largely because German consumers have been quick to
switch stores in pursuit of lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the toughest competitors has been Aldi's, a privately
owned chain of low-priced grocery stores with grim service, total
discontinuity from one week to the next and rock-bottom prices on
whatever products its managers are able to acquire in large
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Aldi's made nationwide news by selling tens of
thousands of personal computers in a single day, even though Aldi's
primary business is in groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart will face the same problem that has bedeviled most of
its German rivals: persistently weak demand from consumers. Thanks
to modest wage increases, tax increases and economic insecurity,
German consumers have refused to increase their spending for the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth is expected to accelerate to 2.7 percent, from
1.4 percent in 1999, and the unemployment rate may well slip below
10 percent for the first time in years. But Germany's association
of retailers is not especially optimistic. It recently reported
that store sales inched up a half of a percentage point in 1999 and
predicted that sales would remain flat in 2000.

VICTOR VALLE, FIXTURE IN BOXING WORLD, DIES AT 82
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Nev., P.R.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Valle, a boxing figure for more than six decades who
trained world champions but was best remembered for developing
Gerry Cooney into a ballyhooed heavyweight contender of the 1980s,
died Dec. 24 at Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Valle, who lived in the Bronx, had a heart attack, according to
his son, Victor Jr., who is also a boxing trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighters are like beautiful women; too many times they'll
break your heart,'' Valle once said.
</P>
<P>
   Valle enjoyed his share of success, compiling a 46-1 record as a
featherweight in the 1930s and managing the world champion boxers
Alfredo Escalera (junior lightweight), Esteban DeJesus
(lightweight) and Billy Costello (superlightweight).
</P>
<P>
   But Valle faced disappointment as well, most notably when
Cooney, seeking Larry Holmes' World Boxing Council heavyweight
title amid hoopla likening him to Sylvester Stallone's ``Rocky,''
was knocked out in the 13th round of their June 1982 bout in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Valle had trained Cooney since his pro debut in 1977, seeking to
harness the undisciplined punching style of a 6-foot-6-inch,
225-pound slugger while capitalizing on his ferocious left hook. He
had forged a strong bond with Cooney, even composing a variation on
Al Jolson's ``Sonny Boy'' that ended ``you're my son, Gerry Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the chunky, silver-haired Valle croon his ``Gerry
Boy'' tribute in Cooney's dressing room after he knocked out Ken
Norton in the first round in May 1981, Red Smith wrote in The New
York Times: ``There really is such a thing as a law of
compensation, and when you hear Victor Valle sing, you know for
sure that he must be very good at something else. Like training a
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Valle was born in San Juan, P.R., but grew up in East Harlem,
where he learned to box by punching makeshift training equipment _
sandbags tied to fire escapes. He challenged the toughest boys in
the neighborhood to street fights and made a few dollars from
winner-take-all passings of a hat.
</P>
<P>
   Valle made his debut as a pro boxer at age 17, and over the next
four years lost only to Sammy Angott, a future lightweight
champion. After breaking his right hand for the third time, he
became a trainer, and he remained active into his 80s, training
boxers with his son, who survives him together with five
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney became Valle's biggest draw, labeled in the press _ to
the boxer's distaste _ as a ``great white hope'' in a heavyweight
division dominated by black fighters. Valle's associates in the
Cooney entourage, the co-managers Dennis Rappaport and Mike Jones,
earned the nicknamacko Twins over their flair for publicity.
The Cooney hype got a boost just before the Holmes fight when
Cooney made the cover of Time magazine alongside Stallone in his
boxing pose, the movie ``Rocky III'' having just opened.
</P>
<P>
   But Holmes pummeled Cooney, prompting Valle to jump into the
ring in Round 13 to get the fight stopped. That was in character
with Valle's credo that a trainer must demand respect but also
``show the fighter that he cares _ that's not a machine out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A trainer must know how to control a fighter's character,''
Valle said in explaining an almost father-son relationship with
Cooney, whose father died shortly before Valle began to train him.
``Maybe it was my strong way of dealing with him, but we clicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before each of Cooney's bouts, the trainer and the
fighter would put their arms around each other and say the Lord's
Prayer. ``You need the prayer to remind you to win in a way without
killing the other man,'' Valle explained. ``Then I talk tough. I
tell Gerry: `It's gonna be you or him. Let's go in there and get
this man out of the way.' '' &QL;

MISSISSIPPI HOUSE TAKES A RARE VOTE, FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time, Mississippi legislators will
gather on Tuesday to choose the state's next governor, using a
provision rooted in the state's racially sundered history to settle
a contemporary political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Voters thought they would be the ones choosing a governor when
they went to the polls on Nov. 2. But after the ballots were
counted, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove had 49.5 percent of the vote, and
Mike Parker, a former congressman, 48.6 percent, with the rest
going to two other candidates. Because no candidate received a
majority, the decision was left to the Mississippi House of
Representatives, under a provision of the state constitution,
adopted in 1890.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the vote on Tuesday has never been in much doubt:
Barring something truly extraordinary, the Democratic-controlled
House will deliver an easy victory to Musgrove, a Democrat, over
Parker, a Republican. The speaker of the House, Tim Ford, has said
Musgrove will probably get 80 of the 122 votes.
</P>
<P>
   But for two months Parker has refused to concede, and the effect
of his resistance has been more than merely symbolic. Musgrove,
saying it would be improper to move ahead with the transition until
his election is confirmed, has yet to announce the selection of his
agency heads or his staff, or the details of his legislative
agenda. Nor have any plans been announced for an inaugural event on
Jan. 11, the first day of the next governor's term.
</P>
<P>
   Many constituents have urged Parker to concede, but he says he
cannot do so, although his motives are not entirely clear. ``I'm
the only one that can stop this train,'' he said a few weeks ago,
explaining why he insisted on making the House election anything
more than pro forma. ``I would always feel that I did not do what I
was supposed to do if I did stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision for a House election of the governor was adopted
as part of a new state constitution soon after Reconstruction, one
of a number of steps intended to deprive newly enfranchised blacks
of any political power. It sends the election to the House if no
candidate receives both a majority of the popular vote and a
majority of the electoral vote, which is based on Mississippi House
districts. (Musgrove and Parker, both white, evenly split the 122
electoral votes.)
</P>
<P>
   The constitution's white architects believed that no black
candidate for governor could ever leap both those hurdles, and if
any won only the popular vote, the House (which has remained in
white hands) would simply select the white candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The winner on Tuesday will succeed Kirk Fordice, who was the
first Republican elected governor of Mississippi since 1874. He has
served the maximum of two terms.

<P>
   Two head coaches were dismissed, another resigned and his top
assistant took charge, a playoff quarterback was benched, another
is injured and was replaced, and a Pro Bowl tackle is injured and
will miss the postseason in what evolved into a black-and-blue
barrage of National Football League moves on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll of the New England Patriots and Ray Rhodes of the
Green Bay Packers were dismissed after their teams failed to reach
the playoffs. But the biggest news came from the New York Jets,
whose successful coach, Bill Parcells, resigned; his longtime
defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, will succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   While Parcells will stay with the Jets as chief operating
officer, he made it clear that his coaching days were over, that he
would serve only as a consultant and that Belichick would handle
all football-related responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to coach any more football games,'' said
Parcells, who stepped down after three seasons with the Jets that
followed a turnaround stint with the Patriots and two Super Bowl
victories with the New York Giants. ``This definitely is the end of
my career.''
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, quarterback Doug Flutie had started all but one of
the 16 regular-season games but was benched in favor of his backup,
Rob Johnson, for the Bills' wild-card playoff game at the Tennessee
Titans on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit quarterback Charlie Batch reinjured his right thumb, on
his throwing hand, and cannot play in the Lions' wild-card playoff
game at the Washington Redskins on Saturday. Gus Frerotte, a former
Redskin, will start for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   And Tony Boselli, a four-time Pro Bowl left offensive tackle for
Jacksonville, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee
against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday and was lost for the
playoffs. The Jaguars, however, have an extra week to solve the
problem because they have a bye this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, five head coaches were dismissed on the day after
their regular-season finales. This year, the action was nearly as
furious, and more head coaches _ chief among them Mike Ditka in New
Orleans _ are expected to be let go later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll earned a 27-21 record in three seasons in New England.
But each year under his leadership, the Patriots faded. They
produced a 10-6 record and reached the second round of the playoffs
in his first year, were 9-7 and reached the first round in his
second year, and crashed to 8-8 this year and missed the postseason
after starting 4-0 and 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll replaced Parcells, who moved to the Jets, and inherited
a Patriots team that had reached the Super Bowl the previous season
and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Patriots fans have come to expect a quality
football team and quality results, and we have not achieved that,''
Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots' owner, said. ``We need a momentum
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said, ``I'll forever be disappointed that we didn't win
more.'' He is expected to resurface soon as a defensive
coordinator, perhaps for Washington or the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who previously coached Philadelphia for four seasons,
coached only one season in Green Bay. He, like Carroll, replaced a
Super Bowl coach, Mike Holmgren, now coach of the Seahawks. Rhodes'
Packers finished 8-8 but had two three-game losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an excuse maker; we can blame ourselves,'' Rhodes said
about his dismissal and about missing this season's playoffs. ``We
missed out on too many opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so in a city and with a team where history consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great franchise; this is the cornerstone of this
league,'' Ron Wolf, Green Bay's general manager, said. ``Every time
I walk down these hallways, I am reminded of the great tradition.
This is a great responsibility. It's all about winning and losing _
that's why they keep score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping this would be a smooth transition. But after the
second three-game losing streak, it was clear it was not. Our
players did not respond. There was a different pulse that was
reflected in our play. I had a long discussion with Ray last night
and he was not pleased, but I think he understands. I wanted a
disciplined, tough, hard-nosed coach, and that is what it takes in
this business. We didn't have that here. Is he a different coach
than I thought he was? Yes. We underachieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kraft nor Wolf named a timetable for selecting a new
coach.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, Flutie had started the Bills' first 15 games.
Johnson started against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday to give
Flutie rest for the playoffs. Now that Johnson has passed for 287
yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions and completed 24 of 32
passes in Buffalo's spirited 31-6 victory over Indianapolis, Flutie
will get extra rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is, with either one of them we can win,'' Bills
Coach Wade Phillips said. ``It was a tough decision. It wasn't a
haphazard thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Batch has spent much of this season on the sideline with his
injured thumb, and he cracked it again, on a helmet while throwing
a pass, in Detroit's 24-17 loss at Minnesota on Sunday. Frerotte
beat Washington, 33-17, late in the season at Detroit, but the
Lions will play a team that has traditionally dominated them.
Detroit is 0-19 in Washington, including 0-2 in playoff games. The
last one was a 41-10 loss in the 1992 National Football Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Boselli was blocking on a routine running play in the third
quarter when he injured his knee. Jacksonville beat Cincinnati,
24-7, and won home-field advantage through the American Football
Conference playoffs, but the victory was definitely dimmed. Ben
Coleman, who will replace Boselli, has had a gimpy knee all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of injuries, and this is obviously a huge
blow to our team,'' Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said. ``It's a
shock today, but once the time comes, I think we'll be ready.'' &QL;

A GOOD YEAR FOR FAMILY FIREWORKS COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Year's business was very, very good for Fireworks
by Grucci, the pyrotechnics company in Brookhaven, N.Y., that the
Grucci family has run for 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably the most important entertainment date in the
history of the world,'' said M. Philip Butler, who is married to a
Grucci daughter, Donna, and insists his title is chief operating
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was an important date in the history of Grucci.
Typically, the Fourth of July is the big occasion for fireworks,
with New Year's Eve a puny also-ran. Not last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Grucci, the highest-profile and most expensive of the country's
fireworks providers, took in about $2.1 million for July 4, 1999;
its revenue on Friday topped $3 million _ six times the amount the
company pulled in on New Year's Eve in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That year, it ran 12 fireworks shows; on Friday, it set off
fireworks displays at 31 different places, places as disparate as
the harbor in Dublin, private homes in the Hamptons and Jamaica,
the Atlantis Casino on Paradise Island in the Bahamas and the
exclusive Yellowstone ski club in Montana. It even lit up the
Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time clients, like the city of Honolulu, which would
normally order a $30,000 show, paid $50,000 and more. And although
Grucci did not raise its prices for the day, it refused to accept
new clients who wanted to spend less than $100,000. ``People
doubled and tripled their budgets,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   They did get more for their money. Last year, Butler said, most
clients were happy with 4-inch shells that would yield a display of
120 feet or so in diameter. This year, far more wanted 6-inch
shells, which exploded into a 200-foot light show.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering all the glitz was no mean feat. All year, Grucci had
sent out feelers, through its Web site and by word of mouth, to
lure the 100 extra technicians it knew it would need. Perhaps
because Grucci paid them well over the $200 a technician would
normally get for a few hours of holiday-night work, more than
enough people came in for training.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Butler tell it, all the programs went off without a
hitch. There was one ``annoyance,'' though, he said: In Washington,
the schedule called for a short light show at midnight, followed by
a longer one at 12:55 a.m., after another concert. On Saturday,
several newspapers reported that the first show had been truncated
by a computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have one glitch, yet we were perceived as having a
Y2K problem,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks industry had reason to set off celebratory
fireworks of its own. According to Butler, the industry's sales
have been soaring since 1993. Corporations are using fireworks as a
promotional tool, while rich individuals _ and, Butler notes, there
are many more of them today than there were when the decade was
young _ use them to make their parties special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the economy, pure and simple,'' Butler said. In the
1980s, he noted, some 70 percent of the company's revenues came
from local governments putting on a show for the citizenry; today,
80 percent of the money is corporate or private.
</P>
<P>
   Will the fireworks boom end now that the millennium hoopla has
ended? Not if the economy keeps steaming along, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be the `first Labor Day of the 21st Century,' the
`first birthday of the 21st century,' any number of reasons to
throw a show,'' Butler said. ``As long as there's wealth, there
will be people wanting to add some bang to their parties.'' &QL;

CHICAGO MINORITY PROGRAM AIDS FIRM RUN BY WHITE MEN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ An investigation ordered by City Hall has found that a
major beneficiary of a program intended to help entrepreneurs
outside the old-boy network is a company run by a white former
union official and his sons.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other big cities, Chicago reserves 25 percent of its
contracts for businesses run by women or members of racial
minorities. One of the big winners under the set-aside program has
been a janitorial business, Windy City Maintenance, which lists its
chief as Patricia Green. The city awarded the company tens of
millions of dollars in contracts during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation found that the company is being run by Ms.
Green's husband, John Duff Jr., a former vice president of the
Allied Distillery and Wine Workers International Union, and their
two sons _ scarcely the kind of outsiders the program is designed
to help.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was ordered after The Chicago Tribune repor July that Duff and his sons were running the company. The
newspaper said the Duff family controlled businesses that reaped
$100 million in city contracts in the 1990s. Duff served 17 months
in prison in the early 1980s for embezzling union funds.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at City Hall said on Friday, in announcing the findings
of the investigation, that Windy City Maintenance had been stripped
of its status as a woman-run company and would lose its contract
within 60 days. City officials also said they would monitor
businesses that claimed to be run by women and minorities, to guard
against fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Windy City said Monday that no one would
comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, who has sought to portray fairness to
minorities as a hallmark of his administration, will speak about
the Duff case at a news conference on Tuesday, aides said. Daley's
support among blacks is considered softer than his rock-solid white
base, so the mayor has been careful to guard against anything that
would stir resentment among minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   The set-aside program has been seen as a potentially dangerous
issue for Daley, especially if it seems that white men are taking
advantage of programs intended to help women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Daley last week announced a program to recruit more companies
owned by women and minorities, especially blacks, to do business
with the city. Some black aldermen have complained that only 9
percent of the $1.3 billion in contractsd by the city
through September 1998 have gone to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who said he agreed that the percentage of blacks getting
city business was too low, said ``the pool has to be expanded in
some way.'' The mayor named Barbara Lumpkin, the city treasurer, to
head a task force to determine the best way to find more
minority-run companies.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, city officials have simply accepted the word of
companies that say they are run by women or minorities, said
Jacqueline Heard, a spokeswoman for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to rely on the integrity of the companies we do
business with,'' Ms. Heard said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, to guard against fraud, city officials will conduct
on-site checks at the companies and talk to customers to make sure
that businesses are complying with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heard said Windy City had been deserving of its status as
women-run until recently. ``It was in fact owned and operated by a
woman,'' she said, adding that company officials still insisted
that Ms. Green was the head of the business.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Heard said it was clear to city officials that Ms. Green
had stepped down from her day-to-day management of Windy City and
largely handed over business responsibilities to her sons.
</P>
<P>
   That transfer of power has made Windy City ineligible to retain
its status as a women-run business, Ms. Heard said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the Daley administration, the problem with the set-aside
program was a rare setback. Less than a year after his latest
landslide election victory, Daley commands overwhelming support
with the 50-member City Council.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Chicago Tribune said that the Duff family and
enterprises they control had contributed more than $30,000 to
Daley's campaigns. The newspaper said the Duffs had played host to
at least two fund-raisers for the mayor, including a breakfast last
February attended by Daley.

NEW LIFE IN LONDON'S FINANCIAL DISTRICT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ No matter how expensive it becomes, how snarled its
traffic or how seedy its public transportation, London just keeps
on pulling in the crowds, especially to the central areas most
beloved of visitors _ the West End, for instance, and the
well-trodden routes that lead from museums to monuments.
</P>
<P>
   For years, though, two key sections of the city have largely
been neglected by restaurateurs, hoteliers and the crowds they need
for their business. Mention doing business in the City of London _
the financial district _ or among the steel-and-glass buildings of
Canary Wharf in the old Docklands area, and the talk has always
been of awkward commutes from the smart hotels farther west to the
banks and offices where the real money is made.
</P>
<P>
   All that is set to change. Over the past few months, a series of
hotel chains have announced plans to renovate or build new
accommodations in the City or Canary Wharf _ decisions that will be
enhanced by the long-delayed completion last month of the
Underground's Jubilee Line leading east toward Greenwich and the
Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will still be something of a commute to link up
the West End with accommodations in the financial district,
particularly in Canary Wharf. But the region's boosters are
suggesting that areas once viewed as urban equivalents of the
Arabian desert's Empty Quarter are gradually assuming an
after-hours life of their own when offices are closed.
</P>
<P>
   The development is closely linked to the financial-services boom
that has transformed a whole area of east London. In the 1920s, in
``The Waste Land,'' T.S. Eliot painted a spectral picture of
commuters entering the city: ``A crowd flowed over London Bridge,
so many, I had not thought death had undone so many.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bonus-driven 1980s and '90s, though, the imagery of drear
commuters plodding their way to work from suburbia has been
supplanted by a newer vision of snappy 20-somethings moving into
riverside lofts and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Even in east London areas once viewed as irredeemably depressed,
such as Tower Hamlets, modest apartments now sell for upward of
$300,000. Districts that once seemed to labor under Dickensian
connotations of deprivation, such as Clerkenwell, draw publishing
and media types to set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   The City itself has seeflux of retailers and bars that,
while catering mainly to the daytime needs of bankers and other
business people, reflect what Alex Branner, a spokesman for
London's Tourist Board, called a trend to see the City as much more
than arid canyons of banks.
</P>
<P>
   This demographic shift has not been lost on hoteliers who,
Branner said, discovered some four years ago that London's 75,000
available hotel beds were about 10,000 less than the British
capital would need by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, Canary Wharf itself, where the opening
this month of a new 139-room Four Seasons hotel coincides with the
creation of Canary Riverside, where the 322 apartments cost from
$380,000 to $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The development brings an array of health and leisure facilities
and restaurants to an area once associated exclusively with
financial services, newspapers and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is a calculation that the Jubilee Line extension,
a 12-minute ride from the new Canary Wharf station to Waterloo
station, and the proximity of London's short-haul City Airport,
three miles east of Canary Wharf, will draw business to the area
because, according to Charlotte Doherty, a spokeswoman for the Four
Seasons, ``the worry that there had been about location is no
longer there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the City of London, closer to the center than Canary Wharf,
there is a similar calculation that businessmen and bankers want
more convenient high-class accommodation. The Eton Town House Group
has announced plans to turn a former bank on Threadneedle Street _
close to the Bank of England itself _ into a 70-room hotel to open
in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The City's Victorian-era Great Eastern Hotel, built between 1879
and 1901, is being reconstructed as a 267-room hotel set to open in
February. And, close to the City, six 18th-century houses on
Peter's Lane have been converted into The Rookery, an upscale
33-bedroom hotel laden with antiques and mellow lighting that
opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, midprice chains such as Novotel, Holiday Inn
Express and others have opened new hotels close to the financial
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a general trend that London is looking again at all these
po areas,'' Branner said. ``With quite a few years of
economic growth, there's a growth of confidence.''

   France Plans a Picnic, And Invites 3 Million &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For sheer magnitude and ecological audacity, few millennium
events can match La Meridienne Verte, the showcase of the Mission
2000 project planned by the French government.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, tens of thousands of schoolchildren planted miles
of saplings along the Paris meridian, the line running 2 degrees 20
minutes 14 seconds east of Greenwich from Dunkirk to Barcelona that
helped 18th-century French mathematicians establish the metric
standard and calculate local time.(Despite the ravages of the
recent storms, the small trees have emerged for the most part
unscathed.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of the architect Paul Chemetov, each of the
337 communities on the meridian in France is nurturing indigenous
trees. Fields of red poppies, flax and impatiens to be planted
along 20 meridian sites are expected to blossom by midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   As the 597-mile tree line snakes over freeways and forests, it
brushes past Amiens Cathedral, winds through the Louvre courtyard,
across an Orly runway, and ascends the volcanic peaks of Cantal and
the Medieval ramparts of Carcassonne before crossing the Pyrenees
at Prats-de-Mollo. &QL;

   New Partnerships Benefit Frequent Fliers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those who keep score: recent changes in frequent-flier
programs include new airline partners for Delta Air Lines and
American Airlines and new hotel affiliations for Trans World
Airlines and United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   South African Airways has become a partner in the Skymiles
frequent-flier program of Delta Air Lines. Since Dec. 1, Skymiles
members have been able to earn miles and redeem awards on flights
operated by South African Airways. Double miles will be awarded for
flights taken through the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Members of American Airlines' AAdvantage frequent-flier program
can earn miles on non-trans-Atlantic flights operated by Swissair,
Sabena, Crossair (an affiliate of Swissair) and Turkish Airlines
(except flights within Turkey). AAdvantage members also can earn
credit on trans-Atlantic flights operated by Sabena or Swissair
that are code shares with American.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines has added Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, (800)
822-4200, and Best Western Hotels, (800) 528-1234, to its travel
partners in the Aviators frequent-flier program. Through the end of
February, Aviators members earn double mileage (usually 500 miles)
for stays at any Wyndham hotel in the United States, Canada and the
Caribbean. Stays at Best Western hotels in the United States,
Canada and the Caribbean earn 750 miles (usually 250 miles) until
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, a consortium of more
than 120 independent luxury hotels, has become a partner in Mileage
Plus, the frequent-flier program of United Airlines. Mileage Plus
members receive 2,000 miles for stays at any Preferred Hotel until
March 31, and then 500 miles. For reservations, call (800)
323-7500. &QL;

<P>
   Showcasing a Century of Design &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, the cradle of modern American architecture, is the site
of an ambitious exhibition, ``At the End of the Century: One
Hundred Years of Architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis of the show, which runs through Feb. 27 at the
Museum of Contemporary Art, is on broad themes in architectural and
urban thinking, including the Bauhaus movement, Internationalism,
the evolution of suburbs, and the trend toward themes or
``Disneyfication'' as epitomized by recent Las Vegas casino hotels.
Scale models, photographs, film footage, drawings, furniture and
architectural sketches are among the exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   In a segment on the politics of monumentality in the 1930s,
connections are drawn between the colossal scale of Fascist
architecture such as Hitler's grandiose vision of the Nazi capital
Germania, and projects such as Hoover Dam, which was, according to
the program notes, ``equally intended to demonstrate the strength
and stability of government during a time of economic crises and
social upheaval.''
</P>
<P>
   A companion exhibition focusing on current work in Chicago,
``Material Evidence: Chicago Architecture at 2000,'' deals with
millennial design and fascination with new technologies and
materials: one firm is experimenting with a pneumatic membrane that
has the properties of a soap bubble for constructing bus-stop
shelters, and another has designed a newsstand that doubles as a
digital information display.
</P>
<P>
   The architects Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid, who recently won the
design competition for a Center of Contemporary Arts in Rome, are
scheduled to speak, and there will be a tour of Chicago's
architectural jewels from the Loop to Hyde Park and the Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, at 220 East Chicago Avenue, (312) 280-2660, is open
Wednesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays are free, and open
until 8 p.m. Admission is $7.

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Jan. 3 _ Irascible, bellicose and demanding,
Bill Parcells helped transform three losing football franchises
into winners, including both New York teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, less than 24 hours after he concluded his third
season with the Jets, the 58-year-old Parcells said he could not
put forth the 365-day effort a year it took to coach in the
National Football League, and stepped down as the head coach of the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to coach any more football games,'' Parcells
said. ``This definitely is the end of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by his top assistant and longtime coaching
colleague, Bill Belichick, who devised the famed defenses that
helped Parcells' teams reach those Super Bowls. Belichick, who had
been the Jets' assistant head coach, will also run the entire
football operation, said Parcells, who said he would function as an
adviser and a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be Bill Belichick's shadow,'' Parcells
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' departure came on a day when two other teams changed
head coaches. The New England Patriots dismissed Pete Carroll, and
the Green Bay Packers did the same with Ray Rhodes. Both teams did
not qualify for the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' decision follows a season that began with the goal of
reaching the Super Bowl after compiling a 12-4 record last season,
but which quickly deteriorated when the starting quarterback, Vinny
Testaverde, was injured in the first game and lost for the season.
The Jets stumbled to only one victory in their first seven games,
but Parcells guided them to a strong finish and a 8-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   It was a turnaround in keeping with Parcells' track record of
building downtrodden franchises into winners, a feat he
accomplished with the Giants of the 1980s, with whom he won two
Super Bowls; the New England Patriots of the early 1990s, whom he
coached to one Super Bowl, and then the Jets, who had a
franchise-worst 1-15 re 1996, the year before Parcells
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   His 29-19 record with the Jets makes him the only coach in
team's 40 seasons to leave with a winning mark. His career record
over 15 seasons is 149-106-1.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would retain the title of chief of football
operations, but claimed he would not exercise those duties. He has
three years remaining on his contract, which has paid him $2.4
million a year for running the club.
</P>
<P>
   There was some urgency involved in the decision. The team is in
the process of being sold by the estate of the late Leon Hess, with
a decision on the winner expected by the end of the week. Charles
F. Dolan and Robert Wood Johnson IV are the two candidates; each
has bid at least $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he had hoped to know lk who the team's new
owners would be. But practically, he could not wait any longer to
anoint Belichick, who was wanted by other teams and might have
accepted a head coaching position elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was especially coveted by the Patriots. Even as they
were dismissing Carroll Monday morning, a league official said, the
Patriots, through a faxed request, were seeking permission from the
Jets to speak to Belichick. But Parcells had already divulged his
plans to club president Steve Gutman and Belichick, who was
elevated Sunday night to the Jets' head-coaching post.
</P>
<P>
   It was another development in the continuing feud between the
Patriots and Parcells' Jets. Parcells left New England three years
ago because of a deteriorating relationship with the owner, Robert
K. Kraft, moved to the Jets and brought Belichick with him. When
the Patriots protested, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had to
intervene and work out a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kraft admitted he wanted to ask Belichick to
replace Parcells back then, but said that his split with Parcells
had been so acrimonious that the Patriots were better off hiring
someone not connected with Parcells. They brought in Carroll
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jets were concerned enough about losing Belichick
that they asked the league last Friday to clarify Belichick's
status. The league said that even though Belichick's contract
called for him to succeed Parcells, the Jets could not stand in his
way if he wanted to interview with other teams. But if Belichick
became the Jets' head coach, he would be unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the league issued a formal confirmation of
Belichick's status, saying in a statement: ``The New York Jets
confirmed to our office earlier today that Bill Parcells is the
head of football operations, and that Bill Belichick is the Jets'
head coach. Under these circumstances, we have notified teams the
Jets are not under any obligation to any club to grant an interview
to Coach Belichick.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's previous experience as a head coach was a five-year
run with mixed success with the Cleveland Browns starting in 1991.
He was reunited with Parcells as his defensive coordinator and
assistant head coach at New England in 1996. Then Belichick came
here with Parcells the next year, and had a $750,000-a-year
contract that provided for him to move up when Parcells stepped
down. Al Groh, the current linebackers coach, will take over
Belichick's role as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick issued a two sentence statement explaining that he
would rather not comment on his ascension ``to allow this to be
Coach Parcells' day exclusively.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick replaces one of only three to have led two different
teams to Super Bowl appearances. His head-coaching career began
with the 1983 Giants. They won two Super Bowls before he left
unexpectedly in the spring of 1991, citing health reasons. He
subsequently underwent three heart procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells took a job as a television analyst, but returned to
football by taking on the Patriots in 1993. They had finished 2-14
the year before. But in their fourth season under Parcells, the
Patriots made it to the Super Bowl, only to fall to the Green Bay
Packers.
</P>
<P>
   But when his relationship with Kraft became untenable, and the
Jets fired Rich Kotite following the 1-15 season, Parcells
instantly became the No. 1 candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells contended Monday that after last season, he had told
the late Jets' owner, Leon Hess, as well as Gutman and Belichick
that he would be stepping down after this season. Hess died last
May. Yet, Parcells also said Monday that if the Jets had not turned
around their season after the 1-6 start, he was contemplating
returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't finished the way we had, I think I probably would
have considered even more strongly staying on,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his health was not a factor in the decision. ``My
health's fine, don't worry about it,'' he said.

ONE BIG CATCH REMAINS IN WARRICK'S TURNABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ He knows why he lost the Heisman Trophy. He knows
how he dropped the Biletnikoff award for the nation's best wide
receiver. He knows how he undid all the admiration that he had
earned last winter when he decided to skip the National Football
League draft to return to Florida State for his senior year. Still,
Peter Warrick also knows that he is just 60 minutes away from
having a pretty good year.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to college for two reasons: to earn a degree and to
win a national championship. Three Saturdays ago, far from the
cheering crowds, Warrick pulled down the first, when he marched in
commencement exercises and was awarded a degree in political
science.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sugar Bowl Tuesday night on national television, Warrick
hopes to help the top-ranked Seminoles march down the field against
Virginia Tech. He wants to hand the coach who stuck by him, Bobby
Bowden, his first undefeated season in 34 years as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to be a part of Florida State winning its second
national title. ``This is the reason I came back, to win a national
championship,'' he said. ``There's nothing else in the world that I
want more than this right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick also knows this should have been a more triumphant week
for him _ that he ought to be talking about having won the Heisman
rather than having lost it, of looking forward to the NFL instead
of escaping to it.
</P>
<P>
   In September, however, Warrick's season of celebration turned
into one of survival. He and a teammate were caught on a
surveillance camera at a Dillard's department store in Tallahassee,
Fla., getting a lot for very little. In league with a store clerk,
Warrick and Laveranues Coles paid just $21.40 for $421.38 worth of
designer clothes. Warrick was arrested on a felony count of grand
theft.
</P>
<P>
   Though he told the police investigators that he had participated
in the scam and admitted it was wrong, Warrick turned his bad
decision into a public misstep when he uttered a remarkably
inappropriate rationale for his actions in his first public
comments. ``It's not like I shot the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspended for two games while his lawyer tried to resolve
the case in a way that satisfied both law enforcement officials and
the Florida State administration. The university community was
deeply divided on how to discipline Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   The university's president, Talbot D'Alemberte, rejected a
proposed plea agreement that would have had Warrick plead guilty to
a felony, finish the season and serve jail time in the spring. He
was deluged with dissenting e-mails and a letter from at least one
Florida state senator. When Warrick eventually pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor in exchange for community service, he became one more
flash point for the debate over whether society (or a coach) allows
athletes to live under different standards.
</P>
<P>
   All week Warrick has had to answer questions about the incident.
``If I would have known the consequences would be like that, I
would have never done it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick also said he thought that the news media ``were trying
to make an example out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They did a good job. A great job.''
</P>
<P>
   But some comments have reflected the deep faith and commitment
to do the right thing that Bowden and his teammates say are the
foundation of Warrick's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot,'' Warrick said. ``Getting through the
trouble, I bounced back from it and it takes a real man to do that.
Now I can stand up in front of a crowd and tell kids to learn from
my mistake. Trouble is easy to get into, but hard to get out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick concedes that he has been publicly humiliated. He was
serenaded with chants of ``jailbird'' by Clemson fans his first
game back from the suspension. In Florida, ``Heistman'' T-shirts,
featuring the famous trophy figure shooting a stiff arm in defense
of a shopping bag, were a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he lose his Heisman front-runner status, but more
than 900 Heisman voters made sure he was not allowed in the same
room with the famous trophy. He finished sixth and was denied a
trip to New York with the winner, Ron Dayne, and four other
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Warrick finished the regular season with 71 catches
for 934 yards and 8 touchdowns, the player many people believe is
the most exciting in college football was not even named the best
at his position. Stanford's Troy Walters won the Biletnikoff award.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into trouble, there were consequences,'' Warrick
said. ``I thought I paid my dues to the world, but I guess I
didn't. When I didn't get to go to the Heisman, it hurt me, but
everything happens for a reason. I'm playing for the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he ordered his cap and gown early in September for his
anticipated graduation, Warrick has been thinking about winning a
title for a long time. In fact, for exactly 365 days, after Florida
State lost the national title to Tennessee in a Fiesta Bowl in
which Warrick caught just one pass.
</P>
<P>
   He stunned Bowden and his teammates when, after a day of
anguished prayer, he announced that he would return to Florida
State for his senior year despite being a certain top-five NFL
pick. His loyalty was returned by Bowden after the Dillard's
incident. Coles, who had been in trouble before, was kicked off the
team. Bowden said Warrick had been nothing but a solid citizen and
deserved a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick has apologized, paid restitution for the clothes and
will do his community service. And as long as he learns from his
mistake, Bowden says, Warrick's debt to him or Florida State is
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to enjoy his last college game,'' the coach said.
``I don't want him to think he has to go out there and make up for
all he has done bad.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, too, bestowed on Warrick an honor that perhaps is
more precious than the postseason hardware he fumbled on his own.
They voted him one of three team captains for the national title
game.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that is enough for Warrick. He is a graduate and a
captain with one more goal to reach. He has owned up to his
mistake, but now is ready to let it go. ``It will go away,
eventually,'' he said. ``I'm through apologizing. It's behind me.''

TWO MEN ARE HELD IN BOMB PLOT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mass., Ill.)   (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Algerians, one in Brooklyn, N.Y., and the other in Seattle,
have been arrested in the continuing investigation of a terrorist
bomb plot. The new arrests came amid indications that federal
authorities are focusing their efforts on a network of Algerians in
New York, Seattle and Boston, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn man, Abdelwahib Hamdouche, was taken into custody
Saturday night at Kennedy International Airport as he was preparing
to leave for Paris on a KLM flight, officials said. Hamdouche, 34,
a naturalized French citizen, was held as a material witness in the
bomb plot investigation, and it is believed that he was ordered to
remain in custody after a closed hearing Monday in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the authorities said they had arrested another
Algerian man, Abdel Hakim Tizegha, on charges of entering the
country illegally. He is believed to be an associate of a man
charged last week in the bomb plot, law enforcement officials said,
but he has not been accused of any direct role. The new arrests on
both coasts stem from what the authorities said was a bomb plot
foiled in Seattle last month after the arrest of Ahmed Ressam, an
Algerian who has been linked to a terrorist group. Ressam was
charged with trying to smuggle powerful explosives and
sophisticated timing devices in a car he was driving across the
Canadian border near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While the scope of the investigation into the plot appeared to
be growing, many details of the case remained murky Monday. It was
not clear why the authorities believed Hamdouche was a witness. It
was also not known why he had been released without being charged
after he was taken into custody last Thursday during a raid in
Brooklyn in which another Algerian, Abdel Ghani, was arrested on
charges of being an accomplice in the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal complaint accused Ghani of having knowledge of ``a
terrorist network of Algerian nationals'' that also included
Ressam, and said that he had planned to travel with Ressam to
Chicago to raise money for the group.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's closed hearing, neither a federal prosecutor,
David N. Kelley, nor Hamdouche's lawyer, Mitchell A. Golub, would
comment or describe the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger refused a request
by The New York Times to open the session, and afterward, he would
not say why he had conducted it in secret.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Hamdouche, who was a roommate of Ghani, appeared
to be a tactical move by investigators seeking to compel his
presence before a federal grand jury or for questioning by federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities may be hoping to see if Hamdouche can tell them
anything about Ghani, and whether he might cooperate in the
investigation. In order for Dolinger to order Hamdouche's
detention, the government had to show that he was material, or
critical, to the investigation, and that he was a risk to flee or
be unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   No one would say if Hamdouche had been ordered held, but he did
not leave the courtroom with his defense lawyer as the hearing
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrests indicated that law enforcement authorities are
continuing to reel in friends and associates of Ressam and Ghani,
although the high degree of secrecy imposed on the case has made it
difficult to learn precisely what the authorities suspect of each
man.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint filed against Tizegha Monday in federal
district court in Seattle, for example, makes no mention of the
bomb plot, nor did prosecutors discuss any link in a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcemenials who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Tizegha was believed to have been a longtime friend
of Ghani, and may have spent time with him in Seattle when Ghani
went there in mid-December, apparently to await Ressam's arrival
with the bomb-making materials. The plot was interrupted when an
immigration agent questioned Ressam at the border and the
explosives were discovered in his car, the government has charged.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint in Seattle against Tizegha says he entered the
United States illegally as a stowaway on a ship in 1993, and lived
in Boston, where he formally applied for political asylum. The
request was denied.

TOBACCO AND ITS GIFTS HAVE MINORITY ALLIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., P.R., Ga.)   (jw) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State Sen. Efrain Gonzalez Jr. of the Bronx decided
to open a Washington office for a Hispanic legislators' association
a few years ago, figuring that he would have little trouble raising
the necessary $40,000. Following something of a tradition among
black and Hispanic members of the New York Legislature, Gonzalez
called a lobbyist for Philip Morris, and came away with the entire
amount.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague from the borough, Assemblywoman Gloria Davis,
receives $5,000 annually from Philip Morris, the world's largest
tobacco company, for a Thanksgiving meal for the poor in her
predominantly black district. Seeking aid for a program to teach
nonviolence to young people, Ms. Davis said that she raised $22,000
from another cigarette giant, R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Such corporate grants are cornerstones in a decades-old campaign
by the cigarette companies to foster good will in black and
Hispanic neighborhoods, an important cigarette market. The grants
have also helped the industry cement ties to black and Hispanic
officials, who are often one of the few factions in the Democratic
Party to oppose new restrictions on smoking.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry is increasingly ostracized by many
politicians in New York, some black and Hispanic state lawmakers
depict it as a kindhearted corporate citizen, playing down the
health consequences of smoking and asserting that they are not in a
position to reject assistance from companies making legal products.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance in New York, which has parallels in Washington and
other state capitals, has until recently been a significant factor
in the industry's enviable record in Albany. Even last month, when
the tide suddenly turned against the tobacco companies in the
Legislature for the first time since 1993, some black and Hispanic
lawmakers came to their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers questioned a move by Gov. George Pataki and
legislative leaders to pay for an expansion of health-care for the
uninsured in part by nearly doubling the cigarette tax, a measure
that delighted antismoking groups. Ultimately, the lawmakers said
they supported the bill because they did not want to hinder a new
health-care program, but among Democrats, their views stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another cigarette tax is a little out of hand,'' said
Gonzalez, who until last month was president of the legislators'
group, the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators. ``It just
looks sexy politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Antismoking groups say they are dismayed by the lawmakers'
stances, contending that because blacks in particular smoke more
and suffer higher rates of smoking-related illnesses than whites,
the lawmakers should treat the industry more harshly. Such
criticism has come up before. But documents disclosed recently by
the industry in smoking litigation cast the dispute in a new light,
showing the extent of its generosity _ and links to policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Philis document from 1988, for example, lists
roughly 125 black groups that the company assisted across the
nation: from the Bedford-Stuyvesant Real Estate Board (which
received $200), to the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus ($6,000) to
the National Association of Negro B and Professional Women's
Club ($12,000).
</P>
<P>
   Next to some of the listings are the names of black politicians
from New York and elsewhere who requested the grants. There is also
a column entitled ``support on issues,'' which describes how some
of the groups backed Philip Morris' effort to block smoking
restrictions and cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   While Philip Morris did not disclose documents on its current
giving, interviews indicate that it has not significantly
diminished; indeed, the company is now seeking to soften its image
by highlighting its philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   It donated $30,000 in 1998 to sponsor conferences for groups
representing black and Hispanic New York lawmakers. The Bronx
Democratic Committee, which is led by Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez,
the most influential Hispanic politician in Albany, received
$19,000 in the last three years from Philip Morris and $10,000 more
from R.J. Reynolds, according to campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several black and Hispanic lawmakers scoffed at
what they said was the heavy-handed approach of smoking opponents.
They acknowledged that they were sympathetic to the industry
because of its financial assistance, but dismissed suggestions of a
quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   And they said it was wrong to scrutinize their relationship to
the tobacco industry while ignoring white lawmakers, especially
Republicans, with similar ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that I was sent to Albany to govern somebody's
bedroom,'' Ms. Davis said. ``We have enough laws on the books
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said that in the past, when corporate America
shunned black and Hispanic causes and had little interest in
diversifying the work force, the tobacco companies were different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that 25 years ago, when you could only get 10
people to show up for a caucus event, Philip Morris was always
there,'' said Assemblyman Herman Farrell Jr., a Harlem Democrat who
is the most powerful black lawmaker in Albany. He was referring to
the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus in the
State Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, today, it is looked upon as something nefarious,''
Farrell said. ``Maybe we're addicted to that like you baddicted to cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, said the company
was proud of its involvement with black and Hispanic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history with diversity and minority employment goes back
to the '50s,'' she said. ``We are very anxious to build
relationships with lots of different groups. These relationships
are important to us, and if they help us get an understanding, or
at least an audience with legislators from these communities, that
is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the company linked grants to official action, she
said: ``That's unfair. What we are trying to do is build
relationships so that we can have a dialogue, and that is as far as
it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of R.J. Reynolds did not respond to several
requests for comment.

</P>
<P>
   Debates have long simmered over charitable giving by the tobacco
companies, especially Philip Morris, which is among the biggest
such benefactors in the nation and has carved a large role in
financing the arts in New York City. Nonprofit groups have grappled
with whether to refuse such money because it is generated in large
part by profits from smoking. Many continue accepting it.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Harlem, some groups have gone on campaigns
against what they say are the tobacco companies' practice of
flooding black and Hispanic neighborhoods with advertising and of
aiming menthol-flavored brands like Newport, Kool and Salem at
black smokers. Even so, many local politicians have remained on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   A few have spoken out, including Assemblyman Albert Vann of
Brooklyn. More common are the sentiments of black and Hispanic
members of the Assembly Health Committee, which has been a
battleground on the issue in recent years, particularly over a bill
that would impose a state ban on smoking in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the bill's sponsors suffered a startling rebuff when
four black and Hispanic Democrats on the Democratic-controlled
committee _ Ms. Davis, Ramirez, James Gary Pretlow of Westchester
County and Darryl C. Towns of Brooklyn _ voted with Republicans and
killed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that one of his primary concerns was economic
development, Ramirez explained that he could not ignore the
economic effects of more restrictions on his district. If fewer
people smoke, then bodegas, which are often the backbone of
Hispanic neighborhoods, will lose cigarette sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White lawmakers, he said, ``have the luxury and the flexibility
of taking positions that are much more popular, because the
consequences of their actions are never going to be felt in their
districts.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
And you thought the Rockets had problems.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the poor-little-rich-team files, here come the Seattle
SuperSonics, or, as they should be known, the SuperChronics.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Sonics carry an 18-12 record into Compaq Center
tonight, the same things that seem to chronically plague the Sonics
are again flaring up this season. Players arguing with coaches.
Players arguing with players. Players walking out of practices and
shootarounds.
</P>
<P>
   You know, all those things that supposedly got George Karl, one
of the most successful coaches in Sonics history, canned two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Paul Westphal who has been thrust into the maelstrom.
And while the calendar says 2000, it must seem a lot like last year
to Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   We repeat _ and you thought the Rockets had problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, at least the Rockets have won a game in the last two weeks;
the Sonics have lost five straight games after wiping their feet on
league doormat Chicago on Dec. 20. Since then, the Sonics have lost
to Indiana, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Portland and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are rapidly becoming the dead-and-gone-ics, and not
even Superman, it seems, can save them. But Superman, at least in
the Pacific Northwest, does not wear an ``S'' on his chest. He
wears No. 20 _ Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is still doing a pretty good job of taking over when we
need him,'' said Sonics guard Brent Barry. ``But Superman needs
help every now and then from Lois Lane. So one of us has to step up
and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton wholeheartedly agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Just like last season, the players are starting to cast a wary
eye _ or is that Gary eye? _ at the effort, production and stamina
of Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   After a 94-89 loss to Portland, Baker and small forward Ruben
Patterson walked out of the shootaround before last Wednesday's
game against Sacramento after having disagreements with Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just conversation,'' Baker said. ``It wasn't something that
was a blowup, like everybody thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   What everybody thinks is that Westphal confronted Baker on his
soft play and the 6-11 power forward did not appreciate being
embarrassed in front of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotions got a little raw ,'' said Westphal, who had drawn a
reaction from Patterson by dropping him from the starting lineup.
``It would have been better if it didn't come to that. But I think
everything is for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of Baker's teammates were happy to see _ and hear,
it seems _ the normally reserved Westphal break out of character
and yell at a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys came into the shootaround, and coach was getting on
them,'' Barry said. ``I was kind of glad to see coach stepping up
into that role. We've been struggling, and we need a kick-start.''
</P>
<P>
   From someone other than Payton, who seems to have taken it upon
himself to do everything, which could be a big factor in the
Sonics' problems.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that in the Sonics' first 15 games, Payton led in
scoring six times. Get the idea that the ball was zipping around?
Yes, which is why the Sonics won 11 of those games. In the last 15
games, though, Payton has led the team in scoring 14 times, perhaps
an equally big reason they have gone 7-8 over that span.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider that not only has Payton been heaving the ball up
(100 field-goal attempts in the last four games), but he has been
taking a large number of those shots from behind the 3-point line _
a total of 51. To put that in perspective: In the last four games,
Payton isn't too far away from the combined number of 3-pointers he
attempted in his first three years in the league (70).
</P>
<P>
   While he leads the league in 3-pointers made (82), he is on pace
to hoist up 585 treys, a horrifying number for a point guard. And
he's doing all this while still being expected to check the
opposing team's top guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody should be able to step up, but we don't have anybody
to step up right now,'' Payton said. ``We have to understand that
we're not going to win basketball games just with one person
scoring all the points and doing everything. This is a team. This
is not the Gary Payton show.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland point guard Damon Stoudamire, who along with Payton is
represented by Aaron and Eric Goodwin, understands why Payton is
going to such great lengths (and distances) in his efforts to
squeeze out a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about being a leader on your team: If you don't feel
comfortable with players you have on the floor, you're going to
always try to do a little more than you ought to,'' Stoudamire
said. ``Maybe that's what is happening now. You look at Gary and
how he played in 1996 when they went to the Finals and how he's
playing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different. He's having to expend a lot of energy scoring
30 points and defending the point guard. In this league it's hard
to try to do it on both ends every night.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Sonics are discovering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hang together,'' Westphal said, ``and start
winning some games again.''
</P>

SETTLEMENT EXPECTED IN ATTICA UPRISING SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 30 years after the deadliest prison rebellion
in American history, a federal judge in Rochester, N.Y., is
expected to announce a settlement Tuesday giving compensation to
the inmates who were beaten and tortured by law enforcement
officers during the uprising at Attica.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Monday, there was no official word on the amount of
the settlement, the number of inmates who may receive awards or
other details. Lawyers involved in the negotiations said details
would be announced at a hearing Tuesday morning before Judge
Michael A. Telesca of U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   If there is indeed a settlement that sticks, it would end a long
legal struggle over a prison crackdown that quickly entered the
American lexicon as a symbol for excessive government force.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven guards and 32 prisoners died during the four-day siege in
September 1971, when inmates took control of the Attica
Correctional Facility in western New York, then were crushed by
state troopers who stormed the prison, guns blazing. An additional
80 people were wounded in what a disillusioned state prosecutor
later described as a ``turkey shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   But as horrific as the siege was, the inmates contended that
what followed was even more unconscionable: an orgy of reprisals
carried out by prison guards and law enforcement officers.
Prisoners were forced to crawl naked over broken glass, and one
inmate had a screwdriver repeatedly shoved into his rectum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, lawyers representing the 1,281 inmates who were in
Prison Yard D during the uprising filed a clasn suit against
prison and state officials. Now, 25 years of legal fits and starts
later, it appears that the case may be over, said Elizabeth Fink,
the principal lawyer for the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell J. Banas, a Buffalo, N.Y., lawyer representing Karl
Pfeil, Attica's deputy warden during the uprising, said that he,
too, expected a settlement Tuesday. He said it would ``still be
subject to court approval and objections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Attica story began on Sept. 9, 1971, when inmates took
several guards as hostages and seized control of parts of the
prison. After several days of negotiations failed, Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller ordered the retaking of the D Yard, giving state
troopers the go-ahead to storm the prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the troopers did not stop there. According to a recent
federal appeals court ruling, there was ``very substantial evidence
that, following the retaking, some, and perhaps most or even all,
of the D Yard inmates were the victims of brutal acts of
retaliation by prison authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit was originally filed against various New York state
police and correction officials, as well as against Rockefeller. A
judge later ruled that the inmates had no claim against the estate
of Rockefeller, who died in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a federal jury in Buffalo found only against Pfeil.
Five years later, one of the inmates, Frank Smith, won a $4 million
award stemming from that verdict, becoming the first prisoner to be
awarded compensation for injuries suffered after the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, now a paralegal in his 60s who lives in New York City,
was forced to lie on a table, naked, while officers assaulted and
burned him. He was forced to hold a football against his throat
with his chin, and threatened with death or castration if the
football slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, a federal appeals court overturned the $4 million
award, saying that the trial judge had mishandled the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case was then turned over to Telesca. And immediately, the
judge said that he wanted to hammer out a settlement to end the
matter.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are hardly two more incompatible words in the
English language than ``bride'' and ``fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The former makes you think of hideous gobs of fattening lace,
while the latter brings to mind minimalist shrouds, eccentric veils
and a mother-in-law weeping softly into her hankie. ``Here Comes
the Bride'' does not go with sheer Helmut Lang bloomers any more
than a Prada nylon slip goes with a full slap of makeup and an
illusion veil. It's bizarre, it's tricky _ it's the sartorial
equivalent of saying, ``I do,'' backward.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the news that Barneys New York will open a bridal
salon at the end of the month. Barneys, which is known for esoteric
window displays, avant-garde expressions of understatement and
svelte-looking customers seemingly nourished by parsley, already
carries Richard Tyler's bridal collection (and Vera Wang's in its
Beverly Hills store). But with the new salon, on the revamped
eighth floor, the inveterate fashion seeker can have a wedding
dress from Christian Lacroix, Olivier Theyskens, Geoffrey Beene,
Akira, Dries van Noten, Jil Sander or perhaps Josephus Thimister,
whose spring ready-to-wear collection was inspired by the German
terrorist couple Andrea Baader and Ulrike Meinhof. Even Rei
Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons has promised to deliver a couple of
dresses. Her spring ready-to-wear colors evoked the hilarity of a
clown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we've been thinking about opening a bridal salon for
a long time _ we just needed the space,'' said Judy Collinson, the
general merchandising manager of Barneys. ``We've always dressed a
lot of brides in our evening and special-order departments. Now we
can have all these designer concepts represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Many designers have dressed women for the altar. Lacroix has a
well-established bridal business in Paris, where a made-to-measure
gown (without too many bells and whistles) starts at around
$100,000. Alexander McQueen, at Givenchy, and Oscar de la Renta
also do wedding ensembles for private clients. On Seventh Avenue,
Carolina Herrera and Badgley Mischka have brought fashion, and good
taste, to bridal clothes. And of course, there is Ms. Wang, who has
done a lot to give gowns more sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when June brides place their dress
orders. A glance at the hefty February/March issue of Bride's
magazine _ ``the blockbuster issue,'' as the cover trumpets _
suggests that fashion strongly influences wedding clothes.
Necklines plunge, the silhouettes are sexier, and everywhere, from
Watteau trains to jeweled embellishments, there is a sense of
let-them-eat-cake opulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change from, say, five years ago is that girls are looking
for fuller skirts, usually in satin or organza, with strapless or
sleeveless bodices,'' said Erisa Katsura, the design director of
Yumi Katsura, a bridal boutique on Madison Avenue. ``There are
still some girls looking for simple dresses, but the look now is
richer, with distinctive details.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wang, who recently opened a Manhattan boutique just for
bridesmaid regalia and who hopes to open what she calls ``combo
stores'' (``It sounds awful,'' she admitted) for both brides and
attendants, said, ``I like to think we changed the perception.''
She paused and let out a throaty laugh. ``I really hate brides!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. With New York awash in cash, this could be a
bumper year for bridal designers. ``There is a proliferation of
weddings right now,'' said Ms. Wang, who, in addition to her
bread-and-butter bridal styles, offers a limited Luxe line of about
25 looks with custom handwork and an average price of $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   There are alternatives. Jessica McClintock sells strapless
dresses with appliqued hems for as little as $350 at department
stores. And Shalini, a former Isaac Mizrahi assistant, who has her
own business on Seventh Avenue, designs the sort of simple,
well-made sheaths and minimalist coats in silk faille that might
appeal to chic brides and guests alike. Defying conventional
fashion wisdom, she always keeps a few classic styles in her line,
which sells at Saks Fifth Avenue. ``I don't know why you should
take a perfectly good dress out of the collection and say, `We
don't believe in it anymore,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Barneys and the prospects for selling, say, a
teacup Lacroix dress with a removable skirt (for the ``I do''
moment), or a sparkly Akira outfit with a stole and trousers? As it
is, the high-end designer business has been a hard sell for many
stores, despite the strong economy. Ms. Collinson won't venture to
predict the response to the Barneys' salon, where prices will
average around $7,000. ``In a way, it's a little like having the
bridal jitters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she thinks there's a sophisticated customer looking for
something different, who identifies with the stark modernism of
Beene's A-line gown with a green harness or who wants the bravura
of a Theyskens gown with a huge train. ``When we first saw the
dress, which was in black, we thought, What would that look like in
white?'' Ms. Collinson said. ``Olivier said he had done it before.
So for a lot of these designers, doing bride is not such a leap.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Ms. Wang, a veteran of bridal jitters, points out,
there's a huge difference between what a woman will buy to satisfy
her fashion tastes and what she wants for her wedding day. ``I love
modern,'' Ms. Wang said. ``I worship at Jil Sander's temple. But
during the eight years I've been doing this, I've always tried to
include some dresses that I think look really modern, and they've
never been very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Ms. Wang has learned is that she can't make her
business grow without satisfying, as she said, ``the other client,
the one who wants something old, something new.'' Bring on the
satin cream puffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be the first to wish Barneys success,'' Ms. Wang said.
``But this is a very strange business. Inside all of us, whether we
want to admit it or not, we have this thing about the spiritual
quality of marriage. I think marriage is so in style right now that
you want to celebrate it.'' And that means clothes that basically
reflect traditional tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if you're at all familiar with how designers like Ms.
Kawabubo present their ready-to-wear collections _ often with
little makeup and no music _ you must either be a devotee or be
able to conjure up a setting where such a radical style wouldn't
look ridiculous. And that doesn't immediately suggest the ballroom
at the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wang, who has outfitted same-sex commitment ceremonies and
isn't surprised by anything, is philosophical about the limits of
the modern bride. ``In these clothes, there's a lot of room for
error,'' she said. ``It's hard to see a girl in full makeup and red
lipstick wearing Geoffrey Beene.''

   A '60s Image Maker Marches On
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the mid-1960s, Roman Polanski tried to set up
David Bailey, the British fashion photographer, with a young French
actress whose looks were not the kind to divide opinion. Her name
was Catherine Deneuve, and at first, Bailey declined his friend's
offer. ``She's not my type,'' he said. ``She's too short.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey eventually met Ms. Deneuve, who starred in Polanski's
``Repulsion,'' and married her. This was between long love affairs
with Jean Shrimpton and Penelope Tree, women his camera turned into
icons. Bailey was the original ``modelizer,'' to borrow a term from
1990s media parlance. He was Austin Powers, a character inspired by
his exploits, with a toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bailey, in New York a few weeks ago wrapping up an ad
campaign for Bergdorf Goodman, said he didn't really know the names
of the models he'd just finished working with, it sounded the same
as if Martha Stewart had said she couldn't remember if forks go on
the left or right of a dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   In an East Village photo studio, Bailey, 62, wearing white
Reeboks and a waist size considerably more imposing than it was
when he brought the sex, grit and verve of Carnaby Street to
magazines, said he avoided fashion work in the 1980s. He hasn't
done it often recently. Bailey, based in London, has done portrait
work and hundreds of television commercials for companies like IBM,
some of them award winners. He has also pursued film. Over the
summer, he finished shooting a thriller, ``The Intruder,'' with
Nastassja Kinski. ``It's not a great film,'' he said. ``It's just
OK I've seen worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking more like a character on a Lifetime cable series than a
man who had Mick Jagger as the best man at one of his weddings (to
Ms. Deneuve), Bailey said he shot the Bergdorf ads because members
of the store's creative team ``seemed like nice people and I have
three kids to put through school.'' For years, Bergdorf's campaigns
have been less than memorable. The Bailey images, which recall some
of his spare studio work, center on new spring lines and will
appear next month.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rizzo, Bergdorf's president, said, ``We don't normally
have the budget for the world's top photographers.'' The store
sought out Bailey to create a look that would be proprietary, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has long said that he's never been all that interested in
fashion. He doesn't seem to think much of the photographs that
document it today, either. ``Lots of photographers are totally the
same,'' he said. ``You don't know who's done what. To do good
things with photography, you have to do something totally
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the world seems perpetually struck by a
nostalgia for the mod '60s that he helped to give birth to, Bailey
says he is not. ``I never went out with girls in white boots and
funny haircuts,'' he said. ``People get caught up in the
characterization of a period.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, he's never seen ``Austin Powers.''

   Bazaar's Drummer Is Vogue
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Katherine Betts has said that in remaking Harper's
Bazaar she intends to beef up the magazine's lifestyle and
Hollywood coverage, and many have interpreted this to mean a book
like the ad-heavy In Style. But the magazine that the evolving
Bazaar most closely resembles is the one Ms. Betts was recruited
from: Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts' full redesign of Harper's Bazaar will not have its
premiere until the February issue,is month, the similarities
to the magazine edited by Anna Wintour, to whom Ms. Betts once
played the role of protege, are hard to miss. Bazaar features the
model Gisele on its cover in a Gucci python dress. Gisele also
appears on the January cover of Vogue in Gucci python. Both
magazines have stories on the craze for fancy handbags. In Bazaar's
new Fashion Click section, which covers parties, one can find a
picture of Jade Jagger in the same Matthew Williamson dress she
wears in Vogue's similar Talking Fashion section. Both pages sit
across from the same ad for Fashionmall.com.
</P>
<P>
   Vogue has a story on young designers titled ``Generation Next.''
Ms. Betts, who has said she loves writing headlines, has run a
story on some of the same designers also under the title
``Generation Next.'' This suggests that fashion copywriters are not
the most imaginative people and that Ms. Betts, perhaps
subconsciously, is out to recreate the formula she learned at Conde
Nast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts' only comment on the pervasive sameness is that it's a
``total coincidence.''

DESPITE INMATE STRIKE THREAT, NO DISRUPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite threats that prison inmates across New York
state would begin a strike on New Year's Day, state officials said
no major disruptions had occurred as of Monday, the first day
inmates were expected to return to jobs after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several places that were running slow,'' said James B.
Flateau, a spokesman for the state Department of Correctional
Services. ``But the system is operating normally.'' About half of
the 72,000 inmates in state prisons work in jobs from prison
maintenance to furniture making and earn an average of $1.05 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Fitzpatrick, director of public relations for the New York
State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, a
union that represents state prison guards, said he was not aware of
any reports of violence in state prisons in the last few days. He
would not say whether some inmates had refused to leave their cells
or go to work. ``We have to monitor this very closely,'' he said.
``Until someone comes up and says there's not going to be any
problem, we'll always consider it a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   All 2,100 inmates at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in
Ossining, in Westchester County, N.Y., and all 1,800 at the Green
Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, in Dutchess County,
N.Y., remained under lockdown for the 11th straight day Monday,
forbidden to leave their cells except for visitors, emergency
medical care or food-preparation jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 24, Glenn S. Goord, the state corrections commissioner,
ordered the lockdowns after five rounds of 9mm ammunition were
found in a common area at Sing Sing and after some inmates at Green
Haven were charged with trying to coerce other inmates into joining
the planned strike.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau said he did not know how much longer the lockdown would
continue. He added that it would not end ``until we have finished
frisking inmates at Sing Sing, and at Green Haven until we finish
investigating inmates who were strong-arming other inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 85 inmates who were accused of plotting the strike _
encouraging inmates to stay in their cells and not report for
prison jobs _ were transferred from Green Haven to other state
prisons in recent months. Others who were found with a flier
calling for the work stoppage have been punished or placed in
isolation, prison officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Green, executive director of the Center for Law and
Justice in Albany, N.Y., an inmate advocacy group, said the
protests had probably been quelled by inmate transfers and threats
of disciplinary actions. She added, ``Key problems and issues and
grievances remain, and if policy makers don't do anything to
address that, tensions are going to grow.''

ALGERIAN HELD IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An Algerian man swept up in the investigation
surrounding an attempt to smuggle explosives into the United States
was charged Monday in federal court in Seattle with illegally
sneaking across the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors made no link with the Dec. 14 arrest of
Ahmed Ressam, who faces five federal counts related to bomb-making
materials discovered in his car as he entered the country by ferry
from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials in Washington, D.C., confirmed
Monday they were looking for a connection.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, was in the custody of immigration
agents before federal authorities _ fearing a terrorist plot to
bomb millennium celebrations _ fanned out around the country last
week to question people possibly linked to Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 people _ most of them Algerian nationals _ were either
charged with criminal violations or detained.
</P>
<P>
   Tizegha, who sported a goatee and cropped curly hair in court
Monday, listened intently as the proceedings were translated into
Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   He will have a preliminary hearing on Jan. 14, unless he is
indicted before then by a grand jury on additional charges.
</P>
<P>
   Tizegha is charged with illegally re-entering ited States,
a felony; and excluding examination by INS authorities, a
misdemeanor. If convicted, he faces 2-1/2 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. He is being held at the federal detention center in
SeaTac.
</P>
<P>
   Tizegha was arrested in Bellevue on Christmas Eve after he
attempted to run from an INS agent, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   He entered this county in 1993 as a stowaway on a ship,
according to court documents. He lived for a time in Boston, and
applied there for political asylum. That request was denied in
April 1997, as was his subsequent appeal last June.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 30, Tizegha's Bellevue roommate told FBI agents that he
had known the Algerian for 14 months, and that Tizegha moved to
Seattle in winter 1998. In August, Tizegha went to Vancouver, B.C.,
the roommate said.
</P>
<P>
   Tizegha applied for refugee status in that city on Oct. 18,
according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, he mailed the roommate a package of his clothes and
his petition for refugee status, the FBI said. Tizegha then asked
for some money so he could return to Seattle from Vancouver, and
the roommate wired him $40.
</P>
<P>
   When Tizegha arrived a week later, he told his roommate that he
had sneaked across the border on foot through woods to avoid INS
agents, then caught a bus to Seattle in Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed with his roommate until his arrest on Dec. 24.
Afterward, he called his roommate from the INS detention facility
and asked him to go through his possessions, find the bus ticket
from Bellingham and burn it.
</P>
<P>
   The roommate did so, the court documents said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Algerian whom federal authorities have linked to Ressam
was arrested last week in New York City. Abdel Ghani, who allegedly
traveled to Seattle on Dec. 11 to meet Ressam, was charged with
secretly trying to help Ressam violate federal explosives laws, and
with conspiring to use fraudulent credit and bank cards.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, arrested in Port Angeles after he drove off a ferry in a
rental car, has been charged with attempting to smuggle a highly
explosive substance known as RDX into the country from Canada.
Timing devices and other chemicals used in creating bombs were
seized from his car.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, 32, faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the
charges. He has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Vermont say Ressam and a Montreal woman _
Lucy Garofalo _ have ties to an Algerian terrorist organization.
Garofalo was arrested as she entered that state from Canada a few
days after Ressam was nabbed in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Vermont say Garofalo and Ressam are linked to the
Armed Islamic Group, known by the French acronym GIA.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA is an extremist faction held responsible for some of the
bloodiest attacks in Algeria's nearly eight-year civil war. It has
also been blamed for bombings in France in 1995 and 1996, and an
airplane hijacking in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York case, court papers say Ghani mentioned to a
confidential source _ a reference sometimes used for an intercepted
communication _ that ``the situation was boiling in Algeria and
that the United States and the CIA are running everything over
there.''

JETS EXPERIENCE A JOLT, BUT DON'T FEEL JILTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Poetry lines should be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The players said Bill Parcells had tears in
his eyes when he said goodbye Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he dropped the microphone and left,'' linebacker
Dwayne Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every player was surprised _ even stunned _ that
Parcells had left the Jets on a high note.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Jets acted as if they had made the playoffs after
a fourth straight victory against a playoff-contending team enabled
them to finish the season at a respectable 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   The players believed Parcells, who will remain with the Jets as
a consultant, would return as coach. Instead, he brought them all
together in the auditorium in the team's complex and concluded his
valedictory by reading a poem written in 1934 by Dale Wimbrow.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``The Guy in the Glass,'' the poem is often used as a
motivational tool and is about a person looking at himself clearly.
It has been quoted in Dear Abby, and by Falcons Coach Dan Reeves.
And Monday the poem was referred to by Parcells as ``The Man in the
Glass,'' with a 20-line text that somewhat modernized the 1934
version.
</P>
<P>
   The last lines of the poem _ and Parcells' last words to his
players _ were:
</P>
<P>
   But your final reward will be heartaches and tears,
</P>
<P>
   If you've cheated the man in the glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news began to sink in, and the players voiced their
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, whose status as a National
Football League quarterback was greatly elevated by his one full
season with Parcells, seemed mildly shocked by Parcells' departure.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Testaverde has a long relationship with Bill
Belichick, who became the Jets' new head coach Monday after serving
as the team's defensive backs coach as well as its defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Belichick who, as the Cleveland coach, rescued
Testaverde from the futility of Tampa Bay in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a head coach already and he knows the team,''
Testaverde said when asked about Belichick. ``He's a lot like Coach
Parcells: the practice schedule, the way he can get in your face if
he has to. I think there will be very little change.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ray Lucas, the special-teams player whom Parcells
felt had the makings of something more, and clearly did, said: ``I
don't know if I'm surprised. We don't fall off too much, but still,
we're going to miss him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson, the gifted wide receiver, said he understood
what Parcells was trying to tell the team with his emotional
reading of the poem. ``If you just don't have it, you don't have
it,'' Johnson said. ``You have to be true to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an outsider coming in, I'd probably think there
was a red flag. But dealing with Bill Belichick? He's my man.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Glenn contemplated life without Parcells and said: ``He'll
still be around. That gives you some sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Otis Smith, who also played for Parcells in New
England and whose 1999 season was ended early by a broken
collarbone, said: ``This is not the end of a legend, but the start
of something new. I don't know whether I'll be part of it. But
Coach Parcells did a lot for players and nonplayers alike. He's a
man of his own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Fred Baxter was one of 13 players from Parcells' first
Jets team of 1997 whom the coach had asked to stand in the
auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy he was coming back,'' Baxter said. ``He'll
still be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Crennel, the defensive line coach, who was saying goodbye
to players in the locker room, contended there would be no
significant changes in the coaching staff. Most of the assistants
go back with Belichick to his Giants days of the 1980s and 1990, a
time when Parcells, with Belichick as his defensive coordinator,
won two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   For Jason Fabini, a second-year tackle who was an instant
starter under Parcells, there was simply resignation about his
coach's decision to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what he wanted to do and he did it,'' Fabini said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn saw what happened in New England, where Pete Carroll was
dismissed Monday by the Patriots after three frustrating years of
trying to follow Parcells' footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be hard on Bill Belichick,'' Glenn said. ``I put this in
the same category as the Pete Carroll situation. But you only put
pressure on yourself. I don't think Bill Belichick has to put
pressure on himself. He's already a good coach, and he knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, it wasn't just current Jets who were reacting to
Parcells' departure Monday. Billy Ard, who played guard for the
Giants on Parcells' first Super Bowl winner, said: ``I'm going to
call him next week and make him laugh. I'll say, `You have a chance
to take your phenomenal name and bring it two steps higher. You're
a Jersey guy; I want to you to think about becoming the Rutgers
coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ard's fellow lineman Bart Oates, who has two Super Bowl rings,
said of Parcells: ``His expectations were very high because he was
a very demanding coach. But except for the strike year of 1987,
I've never seen a Parcells team underperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil McConkey, the wide receiver and punt returner who won one
Super Bowl with Parcells, said: ``Every time we punted in practice,
he was standing two inches away from me. I think I was the best
punt-catcher in the world, but I wasn't good enough for him. That
kept me focused.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Harry Carson, the Giants linebacker who was a
mainstay on many Parcells teams. He was asked just what made
Parcells so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew how to motivate players to do what he wanted them to
do,'' Carson said. ``Everybody can't do that, but he has a feel for
how he wants things done. He projected a certain image to the
media, but that wasn't always what he projected to his players.''

TAVERN WHERE GEORGE WASHINGTON GAVE SPEECH IS FORCED TO CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In its 237 years, Fraunces Tavern has survived the
American Revolution, a devastating fire and a terrorist bombing.
</P>
<P>
   For the most recent half-century or so, the historic tavern
where Gen. George Washington gave his farewell speech to his troops
in 1783 has been run by the Norden family. But the establishment
faces a modern-day Manhattan problem _ high real estate costs _ and
the owner, Robert Norden Jr., says he is being evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute negotiations Monday with the building's owner _ a
historic society called the Sons of the Revolution _ failed, Norden
said. So he began loading much of his office equipment into moving
vehicles, and when the restaurant's staff reports to work Tuesday,
they will come to move, not to cook.
</P>
<P>
   For the past eight years, Norden said, he has run the tavern on
a month-to-month lease that came out to about $300,000 each year.
But late last year, he said, the board refused to act on a 10-year
lease he proposed that would have kept the rate steady.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Norden said, the owners rejected his request to
extend the lease for a few more months while both parties try to
reach an agreement on a long-term lease, and they told him he had
to leave. Board members of the Sons of the Revolution could not be
reached Monday by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may think that the real estate is worth more because it's
Wall Street, the economy is good, but it is a tavern,'' Norden
said, adding that because of the location in the financial
district, which is busy only on weekdays, it was not even feasible
to open on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Landmarks and Preservation commissioner has
designated the building, which also includes a museum, a historic
site. City officials say this limits the types of uses and
alterations that can be made to the building, so even if Norden's
family is pushed out, it is likely that it would probably be leased
to someone who would operate some sort of bar or tavern.
</P>
<P>
   The original Fraunces Tavern building was erected in 1719 as a
Georgian-style house for Steven DeLancey. In 1763, the building was
converted into a tavern by Samuel Fraunces, and it was there 20
years later that Washington gave his famous farewell address to the
officers who helped the United States gain its freedom from
Britain. In a second-floor room just above the restaurant, the
general told his troops, ``with a heart full of love and gratitude,
I now take leave of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1900, the original building was destroyed in a fire
that tore through Lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, the tavern was rebuilt at the same location.
In 1975, four people were killed and 53 were injured when a bomb
set by the FALN, a group of Puerto Rican terrorists, went off in
the building. More recently the tavern has been a popular tourist
spot.

EDITORIAL: THE FESTIVAL IN TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 4: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a vast throng gathered in Lower Manhattan to hail the
ratification of the United States Constitution in 1787, New York
City has served as the premier location for great national
celebrations. The New Year's Eve spectacle last weekend was no
exception. Thanks to exhaustive planning by the police and city
officials under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Times Square bash was a
glittering triumph. The crowd could be joyous because it knew that
all possible precautions had been taken even in the absence of
specific hints of terrorist threats or other mayhem. Yet the
security measures were installed in a spirit that did not
jeopardize the chance of having an uproariously good time.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to New Year's Eve, the temptation was
widespread in this hardened town to be cynical about the events
surrounding the new millennium. The sealed manhole covers, police
barricades, frozen zones and widespread security presence were
welcome but not exactly an invitation to party. Then came the
breathtaking televised diorama that moved from dancing on the beach
in the South Pacific to the fireworks in Sydney, Tokyo, Rome,
Paris, London and finally New York. Maybe the fireworks at the
Eiffel Tower and the light show at the Washington Monument did make
New York's confetti and balloons seem a little dated.
</P>
<P>
   But New Yorkers could boast that they made do with a budget from
local businesses and national sponsorships rather than from the
government. More important, the unusually benign crowd in Times
Square and the surrounding area, where only 14 people were
arrested, epitomized the worldwide theme of peaceful convocation.
What was being celebrated seemed to evolve with the evening.
Initially, many may have been thinking mainly in terms of averted
disasters. But as the wave of midnights rolled around the world,
most people were glad to cheer the global phenomenon that came
wrapped in those blessed hours of peace: genuine hope for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, New Yorkers have a penchant for what the
historian Mike Wallace calls the ``festivals of connection'' that
have provided the most memorable celebrations in the city's past.
Usually they are linked to particular historic moments. The crowd
cheering the opening of the Erie Canal in 1824 knew that the city
would forever be transformed, Wallace notes. In similar fashion,
the throng that greeted the laying of the trans-Atlantic cable in
1857, with its initial message from Queen Victoria to President
James Buchanan, knew that communication would never be the same.
The cheering turnouts for Charles Lindbergh, John Glenn and Neil
Armstrong were all testimony to the collapsing of physical
distances.
</P>
<P>
   While the worldwide millennium celebration was of a more diffuse
nature, the Times Square party nonetheless followed in that
tradition of celebrating connection. It was a specific New York
moment, rooted in a Midtown area that is emerging as a center of
the city's media and entertainment business. It also brought the
city into an immediate connection with celebrations around the
world, and in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and countless
smaller places around the country. With people watching on
television while communicating with each other by Internet, a
vehicle that was barely known a decade ago, the party summed up
where the city and the country are now. Times Square became a
bejeweled cocoon in which we could hear the echoes of each other's
relief and joy that the world had made it through a dangerous time
and could turn to the future with, at the least, a fresh
familiarity with what peace feels like.

QUEENS ARRAIGNMENTS DELAYED BY YEAR 2000 BUG IN POLICE PRINTERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The date was Jan. 1, 2000, but the fickle computers
in most of the 16 police precincts in Queens didn't see it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, criminal complaints printed out by New York police
officers on an antiquated computer system listed the date of the
crime as Jan. 1, 1900, instead of Jan. 1, 2000, said the Queens
district attorney's office, which first noticed the problem. The
forms also popped up with the inexplicable notation of Jan. 4,
1980, for the date the officers had signed the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The errors continued on a smaller scale Sunday and Monday, with
some computers listing the crime dates as Jan. 2 and 3, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ryan, chief assistant district attorney in Queens, said the
problem was not serious because the flaws were quickly spotted, and
police officers were instructed to correct the dates on complaints
bound for the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan estimated that 50 to 100 complaints with incorrect dates
went to the district attorney's office in the last three days, but
he said he believed none had gone on to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than being off by 100 years, everything is fine,'' he
said. ``We've survived worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Some arraignments, however, were delayed slightly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he believed the problem was limited to Queens because
it is the only borough where the police use a program called CAPS,
for Complaint Arrest Processing System, to write up complaints.
After drafting a complaint, officers print it out and fax or
deliver it by hand to the district attorney's office for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the precincts in Queens were affected at first, but by
Monday the problem had been confined to three precincts, said Lt.
Sean Crowley, a police spokesman. He said computer maintenance
workers were trying to have the problem corrected by Tuesday.
Still, the error continued to confound and confuse Monday, when
some complaints appeared with the correct date for officers'
signatures but incorrect dates for the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, I was worried about flashlights,'' Ryan said.
``This is what I'm worried about today. Next week, who knows?''

 &HT;    Ballot set for Texas' statewide primariesBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The March statewide primaries in Texas will be
highlighted by a potentially pivotal _ or entirely meaningless _
Democratic presidential battle between Al Gore and Bill Bradley,
and a Senate scramble among a late-forming field of five
little-known Democratic contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Senate race faces Kay Bailey Hutchison, an
incumbent with no Republican opponent and more than $6 million in
her campaign account. The Democrats itching for a battle with
Hutchison are former state Rep. Charles Gandy, retired military
lawyer Gene Kelly, Dallas lawyer Bobby Wightman-Cervantes, retired
airline worker H. Gerald Bintliff and former bank executive Don
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly filed several weeks ago. The others filed on Monday, the
deadline for getting on the March 14 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats wound up fielding candidates in three of the nine
statewide races. Under a strategy that has them concentrating on
legislative and congressional battles, the Democrats have no
big-name contenders for statewide posts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deadline passed with no Democrats filing for Railroad
Commission seats now held by Republicans Charles Matthews and
Michael Williams. Williams faces Andy Draughn of Houston in the GOP
primary. Matthews drew no opponents. In other filing highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Steve Mansfield, a
Republican who pleaded guilty after being caught scalping
University of Texas football tickets, announced he would not seek
another term. Five Republicans filed for Mansfield's seat. There
are no Democratic contenders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Democrats (attorney William Barr and Waco Court of Appeals
Justice Bill Vance) filed for seats on the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals now held by Republicans. The party, however, will have no
candidates for any of the three Texas Supreme Court seats. GOP
Supreme Court Justices Nathan Hecht and Al Gonzales drew primary
foes. Incumbent Republican Priscilla Owen did not.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Sen. Drew Nixon, R-Carthage, announced he would not seek
re-election. Nixon served jail time in Austin after his 1997 arrest
for soliciting an undercover officer posing as a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   The March primaries lead up to a November election that will be
the first since the Republicans, in 1998, completed their sweep of
all 27 statewide offices. Texas Democrats, who formerly dominated
state government, are concentrating are maintaining their edge in
the Texas House, regaining a Texas Senate majority and keeping its
edge in the U.S. House delegation. Democratic Chair Molly Beth
Malcolm said the Gore-Bradley battle is a ``toss-up'' in Texas,
where the primary could be crucial if the race is not decided by
March 14. Democrats in 26 other states will vote before Texans do.
Both campaigns say they are treating Texas as if it will be
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Texas is going to play a major role in the outcome of
this race,'' said Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign could end as early as Feb. 1 if Gore somehow
pulls off a big victory in New Hampshire, something the polls do
not currently foresee. On the GOP side, Gov. George W. Bush is a
prohibitive favorite in his home state's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Senate race, Hutchison will also be a strong
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a retired military lawyer and a six-time loser in
statewide races, said Monday he is ``delighted'' to have opposition
for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy, former one-term state House member who represented
Mesquite from 1983 through 1984, said he got in the race because it
is important for Texans to have a Democrat and a Republican in the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to be ``the voice for everybody this side of the far
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Texas House, Gandy has lived in Austin and
worked as executive director of the Texas Bicycle Coalition and,
currently, as a consultant for ``livable communities,'' a concept
that involves new ways of melding the use of public spaces and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Bintliff, a resident of Leonard in Northeast Texas, said his
candidacy was motivated by the lack of response from Hutchison to
his letter about second-hand smoke and schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Bintliff, a retired American Airlines employee who identifies
himself as schizophrenic, said he will run a limited campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm still sensitive to smoke and it makes me sick, I
don't know how many places I can really go to speak out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a former Bank of America executive living in Mesquite,
said his campaign will focus on ``issues that pertain to middle-
and lower-class folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wightman-Cervantes, a gay rights activist, said he is running
because Hutchison ``is oblivious to the people of Texas.'' In 1998,
Wightman-Cervantes unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination
for a state district judgeship in Dallas. In Texas congressional
races, where Democrats hold a 17-13 edge, Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin,
drew a last-minute challenger when Ronnie ``Reeferseed'' Gjemre, a
Spicewood resident and hemp crusader, filed as a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, a physician whose district
includes eastern Williamson and western Travis counties, faces his
second straight challenge from former Matagorda County Judge Loy
Sneary, a Democrat.

<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Talks between Israeli and Syrian leaders
on a comprehensive peace accord opened Monday behind sealed doors.
The meetings opened with a sense of urgency, American officials
said, but they pointed to signs that the path would not be easy and
that a single round of negotiations would probably not conclude the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions resumed where the parties left off three weeks
ago in Washington, with both sides indicating a determination to
engage in days or weeks of round-the-clock discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest issues are before them, involving security,
borders, water rights and political relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the difficulty of the talks, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Prime Minister Farouk al-Sharaa did not meet
directly with each other at all Monday. President Clinton left
Shepherdstown Monday evening after a secoing with al-Sharaa,
but without hosting a planned session that would have included the
Israeli and Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said he had no
progress to report at the end of the day of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very hard issues,'' Rubin said. ``You can't have a
fully-scripted procedure with talks this complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and al-Sharaa made no publent. Clinton said through
a spokesman that he believed the talks were ``off to a good
start.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are being held in Shepherdstown, a tranquil
town on the Potomac River about 70 miles from Washington. It was
selected for its isolation, depriving the negotiators of
distractions and increasing the pressure for serious talks.
</P>
<P>
   American mediators have successfully used the technique of
enforced isolation in Middle East peace talks before _ with
Israelis and Egyptians at Camp David in 1978, and with Israelis and
Palestinians at Wye River Plantation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israel has sent a delegation of about 55 officials, including
the country's foreign minister, David Levy; the attorney general,
Eliyakim Rubenstein; Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the minister of tourism
and a former army chief of staff; Zvi Shtauber, the prime
minister's security adviser; and dozens of lawyers, military
officers and technical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's delegation includes 25 to 30 officials, including two
deputy foreign ministers, Yusuf Shakkur and Majeed Abusaleh,
Syria's former ambassador to the United States, Walid Muallim, and
several generals and legal advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, the president of Syria, is not attending this stage
of the talks but his presence at a more decisive stage has not been
ruled out. Assad has assured Clinton that al-Sharaa carries
``plenipotentiary powers'' to conclude an agreement with the
Israelis, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that delegates were not being held
incommunicado, but the normally talkative Israelis have agreed to
turn off their cellular telephones to lessen the possibility of
news leaks. The Syrian government has never been particularly
leak-prone.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations began at the National Conservation Training
Center, which is operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Rubin and Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, provided
the only public information about Monday's meetings to the press
corps, which is sequestered at Shepherd College.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the talks started, Clinton strolled through the
grounds of the training center with Barak on his right and
al-Sharaa on his left. In what was clearly a made-for-television
moment, the three leaders stepped onto a 200-foot-long pedestrian
bridge over a 25-foot-deep gully, pausing about two-thirds of the
way across to gaze out at the Potomac River about 300 yards to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cameras clicked and reporters shouted, but Clinton only smiled
and waved. The three men then walked silently into the gray stone
Commons Building, where Clinton met privately with each leader for
about an hour to discuss a negotiating strategy for the next few
days, officials said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also
met individually with the Israeli and Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The American team that is expected to remain behind for
negotiations included Dennis Ross, the administration's special
Middle East envoy, and his deputy, Aaron Miller; Martin Indyk, the
assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs; Bruce
Reidel, the senior director for Mideast policy at the National
Security Council, and his deputy, Robert Malley; and a supporting
cast of regional experts, note-takers and translators.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Donald Carrick, military adviser to Albright, was also
present for Monday's talks, and additional Pentagon experts were
expected to arrive on Tuesday as the parties begin to grapple with
regional security arrangements and the expected U.S. role in
monitoring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these negotiations the devil is in the details, and the
detail men will be the men that are going to play a critical
role,'' Rubin said. ``And we do expect that during this round, that
all of the issues, one way or another, will be discussed in detail.
But that's a very different thing than expecting that, having
discussed them, that they will achieve agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No one would predict how long the talks here might last. Rubin
said he packed enough clean shirts for ``more than a week,'' and
Barak is said to be willing to stay as long as two weeks if
progress is evident. Clinton has said he will return to
Shepherdstown as often as is necessary to help resolve conflicts or
to offer top-level assurances of America support for difficult
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond serving as mediator and broker for the talks, the United
States is certain to emerge as guarantor and paymaster of any
accord reached here. Israel is expected to ask for military
upgrades to compensate for the loss of the strategic Golan Heights
and economic aid to help pay for the resettlement of some 17,000
Israelis who moved into territories seized from Syria in the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, for its part, is looking for a substantial package of
economic and technical aid to boost its dormant economy and bring
it into the age of computers and global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not yet begun to consult with
congressional leaders on the terms of any new aid package for the
Middle East. It is not certain whether the Republican-led Congress
will agree to pick up part of the tab, which is estimated to be
between $10 billion and $100 billion over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, big deal, and a deal this big is going to carry
with it a price tag,'' Rubin said. ``But we believe the peace is so
important, and our vital interests could so be strengthened by a
peace agreement, that it is worth our playing an important role.''

J.C. PENNEY BEGINS SEARCH FOR NEW AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Texas, Ill., N.Y., Ark.)  (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last month, Madison Avenue has been wondering
whether holiday sales results would trigger significant shifts in
the advertising plans of the myriad dot-com start-up retailers,
particularly those that poured vast sums into campaigns to attract
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the first big change of the post-Christmas
period is being made by a bricks-and-mortar retailer, the J.C.
Penney Co., rather than an upstart dot-com. Penney, which has been
struggling to improve the performance of its 1,150 department
stores in an increasingly competitive retail field, is dismissing
its agency, Temerlin McClain in Irving, Texas, after almost nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal comes before Penney and other traditional
retailers announce holiday shopping results. But analysts said they
expected the company to continue its recent disappointments and
also lag its primary rival, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Sales have
declined for Penney, the nation's fifth largest retailer, as have
earnings, and in December, Penney reduced its quarterly
common-stock dividend for the first time in 40 years. Tellingly,
Sears has just revamped its own ad plans, arranging for its two
principal agencies to collaborate on a national campaign for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Penney decision puts into play an account with billings
estimated at $110 million to $115 million, out of a total budget
for Penney estimated at $300 million. That figure includes ads like
preprinted circulars, which Temerlin McClain does not produce.
</P>
<P>
   Temerlin McClain has handled assignments for Penney since the
summer of 1991 like the creation of national corporate campaigns
carrying themes including ``The best place to spend this holiday
season,'' ``Doing it right'' and ``The look. Look who.'' Media
buying has been handled by Mediavest in New York, part of the
MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   Temerlin McClain's hold on the Penney account, one of its
largest, has been slipping as the client continued to encounter
difficulties in finding a niche between specialty chains like Gap,
operated by Gap Inc., and discounters like Wal-Mart Stores and the
Target unit of Dayton Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Temerlin McClain lost two important Penney
tasks to the Dallas office of DDB Worldwide, owned by the Omnicom
Group. One was the Arizona Jeans account, for the denim duds sold
under that brand name at Penney stores, and the other was the
Penney home lines account. Each assignment had billings estimated
at $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.C. Penney is a company with a lot of potential,'' Dennis
McClain, chief executive and executive creative director at
Temerlin McClain, part of True North Communications, said Monday,
confirming a report about the review in the trade publication
Advertising Age, ``andwe had a great relationship for many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there have been tremendous management changes,'' he added,
``and the business was not what we'd all like it to be. This was a
move they felt they had to make in terms of getting their house in
order.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain described the Penney decision to place its account in
review and not ask Temerlin McClain to take part as ``mutually
agreed upon,'' adding that he was formally notified by the retailer
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sad to lose any major piece of business,'' McClain said,
``but changes happen when things aren't working right.''
</P>
<P>
   Penney accounted for about 10 percent of Temerlin McClain's
annual revenue of $80 million. About 100 of the agency's 700
employees have worked on Penney assignments in some fashion; of the
100, 32 to 37 are considered the core group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some modest reduction in staff,'' McClain said,
``but this will not amount to a tremendous economic issue for us.''
The agency will continue creating campaigns for the St. John's Bay
line of apparel sold in Penney stores.
</P>
<P>
   McClain said he was told by Penney executives that True North
would be ``invited to participate'' in the review ``as a holding
company, putting together a group to pursue the business'' that
would not include Temerlin McClain. Among other True North agencies
are the Bozell Group and FCB Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Woods, a spokeswoman in New York for True North, said
the agency company had not heard from Penney but ``would welcome
the opportunity to participate'' in the review. Pat Sloan, a
spokeswoman in New York for DDB, said, ``If asked, we'd be happy to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Brown, a spokeswoman for Penney, which is based in
Plano, Texas, said she could not identify the agencies being asked
to take part in the review, which is to be completed in March.
``Temerlin McClain has been greatly valued for its contributions,''
she added, but ``it's time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to ``hold a review came after several months of
careful consideration regarding the needs of our business,'' Ms.
Brown said, adding that the successor to Temerlin McClain would
handle that agency's duties as well as tasks like media planning
and buying.
</P>
<P>
   Temerlin McClain won its Penney assignments from what is now the
N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners unit of MacManus, which had worked for the
retailer since 1983. A major makeover for Penney in the 1980s,
emphasizing clothing and home furnishings rather than mass
merchandise like appliances, helped sales throughout most of the
1980s; Ayer conveyed that in campaigns carrying the theme ``Fashion
comes to life.'' However, in the early 1990s, when Penney sales
slumped during the recession, Ayer became a casualty.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who keep track of such things, the Penney Internet
retailing operation (www.jcpenney.com) came in 19th among the
most-visited shopping Web sites from Nov. 14 to Dec. 26, according
to Media Metrix, a market research company. Penney was the only
bricks-and-mortar department store on the list.

<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 4: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is the first day, after nearly half a century, that the
daily comic strip ``Peanuts'' will not appear. Just why it would be
funny to see a young boy lean his head against a tree and say ``I
weep for our generation'' is hard to explain, but Charlie Brown and
his creator, Charles M. Schulz, made it so. Schulz, who is 77 and
ill with colon cancer, and the generation that grew up reading
``Peanuts'' may feel like crying too.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ``Peanuts'' has been many things to many people
_ an animated embodiment of the Christmas spirit, a stockpile of
reassuring sentiments, a collection of fantasies lived through a
beagle named Snoopy. But for a time between the late 1950s and the
mid 1960s ``Peanuts'' was also something much, much more. It was,
in the persons of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy Van Pelt and her
brother, Linus, a distillation of modern childhood, an ongoing
parable of contemporary American existence.
</P>
<P>
   The block where those characters lived _ and still live _ was
the scene of a comic opera whose themes are acceptance, reason and
authority. Linus is the voice of reason _ the blanket-toting boy
who hesitates between ``The Interpreter's Bible'' and ``Moby Dick''
while looking for something to read with his bowl of cereal. But
reason is nearly always trumped by authority, whose name is Lucy _
proprietor of a sidewalk psychiatric office and purveyor of
gloriously certain and erroneous knowledge. And then there is
Charlie Brown, buffeted by desire and despair, transparently aware
of his own emotions, painfully eager for heroism or even simple
acceptance. He is burdened as much by Lucy's erratic dogmatism as
he is by Linus' outrageous competence. It is Charlie Brown, after
all, who brings a little red fire truck to ``show and tell'' on the
same day that Linus brings a homemade facsimile of the Dead Sea
Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   What made ``Peanuts'' different in those years was its joyous
melancholy, the way it so often edged toward irony without ever
spilling into anomie. Its humor arose from its situations _ Snoopy,
a jump-rope wrapped around his nose, pleading, ``Don't put a brand
on me, sir ... I'll stay in the corral!'' _ but also from its
prose. Those classic strips are among the most eloquent comics ever
written. For every ``Rats!'' or ``Good Grief!'' there is Snoopy
noticing that ``In these teacher-pupil struggles it's always the
principal who loses,'' or Linus shaking out his security blanket
and saying, ``Not unlike the proverbial clean slate,'' or Charlie
Brown lying with his head on the pitcher's mound, intoning
autumnally, ``There's a dreariness in the air that depresses me.''
Today, that is how we all feel knowing that ``Peanuts'' has run its
course. &QL;

   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 4: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This month is America's turn to preside over the United Nations
Security Council. That duty rotates among the body's 15 members.
While the powers of the council presidency are limited, the job
involves close coordination with Secretary General Kofi Annan and
considerable control over the council's agenda. Washington can use
this opportunity to press for action on a global front.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the United States' permanent representative,
properly wants to make the long-neglected problems of Africa a
theme of his tenure as council president. But while doing so, he
must also work on trouble spots like Iraq, Kosovo and East Timor,
where timely U.N. action is imperative.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke encountered African issues like ethnic persecution,
brutal civil war and AIDS firsthand on a recent visit to the
continent. On his return, he announced plans to hold council
sessions on such strife-torn countries as Burundi, Congo and Sierra
Leone. He also wants to devote at least one session to the social
and economic devastation wrought by AIDS, especially in southern
Africa. Those sessions are welcome and appropriate, although past
United Nations debates on Africa have offered little more than
pious talk.
</P>
<P>
   But other, non-African issues also demand the council's
attention. In Iraq, the first steps must be taken to put a hard-won
new security council resolution on arms inspections into effect.
Holbrooke needs to ensure that an independent and credible chief is
chosen for the new arms inspection agency that will be created. He
also ought to urge France and Russia to persuade Saddam Hussein to
accept the resolution. It offers the prospect of suspending some
economic sanctions in return for cooperating with the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, start-up problems that have plagued U.N.
administrators, particularly in policing, have to be addressed
before they become intractable. Holbrooke, who knows the Balkans
well, should help Bernard Kouchner, who directs U.N. operations in
Kosovo, get the political backing from U.N. headquarters that he
needs to succeed. Holbrooke should also prod European governments
to follow through on their financial commitments to the Kosovo
operation and urge all countries to live up to their commitments to
provide volunteers for the international police force there.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, some 100,000 East Timorese refugees are still
being terrorized by pro-Indonesian militias in West Timor.
Holbrooke, who played a firsthand part last summer in persuading
Jakarta to accept a more active U.N. role in Timor, can now help
press Indonesia's new democratic government and its military
leaders to disarm those militias and let the refugees return home.
</P>
<P>
   After a long period of estrangement between the United States
and the United Nations, the elements are now in place for a more
constructive relationship. Congress has at last agreed on a plan to
pay most of America's back dues. Annan is showing himself to be one
of the bolder leaders to hold the secretary general's job in recent
years, raising the U.N.'s public profile and helping to restore its
reputation with the release of self-critical reports on past
failings in Bosnia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke brings political clout and diplomatic skills to the
job of American representative. This month is the Clinton
administration's last chance to preside over the security council
and America's first chance to shape the international diplomacy of
a new millennium. Holbrooke should make bold use of this
opportunity. &QL;

N.Y. STATE GOP PAYS FINE FOR FAILING TO DETAIL EXPENSES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Republican State Committee has paid a fine of
$128,000 to the Federal Election Commission for making cash
expenditures and failing to disclose their purpose while it
monitored balloting in New York City in 1994 and 1996, the
commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, which settled a complaint brought by the FEC, is one
of the largest in the commission's history.
</P>
<P>
   It stems from the committee's move to scrutinize polling in New
York City, where Democrats dominate and some Republican leaders
have long believed that the election results are manipulated to
favor Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to ensure that the balloting was fair, the committee sent
volunteers to polling sites in 1994 and 1996 and often gave them
small amounts of cash for items like food, transportation and child
care, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It lumped those expenditures together on its mandatory
disclosure records as ``Election Day expenses,'' without providing
details.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, party committees and candidates are
generally required to make all but the smallest disbursements by
check and to disclose the purpose of each item.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in this case was a total of roughly $80,000 in
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Allen, a spokesman for the Republican State Committee, said
it settled the complaint because it was over a relatively minor
interpretation of the rules. ``We were under the impression that we
did not have to do technical reporting on such small
disbursements,'' Allen said. ``The FEC concluded otherwise. We have
corrected anything that we have done wrong in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it would no longer give cash to volunteers,
in most instances relying instead on buying MetroCards, prepaid
phone cards and other items that it could easily track and
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, whose power base is in the suburbs and upstate
New York, has since the 1989 mayoral election in New York City
called for changes in the way elections are conducted in the city.
It contends that Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican te, lost
that race to David Dinkins, the Democrat, because of fraud _ an
assertion that Democratic leaders call ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   The issue attracted renewed attention in 1998 when Dennis Vacco,
the state attorney general, narrowly lost his bid for re-election
to Eliot Spitzer, and Vacco, a Republican, refused to admit defeat
for weeks on the ground that the Democratic vote total in the city
had been inflated. He could never prove his charges, and eventually
conceded.

ZURICH LAYOVER  
 JEWISH BUENOS AIRES  
 BANANA BOATS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Questions may be italicized)  
 (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We will have layovers in Zurich on a February trip, the first
giving us an afternoon free and the second overnight. What do you
suggest we do or see? _ Jeffrey Weisman, Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. After you clear customs and take care of luggage, it should
be a 10-minute train ride from the airport to downtown Zurich,
according to Evelyne Mock of Switzerland Tourism in New York. Once
there, she suggests touring the old town.
</P>
<P>
   Two-hour guided walking tours meet at the main tourist office in
the rail station and cost about $11.25, at 1.6 francs to the
dollar. Information and reservations are available from (41-1)
215-40000, fax (41-1) 215-4044, and www.zurichtourism.ch. The
tourist center can also tell you about tours by trolley ($18) and
by cable car combined with a boat trip on Lake Zurich ($24).
</P>
<P>
   You could also take one of four self-guided tours with the free
``Walks Through Zurich'' map offered by Switzerland Tourism, 608
Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 757-5944, fax (212)
262-6116. The easy-to-follow directions lead you from the train
station up the Bahnhofstrasse, the luxury-shopping avenue; along
Augustinergasse past St. Peter's, Zurich's oldest church, to
Lindenhof, a park that was the site of a Roman fort and with views
across the Limmat River; from the National Museum next to the train
station across the river to the Romanesque Grossmunster Cathedral,
and past the Rathaus, the town hall; and back across the river past
Fraumunster Church, noted for its stained-glass windows by Chagall.
</P>
<P>
   When you are hungry, a traditional option is one of the guild
houses, like zur Schmiden, at 20 Marktgasse, (41-1) 250-5844, in a
building dating from 1530. For a snack, Sprungli, 21 Bahnhofstrasse
at Paradeplatz, (41-1) 221-1722, offers chocolate treats and good
cappuccino. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to visit the Swiss National Museum, 2
Museumstrasse, (41-1) 218-6511, which is linked with the train
station by an underpass. This castlelike structure offers a
sweeping overview of Swiss civilization from prehistoric artifacts
to medieval art to handicrafts, weaponry, completely furnished
rooms and musical instruments. Open free 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Tuesday to Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On your second layover, you will have time for a traditional
dinner at Kronenhalle, 4 Ramistrasse, (41-1) 251-6669, near the
Opera House, Zurich's most renowned restaurant. It is known for its
original art, by Chagall, among others, and its superb Zurich
cuisine, like Zurich Geschnetzeltes, veal and rosti in cream sauce.
A three-course meal for two with a good wine will run about $175.
</P>
<P>
   You could use your first layover to look into tickets for an
opera or concert on your return leg, or make the arrangements
before you leave home. Check with the tourist office or at
www.zurichtourism.ch for a schedule of events. &QL;

<P>
   Q. I will be in Buenos Aires with an elderly cousin who is
interested in Jewish history and culture. Are there any
Jewish-oriented tours of the city, preferably in English? _ Edward
B. Reich, Greenlawn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. For more than a century, Jews have had a substantial presence
in Argentina. They settled in Buenos Aires (which has about 50
synagogues) and other cities and set up agricultural colonies in
the provinces, including the first, Moises Ville, where a dwindling
few ``Jewish gauchos'' still tend wheat and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   A Buenos Aires agency called Tour-Ar, 408 Libertador,
Departamento A, (1001) Capital Federal, Argentina, telephone and
fax (54-11) 4211-1099 or (54-11) 4328-3254, offers a Jewish
Heritage tour. It lasts about three and a half hours and can be
tailored to personal interests. The cost is $150 for up to three
people.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking this tour or to plan a self-guided one, you might
want to get a 16-page pamphlet, ``Argentina: A Guide for the Jewish
Traveler,'' published by Aerolineas Argentinas and available free
from the Argentina Government Tourist Office, 12 West 56th Street,
New York, N.Y. 10019; (212) 603-0443, fax (212) 315-5545. It
discusses the Jewish heritage in Argentina and lists Jewish sites
and organizations, as well as general sightseeing suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to turn for guidance is a group commonly known as
AMIA _ for the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association _ at 633
Pasteur, Buenos Aires. It has art, film and other cultural
offerings, and if you fax a note to Anita Weinstein there at
(54-11) 4959-8865 saying when you will visit, she can suggest
things to do and places to visit. AMIA's phone number is (54-11)
4953-9595.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the summer has just begun in Argentina and
that vacations may limit access to some places in January and
February. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you shed light on the Geest Line, whose ships transported
bananas and a few passengers between the Caribbean and Britain. Our
mail inquiries have been returned undelivered. _ James F. McNamara,
New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The white Geest ships still ply the banana route, from Le
Havre and Southampton to the Caribbean. The line can be reached at
Windward Terminal, Post Office Box 154, Herbert Walker Avenue,
Western Docks, Southampton, England SO15 1AJ; telephone (44-2380)
333-388, fax (44-2380) 714-025. It also has a Web site,
www.geestline.co.uk, but it isn't much help for potential
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the line is to determine only this month
whether it will continue taking passengers, according to Ian
Cameron of Cargo Ship Voyages, an English agent that has handled
Geest cruises. Geest, which has been carrying four or five
passengers a ship for the last few years, is replacing its four
chartered ships this month, he said, and has not decided whether
the new ones will accommodate passengers.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Cameron said, he can book you on several other lines'
cargo ships. Rates for these trips out of Southampton run about
$3,250 a month _ these can be two months or more round trip _ and
include all meals (but not alcoholic drinks) and the use of
officers' lounges.
</P>
<P>
   These ships can spend up to nine days at some ports, offering
plenty of time to explore islands like Antigua, St. Lucia,
Martinique and St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   If your time is more limited, he suggests a cruise from
Southampton on a Fyffes Bananas ship, which you can take one way to
Belize and Costa Rica, then fly back to the United States. The fare
is $1,620. Information: Cargo Ship Voyages Ltd., Hemley,
Woodbridge, Suffolk, England IPI2 4QF; (44-1473) 736-265, fax
(44-1473) 736-726.

STAYING SAFE ON THE MOUNTAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Vt., Wash.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snowboarding, a sport now 15 years old, is booming, with
resulting major changes at ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Sporting Goods Association, which estimates that
7.7 million people over age 7 participated in alpine skiing at
least once in 1998, put the number of boarders, with some overlap,
at 3.6 million, an astonishing rise of 29 percent from the group's
1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
   On the association's list of 59 popular sports, topped by
exercise walking and ending with windsurfing, alpine skiing ranked
34th, with snowboarding 46th and closing in. The National Ski Areas
Association expects the totals to converge in five to six years.
</P>
<P>
   This change has had an impact on safety, but not the way
alarmists may believe: the number of injuries caused by boarders
who run into skiers is considered minor by safety experts, and most
ski areas doubt that segregation of the slopes would improve safety
much.
</P>
<P>
   Both sports involve blind spots, skiers to their rear, and
boarders to the side. In either sport, going at high speed might
not cause injury on an early morning empty hillside, while speeding
in an afternoon crowd, whether on skis or a board, could be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As for the maturity of the boarders, although the vanguard had a
devil-may-care hotdogging image, snowboarders are growing older
with the sport as baby-boomer parents take it up along with their
children. There is even a 60-year-old snowboard instructor out
there.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want fancy stuff, many areas have terrain parks
for skiiers who like tricky maneuvers, as well as snowboard parks
for those who want half-pipes, rails and other challenges. These
attractions divide participants by interests and keep them out of
one another's way.
</P>
<P>
   The major safety trends are in conflict. Injuries to skiers have
been declining, but snowboarding injuries have almost offset the
reduction. In addition, the two sports produce different types of
injuries, although as with bicycling and other sports, head
injuries are a major factor in deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Witt, a spokesman for the Vail Ski Resorts _ Vail, Beaver
Creek, Breckenridge and Keystone _ said about a quarter of the
visits to his resorts last year were by snowboarders. He said that
the growth of the boarding population had not changed the rate of
injuries, but rather the types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boarders' injuries tend to be in the wrist, shoulder and upper
body,'' he said, ``because the feet are locked in place on one
board.'' Skiers' injuries tend toward the legs and feet, he said,
because they can fly out in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julie Gilchrist, a pediatrician and medical epidemiologist
in the center for injury control at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, says her center has gathered no independent data on
child safety on ski slopes. But she has studied research by the
Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission that supports the
wearing of ski helmets. She recommends common-sense approaches to
safety, focusing on the National Ski Patrol's Responsibility Code.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gilchrist lists year-round physical and cardiovascular
conditioning as a good preparation. Keeping equipment in good
repair, being aware of the effects of altitude on strength and
stamina, and planning the day to avoid exhaustion were among her
other suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   On these last two points, ski operators note that modern
high-speed, high-capacity lifts mean that people can fit in many
more runs than in earlier years, and so should be aware that
exhaustion and dehydration can come earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The National Ski Areas Association, which encompasses 509 major
areas in the United States receiving 95 percent of the skiing
visits annually, has joined this season with the National Ski
Patrol, insurance companies and other organizations to create
Safety Initiative 2000, a program to focus on avoiding injury. The
motto ``Heads Up'' was chosen, but which steps to take is up to
each area.
</P>
<P>
   At Vail, ski patrols have taken away lift passes from those
skiing too fast. But at Ascutney in Brownsville, Vt., said Kim
Jackson, a spokeswoman, the emphasis is on warning and counseling.
Children 8 to 12 in the Young Olympians school get report cards
each day that also bear messages about responsibility _ for
example, that skiers should stop on the side of a trail, not in the
middle, and look uphill before starting down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a family-oriented mountain,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``We
don't get hotdoggers.'' But ski patrols and staff members skiing
for recreation do stop those displaying risky behavior and warn
them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Vail resorts, Witt said, employees identified as Yellow
Jackets warn skiers and boarders who are going too fast, although
Ski Patrol members and employees there also have the power to
remove people.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of safety on the slopes got intense attention two
years ago when Rep. Sonny Bono of California died after hitting a
tree in South Lake Tahoe, Calif., less than a week after Michael L.
Kennedy died the same way in Aspen, Colo. Tim White, head of
education for the ski areas group, said, ``Undoubtedly, it's public
awareness of ski-snowboarding-related accidents, not the injury
rate, that's rising.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ski-areas group said that for the 1998-99 season, it had 52
million visits _ people entering for a day or part of one. Stacy
Gardner, a spokeswoman, said that there were 39 fatalities at the
group members' areas that season, 33 skiers and 6 snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   She said that over 15 years, fatalities had averaged about 34 a
year, a rate of 3.75 fatalities for each million participants.
Colorado's first fatality of this season came on Nov. 28, when
Steven Ricci, 31, a disabled skier, struck a tree at Winter Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gardner, along with others in the industry, said that she
considered the rate no worse than other sports involving ``high
energy participation,'' like bicycling or scuba diving. The ski
areas association has a Web site with safety information and tips
at www.nsaa.org.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment advances seem to be helping. The Consumer Product
Safety Commission monitors injury rates though an electronic coding
system in hospital emergency rooms. In its report early this year,
it estimated that skiing injuries treated in hospitals declined to
84,200 in 1997, from 114,400 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The group said that improved equipment, bindings in particular,
reduced leg injuries. Snowboarding injuries in the same period were
estimated to have tripled, to 37,600 from 12,600, a change linked
to the sport's growth.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1997 total, 18 percent of the injuries to skiers and
boarders combined were estimated to involve children under 15; 30
percent were to 15-to-24-year-olds. Male victims accounted for 63
percent of all cases.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer-product group estimated that the total of head
injuries among alpine skiers and snowboarders in 1998 was 16,000.
In an earlier study, head injuries were estimated to represent 14
percent of skiing and snowboarding injuries; for children under 15,
the figure was 22 percent. These injuries ranged from fractured
skulls to cuts and broken teeth.
</P>
<P>
   From Feb. 1 to March 31, 1998, the Product Safety Commission
studied injuries to see where a helmet would have made a
difference. This study found that 44 percent of 124 injuries would
have been prevented or reduced in severity by a helmet, and 42
percent would not. On the basis of the 1998 figures, the agency
said that 7,000 head injuries could have been avoided or lessened
by a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   No state or resort requires helmets. Expert skiers who go into
back country face added dangers, including avalanches, and they
might follow Forest Service rules for its employees and wear
helmets, in addition to other precautions: skiing with buddies and
leaving information on where they are going. (The consumer-product
commission helmet study may be read on the Web at www.cpsc.gov.
Click on ``search'' and enter ``skiing.'')
</P>
<P>
   The study's conclusions on helmet efficacy have been disputed as
``somewhat optimistic'' by Jasper Shealy, who is chairman of the
industrial engineering department of the Rochester Institute of
Technology and has researched ski injuries since the 1970s. In an
article distributed by the ski areas group, he wrote that 90
percent of all fatally injured skiers die of ``high-speed impact,''
and that no commercially available helmet would be of ``any great
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane C. Thompson at the Harborview Injury Prevention and
Research Center in Seattle, whose organization has done extensive
work researching the value of bicycle helmets and designing safety
campaigns, says it is considering a study on skiing-snowboarding
models. She said they could probably protect the wearer in a
``fairly brutal fall,'' noting that competitors wear helmets.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Gardner says that the ski area managers worry about
requiring helmets because wearers may then feel they are invincible
and take needless chances. ``We want them to have fun and take
responsibility for their own safety,'' she said.

 &HT;    ATTN: updates throughout following Clinton failed attempt at
meeting
 &HT;    ISRAEL, SYRIA OPEN NEW ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITH CAUTIOUS
OPTIMISM
 &HT;    With TALKS-TOWN-0104.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Israeli-Syrian peace talks suffered an
early setback late Monday, when unexpected divisions forced
President Clinton to scrub plans for bringing both sides together
in face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
   The move amounted to a diplomatic stutter step in the opening of
negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
spent all afternoon and several hours into the night trying to pull
both delegations together, the president was forced to pivot.
</P>
<P>
   He met into the night with Sharaa instead, as Albright spent
additional time with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tactic diplomats refer to as ``proximity talks,''
employed when animosities between foes are deemed so great that
bringing them directly together runs the risk of doing more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Sharaa until after 10:30 p.m. (EST) and was
expected to board the presidential helicopter, Marine One, shortly
after the meeting broke up for the half-hour flight back to
Washington, leaving the sensitive talks in Albright's hands.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't certain when Clinton might return, though White House
spokesman Joseph Lockhart said Clinton's weekly schedule has been
cleared for the talks, expected to last at least into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin cautioned reporters not
to exaggerate the rocky kick-off Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that all is lost,'' Rubin said, ''or that
there's been a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic negotiations, in fact, often start off on shaky
ground, as opposing sides tend to open with hardened positions.
Those soften over time, when negotiations succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that these are very hard issues; that you can't
have a fully scripted procedure in discussions this complex,''
Rubin told reporters in a news conference he gave late Monday by
speakerphone.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say what spiked the plans for bringing Barak and
Sharaa together, other than to say ``that expectations didn't pan
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin made clear, though, that diplomats were taken aback by the
inability of the two parties to come together even on the
fundamental outline of how to move forward in this week's
negotiations, a critical new phase in the larger quest for Mideast
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton met separately with Barak, then
Sharaa, and emerged encouraged that both men had come prepared for
brass-tacks talks over issues centered on territory and security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president came out of his two meetings believing
that...both sides are serious about being here,'' said Lockhart
told reporters. ``He believes the talks are off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, Sharaa and the battery of issue experts each man brought
along were expected to assess the talks' progress at week's end and
determine whether to continue or to head back to their respective
capitals to consider each other's positions.
</P>
<P>
   As promised when the talks were announced last month, Lockhart
declined to discuss the substance of Monday's meetings. The
negotiations are being held under a news blackout _ Syrian and
Israeli delegates were stripped of their cell phones to deter
clandestine chats with reporters _ in an effort to avert public
controversy at each juncture of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cautioned reporters, though, against expecting the
Shepherdstown talks to resolve all the differences between Israel
and its giant Arab neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect to achieve a core agreement with one round of
talks,'' Rubin said. ``We're at a time for decisions, but those
decisions don't get made in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton regards this round as ``an important next
step,'' in a negotiating process analysts expect will take months
to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was easy,'' Lockhart said, ``it would have been done a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   There's much riding on the talks for Clinton. He sees the
Israeli-Syrian negotiations as a key part to the larger quest for
Mideast peace, one of the top foreign policy priorities for his
final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges to that goal were apparent even as the talks got
under way, however. In Syria, about 50 protesters, mostly
university students, staged a sit-in at the offices of the
International Committee for the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and
demanding the release of Syrian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men
imprisoned,'' Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been
jailed in Israel since 1985, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high, also, for the United States, which counts
Israel as its closest strategic ally in the oil-rich Mideast
region.
</P>
<P>
   Americans would certainly be called upon to provide billions of
dollars in military, economic and humanitarian aid to help cement
any peace deal between Israel and Syria. U.S. troops might also be
deployed to help police a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin stressed that no such arrangements have been agreed upon,
but he suggested that Americans should be ready to accept a
peacekeeping role should an Israeli-Syrian accord be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, big deal,'' Rubin told reporters at a news
briefing, ``and a deal this big is going to carry a price tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived at this two-century-old town at the edge of the
Appalachian Mountain range shortly before noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded immediately into separate meetings with Barak and
Sharaa at a conference center in a secluded, wooded retreat
operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton, who has cleared his weekly schedule to
monitor the talks, would be available throughout the week to return
to Shepherdstown whenever Albright decides his presence would help
move the talks forward.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate track, Barak is pursuing a peace agreement with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The two men have pledged to
hammer out a framework for so-called ``final status'' talks by
mid-February and to nail down a comprehensive agreement _ to
include such contentious issues as the future of Jerusalem and the
question of Palestinian statehood _ by October.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's talks with Syria are centered on a plan under which
Israel would return to Syria the Golan Heights in return for
security guarantees, and normalized diplomatic and economic
relations between the two Mideast neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are such matters as how to structure security
guarantees _ possibly using United Nations and U.S. peacekeeping
troops _ for Israel; a timetable for Israeli withdrawal from the
strategic Golan Heights; how to allocate precious fresh water
supplies from the Sea of Galilee, in the Golan; and how to set up
the first-ever commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and a
country that has been its avowed foe since the birth of the Jewish
state in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops seized the Golan territories from Syria during
the 1967 war, after Syria joined Egypt and Jordan in attacking
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the talks here was Syria's aging President Hafez
al-Assad, who is reported to be in uncertain health.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said U.S. officials are confident that Sharaa is
negotiating with Assad's full confidence and authority, however,
Assad's personal attention is likely to be required to seal any
comprehensive accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do expect him to be involved,'' Rubin said, though it was
too soon to say whether Assad would make an appearance in
Shepherdstown.

 &HT;    ISRAEL, SYRIA OPEN NEW ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITH CAUTIOUS
OPTIMISM
 &HT;    With TALKS-TOWN-0104.

<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Israeli-Syrian peace talks suffered an
early setback late Monday, when unexpected divisions forced
President Clinton to scrub plans for bringing both sides together
in face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
   The move amounted to a diplomatic stutter step in the opening of
negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
spent all afternoon and several hours into the night trying to pull
both delegations together, the president was forced to pivot.
</P>
<P>
   He met into the night with Sharaa instead, as Albright spent
additional time with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tactic diplomats refer to as ``proximity talks,''
employed when animosities between foes are deemed so great that
bringing them directly together runs the risk of doing more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Sharaa until after 10:30 p.m. (EST) and was
expected to board the presidential helicopter, Marine One, shortly
after the meeting broke up for the half-hour flight back to
Washington, leaving the sensitive talks in Albright's hands.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't certain when Clinton might return, though White House
spokesman Joseph Lockhart said Clinton's weekly schedule has been
cleared for the talks, expected to last at least into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin cautioned reporters not
to exaggerate the rocky kick-off Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that all is lost,'' Rubin said, ''or that
there's been a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>

AGENCY'S LEADER TAKES THE SUBWAY TO THE FRONT IN THE AIDS BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Ana Oliveira were a psychiatrist, the queue for
couch time in her office might stretch around the block. Her ``I
can fix it'' attitude could throw the toughest neuroses for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Oliveira, whose altruistic instincts were handed
down like an heirloom from her mother in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
searched for a modern dragon to slay, it was the three-headed hydra
of AIDS, substance abuse and poverty that kept her in the United
States after she received a master's in medical anthropology. She
got her degree as planned, the first in her family to do so. But
she never went back to Sao Paulo. That part was unplanned.
</P>
<P>
   Now 47, Ms. Oliveira is still here on the prowl against AIDS,
and today her salt-and-pepper hair stands at attention, her
silver-ringed hands churn, and the Brazilian accent that wafts
through her textbook English like a whisper of samba is soaring as
she explains why she can't leave. Not when AIDS _ she calls it
``the epidemic'' _ has shifted its focus to women, children and gay
men of black and Latin heritage. ``It hasn't affected my body, but
it has affected my community,'' Ms. Oliveira says. She endured her
own brush with a potentially fatal disease when she had surgery for
thyroid cancer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliveira, a Latina, a lesbian and, for reasons to be
clarified later, an acupuncturist, is the first woman to become
executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's
oldest and largest AIDS services agency and one in the throes of
its own crisis after a $6 million budget cut and a 33 percent staff
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliveira, whose connection with the agency began in 1996
when she started its women's department, was a unanimous choice as
director. When her appointment was confirmed recently, everybody
stood and whooped like lottery winners.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar had happened when she introduced the women's
program, and it was the reception she got then that convinced her
there was no contradiction in putting a woman at the helm now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day we announced the women's department, I was asking
myself, can the agency be large enough to take this thing on?'' Ms.
Oliveira recalls, referring to the agency's open-mindedness, not
its size. ``And how can I make the link?'' she added. She did it by
facing the staff and asking those who provided AIDS services to
women to stand. Then she asked those who provided services
indirectly to rise. ``When it got to that point and there were some
folks still sitting down,'' she says, eyes glinting, ``I asked all
of us who want to bring out the woman inside us to please stand,
and everybody did. We had a tremendous laugh, a tremendous
clapping. That's when I knew I had the support of my gay
brothers,'' she notes, knuckles knocking a wood table for luck.
``When people ask me if AIDS is not about men, not gay, not a
crisis anymore, I tell them it still is. It's just a different
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, 40,000 new infections appeared in the United States,
and worldwide, 2.5 million deaths were attributed to AIDS. Ms.
Oliveira counts two close friends, both women, among the
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Though hers isn't a post for the faint-hearted (her predecessor,
Dr. Joshua Lipsman, resigned after 10 months), Ms. Oliveira,
insisting that she is accountable to all 8,000 clients of the
agency, is passionate about what brought her here. The primary
vehicle was the No. 6 train to the war zone that was the South
Bronx in 1981. There, amid alcoholics and addicts of the pre-crack
era, Ms. Oliveira did her New School internship at an acupuncture
clinic affiliated with Lincoln Hospital's substance abuse program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into a room and there were 30, 40 people, poor folks,
sitting there with needles sticking in their ears,'' she says. ``I
was completely captivated. My internship was supposed to last six
months. It lasted several years!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliveira took note when Paul Popham, a founder of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis, who died of AIDS, showed up at her clinic
desperate to find a cure for an ailment so modern it was nameless.
</P>
<P>
   She finished her degree, became a licensed acupuncturist, worked
at Lincoln and other clinics and, with the advent of crack and HIV,
saw a shift in clients. ``We started to see more women.'' After a
stint at Samaritan Village in Queens, Ms. Oliveira arrived at the
Gay Men's Health Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   She says she won't leave until ``we have the same impact on the
prevention side of the epidemic we've had on quality of life.'' She
added, ``Now that folks are living with instead of dying from AIDS,
it's about teaching life, work, relationship and parenting skills
instead of grieving skills; making medicine accessible; finding
medicine for resistant strains.''
</P>
<P>
   Parenting skills may soon come in handy for Ms. Oliveira, who
lives in Morningside Heights with her partner of five years, Julia
Ritchie, a therapist. ``She wants to have a child, and I love
children, so it's a dangerous combination,'' Ms. Oliveira says.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest daughter in a Roman Catholic household she describes
as progressive, Ms. Oliveira was married briefly at 18, and it took
years before she told her parents she was a lesbian. ``They more
accept than understand it,'' she says. ``But the need to make a
difference in the world, and not just any difference, I very much
got that from my parents.''

BRIBERY FOUND COMMON AMONG N.Y. TICKET BROKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever wondered why tickets are sold out at the box
office for a basketball game or a Broadway show, but ticket
agencies seem to have a large supply? There is often a reason, says
the New York state attorney general's office: bribery.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing investigation by the office has found that ticket
brokers use bribery to obtain tickets for Broadway shows, concerts
and sporting events, tickets that should be available to the public
at box office prices. The brokers are able to acquire hundreds of
seats, creating a virtual stranglehold on the most-sought tickets,
according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insiders are taking bribes to make tickets available to ticket
brokers, anverage Joe doesn't have a shot,'' said Elizabeth
Block, the attorney general's lead investigator on ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators acknowledged the existence of scalpers
who resell tickets in front of arenas and theaters, those people
are not the focus of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to root out corruption in the box office itself,''
said Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer. Spitzer said his office was
close to filing a series of criminal complaints against people who
take or pay bribes for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem of brokers' illegally obtaining large blocs of
tickets could be eliminated, Ssaid, the attorney general's
office would consider supporting the removal of price restrictions
on ticket resales. ``I am certainly tempted by a free market for
tickets once we have eliminated bribery in the ticket office
itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread bribery has inflated prices beyond those that a
free market would bear for three reasons, Spitzer said. First, he
explained, brokers snap up so many tickets that it worsens the
scarcity of tickets in high demand. Then brokers have to recoup the
cost of the bribes. Finally, businesses support the brokers by
paying inflated prices for seats that the companies use to impress
clients. The money that companies spend entertaining is tax
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies can spend virtually unlimited dollars,'' Spitzer
said. One New York brokerage firm spent almost $370,000 on tickets
in a single year, a report issued by the attorney general's office
in May said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not limited to New York. ``I've spoken with
people in other states,'' Spitzer said. ``And this has not become a
multistate enforcement action, but the problem is, in fact,
nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general acknowledged that the problem may be more
apparent in New York. Even though New York has more shows, concerts
and venues than most cities, the audience, fed by tourism,
outstrips demand. There is also a concentration of major companies
willing to pay the high ticket prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Broker markups on tickets commonly range up to 600 percent, but
can go higher depending upon the event.
</P>
<P>
   In August, during the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens,
more than 900 people received citations for scalping tickets, said
Michael Mansfield, chief of the Economic Crimes Bureau for the
Queens district attorney. There, $25 tickets were going for $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the New York securities firm cited in the attorney
general's report paid a ticket broker in New Jersey $367,980 for
tickets _ including $3,250 each for four U.S. Open tickets,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   Such markups are illegal in New York under a law that restricts
resale price to $5 or 10 percent, whichever is greater, plus tax.
Lobbyists for the East Coast Ticket Brokers Association have
supported a bill that would repeal that provision. Repeated calls
to the organization's lawyers, the firm of Davidoff &AMP; Malito, for
comment about the attorney general's report were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the law in place, brokers skirt New York
statutes, Spitzer said. Many operate in New Jersey, where the
scalping laws do not cover out-of-state sales.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald B. Lefcourt, a criminal defense lawyer in New York, said,
``If brokers do end up in court, they usually get adjourned in
contemplation of dismissal.'' In these cases, as long as the
defendant is not arrested again for six months, the charges are
automaticsmissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has seemingly made scalping easier. A search of
eBay under tickets on Monday brought 2,418 responses. Ebay's policy
is that the seller must conform to local laws, which causes
enforcement problems because the seller does not have to list a
location. Ebay will remove any tickets that the police say are
being sold illegally. But that has never happened, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Madison Square Garden conducted an investigation that
led to the dismissal of five employees in the subscription
department and the removal of many brokers from the subscription
list. Some of those brokers were reinstated in 1997. That same
year, state investigators found, 75 percent of the Knicks'
subscriptions were given to people found to have connections with
management. The 25 percent sold to the public were in the upper
tier, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Madison Square Garden said in a statement: ``In
each of the past three years Madison Square Garden, as part of its
ongoing policy regarding the unauthorized resale of season tickets,
revoked an average of more than 500 tickets per year. Reports have
stated that a handful of people who had their subscriptions revoked
have been able to subsequently purchase new subscriptions. The
Garden is investigating and if appropriate, will revoke these
subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office has asked for changes in
legislation that deals with scalping. Specifically, the office has
asked that taking or giving bribes for tickets, now a misdemeanor,
be made a felony. It also wants to set up a system to track sales
of individuals tickets, to  easier to identify box office
employees who make illegal sales.
</P>
<P>
   The issue probably will not be taken up by the New York
Legislature until the current state law expires next June. Even
then, it is unclear if there will be a legislative solution.

   As the report itself pointed out, New York has regulated resale
and sellers of tickets for 77 years and has not beaten scalping
yet.

TRACING THE DANGER FROM BULLETS FIRED INTO THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ What goes up must come down. This fundamental
law of physics was tragically proved in the first four minutes of
New Year's Day, when 32-year-old Anthony Rickman of Kansas City was
killed by a stray bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Rickman was in the 3900 block of Monroe Avenue, where he had
been firing off shots in his own celebration of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people might think it's OK because everybody
does it,'' said Officer Steve Young, a spokesman for the Kansas
City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not OK. It's illegal, and very, very irresponsible. That
bullet has to go somewhere. If you shoot it into the air, it
doesn't stay there. It's an asinine thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no other deaths due to random gunfire were reported, in
Overland Park 12-year-old Kevin Lander woke Saturday morning and
realized how close he'd come to danger.
</P>
<P>
   His first sight that morning was a bullet that had come down
through the roof and lodged in the ceiling above his pillow. He
could see the copper-colored tip sticking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked up at the ceiling and said, `Dad, you'd better come
in here and look at this,' '' said Kevin's mother, Charlene Lander.
</P>
<P>
   Police think that the bullet was fired into the air by a
reckless New Year's Eve reveler.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet, which police said was probably a 9 mm, pierced the
wood-shingle roof of the Landers' home at 5711 W. 84th St. and
ended up above Kevin's head in the northeast part of the
single-story house.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents attributed to festive gunslinging included two
small power outages in southeast Kansas City and the interruption
of cable television service to hundreds of customers in Kansas
City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve is prime time for re-enacting the days of the
Wild, Wild West, according to spokesmen for a few local police
departments, but it is not the only such occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be popular following, of all things, Chiefs
football victories,'' said Bill Pross, speaking for the
Independence Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July, too, brings out the celebratory gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of those occasions lend themselves to drinking,
which then dulls one's common sense,'' Pross said.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of town on New Year's Eve, Young said, ``it sounds
like a war zone. Ninety-nine to 100 percent of the people shooting
their guns have no idea where those bullets are going to end up.''
</P>
<P>
   While detectives were investigating the Rickman death on Monroe
Avenue early New Year's Day, a bullet tore into a nearby shed,
Young said. Another police officer who returned to his car on New
Year's morning after working overnight found a bullet hole in the
hood of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think the chances are slim'' that a random skyward shot
would cause problems, Young said. ``But shooting a gun and not
knowing where the bullet's going to end up is probably one of the
stupidest things you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stray bullets pose varying levels of threat to bystanders,
depending on factors such as the trajectory, the make of the gun,
the weight of the bullet and the amount of powder used.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet shot straight overhead would be very unlikely to kill
anyone on its way down, said Bill Newhouse, who works in the
firearms section of the Kansas City police crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that particular circumstance, it would hurt like hell, but
almost certainly wouldn't penetrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullets generally need to travel at 200 feet or more feet per
second to break the skin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullets fired along a more horizontal trajectory can do a great
deal more damage. There is a great deal of variation in their
muzzle velocities, or the speed at which bullets leave the weapon.
Bullets from .38-caliber revolvers travel between 600 and 800 feet
per second, Newhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Rifle bullets generally have much higher velocities than
handguns, traveling between about 1800 and 4000 feet per second,
depending on bullet weight and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet fired from an AK-47 or similar assault rifle would
hurtle out of the muzzle about 2300 feet per second. After 100
yards, the length of a football field, it would have slowed to
about 2000 feet per second. At 500 yards, or a little more than a
quarter of a mile, it would be traveling at 1200 feet per second,
according to Newhouse.

UAW CHIEF USES CONTRACT ISSUES TO RECAPTURE POLITICAL SWAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Mich., Wash.)   (Subs 7th graf for insert about union's upcoming meeting to
endorse presidential candidate) 
(jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In the past, presidents of the United Automobile
Workers union, men like Walter Reuther and Douglas Fraser, were
well-known national figures not just because they could shut down
the world's largest companies but because they were politically
influential and frequently on television.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yokich, the union's president since 1995, has taken a
very different approach, shunning the limelight and focusing on
contract issues. Believing that he can communicate most effectively
with his members through local union leaders, he has said virtually
nothing in public during strikes and other showdowns with
automakers. While he has visited Washington frequently to discuss
issues like trade and global warming, he has favored private
meetings with politicians to parades and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But now Yokich is trying to rebuild the political power of the
union, most notably by negotiating paid holidays for 400,000
workers at General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler on Election Day
in 2000 and 2002. The prospect that more union workers might turn
out to vote, hand out pamphlets and drive other Democrats to
polling booths has alarmed Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part for Yokich, pollsters and politicians said, will
be persuading the rank and file to vote for candidates endorsed by
union leaders. Earning $50,000 to $120,000 a year, the union's
members are too affluent to benefit from many Democratic social
spending programs and are prosperous enough to be concerned about
income tax rates. Many members are conservative on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the leadership has tended to support Democrats, particularly
for president, perceiving them as more friendly on workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich said the union must emphasize political concerns that
apply to all members and transcend partisan politics. ``We support
those who support us; the party doesn't matter,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Two such concerns, he said, are international trade and global
warming. The problem is that neither former Sen. Bill Bradley nor
Vice President Al Gore has taken his positions on either issue. The
union will endorse a presidential candidate next month; it had
opposed the AFL-CIO's decision to endorse Gore early in October.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich advocates balancing free trade with what he calls ``fair
trade,'' requiring other countries to follow rules on safety, the
environment, and workers' rights to form unions that are similar to
rules in the United States. He is particularly critical of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which he says has destroyed
more high-paying jobs than it has created, an assertion questioned
by many economists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley and Gore have long track records of supporting free
trade. Yokich said he was disappointed that they were not at a
peaceful protest by union members at the recent meeting of the
World Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming is another difficult issue for Yokich.
Automobiles contribute to global warming with each gallon of
gasoline they burn, so environmentalists have begun lobbying for
more stringent fuel-economy regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But the union contends that tighter fuel economy rules are
unnecessary because many other industries contribute to the problem
and because developing nations have not agreed to limits on their
emissions of the gases linked to global warming. Bradley and
particularly Gore have both called for tighter fuel-economy rules.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has not been as outspoken as Gore on the
environment, he supported a Senate resolution calling for much
stiffer fuel-economy rules on sport utility vehicles and other
light trucks, which are allowed much worse fuel economy than cars.
The measure was narrowly defeated on Sept. 15 after the union
joined automakers in strenuous lobbying against it.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich said he had expressed concerns to Gore about the Clinton
administration's policies on global warming, but quickly added that
he considered himself a friend of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to the Sierra Club, so you can't just say, `he's about
jobs for his members','' Yokich said. ``I belong to the Sierra
Club, I belong to Ducks Unlimited.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fraser said that Yokich had to become more active politically
because the most pressing issues facing the union _ like
international competition, environmental protections and health
care _ could not be settled at the bargaining table with
automakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the members of the UAW rests with Congress and
the legislative process more than it ever did in the past,'' Fraser
said. ``That's why you have to get more involved in the political
process.''

 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first glance, Natalia Sarygina doesn't look like
much of a glass-ceiling smasher. She wears a sequined minidress to
work, is pleased with her $25,000-a-year salary and has a
conventional take on gender roles, in Russian-laced English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think man is a man, he's more strong,'' she says. ``A woman?
It's a woman,'' she shrugs, applying thick makeup in her stamp-size
trailer in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Five-foot-four and 110 pounds, Ms. Sarygina appears to have more
grace than intensity. But at 28, she is among a handful of women
worldwide at the top of her profession: juggling. It is a field in
which men outnumber women 9-1, according to the International
Jugglers' Association, and in which the three other partners in her
troupe are men.
</P>
<P>
   Even rarer, she juggles clubs, which are heftier than the
batons, rings or soft balls that other female jugglers favor. At
her alma mater, Moscow's State Circus and Variety College, most
women content themselves with hula hoops.
</P>
<P>
   By numbers alone, then, Ms. Sarygina _ currently performing with
the Big Apple Circus and living in its trailer encampment behind
Lincoln Center, at 62nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam
Avenues _ has accomplished something on a par with the CEO of
Hewlett Packard and the secretary of the Air Force, both women.
</P>
<P>
   Her act is almost too fast to track, her concentration muscular.
The clubs slam into her hands and fly off, touch down in her
partners' hands and fly off again. The performers circle, climb
onto pedestals, traverse a distance of twelve yards, all while
passing and plucking clubs, spinning in a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circus lights are blinding and the dust can get in your
eyes,'' she says. ``You finish a performance and you can't feel
your hands. You can train and train, but if you miss one thing,''
juggling becomes an ungrateful profession.
</P>
<P>
   The roles of most other women beneath the big top are defined by
gender. Women gravitate toward elephant riding, the trapeze and
balance acts known as equilibristics, which demand grace and speed.
Clowning, with its bruising pratfalls and adolescent goofing, draws
more men, as do acts requiring strength, like the four-high
acrobatic teams in which one huge member of the troupe stands
beneath the others.
</P>
<P>
   But none have remained a male bastion as much as juggling, with
its long-term dangers of vision problems andumbness,
technical demands and grueling practice schedule. ``Traditionally,
boys have been more comfortable playing games that involve throwing
and catching,'' said Cindy Marvell, who in 1989 was the first woman
to win a gold medal at the International Jugglers' Association
competition. Since then, only one other woman has succeeded her.
Even the jugglers' association itself, formed in 1947, evolved from
the International Brotherhood of Magicians.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling holds little glamour and sex appeal, Ms. Sarygina
explains. ``When little girls start to do something, she doesn't
want to be a juggle,'' she said, dropping the ``r'' in her sketchy
English. ``She wants to be a little queen.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to hurling bowling pins through the air, however,
Ms. Sarygina is king.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath her liquid eyeliner and leopard-print undergarments, her
determination is steely, her thin arms like ropes, the result of
the 20-pound barbells she curls every day. The troupe's practice
schedule _ four hours a day, one hour nonstop _ leaves her with
calluses and disappointingly short fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Her feminism is ``maybe just in some things,'' she concludes:
``For each woman to earn by herself, to work by herself, to exist
by herself.'' She has been juggling for only four years.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the female phenoms of the juggling world learned the art
from their fathers. Katya Ignatov, for example, was trained by her
famous father, Sergei. And Dorothy Finegan, 15 _ the next
generation's talent, Ms. Marvell said _ learned on tour with her
juggling father, who goes by the stage name of Professor
Confidence.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ms. Sarygina knew nothing of the circus, growing up
an only child in Moscow with her fighter-pilot father, and her
mother, an assistant television producer. She trained at the Moscow
Institute of Sports as a rhythmic gymnast and became a two-time
European aerobics champion, in 1990 and '91. On she went to model
Puma sportswear and contemplate a career in journalism. Then one
day in 1995, three male jugglers invited her to toss around some
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out it worked for me,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   She makes no claim to be the world's greatest juggler. That
honorific may belong to Sergei Ignatov, the first person to juggle
13 rings. He is known for saying that juggling lies in the soul,
not the wrist. Others argue for Michael Moschen, who received a
MacArthur Foundation genius grant in 1991 for his manipulation of
crystal spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Francoise Rochais grabbed the gold from the International
Jugglers' Association in 1995 by tossing seven clubs simultaneously
_ slim homemade ones, albeit, with little flower decorations at the
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Sarygina prefers three clubs, there is little doubt
that her strength, dexterity and flawless grasp of whizzing objects
put her near the top of the tent. Her male partners, somewhat
miffed to be passing clubs in her shadow, concede that of 3,000
Russian circus artists _ 48 reputable juggling troupes among them _
only one or two ``girls'' juggle at her level.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage in the sawdust, the ringmaster's stunt double, Dinny
McGuire, said that in twenty years of circus experience, he has
never seen a woman as good as she is in an act ``like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bello Nock, the star clown, with vertical orange hair and a
baggy tuxedo, said that Ms. Sarygina had mastered upper-body
isolation, mixing strength and force with elegance. ``It's hard to
look as graceful as she does,'' he said, watching her troupe, The
Original Jugglers, warm up.
</P>
<P>
   The subject quickly turned to her striking looks, akin to those
of one of James Bond's girlfriends. ``I don't think she has to
juggle,'' Nock reflected. ``She could just drop them and pick them
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During this act, she's about all you see,'' McGuire chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Ms. Sarygina whether it's hard to be young and single in
a man's world, with smitten audience members sometimes offering
dinner or drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Her sole complaint is a practical one. ``If a woman is single,
it's a little bit hard, driving,'' she says, explaining that she
must drive her own trailer, hours on end, to circus gigs across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also benefits to being the only woman in a male
troupe: ``They are good guys,'' she says of her partners. ``They
could help if something happens to the trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   The encampment behind Lincoln Center could be like any outpost
in Eastern Europe, where six of the acts originate. The female
performers carry tubs of laundry from their small trailers to the
wash room and the men _ in their jumpsuits _ stand behind the tent,
smoking unfiltered cigarettes. The horses, including a plump
miniature, stamp impatiently in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Inside her tidy but dim trailer, kept so to rest her eyes, Ms.
Sarygina prepares for a 6:30 p.m. show, with her triple-decker
makeup bag beside her. ``First of all, foundation,'' she says.
``After this, pressed powder.'' Then eye shadow, black liner and
mascara. ``Lipstick must be very bright,'' she adds, drawing on a
vibrant pink. The finishing touch, a spritz of Chanel perfume, will
sweeten the tent odor of sweat and elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers some restraint _ ``When it's too much, it's more
like for a dancing bear,'' she says _ but admits delight in her
dress, a sparkling halter back of sea green. ``Even if it's a man's
job, I try to be a woman in the ring,'' she says, slipping into
high-heeled sandals and beginning her icy chasse to the tent.
</P>
<P>
   Her wants are few. She longs for a big motor home. She reveals
that she is working on a secret and ``unique'' act with hula hoops:
five around the middle, two on each arm.

BRADLEY AND GORE RNEW BATTLE IN A WARM-UP FOR A PAIR OF DEBATES
THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President
Al Gore, 1,125 miles apart, argued on Monday about the virtues of
experience and accused each other of having a vision too limited to
deal with problems that concern most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only those who have never left Washington have missed the
lessons of the last decade,'' Bradley told an audience of 400 here.
The audience first giggled and then applauded at the obvious
reference to Gore, who has held office in Washington since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only those who have embodied the ways of Washington have
failed to notice that Americans see Washington as a place that has
nothing to do with their lives,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, before 1,000 students and supporters in
Davenport, Iowa, Gore accused Bradley of a passivity born of a
sense of defeatism and impracticality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is not an academic exercise,'' Gore said.
``It's not a seminar where you get to entertain a single grand
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic presidential hopefuls, who were resuming
their campaigns after the holiday, will debate in person twice this
week, on Wednesday in Manchester and on Saturday in Des Moines,
Iowa. On Monday, they warmed up, in speeches their staffs
advertised as important, with the ideas they think will play best
in Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses and New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley approach reflected some of the anti-Washington
themes that won primaries here for Jimmy Carter in 1976, Ronald
Reagan in 1980 and Pat Buchanan in 1996. In a line that recalled
Carter's promise to provide a government as ``full of love as the
American people,'' Bradley said, ``I'm not prepared to settle for
anything less than America realizing the potential embodied in our
ideals, in the creativity of our minds and the goodness of our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Without directly naming his rival, Bradley called the vice
president no more than a tinkerer. He referred briefly to his major
campaign proposals: providing universal access to health insurance,
ending child poverty, putting 600,000 new teachers in public
schools, registering all handguns and reforming the campaign
finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a comment that the audience took to be aimed at Gore,
he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those voices that say we cannot do big things any
more, that we must tinker around the edges offering small solutions
to big problems. But I say now is not the time to be timid. Above
all, now is not the time to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took on his rival much more bluntly, scoffing at his
emphasis on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley,'' he said, ``seems to believe that America
should address only one thing at a time, or only a very small
number of things at a time, health care is the only challenge
deserving of a comprehensive proposed solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of America,'' Gore added, ``means more than a
single proposal, done in the wrong way, at a price that leaves us
helpless to take on other great national priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Bradley's approach was, if not un-American, at
least un-Democratic: ``Can you imagine John Kennedy saying, `We
have to fight the cold war; we can't explore the heavens or put a
man on the moon?' He knew we could do more. Can you imagine Lyndon
Johnson saying, `We can wage war on poverty, but we'll have to
postpone the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. He knew we could do
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The characterization of Bradley as a man of ``limited vision''
was meant to puncture the altitude that the former senator has
gained with his call for universal health insurance. The Gore
campaign is worried that this is undermining support for the vice
president, who is offering a more incremental approach.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore seized on Bradley's self-proclaimed affinity
for Ronald Reagan as an advocate for a few big ideas, belittling a
Bradley administration as lacking the kind of can-do American
spirit that Gore promised to bring to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As he chastised Bradley for having only one big idea in health
care, he promoted his own education plan in hyperbolic terms,
saying it would ``bring the greatest single increase in our federal
commitment to education since the G.I. Bill, and the greatest
single increase in our federal comitment to pre-K through 12
education since the beginning of public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He then turned Bradley's language against him, dismissing
Bradley's education proposals in nearly identical phrasing that
Bradley has used to describe the vice president. ``We can't settle
for the minor extension of a few existing programs,'' Gore said.
``We can't settle for simply nibbling around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   And he emphasized the theme that he is a fighter, fighting both
for the nomination and suggesting that as president he would fight
for the country. In an aside that revealed something of his
combative strategy, Gore told the audience: ``How one campaigns is
some prediction of how one might serve.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, cultivating the rocky New Hampshire soil of
anti-Washington feeling requires a bit of juggling, since he served
in the Senate for 18 years and boasts of his experience there as
evidence that he can get things done. So he emphasizes the years
since he retired in 1995 as a time when he got reacquainted with a
nation that has ``an abiding sense that Washington -doesn't have a
clue as to where people really live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a state where he may be ahead because independents
can vote in the Democratic primary, Bradley attacked Washington,
and, by implication, Gore, for excessive partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only those who have been mired in the battles of partisanship
have failed to realize that Americans are tired of partisanship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he has before, Gore suggested on Monday that Bradley made a
cowardly retreat, not an intellectual exploration, when he retired
from the Senate. Speaking of the seven-year Clinton-Gore economic
record, he said, ``There were many good individuals _ even in high
places in our own party _ who thought that it couldn't be done.
When Senator Bradley retired from the Senate during President
Clinton's first term, he spoke about a `budget stalemate,' of a
political process that was, and I quote, `paralyzed' . . . on
creating jobs, on reforming welfare . . . a continual deadlock. And
he said that part of the problem was that Democrats `cling to old
programs.'''

   Bradley's other main topic on Monday, raised perhaps as a
counter to Gore's experience in the area, was the contradictions of
technology, which ``brings us closer and makes us distant at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With cell phones and pagers and e-mail, we're never out of
touch, but we're not face-to-face, either,'' he said. ``We're both
more connected and more isolated. Now we have so many different
avenues of communication that about the only thing Americans do at
the same time any more is watch the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said this did not worry him because ``every new form of
information and knowledge creates more liberty, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy always benefits from more information, more
transparency, more ideas,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate closed with an effort at inspiration, though
Gore's was more programmatic. The vice president said, ``Imagine
what this country will be like when every child has health
coverage, when we save Medicare and Social Security, when we invest
in world-class public schools, when we make bold new strides for
opportunity and justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us raise our sights and broaden our vision. Let us reach
for the America that is in our dreams _ and also within our
grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley concluded by saying, ``What does it profit us to expand
the boundaries of knowledge if we don't expand the circle of
justice. For though we're expanding the frontiers of knowledge, the
coordinates of the human heart remain the same, and that is the
ultimate challenge of politics, to touch the goodness that is in
all our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in an age of new possibilities,'' he said.
``Some people say we can never achieve our special destiny, but I
say, in a world of new possibilities, guided by goodness, we can
and we will.''

JESHAJAHU WEINBERG, 81, LED JEWISH MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jeshajahu Weinberg, the first director of the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum here and one of the principal forces
behind its creation, died on Saturday in Ichilov Hospital in Tel
Aviv, Israel. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg served as the museum's director from its beginning in
1989 until 1995, as it became one of Washington's leading tourist
attractions. He also helped to create museums in Israel and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Reich, who succeeded Weinberg as director of the
Washington museum, said Monday that Weinberg's interests in it went
from inducing a British television documentary maker to design the
exhibitions to worrying about the impact that a museum depicting
the Nazi horrors might have on children who visit it and curators
who work there.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, whose first name was pronounced ye-sha-YAH-hu but who
was known as Shaike (pronounced SHY-ka), was born in Warsaw and
educated in Germany until his family fled to Palestine in the 1930s
with the rise of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg served from 1935 to 1948 in the Jewish underground
army, the Haganah, and from 1942 to 1946 in the Jewish Brigade of
the British army, although the Haganah and the British army were
frequently at odds. He fought in Italy while in the British army
and became a sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Smith, the documentary filmmaker who designed the
exhibitions, said from his home in Bristol, England, that Albert
Abramson, one of the museum's founders, had suggested to Weinberg
that Smith would make the ideal designer of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't Jewish, I wasn't museum inclined, and I wasn't
American,'' Smith said, but Weinberg was persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He encouraged me to look at how the techniques of documentary
filmmaking could be used in a museum setting,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's architect, James I. Freed, also described how
Weinberg had driven the design and construction of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   After a section had been built, Freed said, ``Shaike was
insistent _ he wanted a railroad freight car to be included. We had
to change the building to accommodate it. He never accepted `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   Freed added that Weinberg worked to bring together competing
constituencies that wanted to make sure their groups' sufferings
were not ignored. The groups included European Jews, Gypsies and
other ethnic groups as well as members of dissenting religions and
political parties, homosexuals and the physically and mentally
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg was also an official of the Israeli government and
director of the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv. He helped create the
Beth Hatefutsoth Museum of the Jewish Diaspora in Tel Aviv, where
he served as director, and the Museum of the History of the City of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, even while slowed by vascular illness, Weinberg
was working on the design of Jewish museums in Warsaw and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Washington museum said that Weinberg's wife,
Hanna, died in 1992. Survivors include three daughters, Michal,
Mei're and Ruthie Weinberg, all of Israel; a son, Na'aman Weinberg
of California; and a grandchild.

NAT ADDERLEY, JAZZ CORNETIST AND COMPOSER, IS DEAD AT 68 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nat Adderley, a jazz cornetist and trumpeter who was a frequent
collaborator with his brother, the saxophonist Cannonball Adderley,
and a composer whose style popularized a melodic, bluesy, secular
gospel-jazz, died on Sunday at a hospice in Lakeland, Fla. He was
68 and lived in Lakeland.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from diabetes, said Fred Stuart, his
publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Adderley was born in Tampa, Fla., and began his career playing
with bands in Florida. In 1950 he changed from trumpet to cornet,
and during the early 50s he played with a military band in the
Army. In 1954 he joined Lionel Hampton's group, and in 1956 he
became part of the Adderley Brothers quintet started by his
brother, an alto saxophonist.
</P>
<P>
   That group disbanded in 1957 and the brothers reunited in the
Cannonball Adderley Quintet before the end of the decade. With
Cannonball Adderley's buoyant, linear style and Nat Adderley's more
dynamic sound, the quintet became one of the longest-running groups
in postwar jazz, remaining active until Cannonball Adderley died in
1975 and making a series of hard-hitting records. Three of the most
popular songs in its repertory, which all became standards, were
written by Nat Adderley: ``The Work Song,'' ``Jive Samba'' and
``Hummin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Adderley, who had also appeared as a sideman on other records by
musicians including Kenny Clarke, Wynton Kelly and Jimmy Heath,
started his own band shortly after his brother's death, modeled on
the music they played together. The alto saxophonist Vincent
Herring often played the Cannonball Adderley role in the band. The
group recorded for Enja, Landmark and other labels, and performed
widely for about 20 years, until Adderley lost a leg because of
diabetes in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nat Adderley's band was one of the more stable groups in jazz:
the bassist Walter Booker remained with him for most of two decades
and the pianist Rob Bargad played with him through the 1990s.
Outside his group, Adderley also collaborated with his brother on a
musical about the folk hero John Henry. It was released as an
album, performed as a concert at Carnegie Hall in 1976, and then as
a full theatrical production called ``Shout Up a Morning'' at the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and the La
Jolla Playhouse in California in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Adderley is survived by his wife, Ann; a son, Nat Adderley Jr.
of West Orange, N.J.; a daughter, Alison Pittman of Palm Bay, Fla.;
and five grandchildren.

RENNY SALTZMAN, 69, INTERIOR DESIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Renny B. Saltzman, an interior designer and patron of
modern architecture, died on Sunday at New York Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 69 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications associated with leukemia, said his
wife, Ellin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 Saltzman established a design firm and quickly became
known for a refined eclecticism. His clients included Charles
Revson, the founder of Revlon, for whom Saltzman designed an
apartment and a yacht, the Ultima 2; Herbert Siegel of Chris-Craft
Industries, and the publisher Richard Snyder of Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Saltzman was born on Aug. 9, 1930, in Brooklyn. His parents'
dreams of having their first son become a dentist were thwarted
when Saltzman, who received his undergraduate degree from New York
University, went on to enroll in the New York School of Interior
Design. (His younger brother, Kenneth, who now lives in Boca Raton,
Fla., did become a dentist.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 Saltzman married Ellin Jane Sadowsky, then an editor at
Glamour magazine. He is survived by her; by their children, David
and Elizabeth Saltzman, both of Manhattan, and by his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture was a keen interest and in 1968 Saltzman gave the
architect Richard Meier one of his first house commissions; the
Saltzman home has since become a landmark of white modernism in
East Hampton. Unlike the commissions that Saltzman carried out for
his clients, which often tended toward the traditional, the
architecture of the house was starkly modern.
</P>
<P>
   Saltzman was listed as one of 100 notable contemporary interior
designers and architects in the January issue of Architectural
Digest; he also frequently participated in leading show houses like
the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show House.
