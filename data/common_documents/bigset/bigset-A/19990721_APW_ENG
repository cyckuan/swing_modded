<HEADLINE> Clinton Compares Gore to Nixon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called his vice president  
``a good man with a good record'' Wednesday, but compared Al Gore's 
political challenges to those faced by another vice president who 
sought the top job: Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon lost the 1960 presidential campaign -- before claiming the  
White House as a private citizen eight years later and resigning in 
disgrace in 1974. Gore aides said Clinton's analogy was made with 
good intentions, but they winced at the comparison nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	Peppered with questions about the 2000 campaign, Clinton gave  
Gore a strong vote of confidence and continued a pattern of 
needling the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush of Texas. The 
strategy allows Gore to focus on his agenda, remaining above the 
fray while Clinton deftly does his dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in this room knows that (Gore) has had far more  
responsibility and gotten more done than any vice president in 
history,'' Clinton said. ``I don't think the American people know 
that yet, but I know that. '' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gore must convince Americans he is ready for the Oval  
Office, calling the vice presidency ``a mixed blessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to see any vice president out there on his own. If  
you go back and look at where Richard Nixon was in 1959, you see 
the same sort of thing,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll do fine,'' the president said. ``He's a good man  
with a good record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides expressed dismay with the comparison, if only because  
Clinton mentioned Nixon instead of former President Bush, who 
served as vice president under Ronald Reagan until he claimed the 
White House in 1988. ``Thanks again, Mr. President,'' one Gore aide 
said with a soft chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	To some Gore supporters, the remark underscores their concerns  
about Clinton's eagerness to comment on every political development 
and interject himself in the 2000 campaign. The Clinton and Gore 
camps are still trying to patch over ill feelings that flared up in 
May when the president raised questions about Gore's campaign in a 
New York Times interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most Gore officials shrugged off the remark.  
</P>
<P>
	``The president was making a point that we ourselves have been  
making: If you look at the historical record, vice presidents 
always go through a process of stepping out from the shadow of the 
president they are serving under to be a candidate in their own 
right,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Nixon ``came very close to winning'' in 1960 and the  
elder Bush won in a 1988 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's son, the Texas governor, is leading the GOP presidential  
sweepstakes with a promise to bring a ``compassionate 
conservative'' brand of politics to Washington. Clinton said 
Wednesday he was simply ``having a little fun'' when he criticized 
Bush in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a little more fun Wednesday, questioning again whether  
Bush has provided enough details about his plans for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say to everyone, use whatever slogans you want but  
tell us where you stand,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gore has outlined specific proposals on education,  
health care and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's advisers say the Texas governor has not dodged the  
details, pointing to a long list of issues he has addressed, 
including abortion, education, taxes, foreign policy, health care 
and getting faith-based institutions more involved in social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appeared to be warming up for his role in the  
presidential campaign. Rather than be Gore's hatchet man, the 
president plans to use a stiletto to jab Bush from time to time, 
advisers for both Democrats say. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also praised first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, vowing  
to do whatever it takes to help her get elected to the New York 
Senate if she mounts a full-throttle campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his own political future after the White House, Clinton  
demurred when asked whether he would rule out seeking another 
office. ``I don't have any idea,'' he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was in ``pretty good shape'' politically but limited  
to two terms as president under an amendment he supports. The only 
certainty about his future, Clinton said, is that he plans ``to be 
a useful citizen of my country and the world for the rest of my 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Clinton News Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights of President Clinton's press conference Wednesday.  

</P>
<P>
	On John F. Kennedy Jr.:  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he decided to mount an all-out search for the  
wreckage of Kennedy's plane, in part because of the Kennedy 
family's role ``in our national lives.'' Clinton also reminisced 
fondly about a recent visit the 38-year-old Kennedy made to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he really wanted to kind of come to terms with  
all of it,'' Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	On China-Taiwan tensions:  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States is talking to both governments  
and sticking to its long-held policies about reunification. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that we don't want to see escalate,'' he  
said. ``We all understand how difficult this is, but I think that 
the pillars of the policy are still the right ones. The one-China 
policy is right. The cross-strait dialogue is right. The peaceful 
approach is right, and neither side, in my judgment, should depart 
from any of those elements.'' Clinton also said a planned visit to 
Taiwan this week by Pentagon officials was delayed because he 
``didn't think this was the best time to do something which might 
excite either one side or the other and imply that a military 
solution is an acceptable alternative.'' 

</P>
<P>
	On the possible renomination of Alan Greenspan as Federal  
Reserve chairman: 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised Greenspan's tenure so far, and said he would  
decide ``in a timely fashion'' whether to ask Greenspan to stay on 
for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect it to become embroiled in election-year  
politics,'' Clinton said. ``We believe that as long as the United 
States is fiscally responsible, then the Fed will respond to 
developments in our own economy and in the world economy in a way 
that is clear, transparent and, I think, designed to keep our 
growth going. So I'm not concerned about it.'' 

</P>
<P>
	On the Republican tax cut proposal:  
</P>
<P>
	``Our studies show that their tax cut over the next two decades  
will cost first a trillion dollars and then three trillion in the 
second decade,'' Clinton said. ``They can't possibly finance this 
tax program without doing serious damage.'' 

</P>
<P>
	On a phone conversation Wednesday morning with Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat, in which Clinton described his recent 
meetings with new Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out of my way not to describe Prime Minister Barak's  
proposals or to advocate or not advocate, but simply to say that I 
was convinced they were being made in complete good faith and that 
... the peace process would be revitalized,'' Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	On Syria's role in Middle East peace process:  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can tell you is that the statements, at  
least, that have been coming out Syria have been quite encouraging 
in terms of the regard that President Assad seems to have for Prime 
Minister Barak and the willingness, the openness that there is to 
negotiating and working toward peace. So I'm encouraged by that.'' 

</P>
<P>
	On the future of the Air Force's F-22 jet fighter, which a House  
panel has voted to delay: 
</P>
<P>
	``We can fund the plane without compromising the basic  
priorities of our national defense within the funds set aside, and 
that is what I will fight to do. I think it would be a mistake to 
abandon the project. I think it has real potential to add to our 
national defense. I have always supported it, and I hope that it 
can be preserved.'' 

</P>
<P>
	On whether he is ``a mixed blessing'' to the presidential  
aspirations of Vice President Al Gore: 
</P>
<P>
	``I think change is good. The great thing about this country is  
that it works best when it's sort of in a perpetual stage of 
renewal. As a citizen I would vote against somebody who said, 'vote 
for me and I'll keep it just like it is.''' 

</P>
<P>
	On Hillary Rodham Clinton's possible Senate run in New York:  
</P>
<P>
	``If she decides to do this, I will do whatever I can do. And if  
she's successful, I will happily go to the Senate spouses meeting 
if that's part of the job.'' 

</P>
<P>
	On the political situation in Iran:  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Iranian people obviously love their country and  
are proud of its history and have enormous potential. And I just 
hope they find a way to work through all this and I believe they 
will.'' 

</P>
<P>
	On the stalemate in Northern Ireland:  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I am very disappointed at the breakdown of the  
process here. But I do think it's important to note that neither 
side wants to abandon the Good Friday agreement. And that's very 
important.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Coach Calls Opponents Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Even if Brazil and Germany left their  
top players home, U.S. coach Bruce Arena says they'll be difficult 
opponents for the Americans in the FIFA Confederations Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me that team and say it's weak. I'd be glad to take it,''  
Arena said of the Germans. ``We're going to be playing two of the 
top five teams in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arena noted that some strong U.S. players also couldn't make it  
because of club obligations, including top midfielder Claudio 
Reyna. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are focusing on their opener Saturday against New  
Zealand. They play Brazil on July 28 and Germany two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go into the second game with three points, you're in  
the driver's seat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolivia, Egypt, Mexico and Saudi Arabia are in the other group,  
which plays in Mexico City. The top two nations in each group 
advance to the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Warns of Farm Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) -- Pat Buchanan said Wednesday that family  
farms are being threatened by trade policies that don't go far 
enough in opening up foreign markets to American exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate called for a fundamental  
overhaul of the nation's trade policies, including a review of the 
trade embargo against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not now a threat to national security to sell food to  
Cuba,'' he said. ``I would take a look at that embargo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting a farm implement dealer, Buchanan declared, ``Virtually  
every single family farm in America is in danger of going under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I blame the new world order gang and I put Republicans right  
in there'' with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, he 
said. ``There's not a dime's worth of difference between them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he mentioned GOP presidential rivals George W.  
Bush and Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it when we're at our most productive and our economy is  
booming, that farmers are facing another 33 percent drop in 
revenue?'' Buchanan asked. 
</P>
<P>
	He said U.S. trade policies have not gone enough to force open  
foreign markets and said ``an economic nationalist'' should be in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan finished third in Iowa's caucuses last time, and his  
message may resonate if economic problems deepen in the state. 
Commodity prices at historic lows and bumper crops in the fields 
add to the oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go out and talk to the farmer, they know there's a  
problem and I think a lot of them are listening,'' Buchanan said. 
``It is going to get worse. You've got an oversupply from last 
year, which is sitting in the bins and you've got a huge crop this 
year. With that overhang on the market next year, it's going to 
create a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making his appeal, Buchanan cast his argument in populist  
terms, saying current trade policies are designed to prop up big 
banks and multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's socialism for the super-rich,'' he said. ``It's free  
enterprise for the American farmer, who is allowed to go under.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions with Chrissie Hynde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chrissie Hynde insists she's not talking about  
herself in her new song, ``Popstar,'' but it's tempting not to 
believe her. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't make 'em like they used to,'' she sings in the  
chorus of a song that rips self-absorbed stars more interested in 
making the cover of fashion magazines than in making music. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly she has the track record to make that claim.  
</P>
<P>
	As the leader of the Pretenders, Hynde has been making tough,  
melodic rock songs for two decades. She's pressed on despite the 
death of two original band members and the estrangement and 
eventual reconciliation with the third. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the type of music -- straight-ahead rock `n' roll with roots  
in the 1960s -- that seems more and more like a relic among this 
generation of, well, pop stars. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Hynde presses on. The songs may be a little more  
melodic, a little less tough than in the early days, but the sound 
wouldn't surprise anyone who had been asleep for, say, 20 years. 
Her look hasn't changed much, either: same shag haircut, same heavy 
eyeliner. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should've just stuck with me,'' the song concludes.  
</P>
<P>
	Her fans wouldn't argue.  
</P>
<P>
	1. Does music mean as much to you now as it did when you were  
younger? 
</P>
<P>
	Hynde: Certainly not, not in the same way. It means more to me  
in other ways. I can find it much more gratifying to listen to a 
piece of music. And when I watch a great band, I can get that 
feeling of glory coming over me where I love it so much. When I was 
a teen-ager, I came home and listened to a record and that meant 
everything to me. Now -- and I don't mean to demean it too much -- I 
look on it from the perspective of being a hobby. I don't have any 
musical ambitions. I'm not trying to learn any other instruments or 
produce other bands or write songs with my heroes, because for me 
I've achieved everything I wanted to. I play guitar in a rock band, 
and that's all I ever wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	2. In an interview last year, you weren't very complimentary of  
the all-women rock tour, Lilith Fair. This year, you're a featured 
artist. What changed? 
</P>
<P>
	Hynde: To me, it's show business, after all. In a coldblooded  
way, it's whatever sells and whatever is interesting to the public. 
I think the Lilith thing was more of a sociological statement 
because it was all fronted by women, and to me that's just another 
form of discrimination. I think that it's a great gimmick that will 
make things really interesting; I do love that aspect of it. What I 
was referring to last year was that it was like having a festival 
where every band had to feature a Jewish keyboard player. To me, 
that would be getting away from what the music's all about. Maybe 
I'm wrong. Maybe the bands being fronted by women may be 
significant musically, I'm not sure myself. The main reason I am 
doing it is because I think it will be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	3. VH1 is coming out with a list of the 100 greatest women of  
rock `n' roll this summer and you're prominently featured. What 
does that kind of honor mean to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Hynde: It's nice to be remembered, it's nice to be highly  
thought of (but) to me, that wasn't what it's all about. I thank my 
lucky stars that I play in a band, and it's a good band and we've 
made a good album. All's right with the world as far as my band 
goes. I don't need any more recognition than that. I don't know 
what's wrong with me. I'm a miserable celebrity but a really happy 
person in real life. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Why did you title your new album ``Viva El Amor''?  
</P>
<P>
	Hynde: Long live love. It sort of fit in with my propagandist  
artwork ideas. I originally wanted to call it `Biker,' which is the 
last song on the album and is kind of what the album is all about -- 
this renegade outlaw with a moral code he always lives by. Some of 
the powers that be around me were not too keen with that as the 
title of the album, and sort of talked me down from that. It didn't 
bother me, because when I said `Viva El Amor' to Linda McCartney, 
she just loved it and said she wanted to do the picture for it. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Did she get the chance to do it before she died?  
</P>
<P>
	Hynde: Yeah, and she said, `See you in a couple of weeks,' and I  
never saw her again. I think it's probably her last portrait. And 
now that I look back on it, I think it was her trying to give me 
something because we were good friends and maybe she knew she was 
near the end. I took it very personally.

<HEADLINE> Copper Down; Grains, Soybeans Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures prices rocketed higher Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as temperatures across the Midwest 
threatened to scorch young crops. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, copper futures fell sharply, while energy  
prices also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, soybeans and, to a lesser extent, wheat futures, jumped as  
forecasters predicted the thermometer will climb into the 90s 
across key Midwest growing regions and remain there for days, with 
little relieving rain in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service predicted after trading had ended  
that temperatures in Illinois and Iowa, the nation's largest corn- 
and soybean-growing states, will remain far above normal, while 
rainfall will be below normal in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	That comes after the U.S. Agriculture Department earlier this  
week reported crop conditions had declined as soil moisture in 
parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio began to dry up. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden turn in fortunes for crops that had enjoyed generally  
favorable growing weather has helped prices post their biggest 
rally in months. Still, futures prices remain at their lowest in 
decades amid expectations farmers still will harvest bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery, representing prices after the fall  
harvest, rose 6 cents to $2.69 1/2 a bushel; December corn rose 8 cent 
to $2.15 a bushel; December oats rose 4 1/4 cents to $1.18 3/4 a bushel; 
November soybeans rose 24 1/2 cents to $4.58 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
on expectations that a world surplus will continue through year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	While copper producers have been reducing operations at costly  
mines and slashing some refining of the industrial metal, supplies 
in storage remain at high levels. In fact, inventories in 
warehouses controlled by the London Metal Exchange continue to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were pressured by unexpectedly weak figures  
for U.S. housing starts, which were down 5.6 percent in June and 
their lowest since May 1998. Copper is used in plumbing and 
electrical systems, and the spring and summer months typically are 
when it is most in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	September copper fell 2.2 cents to 74.75 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures finished marginally lower on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after weekly inventory figures showed a 
surprising increase in supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. crude oil inventories rose 5.53 million barrels last week  
to 332.1 million barrels, according to the American Petroleum 
Institute. The gain included a revision that raised the previous 
week's inventory figure by 1.93 million barrels. Without the 
revision, the weekly increase would have been 7.46 million barrels, 
the API said. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase could signal some cheating is beginning to occur on  
a concerted effort to slash oversupply as world oil producers see 
higher prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was too early to tell whether the increase following  
weeks of general decline was an aberration. That kept prices from 
finishing sharply lower on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	September crude fell 10 cents to $19.65 a barrel; August  
unleaded gasoline fell 0.40 cent to 59.61; August heating oil fell 
0.14 cent to 49.51 cents a gallon.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two men working on a sewage tunnel 400 feet below  
ground died Wednesday, apparently after a malfunction with their 
air supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were inside the 26-foot wide tunnel, scheduled to

<P>
	``Now we need to find out how and why it happened,'' said Thomas

<HEADLINE>  Kennedy, Airplane Wreckage Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s  
plane was located off the coast of Martha's Vineyard with Kennedy's 
body still aboard, and the Navy began a recovery mission, 
government officials and family sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
this afternoon that officials expected the body would be brought to 
the surface later today. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was to be conducted at Barnstable County Hospital in  
Bourne on Cape Cod by the state pathologist, according to the 
office of Philip Rollins, Cape and Islands district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, government sources dismissed a report by a military  
source who said Kennedy's body had already been brought aboard a 
Navy ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they had no information on the whereabouts of the  
bodies of Kennedy's wife and sister-in-law, who also were on the 
plane when it crashed Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this afternoon, a Coast Guard helicopter took Sen. Edward  
M. Kennedy, and his two sons from the Kennedy compound in Hyannis 
Port to Menemsha Harbor at Martha's Vineyard. They got on a boat 
bound for the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship leading the recovery 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted flying zone around the Grasp was extended from  
3,000 feet to 5 miles to keep media away. 
</P>
<P>
	The heightened activity took place after ships from the Navy,  
Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
spent Tuesday night scouring a site 7 1/2 miles southwest of the 
Martha's Vineyard coast, a spot that investigators had speculated 
was the likely splash point for the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	It crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuselage was first spotted at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, according  
to a statement issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, 
and subsequent investigation confirmed that it was Kennedy's 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the discovery was made  
with remote cameras, adding, ``The highest priority remains 
locating and recovering the remains of all three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy family was notified of the discovery in the early  
morning hours, a family source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy destroyer USS Briscoe was heading toward Cape Cod to  
participate in a possible memorial service, said a government 
source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A family source said a 
final decision on a burial at sea had still not been made early 
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Bessette family were working with the Kennedys on  
plans for a service said Grant Stinchfield, a family friend. He 
also said nothing has been finalized. He said the family would have 
no comment on the discovery of Kennedy's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Admirers of the family expressed relief that the body was found.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, that'll bring some closure, at least, for the  
Kennedys,'' said Angelo Catalano, of Sayerville, N.J., as he 
visited the site of Kennedy's apartment in Manhattan today. ``and I 
hope they find the other two to bring some closure for the 
Bessettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He continued: ``It's a shame. He had such a great future ahead  
of him. There's no telling where he could've gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several experienced pilots who flew into the Vineyard on Friday  
night said the hazy skies and darkness were challenging even for 
them. Kennedy obtained his pilot's license in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At a briefing Tuesday, Robert Pearce, who is heading the  
investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board, gave a 
more detailed explanation of the approach. 
</P>
<P>
	All seemed fine about 34 miles from the airport, with the plane  
descending from 5,600 feet to about 2,300 feet at a slightly 
faster-than-normal rate of 700 feet per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 miles from the airport, the plane started turning to  
the right and climbing back to 2,600 feet. After leveling off, it 
flew for a short time before beginning another turn to the right 
and starting ``a rapid rate of descent'' that may have exceeded 
5,000 feet per minute, or about 10 times faster than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The descent was 3,000 feet per minute faster than what would be  
a stressful approach for even the most experienced flier, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce would not speculate on the damage caused by such a crash,  
but said: ``I'm sure you can draw a conclusion by the debris we've 
been bringing in, which is fragmented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the fourth full day of the search, the FAA acknowledged it  
was asked in a phone call from an intern at the Martha's Vineyard 
airport to help locate the plane Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller, 21-year-old Adam Budd, expressed no great urgency as  
he telephoned an FAA station in Bridgeport, Conn., at 10:05 p.m. 
Friday, FAA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he called at the request of an unidentified couple who  
had come to the airport to meet Ms. Bessette. Kennedy and his wife 
had planned to drop her off on their way to Hyannis Port, Mass., 
for his cousin's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Budd asked if the agency could track the airplane, but the  
person at the FAA station questioned him about who he was and 
finally said: ``We don't give this information out to people over 
the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Budd gave up, saying, ``It's not a big deal.''  
</P>
<P>
	The plane had gone down about 9:40 p.m. Nothing was done until a  
much more urgent call was made to the Coast Guard at 2:15 a.m. by a 
Kennedy family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified FAA source said in today's Boston Globe that the  
agency was considering disciplinary action against the employee for 
not coming forward about the call when it became clear the plane 
was missing.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defects Before Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Three days before the Pan American  
Games begin, a Cuban shooter defected and several top American and 
Canadian athletes dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes walked into a Royal Canadian  
Mountain Police station on Tuesday and asked to remain in Canada. 
Sources said Wednesday that Reyes was turned over to federal 
immigration authorities, then released, pending an immigration 
hearing, probably in September. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cuban athletes defecting hardly is surprising nowadays,  
this move was especially noteworthy because last week five members 
of the Cuban national basketball team defected during the 
Tournament of the Americas in Puerto Rico. Heavier security was 
expected for the Cubans for this event, but Reyes apparently had no 
trouble walking away. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans who walked away from the games, which officially open  
Friday night, were pole vaulter Jeff Hartwig, 1991 Pan Am 200-meter 
winner Kevin Little, hurdler Sandra Glover, distance runner Libbie 
Hickman and long jumpers Erick Walder and Roland McGhee. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the American team features 13 men and five women who have  
participated in the Olympics. Many of the top track and field 
athletes currently are competing in lucrative European meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's baseball team, which could challenge for one of two  
berths for the 2000 Olympics being decided here, was hurt by the 
last-minute dropouts of Double A Birmingham pitchers Aaron Myette 
and Julien Tucker. Canada manager Ernie Whitt didn't find out until 
Tuesday morning that Myette, likely to be his top starter, and 
Tucker would not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players apparently were being pressured by their parent  
team, the Chicago White Sox, to stay with Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not supposed to work that way,'' Whitt said. ``The  
organizations are supposed to approve it and they're supposed to 
go. That's the way it was supposed to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Chris Mears and outfielder Greg Morrison will replace  
Myette and Tucker on the Canadian roster. The United States also is 
using minor leaguers, while Cuba, the overwhelming favorite in 
baseball, sends its vaunted national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition begins Thursday with canoe and kayak. On Friday,  
even before the opening ceremony at Winnipeg Stadium, action starts 
in soccer, volleyball and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
	One sport where the United States will send its top competitors  
is wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time world champion Terry Brands heads the freestyle team,  
which includes four wrestlers who are ranked No. 1 at their weights 
for the first time: Eric Akin at 119 pounds, Joe Williams at 167.5, 
Dominic Black at 213.75 and Stephen Neal at 286. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the U.S. wrestlers, the stiffest competition for  
gold medals will come from the Cubans. Les Gutches, the 1997 world 
champion at 187.5, is likely to face Cuba's Yoel Romero, whom 
Gutches has never beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling starts Saturday with the Greco-Roman competition, in  
which the Americans aren't nearly as strong.

	Kennedy's Plane Located  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Five days after crashing into the waters  
off Martha's Vineyard, government officials say the wreckage of 
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was located with Kennedy's body still 
aboard. The plane was found five days after it crashed into the 
waters off Martha's Vineyard, killing Kennedy, his wife and her 
sister. There was no immediate word on the bodies of Carolyn 
Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette. A Coast Guard boat is 
taking Sen. Edward Kennedy, John's uncle, to the search site where 
Sen. Kennedy will be asked to identify the body on board the Navy 
ship.

	GM To Recall 3.5M Vehicles  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors has agreed to recall some 3.5  
million vehicles to conclude a five-year government investigation 
into problems with anti-lock brakes installed on sport utility 
vehicles, vans and pickup trucks. The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration launched the probe after receiving reports of 
performance problems on an array of GM vehicles manufactured in the 
1990s. The agency has on file 10,861 reports of brake problems on 
General Motors S and T trucks, which included reports of 2,111 
crashes and 293 injuries.

today said there is perfect weather forecast for the launch of the 
space shuttle Columbia. Eileen Collins and her crew will board 
Columbia for the scheduled 12:28 a.m. EDT liftoff tomorrow.

	Cruise Line Paying $18M Dumping Fine

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Royal Caribbean Cruises has agreed to pay a  
record $18 million fine and plead guilty to 21 felony counts for 
dumping oil and hazardous chemicals from its cruise ships and lying 
about it to the Coast Guard, Attorney General Janet Reno said 
today. Reno said the cruise ships used ``secret bypass pipes'' to 
dump waste oil and hazardous materials overboard, often at night. 
Ship personnel falsified log books that employees called by a 
Norwegian term meaning ``fairy tale book,'' she said.

	Source: Gun Makers Try To Avoid Suit  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Three major gun makers are in negotiations  
with New York state's attorney general to avoid being named in a 
lawsuit he plans to file, a source close to the talks said today. 
The talks involve Colt's Manufacturing, Smith &AMP; Wesson, and Sturm, 
Ruger &AMP; Co., the source said. New York would be the first state to 
sue gun manufacturers, though 23 cities and counties across the 
country already have done so. The negotiations focus on whether the 
companies will agree to concessions, including better supervision 
of the marketing and sales practices for their guns. In exchange, 
Spitzer would exclude the companies from the planned lawsuit.

worth of Kmart merchandise per year. The companies will provide dry 
groceries and other goods to Kmart's 2,151 stores nationwide. They 
also will supply a broader assortment of food items and perishables 
at Super Kmart stores, which already contain full-service grocery 
departments. Competitor Wal-Mart recently designed stores that

to try to unload the temperamental slugger. Belle's five-year, $65 
million contract includes a three-year clause barring him from 
being traded, but he apparently consented to lift the trade ban 
soon after the Orioles learned of a June 4 incident in which he 
allegedly made obscene gestures to fans in the bleachers at Camden 
Yards. Belle is hitting .275 with 20 homers and 59 RBIs for 
Baltimore, but his time with the team has been filled with 
controversy.

	Kennedy's Body, Wreckage Found  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s airplane  
was located with Kennedy's body still aboard and the Navy today 
readied a recovery mission off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, 
Mass., according to government and family sources. There was no 
word on the bodies of Kennedy Jr.'s wife and sister-in-law. The 
fuselage was first spotted at 11:30 p.m. last night, the National 
Transportation Safety Board said. A White House spokesman said the 
discovery was made with remote cameras. The fuselage was located

	MARIETTA, Pa. (AP) -- U.S. lawmakers, worried that the smallpox  
virus could fall into the wrong hands, are pushing the Clinton 
administration to stockpile more of the smallpox vaccine and 
develop new ones. The nation's only stockpile of smallpox vaccine, 
about 15 million doses, is located in this small town. Less than a 
generation ago, smallpox plagued 31 countries, killing about 2 
million people a year. Since its eradication from the general 
population in 1979, the highly contagious virus is supposed to 
exist only in guarded laboratories in Atlanta and Moscow. 
Worldwide, only about 60 million doses of the vaccine are

Keith Fleer and three associates forged documents purporting to be 
secret files from the CIA and M16, a British intelligence agency. 
The files detailed a bogus plot to murder Diana and Dodi Fayed,

<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s  
plane was located off the coast of Martha's Vineyard with Kennedy's 
body still aboard, and the Navy began a recovery mission, 
government officials and family sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
this afternoon that officials expected the body would be brought to 
the surface later today. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was to be conducted at Barnstable County Hospital in  
Bourne on Cape Cod by the state pathologist, according to the 
office of Philip Rollins, Cape and Islands district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, government sources dismissed a report by a military  
source who said Kennedy's body had already been brought aboard a 
Navy ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they had no information on the whereabouts of the  
bodies of Kennedy's wife and sister-in-law, who also were on the 
plane when it crashed Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this afternoon, a Coast Guard helicopter took Sen. Edward  
M. Kennedy, and his two sons from the Kennedy compound in Hyannis 
Port to Menemsha Harbor at Martha's Vineyard. They got on a boat 
bound for the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship leading the recovery 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted flying zone around the Grasp was extended from  
3,000 feet to 5 miles to keep media away. 
</P>

	The heightened activity took place after ships from the Navy,  
Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
spent Tuesday night scouring a site 7 1/2 miles southwest of the 
Martha's Vineyard coast, a spot that investigators had speculated 
was the likely splash point for the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	It crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuselage was first spotted at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, according

final decision on a burial at sea had still not been made early 
this afternoon.

<P>
	He continued: ``It's a shame. He had such a great future ahead  
of him. There's no telling where he could've gone.''

	All seemed fine about 34 miles from the airport, with the plane  
descending from 5,600 feet to about 2,300 feet at a slightly 
faster-than-normal rate of 700 feet per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 miles from the airport, the plane started turning to  
the right and climbing back to 2,600 feet. After leveling off, it 
flew for a short time before beginning another turn to the right 
and starting ``a rapid rate of descent'' that may have exceeded 
5,000 feet per minute, or about 10 times faster than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The descent was 3,000 feet per minute faster than what would be  
a stressful approach for even the most experienced flier, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce would not speculate on the damage caused by such a crash,  
but said: ``I'm sure you can draw a conclusion by the debris we've 
been bringing in, which is fragmented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the fourth full day of the search, the FAA acknowledged it  
was asked in a phone call from an intern at the Martha's Vineyard 
airport to help locate the plane Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller, 21-year-old Adam Budd, expressed no great urgency as  
he telephoned an FAA station in Bridgeport, Conn., at 10:05 p.m. 
Friday, FAA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he called at the request of an unidentified couple who  
had come to the airport to meet Ms. Bessette. Kennedy and his wife 
had planned to drop her off on their way to Hyannis Port, Mass., 
for his cousin's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Budd asked if the agency could track the airplane, but the  
person at the FAA station questioned him about who he was and 
finally said: ``We don't give this information out to people over 
the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Budd gave up, saying, ``It's not a big deal.''  
</P>
<P>
	The plane had gone down about 9:40 p.m. Nothing was done until a  
much more urgent call was made to the Coast Guard at 2:15 a.m. by a 
Kennedy family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified FAA source said in today's Boston Globe that the  
agency was considering disciplinary action against the employee for 
not coming forward about the call when it became clear the plane 
was missing. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> FTC Sues Free Web Site Designers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Web site companies, working with  
telemarketers, have bilked thousands of small businesses of 
millions dollars by billing for unauthorized services, according to 
a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission. Recent cases 
prompted a congressional inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minn.,  
charges WebValley Inc. and its affiliates with cramming 
unauthorized charges onto phone bills for Web pages that consumers 
did not expressly order. The case comes as WebValley is seeking 
approval to sell $34.5 million worth of stock in an initial public 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC filed its complaint under seal last week and announced  
the case Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A congressional committee has opened its own investigation,  
fearing that small businesses trying to keep up with large 
competitors and boast a presence on the Internet, are being taken 
for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the nationwide frenzy to cash in on the millions being  
made through e-commerce, I am particularly concerned that small 
businesses ... may be taken in by schemes that cram fraudulent 
charges for services onto phone bills,'' said Sen. Christopher 
``Kit'' Bond, R-Mo., chairman of the Senate Small Business 
Committee. Bond said the committee may hold hearings on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	In its complaint, the commission outlined the practice by which  
the companies purportedly sold 50,000 Web pages to small 
businesses, charity organizations and foundations: Telemarketers 
called consumers on behalf of WebValley and offered to design pages 
for them to be posted on the Internet for a free 30-day trial 
period. They were told to expect mockups of the sites in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, telemarketers did not inform  
consumers that they would be billed automatically if they did not 
cancel the service within 30 days, and the introductory materials 
did not explain the billing process. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies then began charging consumers a recurring monthly  
fee of $19.95 or $24.95 on their phone bills, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company defends its practices and says it will contest the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has a strong commitment to its customers and to  
high ethical standards in its business activities,'' said Satya 
Garg, president of WebValley, based in Hopkins, Minn. He said the 
company uses a stringent third-party verification system on the 
phone calls to make sure only those consumers who want the service 
receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC, in its complaint, said such verifiers did not ensure  
that the customers understood the terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who eventually noticed the charge had trouble canceling  
it, the complaint also said. FTC investigators also couldn't locate 
the majority of the sites, using major search engines on the 
Internet. The commission reviewed more than 900 complaints and 
spoke to 70 businesses and organizations. Fifty-two of them had no 
idea they had Web pages on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has requested the court to appoint a receiver to  
temporarily take over the operations and to ultimately order a 
permanent injunction and redress for consumers. The complaint also 
names two companies that telemarketed WebValley's services, U.S. 
Protel Inc. and Protel Advantage Inc.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Veto House Teacher Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he will veto a  
House-passed teacher improvement bill that Republicans say will 
give schools more choice but the president says would trample on 
his goal to put 100,000 new teachers in the nation's elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed 239-185 Tuesday with support from 24  
Democrats, carries forth the longtime Republican priority of moving 
control over education dollars from Washington to the states and 
local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	It provides some $2 billion annually over five years in the form  
of block grants to states and localities, consolidating several 
programs aimed at improving the nation's teaching pool. Those 
include the administration's ``Goals 2000'' program to raise 
academic achievement and the class-reduction program Clinton won 
from Congress as part of last year's budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, local school districts would be held accountable  
for raising student achievement but could decide how best to use 
the money to improve teacher quality, whether that be by hiring 
more teachers, teacher training or expanding special education. 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing class size is of little value if the newly hired  
teachers aren't qualified, said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman 
of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. ``We're trying 
to make sure that every teacher out there at the present time is 
properly qualified to teach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know firsthand that it isn't necessarily the quantity of  
teachers that makes a difference, but the quality of teachers you 
put in the classroom,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
a former high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton, who last fall made the teacher hiring program a key  
bargaining chip in the budget talks, said in a letter that he would 
veto the House bill ``in order to protect our nation's commitment 
to smaller classes and better schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing class size, he added in remarks to the National Bar  
Association, is ``particularly important to poor children and 
people who don't come from strong educational background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had just released funds to hire the first 30,000 new  
teachers. ``But now, unbelievably in this non-election year ... 
there are some who propose to kill the class size initiative and 
replace it with a program that doesn't guarantee that one red cent 
will go to hiring a single teacher or reducing the size of a single 
class,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling insisted that no school district would lose funding  
because of the consolidation, but Democratic opponents of the 
measure said the bill also falls short in failing to target school 
districts with the greatest needs. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is no companion Senate bill, the Senate may take up  
the issues of teacher hiring and training in the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act this fall. Both chambers are due to renew 
the comprehensive federal education law for kindergarten through 
12th grade that expires this year.

<HEADLINE> Iowans Battle Rising Floodwaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLES CITY, Iowa (AP) -- People filled sandbags along the Cedar  
River on Wednesday hoping to stem the record flood of water that 
washed into town, damaging 100 homes and filling countless 
basements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our town. We can't let it get swept away,'' 18-year-old  
Danielle Weber said as she worked in the morning with her friend, 
Haley Salinas, 17. The teen-agers' T-shirts were encrusted with 
mud. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the efforts, heavy rain caused the river to crest  
Wednesday afternoon at 23 feet, more than a foot higher than the 
floods of 1993, the worst Iowa had seen in 30 years, Fire Chief Roy 
Schwickerath said. By 7:30 p.m., the river leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we had sandbagged got washed out from two different  
directions,'' Mayor James Erb said. ``So we got a double whammie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in nine homes near the river were evacuated early  
Wednesday morning. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sandbags were so beautifully done that when it rained the  
water came off our roof and backed up into our house. It was like a 
pool,'' said Margaret Carroll, who has lived near the river since 
the 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said police evacuated her home about 1:30 a.m. Ten hours  
later, the river was flowing through her house. 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuation sites were set up at three local churches.  
Authorities were recommending against travel in or out of Charles 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa Army National Guard had sent 27,000 sandbags to Charles  
City and 26,000 sandbags to Osage. Another 52,000 sandbags were 
stockpiled at the Waterloo Armory in case they were needed 
elsewhere in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding forced the closure of a bridge along Iowa Highway  
346 into Nashua, a town of about 1,500 people 35 miles north of 
Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandbags were placed around the town's sewer plant, but the  
water kept rising, Nashua Mayor Deanne Lantow said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mason City, it was the possibility of record flooding on the  
Winnebago River causing worry. About 1 p.m., city officials put 
about 400 residents in low lying areas on alert. But by early 
evening, forecasts had been revised, and many of those families 
were allowed to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, eight counties were covered under a disaster  
proclamation by Gov. Tom Vilsack. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic areas along the Winnebago River moved further south later  
Wednesday as the crest of the river pushed on. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greene, the river surged into the downtown area, flooding 12  
businesses, about half those in the community of 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers filled sandbags throughout the afternoon, trying to  
protect as many homes and businesses as they could. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents and volunteers in nearby Nashua, Plainfield and  
Waverly also worked in sweltering heat and humidity filling and 
distributing sandbags and helping people move their belongings from 
flood-threatened houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashua Mayor Deanne Lanton said 15 homes had to be evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Richmond Considers Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With talks stalled between free agent Mitch  
Richmond and the Washington Wizards, Richmond's agent said 
Wednesday night he is listening to offers from as many as eight 
other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it looks like you're not making progress, then you have to  
look at alternatives,'' agent Mike Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond and the Wizards remain millions of dollars apart on a  
contract. The 10-year veteran, acquired a year ago in a trade with 
Sacramento, was the team's leading scorer with a 19.7 average last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But that average was the lowest of Richmond's career. He is also  
33 years old, and the Wizards acquired another shooting guard, 
Richard Hamilton, in last month's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the season, Richmond said he wanted to return to  
Washington, and general manager Wes Unseld and coach Gar Heard have 
said they want him back. But the impasse in negotiations has Sharpe 
feeling that Richmond will probably be playing somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think so,'' Sharpe said. ``We have no planned negotiations  
with Wes. Certainly, Wes and I have left the door open, but it 
would be fair to say talks have stalled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe said Phoenix, Seattle, Golden State, Miami, Indiana,  
Orlando, Sacramento and the Los Angeles Lakers have inquired about 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of salary cap restrictions, Sharpe is exploring a  
sign-and-trade deal involving the Wizards and a chosen team. The 
Wizards could offer Richmond as much as $14 million per year under 
the new collective bargaining agreement, an amount no other team 
could come close to matching unless a trade is involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld was not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Wizards have agreed in principle to a three-year,  
$5.9 million deal with Hamilton, the No. 7 overall pick in the 
draft, with an option for a fourth year that would make the 
contract worth $8.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still working on a few details,'' said Al Irby,  
Hamilton's agent. ``And we expect the agreement to be signed 
momentarily.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Shuffle Pitching Rotation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mark Portugal, suffering from back spasms, joined  
Pedro Martinez on the sidelines Wednesday as the Boston Red Sox 
were forced to shuffle their pitching rotation again. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston also obtained right-handed reliever Julio Santana from  
Tampa Bay for a player to be named. Santana has a 1-4 record and a 
7.32 ERA in 22 games with the Devil Rays, five of them starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, baseball's best pitcher with a 15-3 record, is  
expected to miss at least one turn with a sore right shoulder. In 
his last outing, he allowed a career-high nine runs in 3 2-3 
innings Sunday against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal (5-7) had been scheduled to pitch Thursday against  
Baltimore but will be replaced by Jin Ho Cho. Tomokazu Ohka, 
knocked out of his first major league start in the second inning 
Monday night, is slated to start for Martinez on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had it before,'' Portugal said of his back problem.  
``Sometimes it takes two or three days'' for the problem to clear 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was possible he could pitch Saturday, although Pat  
Rapp appeared more likely to fill in for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Santana, who reached the major leagues with Texas in 1997, was  
9-12 with a 5.37 ERA before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for him on the 40-man roster, the Red Sox  
designated for assignment right-hander Travis Baptiste, who was 
with Triple-A Pawtucket of the International League. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston would have to make another move to get Santana on the  
25-man major league roster.

<HEADLINE> Female Shuttle Commander Tries Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the second time this week,  
Eileen Collins, the first woman to lead a U.S. space flight, 
strapped into the commander's seat of Columbia for liftoff with the 
world's most powerful X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good to see you back in Columbia,'' a launch controller told  
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be back again,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Steven Hawley, who has endured numerous launch delays in his 21  
years as an astronaut, briefly pulled a brown paper bag over his 
head before boarding the shuttle. He's used the bag before, as a 
joke, to disguise himself for liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The first launch attempt, on Tuesday, ended seven seconds before  
liftoff when a dangerous hydrogen buildup was detected in the 
engine compartment. It turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton was returning for Thursday's try, along  
with daughter Chelsea, a delegation of female members of Congress 
and the co-captain of the U.S. women's soccer team. The whole team 
showed up for the first launch attempt. Liftoff was set for 12:28 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle is carrying the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a $1.5  
billion telescope that will spend at least five years searching for 
black holes and scrutinizing galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time in 38 years of U.S. space flight that a  
woman is at the controls. Collins, a 42-year-old Air Force colonel, 
flew twice before in space, as a co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``To women, I say, this represents a huge milestone,'' she said  
in a recent interview. ``I think it's long overdue, I really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five astronauts' first major task in orbit will be to  
release Chandra, the heaviest payload ever packed into a space 
shuttle. The 45-foot telescope, along with an attached rocket motor 
and support gear, weighs 50,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle had to be stripped of 7,000 pounds of unnecessary  
gear. And engineering studies were done to make sure the shuttle 
could sustain the weight if, because of some problem, it had to 
return to Earth with the telescope still on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra should have flown last summer but was grounded by  
technical problems, including bad circuit boards and a suspect 
rocket motor needed to propel it into an orbit extending one-third 
of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope is named for the late Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar,  
a Nobel-winning astrophysicist who taught at the University of 
Chicago. His 88-year-old widow, Lalitha, was on hand for the 
launch.

<HEADLINE>  Five AL Umps Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some baseball umpires are breaking ranks with  
their union after deciding not to quit, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Five American League umpires have changed their minds and won't  
resign, and 13 umps never quit to begin with, a high-ranking 
baseball official told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, union head Richie Phillips said 57 of the 66  
unionized umpires had resigned, effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who never quit included 11 AL umpires, according to the  
official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified. Also, 
two NL umps never quit, according to union president Jerry 
Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean that as of now, only 48 of the 66 unionized  
umpires plan to resign: 34 of them in the NL and 14 in the AL. Two 
AL umpires were hired during the 1979 strike and are not members of 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball owners are prepared to accept the resignations of all  
umpires who quit, and hire new umpires. A statement from 
commissioner Bud Selig could come later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips didn't return phone calls to his office in  
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires, boxed in by a no-strike clause in a labor contract  
that expires on Dec. 31, decided to resign after concluding owners 
would lock them out next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Barnett, Jim Joyce, Dave Phillips, Rocky Roe and Dale  
Scott are the umpires who rescinded their resignations, according 
to another high-ranking baseball official. Barnett, in his 31st 
year, is the senior umpire in the major leagues, and Phillips, in 
his 29th season, is tied for third in seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Davey Phillips is protecting a disability claim and Larry  
Barnett is doing the same,'' said Crawford, an NL umpire in his 
23rd season. ``Jim Joyce, I spoke to him today. He just re-thought 
his position, that maybe he should have thought this out a little 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford said the two NL umpires who have not resigned were Mark  
Hirschbeck and Greg Bonin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been able to get the information to them,''  
Crawford said. ``Until they tell me they're not going to sign it, 
my feeling is these guys will eventually sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford insisted the union was strong despite the defections  
and little sympathy from fans, who booed umpires in several cities 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about public opinion. Public opinion is not what  
we're after,'' Crawford said. ``What we're after is protecting the 
rights we bargained for over the past 21 years, that's what we're 
doing. We're never going to win a popularity contest with the 
public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some umpires said they heard rumors some of their colleagues had  
change their minds, possibly to protect claims related to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're out to protect themselves. They're thinking of  
themselves,'' said Rick Reed, one of the AL umpires who has 
resigned. ``In that light, we wouldn't think any worse of them at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips held another conference call with minor league umpires,  
whom he is trying to organize. While there were reports they would 
strike on Friday, no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation, the Gulf Coast League sent a memorandum to team  
business managers telling them to have replacement umpires on hand 
Friday. The replacements would get $40 per game if they are not 
used, $95 per game if they are used. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said that if replacements could not be found, a coach  
should call balls and strikes from behind the mound, and that a 
coach or player not in the game should work the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulf Coast League president Tom Saffell declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Pat O'Conner, a vice president of the minor leagues' governing  
body, the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, 
said similar memos have been sent by all minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have in place ... a pool of substitute umpires,'' he said.  
``We're just beefing that replacement pool and getting them pretty 
much on standby ... if our guys decide they're not going to come to 
work.''

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Buys Imaginarium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc. will greatly expand its offerings  
of learning and specialty toys with its purchase of Imaginarium, 
one of the nation's best-known educational toystores. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquistion of 41-store Imaginarium chain, which was  
announced on Wednesday, is the latest step by the Paramus, 
N.J.-based Toys R Us to restructure its business. Terms of the deal 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held Imaginarium will keep its name on its stores,  
while an area of Toys R Us' stores will be branded Imaginarium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toys R Us is changing everything in their stores and this is  
another piece of that,'' said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst at the 
investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``This deal brings in a 
brand name that consumers know and trust, and it's a good move for 
Toys R Us right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors shrugged off the deal, however, keeping Toys R Us  
shares unchanged at $17 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has been reorganizing its entire business over the  
past year amid slumping sales and profits. Last year, giant 
discounter Wal-Mart topped Toys R Us as the biggest toy chain in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has responded by renovating its 1,500 stores, creating  
a brighter layout that is easier to navigate. It is also stepping 
up its customer service and efforts on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the company is changing the kind of merchandise it  
offers. It is scaling back on toys that aren't popular anymore such 
as board games, and is becoming less reliant on mass-market toys 
such as Barbie dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Toys R Us is filling its stores with products it  
believes kids today want -- electronics, beauty accessories and 
science and learning toys. 
</P>
<P>
	With its purchase of Imaginarium, Toys R Us takes over a chain  
that is known for its broad selection of quality educational toys 
and topnotch customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saddle Brook, N.J.-based Imaginarium is one of a handful of  
smaller, specialty toy chains -- which also includes Noodle Kidoodle 
and Zainy Brainy -- that have seen huge growth in recent years 
because they offer consumers a better all-around shopping 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Most are found in malls or along main streets in suburban towns.  
</P>
<P>
	``The shelves aren't stocked to the ceiling. They give you a  
level of knowledge from the staff that the big chains never have 
offered. They offer high-quality line of goods that parents like 
for their kids,'' said New York-based toy consultant Chris Byrne. 
``That's why the smaller chains are doing so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us hopes the Imaginarium purchase will help it quickly  
build its science and learning toys business. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the deal will accelerate the development of its  
specialty toy business online. Imaginarium's Web site -- 
www.imaginarium.com -- will be linked with the Toys R Us site at 
www.toyrus.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us chief executive Robert Nakasone also said he believes  
that Imaginarium's ``neighborhood prototype is one that could be 
potentially expanded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that may mean that Toys R Us is considering the  
development of a smaller Toys R Us store that would stock only a 
fraction of the goods found in its larger stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Imaginarium's CEO Tom Lynn will become vice president of Toys R  
Us and president of Imaginarium stores.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Profits Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp. reported a 25 percent  
increase operating profits for the second quarter on strong volume 
of home loans and growth in investment banking services. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest bank had operating profits, which  
exclude one-time charges and gains, of $1.35 billion, or $1.55 a 
share, surpassing Wall Street's estimate by 18 cents a share, 
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. The New 
York-based bank had operating profits of $1.08 billion, or $1.21 a 
share for the second quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (economic) environment has been very good for financial  
services firms,'' said Dina Dublon, chief financial officer of 
Chase. ``We have been able to participate and take more than our 
share of the good times. We have continued to gain market share 
across all our businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including one-time financial events, such as the sale of a New  
York office building and branches in Texas, Chase Manhattan posted 
net income of $1.39 billion, or $1.60 a share, for the April-June 
period, compared with $1.07 billion, or $1.20 a share, for the 
second quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Home loan fees and interest increased to $291 million, a 19  
percent jump from second quarter 1998. Investment banking fees were 
$585 million in the second quarter, up 34 percent from the year-ago 
quarter, and up 85 percent from the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase's total revenues for the second quarter were $5.62  
billion, up 18 percent from $4.76 billion in the comparable quarter 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has set aside $400 million to cover the cost of  
updating computer systems to handle any year-2000 computer 
glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very comfortable with the approaching date and think  
we've taken all the necessary actions, including contingency 
planning, which we have to do, being a regulated firm,'' Dublon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, profits totaled $2.57 billion,  
or $2.92 a share, a 43 percent increase over the first half of 1998 
when the New York-based bank earned $1.80 billion, or $2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $10.76 billion vs. $9.38 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Chase's stock rose 43 3/4 cents to $81.31 1/4 Wednesday on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  JFK's, Passengers' Bodies Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Navy divers found the bodies of John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law in the wreckage of 
Kennedy's plane Wednesday, ending the painful, five-day vigil their 
families endured during the search of the waters off Martha's 
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were brought to shore Wednesday night and taken to  
the medical examiner's office for autopsies. A family source said a 
burial at sea for JFK Jr. was likely, and broadcast reports said 
the Navy had granted permission for such a ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found 116 feet below the surface after ships  
from the Navy, Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration spent the night scouring a site 7 1/2 miles southwest 
of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	After a search that had the nation transfixed since Saturday,  
the plane's body, or fuselage, was spotted by underwater cameras at 
11:30 p.m. Tuesday. The bodies of all three victims were found in 
the fuselage, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	A large section of the fuselage that included the instrument  
panel was recovered. The effort to bring more of the wreckage to 
the surface was to continue Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep TV cameras away, officials banned flights within five  
miles of the recovery effort, which was led by the USS Grasp, a 
Navy salvage ship. JFK Jr.'s uncle Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and his 
sons, Patrick and Edward Jr., were aboard the Grasp while the 
bodies were being recovered and accompanied the remains to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said the bodies were brought to the surface ``in a way  
that respected the situation they were in. It was something we were 
very sensitive to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference, President Clinton defended his  
decision to pour so many federal resources into the search for the 
plane, saying it was ``consistent with what would have been done in 
any other case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``it was the right thing to do,'' partly because of the  
Kennedy family's role ``in our national lives, and because of the 
enormous losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, was piloting his single-engine plane Piper Saratoga  
from New Jersey when it dropped from radar 16 1/2 miles from Martha's 
Vineyard Airport on Friday night. Also aboard were his 33-year-old 
wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and his wife had planned to drop Ms. Bessette off at  
Martha's Vineyard and continue on to Hyannis Port to attend the 
wedding of his cousin Rory. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of flight data showed the plane dropped precipitously  
after Kennedy took a right turn, away from the Vineyard, and 
experts said he may have been disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	After her brother's body was found, Caroline Kennedy went for a  
quiet bicycle ride with her husband before returning to the 
seclusion of their summer home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the Bessette sisters issued a statement thanking  
everyone who assisted in the exhaustive search for the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our children are with us in spirit each and  
every moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' said Ann 
Freeman, their mother, and Dr. Richard Freeman, their stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
	A private Mass for Kennedy and his wife was scheduled for Friday  
morning at a Roman Catholic church in New York City where his 
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, prayed. Clinton and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only service for Kennedy's sister-in-law is  
planned for Saturday night at an Episcopal church in Greenwich, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy destroyer USS Briscoe headed toward Cape Cod to  
participate in a possible at-sea memorial service for Kennedy, said 
a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Admirers of the family expressed relief that the bodies was  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, that'll bring some closure, at least, for the  
Kennedys,'' said Angelo Catalano of Sayreville, N.J., as he visited 
the site of Kennedy's apartment in New York. ``It's a shame. He had 
such a great future ahead of him. There's no telling where he 
could've gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shrine of offerings left by mourners outside the apartment  
building grew so large Wednesday that police said most of it would 
be taken away in vans and delivered to charities and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bodies were recovered, 67-year-old Pearl Heck of  
Franklin, Ind., stared at the Grasp through binoculars from the 
Aquinnah coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a witness to history. It looks so peaceful out  
there, the waves, the water, the sun,'' she said. ``I'll always 
remember this moment.''

<HEADLINE> Rival NFL L.A. Groups Work Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rival groups led by billionaire Eli Broad and  
former Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz have agreed to present 
the NFL owners with a unified stadium design and site plan to help 
bring a team back to Los Angeles, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups also expect the NFL to contribute an estimated $150  
million toward the effort, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
The paper cited unnamed sources in reporting the developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad and Ed Roski led one of the groups vying for the league's  
32nd franchise, and Ovitz and food magnate Ron Burkle headed the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups have essentially been operating separately with  
competing ideas on how the stadium and Exposition Park should be 
revamped to accommodate the venture. NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue and some owners had suggested the groups work together. 
In May, Broad wrote a letter to the Ovitz team in an apparent 
overture to join forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the progress we have made,'' Ovitz said on  
Tuesday. ``Everybody is pitching in. We have been working very well 
with Broad partner Ed Roski and his associates. We're about as well 
organized as a group as we have ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has told Los Angeles it needed to come up with a  
feasible plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Goodell, the NFL's vice president of football operations,  
says the league is encouraged by what is going on in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a unified plan developing on how to bring  
the NFL back to this market on a successful basis,'' Goodell said. 
``The economic challenge we have here remains the most significant 
hurdle that we will have to address with the membership league 
owners, and that might include a league contribution to the 
project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL expects the Los Angeles stadium to cost $400 million,  
with an additional $150 million spent on additional parking, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Chadwick, who was appointed by Gov. Gray Davis to represent  
the state in the negotiations, has drafted a set of proposed terms 
outlining the details of an agreement between Sacramento and the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick said the league's willingness to pay a big portion of  
the tab for the stadium parking project at Exposition Park was a 
positive development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at this as the state,'' he said. ``If they're willing  
to contribute in excess of $100 million for the preservation and 
renovation of this state facility, that is a great, great thing. 
... This is money that goes into our property and our 
neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan that the Broad and Ovitz groups have agreed to present  
would include the construction of more than 15,000 parking spaces 
at the park in South-Central Los Angeles, creating a total of 
21,900 spaces, the paper said. The unified stadium design is only a 
slightly modified version of the one that Ovitz presented to the 
league during its meetings last month in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Designer Combines Style, Activism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Designer Kenneth Cole practices what he preaches  
-- from style to social activism. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a crisp white shirt (but no tie), he is a walking  
advertisement for the professional, yet casual, attire he promotes 
on the runway because it suits his lifestyle as a company president 
and CEO, active father of three young daughters and novice 
fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ads for his products often combine a typical fashion photograph  
with a timely, provocative tag line. One example: ``Without 
mentors, kids are 80 percent more likely to become something in 
life. ... loafers.'' And there is this ad: ``62 percent of society 
believes preferences other than their own are wrong. So much for 
seeing eye to eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using ads with a social message is not just a marketing gimmick.  
Cole serves as a board member for the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research (AmFAR) and the HELP USA Homeless Project. HELP is run by 
Cole's wife Maria, daughter of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and 
sister of federal Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew 
Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I do is reflective of my life, it's not my life is a  
reflection of my job,'' he said in an interview at his Manhattan 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his life is intricately and integrally involved with  
Kenneth Cole Productions Inc., the company he founded 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole -- and 40,000 pairs of shoes -- started out in a  
tractor-trailer outside a New York hotel where established footwear 
manufacturers were selling their goods. He got a permit to park on 
the street by posing as a film production company. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Kenneth Cole Productions (the name is a holdover from his  
little white lie to the city) is expecting 1999 retail sales to hit 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenneth Cole umbrella, including Kenneth Cole, Reaction and  
Unlisted labels, covers men's shoes, clothing and accessories, and 
women's shoes and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	``A business takes on a life of its own. You make a commitment  
that you're going to suit a customer's lifestyle, then you become a 
lifestyle brand, and then you decide that you're going to serve a 
variety of their wardrobe needs,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	However, getting consumers hooked on his products is only half  
the battle. Once those customers have found a look that works for 
them, Cole has to give them a reason to go out and buy something 
new. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole has learned to follow his instincts and personal tastes,  
and his vision of the fashion future is not too far ahead. ``Every 
day I walk into my closet and see what is there and what isn't. 
Then I ask `What do I wish was there?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, his company launched a children's footwear line, and  
plans are in the works to dress kids from head to toe. 
</P>
<P>
	At what age can children be turned into brand-savvy consumers?  
</P>
<P>
	``At what age can they start to talk?'' Cole responded.  
</P>
<P>
	``Children are looking for a sense of identity at ages that were  
unimaginable not that many years ago,'' he said. ``With that comes 
branding. It's a way for a child to seek out and identify what they 
want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expansions into women's clothing, home furnishings and fragrance  
are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole, 45, describes himself as functional and practical, the  
same things he tries to put into the products that bear his name. 
To an interviewer, he also comes across as relaxed and thoughtful -- 
and this just two weeks before the debut of his spring 2000 
collection at the biannual Men's Fashion Week. 
</P>
<P>
	His show at the Hammerstein Ballroom will be the season opener  
for the collections, including DKNY, Nautica and Joseph Abboud, 
which will run from July 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Cole injected a dose of celebrity into his  
fall-winter show by having actor Kevin Bacon strut down the runway 
modeling a gray one-button pinstripe suit worn with a black polo 
sweater. Fashion editors and invited guests brought old pairs of 
shoes to donate to Cole's seventh annual shoe drive. 
</P>
<P>
	He is unsure what effect aligning his company with social causes  
and organizations such as HELP USA and the Anti-Defamation League 
has had on its bottom line -- and he doesn't seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like AIDS research is not a `cause du jour.' It's  
part of who we are. I don't know what our corporate atmosphere 
would be without it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in an enviable position because our target customer is  
open-minded and progressive. They don't have to agree with the 
exact causes but they usually agree with the good intentions.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Auto Production Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hurt by sluggish sales at home and falling exports,  
Japan's five leading automakers produced fewer cars in June 
compared to a year earlier, the companies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But while they cut back at home, the companies reported big  
increases in production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic auto production is watched closely as an indicator of  
economic health because it accounts for a big part of Japan's 
industrial output. 
</P>
<P>
	Troubled No. 2 automaker Nissan Motor Co. reported the biggest  
cuts at facilities in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan cut domestic production 18.3 percent in June to 112,734  
vehicles as sales at home sank 22.6 percent to 61,514. Nissan's 
exports declined 12 percent to 54,391. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expanded overseas production by 11.2 percent to  
95,314 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	French automaker Renault SA agreed in March to buy just over a  
third of debt-ridden Nissan and is trying to turn it around from 
losses in seven of the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	While production was lower overall, there were a few signs of  
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors Corp. posted a healthy 9.9 percent rise in  
domestic sales thanks to the popularity of its mini-vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mini-vehicles are small, low-powered cars and trucks that are  
cheaper to register and run. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mitsubishi reduced domestic production by 8.5 percent to  
86,919 vehicles while its exports skidded 26 percent to 36,433. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor Corp.'s exports rose for the first time in three  
months, climbing 18.1 percent to 42,114 vehicles, as it started 
shipping its MPV and Premacy minivan models overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda said domestic production fell 5 percent to 68,651 in June  
and sales fell 3.7 percent to 26,808 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi increased overseas production 30 percent to 57,116  
vehicles while Mazda boosted overseas production 65.1 percent to 
11,165. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. cut production at its plants in Japan by 3.8  
percent to 265,940 vehicles as sales at home fell 3 percent to 
145,901 vehicles. Toyota trimmed exports by 2.6 percent to 122,508 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	But Toyota made 143,882 vehicles at overseas plants, 18.9  
percent more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. said production in Japan fell 4.3 percent to  
106,163 vehicles. Domestic sales in June declined 0.4 percent to 
68,029, although sales of mini-vehicles jumped 37.6 percent to 
27,141. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda lowered exports 3.1 percent to 42,172 as it cut shipments  
to Europe. The company increased production abroad to 102,000 
vehicles, up 13.3 percent from last year.

<HEADLINE> Dry Weather Boosts Grains, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Wednesday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as hot weather moved into key growing 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures continued sharp gains made this week as  
temperatures moved into the 90s in key growing states, including 
Illinois and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecasts for the hot weather to extend through the weekend  
boosted prices that have been in the doldrums for weeks amid 
concerns about bumper crops and weaker than normal export demand. 
Some growing areas already are experiencing below-normal soil 
moisture. 
</P>
<P>
	The market could face pressure from the same forecasts for rain  
showers to occur through the weekend, but nervous investors were 
waiting to hear potential rain totals before betting the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service reported after trading had ended  
that Midwest temperatures were expected to remain far above normal 
over the next 10 days, with some areas receiving below-normal 
rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were supported by talk of new export demand.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery -- after the fall harvest -- rose 6  
cents to $2.69 1/2 a bushel; December corn rose 8 cent to $2.15 a 
bushel; December oats rose 4 1/4 cents to $1.18 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans rose 24 1/2 cents to $4.58 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeder cattle futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle and lean hogs retreated and 
pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .62 cent to 64.22 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .15 cent to 76.07 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .25 cent to 44.87 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
the limit 3 cents to 37.60 cents a pound.

	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Raquel Welch has remarried,  
exchanging vows with restaurant owner Richard Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	They were wed Saturday at her Beverly Hills home. The couple had  
dated for about two years and became engaged last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a small, private ceremony with only close family and

	There was no word on a honeymoon. ``I don't know that they've  
made plans,'' Becher said, adding that Ms. Welch will be in 
Vancouver, British Columbia, for several weeks working on a movie 
called ``Bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer owns the Mulberry Street Italian restaurant in Beverly  
Hills and Richie's Neighborhood Pizza stores.

<HEADLINE> Clothier Settles Investor Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Clothing maker Mossimo Inc. says it will  
pay $13 million to settle lawsuits claiming it issued falsely 
optimistic financial statements that misled investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mossimo Giannulli, the company chairman, disputed the claims in  
the state and federal class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of 
investors who bought Mossimo shares between its initial public 
offering in February 1996 and January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mossimo stock soared from $18 a share to a high of $50 before  
falling to less than $6. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors' attorneys said Mossimo failed to tell them  
quickly enough about problems with production and an effort to 
expand into women's wear. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unknown how many investors will qualify for some of the  
settlement money or how much they lost, said Jan Adler, attorney 
for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Giannulli said Tuesday the company decided to settle to remove  
uncertainty at a time when Mossimo is trying to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an absolute distraction,'' he said. ``We wanted to  
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost $13.8 million last year. Sales dropped 36  
percent to $45.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's insurance, backed up by an additional policy  
Giannulli paid for himself, will cover the settlement costs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is subject to approval by judges in Orange County  
Superior Court and U.S. District Court.

<HEADLINE> DNA Links Dead Man to 11 Rapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Detectives have used the DNA of a dead  
man to link him to nearly a dozen rapes and robberies in 
Jacksonville and Washington, D.C., authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Dundas, 38, apparently raped eight women in Washington,  
D.C., and three women in Jacksonville between 1997 and 1998, said 
Lt. Paul Woolard, a sex crimes investigator for the Jacksonville 
Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Dundas was shot to death in March in Jacksonville. Police have  
no motive or suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives investigating the homicide remembered that Dundas had  
been questioned last year about several rapes, but refused to give 
a blood sample. He denied knowing anything about the attacks, 
Woolard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives took a blood sample from Dundas' body and submitted  
it to the FBI for comparison to DNA from semen found on the 
victims. The samples matched. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI is continuing to process evidence from other rapes  
here,'' said Cmdr. Winston Robinson. ``He could be a suspect in 
other rapes.''

<P>
	The 23-year-old member of the R&AMP;B quartet Xscape has been

<HEADLINE> Tigers, Dodgers GMs Fined in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The general managers of the Detroit Tigers and  
Los Angeles Dodgers were fined by commissioner Bud Selig for 
violating baseball's million-dollar rule in an April trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone was fined $15,000 according  
to The Los Angeles Times, and Tigers general manager Randy Smith 
about $5,000 according to the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In the trade in question, the Tigers sent three minor leaguers  
to the Dodgers for pitchers Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't known if the Tigers or Dodgers paid the fines for their  
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Malone violated baseball's rule against including more  
than $1 million in a trade, the Free Press reported today. The 
Tigers agreed to take Rojas as long as the Dodgers paid about 95 
percent of his $4.5 million salary.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Bell To Acquire IXC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Bell agreed to pay $2.2 billion in  
stock to acquire IXC Communications, a long-distance phone company 
that's been building a fiber-optic network. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would help Cincinnati Bell, a local telephone company,  
transform itself into a national player carrying voice and Internet 
traffic across a network of about 13,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this move, we are now positioned to offer a bundle of  
local, long distance ... and other advanced (data) services to 
businesses nationwide,'' said Richard Ellenberger, president and 
chief executive officer of Cincinnati Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger with IXC, based in Austin, Texas, would create a  
company with more than 1 million customers, 5,000 employees and a 
market value of more than $7.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced Wednesday, each share of IXC would  
be converted to 2.0976 shares of Cincinnati Bell common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which also calls for Cincinnati Bell to assume about  
$1 billion of debt, initially valued IXC at slightly less than $50 
a share. However, a 16 percent plunge by Cincinnati Bell's stock on 
Wednesday shrank the value of the shares that IXC investors would 
get to just $40 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's Nasdaq trading IXC stock rose 10 percent, closing  
$3.50 higher at $39.75. On the New York Stock Exchange, Cincinnati 
Bell fell $3.75 a share to $19.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors holding about 40 percent of IXC's stock have agreed to  
vote in favor of the deal. Cincinnati Bell has agreed to buy 5 
million IXC shares from the General Electric Pension Trust for a 
cash price of $50 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellenberger will be president and CEO of the merged company,  
which would be based in Cincinnati. John Zrno, chief executive of 
IXC, will join Cincinnati Bell's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to be completed late in the fourth  
quarter or early next year, pending regulatory.

<HEADLINE> Japan Consumer Confidence Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank said Wednesday that corporate  
and consumer confidence were improving and that the country's 
economy has stopped deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bank of Japan, in a monthly report, noted that rising  
confidence had not yet translated into economic progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This improvement in corporate sentiment, however, has not  
necessarily stimulated business activity, because firms strongly 
feel that they have excess capacity and employees and their profits 
remain weak,'' the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said that improved consumer sentiment ``is not strong  
enough to push up private consumption.'' Private spending accounts 
for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been struggling with its worst recession since the end  
of World War II, fed largely by consumer reluctance to spend amid 
rising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month the government had some rare good news,  
announcing that the economy grew 1.9 percent in the January-March 
period. That has sparked optimism that the worst may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's report, however, the bank reiterated that it has  
not observed clear signs of a sustained recovery in private demand. 
</P>
<P>
	It said corporate restructuring may reduce capital investment  
and discourage household expenditure because of worsening 
employment and income conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's official discount rate, the key interest rate charged by  
the Bank of Japan on its loans to commercial banks, now stands at a 
record low 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average has been rallying, recently  
hitting its highest level in 22 months.

<HEADLINE> Apple Introduces iBook Laptop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Computer is betting again on the playful  
look that made the iMac a hit, but the most striking feature of its 
new laptop may be something you can't see: A wireless connection 
that lets Internet users roam the home or office. 
</P>
<P>
	The iBook, unmasked Wednesday, fills an important hole in  
Apple's product line and could add fuel to the company's rebound 
from financial and technological doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	Costing $1,599 without optional wireless accessories, the iBook  
may be too pricey for some consumers. Analysts also said the 
machine may be too heavy or bulky for some people's tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the iBook could help Apple tap a new market -- those  
people intimidated by the stodgier look and feel of the laptops 
already on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really isn't a lot out there that's really like this,''  
said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group. ``They 
may open up the consumer market for laptops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The iBook, which goes on sale in September, borrows from the  
playful, unusual design of the popular iMac desktop computers that 
Apple introduced last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes in two fruity colors, blueberry and tangerine. And in  
contrast to the boxier shape of most laptop computers, it is 
rounded and translucent at the edges. 
</P>
<P>
	Another notable departure from laptop tradition is the addition  
of a colorful pullout handle to carry the computer around without a 
protective suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most significant feature may be that iBook users can  
roam up to 150 feet from a $299 base station that plugs into the 
wall like a cordless phone. The iBook's wireless feature also 
requires a separate computer card that costs $99. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the freedom of movement could attract students  
who'd wander the Web as they drift between dorm rooms, or family 
members who'd crash on the couch while they check out Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The iBook also sports a speedy PowerPC G3 microprocessor, 56K  
modem, CD-ROM drive and two antennas for the wireless connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Macintosh enthusiasts have speculated for months that Apple  
would introduce a laptop that takes its cues from the enormously 
popular iMac. That buzz may generate strong demand, even though the 
iBook won't go on sale until after the key back-to-school buying 
season has begun. Still, there are some drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The iBook weighs 6.6 pounds and is slightly larger than some  
comparably priced portables, meaning a tight squeeze on airplane 
meal trays. At the same time, the screen is 12.1 inches, smaller 
than some rival machines. 
</P>
<P>
	And a $2,000 price tag with the wireless accessories thrown in  
could be a turn-off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds cheap, until you add in everything else,'' said  
Robin Zachary, art director of Bridal Guide magazine, who uses a 
Macintosh G3 desktop. ``I wouldn't buy one at that price as a 
second computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the product was greeted with ``whoops'' and applause by  
the audience at Apple's semiannual MacWorld show in New York City, 
as well as by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Wall Street, Apple's stock gained 2 percent, rising  
$1.18 3/4 to $54.06 1/4 in Wednesday's trading on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrating the iBook's wireless feature at MacWorld, Apple  
cofounder and acting chief executive Steve Jobs moved a green hoop 
around the laptop like a magician to prove there were no cables 
connected to the machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``iBook is the 'iMac to Go,''' Jobs said. ``I hope people are  
starting to see design is making a difference'' in computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Apple sells lots of iBooks will be crucial to keeping up  
the momentum of the company's resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales of the iMac, introduced last August, helped Apple  
nearly double its profits in the most recent quarter, easily 
beating Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Apple's share of retail desktop sales reached 6.7  
percent in May, double that of a year ago, according to the ZD 
Infobeads research firm.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Shows Off New Indiana Digs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The designers of the new NCAA headquarters  
here spun the color wheel and it stopped on ``cantaloupe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showing off their new home for the first time Wednesday, NCAA  
officials made sure that the color scheme of the four-story 
building's towering atrium wasn't confused with some other fruit, 
like peach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to create a brighter environment,'' said NCAA  
project manager Frank Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission accomplished.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the new 140,000-square-foot building is still swarming  
with construction workers, the association's move from Overland 
Park, Kan., is already underway. Employees will move into the 
building in two waves, the first arriving Monday and the second 
pulling in Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's belongings will be packaged in about 8,000  
boxes and will require nearly 40 tractor-trailers to transport. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was set in motion in 1997, when Indianapolis presented  
an incentive package totaling some $50 million, including the new 
headquarters in White River State Park. The NCAA relocation 
committee voted 7-1 for Indianapolis over suburban Kansas City, 
which had been home to the NCAA since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Federation of High School Athletic Associations,  
also based in the Kansas City area, later decided to follow the 
NCAA to Indianapolis. It will relocate here early next year, 
occupying the former Acme-Evans Superintendent Building adjacent to 
the new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hall of Champions is still under construction and will open  
next spring in conjunction with the NCAA men's basketball Final 
Four at the nearby RCA Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall said the NCAA has hired more than 100 Indiana  
residents, along with about 100 other people from other states. Of 
the roughly 300 people who worked for the NCAA at the time the move 
was announced, 95 will actually be making the trek to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to help them as much as possible,'' Marshall said.  
``We've provided assistance selling homes, and paid moving expenses 
and given a relocating allowance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once they arrive, employees will keep mainly to the second,  
third and fourth floors, which house conference rooms and offices. 
The offices consist mainly of glass walls, intended to create an 
open environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted a more informal feel,'' Marshall said. ``A feeling  
more of a sharing of information, to encourage the employees to 
work in teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the grand entrance to the building is completed in the  
fall, it will feature a video wall made up of 144 television sets, 
located on the upper level of the entrance hall and visible from 
outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that will entice people to come in,'' Marshall said.  
</P>
<P>
	If that doesn't work, there's always the cantaloupe atrium.

<HEADLINE> Big Unit Haunts Old Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- This was the night Seattle Mariners' fans kept  
waiting for -- Randy Johnson on the mound at Safeco Field, pitching 
a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	Only it was against the Mariners, not for them.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot of fun coming back here,'' Johnson said after the  
Arizona Diamondbacks' 6-0 win Tuesday night. ``I saw a lot of 
friends and I had the opportunity to see the new ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Unit helped create Safeco Field, pitching the Mariners  
to the American League championship series in 1995. But he was 
traded to Houston last Aug. 31 in a contract dispute and signed a 
$52.4 million contract with Arizona as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Interleague play gave the 35-year-old left-hander a chance to  
come back to Seattle, and in the sixth game at the $518 million 
stadium, he shut out former teammates Ken Griffey Jr., Alex 
Rodriguez and Jay Buhner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of my career has been here in Seattle and the fans have  
always been supportive,'' Johnson said after getting two standing 
ovations from the first sellout crowd at Safeco since last week's 
stadium opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson (10-7), who won for the first time in seven starts since  
June 14, lowered his NL-leading ERA to 2.65. He struck out 10 in 
the 14th double-digit strikeout game this season, the 116th of his 
career, and allowed eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He increased his strikeouts total to a major league-leading 229  
this season and 2,558 in his career, moving past Jerry Koosman in 
18th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy was probably excited to be in the building,'' Mariners  
catcher Dan Wilson said. ``He's a big part of this building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 70-32 at the Kingdome from 1989-98, got his second  
shutout of the season and 25th of his career. It was his eighth 
complete game of the season, tying Philadelphia's Curt Schilling 
for the major league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy is tough,'' Seattle manager Lou Piniella said. ``We saw  
it here for many years. He's been durable and he's a big, strong 
guy. Tonight, he probably had a little extra adrenaline pitching 
against this team here in Seattle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was given a standing ovations when he walked in from the  
left-field bullpen to the Diamondbacks' dugout before the game, 
then another when he went out to the mound in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, it was just a matter of getting focused on the  
game,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson gave up two hits each to Rodriguez, Martinez and David  
Bell, but Seattle stranded eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a great team and a real nice ballpark,'' he said.  
``I gave up a lot of hits to a lot of good hitters. It was a 
blessing that I didn't walk anybody or allow a big inning to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is another tough assignment: Kevin Brown and the Los  
Angeles Dodgers in a rematch of the season opener.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Pro-Environment Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man that President Bush mocked as ``Ozone  
Al'' in 1992 is now looking to pick -- or, in this case, paddle -- 
that same fight with Governor Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vice President Al Gore dips his canoe paddle into New  
Hampshire's Connecticut River today, he hopes the made-for-cameras 
image will make the point that in a matchup with Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner, Gore is the 
pro-environment choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warned that Gore risks hurting himself further with the  
business community and could end up unintentionally highlighting 
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley as an alternative for 
business-minded Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 2000, the American people will have a stark choice between  
the vice president and whoever the Republican presidential 
candidate may be when it comes to the environment,'' Gore spokesman 
Chris Lehane said Wednesday. ``The Republicans seem to believe it's 
more important to protect the polluters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehane was making a barely concealed reference to legislation  
recently signed by Bush -- and seized upon by environmentalists -- 
that established a voluntary program for some 800 Texas industrial 
plants to reduce air pollution. The program gains some teeth by 
imposing higher fees on noncompliant companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker countered that a similarly  
voluntary program by 20 companies that Bush enlisted when he first 
took office in 1995 already has cut air emissions to a degree 
equivalent of taking 500,000 cars off Texas roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also signed a bill making Texas only the third state to  
require all electric utilities to reduce air pollution or shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a strong record of accomplishment,'' Tucker said.  
``What Governor Bush has focused on is voluntary environmental 
initiatives that emphasize industry and government cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore is counting on being seen as greener.  
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, he wants voters to remember that, as a  
member of Congress in 1979, he called the nation's first hearings 
on toxic waste and has championed the environment ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups are particularly grateful that the  
Clinton-Gore administration has strengthened clean air health 
standards for soot and smog, acted to protect the California desert 
and Florida Everglades, and stood against Republican-driven 
attempts to relax environmental regulations and permit drilling in 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gore was ahead of the Washington pack in recognizing the  
threat of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Bush reversed course and told reporters, ``I'm becoming  
more convinced that the science proves there's global warming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The environment and education are key issues driving the  
so-called gender gap against the GOP, Bush strategist Ralph Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a Republican to do well among his base on issues like  
taxes and values but still reach out to swing voters, a positive 
environmental agenda is crucial,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Club political director Dan Weiss called Gore a ``Green  
Giant'' compared with Bush's ``pale lime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Weiss added, the current administration made a mistake --  
later acknowledged by Gore -- when early on it allowed the clear 
cutting of healthy trees in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gore still has not offered concrete steps to reverse global  
warming beyond tax incentives to cut emissions dangerous to the 
Earth's protective ozone layer, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the issue, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice  
President Bill Kovacs said Gore is ``so far to the extreme'' in 
pushing a government-directed ``command and control'' of the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will hurt him substantially with the business  
community,'' said Kovacs. ``Bradley is more an internationalist who 
sees the global impact, understands the trading system, monetary 
system and banking system. He certainly would be a lot easier to 
live with than Gore because I think business people believe they 
can talk to Bill Bradley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser resisted comparisons with  
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	From cleaning up New Jersey beaches and parks to championing a  
water distribution problem in California, ``the environment was 
always a major priority for him consistently through 18 years in 
the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Sierra Club, which does not plan to endorse any candidate  
in the 2000 presidential primaries, Weiss agreed that Bradley voted 
pro-environment but ``he was not the leader that Gore was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, Weiss said, ``generally left the heavy lifting on  
pollution'' to fellow New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg who, 
then as now, sits on the Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate may be merely academic.  
</P>
<P>
	Interviews with voters nationwide as they left the polls in 1992  
found only 6 percent of them cited the environment as one of ``the 
issues that mattered most'' -- trumped by the economy, jobs, health 
care and the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The environment's profile isn't much higher among others in this  
year's field. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes spokeswoman Juleanna Glover said he ``hasn't had an  
opportunity'' yet to address the environment but would later in the 
year. Elizabeth Dole's campaign declined an invitation to respond 
to Gore's record.

<HEADLINE> Man Caught With Cocaine in Crotch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASTORIA, Ore. (AP) -- A suspected drug trafficker was arrested  
when the cocaine he had stashed down his pants was burning his 
crotch so much he had to ask police to remove it, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police pulled over the car Roberto Valiente-Martinez, 28, was  
riding in on Saturday because the driver had parked inside a 
crosswalk.

	After a few minutes, the man pleaded with Officer William Barnes  
to remove a bag of cocaine hidden down his pants, police said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airbase in Germany May Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RHEIN-MAIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) -- It was here that Allied  
forces staged the Berlin airlift. Here that freed Western hostages 
began long-awaited journeys home. Here that the bodies of U.S. 
Marines were brought from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	In sadness and joy, the U.S. Rhein-Main Air Base has been a  
landmark in postwar history. It was a hub for Cold War travel 
during the days of West Germany and a link between the United 
States and Europe, where more than 300,000 U.S. troops once were 
based, most of them in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the U.S. military plans to close the base as part of its  
downsizing in Germany. Negotiators today were working out final 
details of a plan for the base to eventually be absorbed into the 
nearby Frankfurt International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Air Force spokeswoman, Capt. Patricia Lang, said the deal  
could be signed in the coming days or weeks. ``They're making 
progress,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some veterans are upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad thing,'' said Francis Townsend, 61, a former  
soldier from Allston, Mass., who works at the base shopping center. 
``I think they're making a big mistake. There's so much history 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What became Rhein-Main started as a German air force base in  
1936 -- used to launch planes and zeppelins, including the 
Hindenburg, which crashed in flames in New Jersey in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Used by Hitler's Luftwaffe, the base was bombed by the Allies.  
After the war, the Allies took over. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Soviet Union blocked land and water routes to West  
Berlin in 1949, the United States, Britain and France used 
Rhein-Main as one of their staging grounds for flying food and fuel 
to the divided city. 
</P>
<P>
	Their success is remembered in a Berlin Airlift memorial at  
Rhein-Main, which will remain at the Frankfurt airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for the base closure, the sign over the entrance  
-- ``Gateway to Europe'' -- already has been removed. But that is how 
tens of thousands of American troops and their families will 
remember Rhein-Main, as will those for whom arrival at the base 
meant freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the day in January 1981, when 52 American hostages  
came to Rhein-Main after 444 days as hostages in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1985-91, a string of Western hostages held in Lebanon were  
flown to the hospital at Rhein-Main, including AP Middle East 
Correspondent Terry Anderson. Reporters used to wait for hours on 
the roof of the Sheraton Hotel across from the base runway, hoping 
for a first glimpse of a plane carrying freed hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the saddest days at Rhein-Main was the return of 241 U.S.  
servicemen killed in October 1983 along with 58 French soldiers in 
suicide bombings in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhein-Main itself was the target of a car bombing in 1985. Two  
people were killed and 20 wounded in an attack for which Germany's 
radical leftist Red Army Faction terror group claimed 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Persian Gulf War, Rhein-Main was a travel hub for  
U.S. troops and equipment. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it 
was the staging ground for humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union. 
And in 1992, U.S., German and French planes from the base dropped 
tons of food on isolated areas of wartime Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, the U.S. Air Force announced it was cutting back  
its personnel at the base from 3,000 to less than 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rhein-Main missions continued, with aid to peacetime Bosnia  
and refueling planes for NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Rhine-Main can close completely, the U.S. military must  
prepare other west German air bases, both in the Rhineland, to fill 
the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say that could take as long a six years -- time,  
perhaps, for more history-making at Rhein-Main.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Legislation Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate agreed Tuesday to debate campaign  
finance legislation this fall, pulling back from an immediate clash 
that had threatened to disrupt routine business for days. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and  
Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said they had gained the promise of an 
orderly debate in which the Republican leadership would allow 
amendments to be voted on freely. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, they agreed not to try to force the issue to  
the floor in the next few weeks, when Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., hopes to have several must-pass spending bills approved. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Feingold are co-sponsors of a measure to ban soft  
money, which are unlimited donations that political parties covet 
and that increasingly, individual politicians seek as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure would curtail so-called issue ads,  
which are customarily thinly veiled attacks that stop short of 
explicitly calling for a candidate's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the agreement, Feingold said, ``we have a better  
chance'' of ultimately prevailing on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure in the House and outside Congress also  
depicted the agreement as a potential breakthrough in the long 
effort to overhaul the campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., who supports a companion bill in  
the House, said ``now, more than ever,'' there is a chance for 
passage. And Common Cause, an advocacy group pressing to change the 
campaign finance laws, said ``reformers in both houses of Congress 
have extracted a promise from the leadership'' for debates this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate agreement requires Lott to bring the issue to the  
floor by Oct. 12, with several days set aside for debate on 
amendments. Assuming a filibuster by Republicans, many of whom 
oppose the soft money ban, the bill's supporters would have one 
opportunity to gain the 60 votes needed to overcome the delaying 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Feingold both expressed the hope that by giving  
senators a chance to have amendments added to the bill, they would 
broaden support for the underlying legislation beyond 60 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is scheduled to debate campaign finance legislation in  
September. It voted approval last year for a measure similar to the 
bill embraced by McCain and Feingold. But the Senate gridlocked on 
the issue when the GOP leadership sought to stall a final vote.

<HEADLINE> Baby Bells Profit From Wireless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic and BellSouth posted solid profit gains for the  
second quarter, with wireless and Internet services playing an 
increasingly key role for two more Baby Bell telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, the regional phone company for much of the  
Northeast and mid-Atlantic, reported an 11 percent increase in 
profits for the April-June quarter, excluding one-time factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits rose 8 percent at BellSouth, which serves the  
Southeast, although a one-time gain from a new accounting method 
more than doubled the company's net earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports, like those on Tuesday from SBC Communications and  
Ameritech, showed surging demand for wireless and data services 
among the local Bell monopolies, whose fortunes have grown far less 
reliant on phone calls. 

</P>
<P>
 *Bell Atlantic    	
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company earned $1.20 billion, or 75 cents per  
share, in the second quarter. Those figures exclude one-time costs 
from the merger with Nynex that lowered Bell Atlantic's net profit 
to $1.17 billion, or 74 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Bell Atlantic earned $1.07  
billion, or 68 cents per share, excluding merger and pension costs 
that lowered the company's net profit to $1.02 billion, or 65 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the just-ended quarter totaled $8.3 billion, up  
4.6 percent compared with $7.9 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless services generated $1.12 billion of those revenues, an  
18.6 percent increase from a year ago, while digital data revenues 
rose 26.3 percent to $691 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's latest profits matched most Wall Street  
forecasts, according to a survey by the research firm First Call. 
After the release of Wednesday's report, Bell Atlantic's stock rose 
31 1/4 cents per share to $47.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are speeding up our drive into the high-growth markets of  
the future,'' said Bell Atlantic chairman and chief executive Ivan 
Seidenberg, noting the recent rollout in Boston and New York of 
digital subscriber line services, or DSL, which provide high-speed 
Internet connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Seidenberg also expressed confidence that Bell Atlantic's  
pending merger with GTE would pass regulatory scrutiny, but offered 
no timetable. The deal recently drew a nod from the Department of 
Justice, but still awaits a ruling from the Federal Communications 
Commission and several states. 

</P>
<P>
 *BellSouth    	
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based company earned $885 million, or 46 cents per  
share, in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That excludes a one-time gain of $95 million, or 5 cents a  
share, from credits on software spending in preparations for the 
Year 2000 computer bug. That gave BellSouth a net profit of $980 
million, or 51 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's second quarter, BellSouth posted a net profit of  
$818 million or 41 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the latest quarter totaled $6.15 billion, up 8.5  
percent from $5.66 billion during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic wireless revenues grew 18.5 percent to $796 million,  
while revenues from digital and data services jumped 32.3 percent 
to $615 million compared with the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected earnings of 47 cents per share in the  
latest quarter, excluding one-time items, according to a survey by 
First Call. After Wednesday's report, BellSouth stock was up 75 
cents per share to $47.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to move swiftly and execute decisively in the  
fast-growing areas of the exploding telecommunications marketplace 
-- data, Internet, wireless and international,'' said BellSouth 
chairman Duane Ackerman.

<HEADLINE> Al Fayed Sues Over Crash Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The billionaire father of Dodi Fayed claims  
four people sold him bogus documents that showed the car-crash 
deaths of his son and Princess Diana were the work of a carefully 
planned assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed Al Fayed accused Beverly Hills attorney Keith Fleer and  
associates Oswald LeWinter, Pat McMillan and George Williamson with 
forging documents purporting to be secret files from the CIA and 
MI6, a British intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to imagine conduct more despicable than to attempt  
to take money from a father grieving over his dead son,'' Al 
Fayed's attorney Bertram Fields said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left Wednesday for Fleer weren't returned.  
</P>
<P>
	LeWinter is currently serving four years in an Austrian prison  
after being convicted of attempted criminal fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Monday in state court, seeks $6 million in  
damages, claiming fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy 
and unjust enrichment. The U.S. Attorney and FBI were investigating 
the alleged fraud, Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodi Al Fayed, Princess Diana and driver Henri Paul were killed  
in a traffic tunnel in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997. Test results showed 
Paul was drunk at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Al Fayed refuses to accept the high-speed crash was an  
accident and has said he believes it was a conspiracy plotted by 
people who did not want the future king of England with an Egyptian 
stepfather. Diana's eldest son, Prince William, is in line to 
become king. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Fayed is the owner of Harrod's department store in London and  
the Ritz Hotel in Paris.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Accused at Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Fueling a nagging controversy over Lance Armstrong,  
currently leading the Tour de France, Le Monde newspaper again 
reported today that traces of a banned anti-inflammatory drug had 
been detected in the American's urine. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor on the medical commission of the International Cycling  
Union, however, repeated that no cases of improper drug use had 
been uncovered, which could mean that any rider who tested positive 
for such a drug has a medical waiver for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily said Armstrong was tested July 4, the day after he won  
the race prologue, and that traces were found of a corticosteroid.

	Corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs which

	If the report is confirmed, the next question would be whether

<HEADLINE> Rival NFL L.A. Groups Work Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rival groups trying to land an NFL expansion  
franchise for Los Angeles appear to have cleared a major hurdle, 
agreeing to present league owners with a single stadium design and 
site plan for Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for the city, it looks like now we're going to get  
football,'' John Semcken, executive vice president of the New 
Coliseum Partners, said Wednesday. ``There's a lot of work still to 
be done, but we've made an incredible amount of progress in the 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will still be alterations, but I'm confident we've gone  
a long way toward coming up with a design that's generally 
acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At its March meetings in Phoenix, the NFL tentatively awarded  
Los Angeles the league's 32nd franchise over Houston with the 
stipulation that it come up with a viable plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has said it intends to put a team in a 76-year-old,  
reconstructed Los Angeles Coliseum, but has yet to name a price or 
choose an owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire developer Eli Broad and Ed Roski, co-owner of the  
Los Angeles Kings, head one of the groups, while former Hollywood 
agent Michael Ovitz and grocery billionaire Ron Burkle head the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Acceding to NFL wishes, they have come together in recent weeks,  
with the help of Bill Chadwick, appointed a month ago by Gov. Gray 
Davis to pull the sides together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key element is that all four principals have come together  
to create one plan for the Coliseum. That's what has enabled us to 
break the ice and move forward,'' Semcken said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unified Los Angeles group expects the NFL to contribute  
roughly $150 million to the project. Technically, the money would 
be considered a loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's commitment of that kind of money is relatively new  
and aimed at keeping teams from relocating. Two months ago, it 
committed more than $200 million as collateral for stadiums in 
Philadelphia, Denver and Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners will meet July 28 in Chicago to consider the joint  
Los Angeles stadium design and site plan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a very important hurdle that's been cleared,''  
Chadwick said. ``We're not 100 percent there yet. Do I think there 
are other hurdles? Sure, I do. This isn't as simple as drawing a 
building. I think that's a big part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Semcken said he believes the owners will appreciate the progress  
the groups have made. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have to pick an owner, they still have to pick a  
(franchise) price,'' he said. ``None of the final arrangements can 
be made until an owner is picked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price could be upwards of $1 billion. The NFL expects the  
refurbished Coliseum to cost about $400 million and increased 
parking to cost $150 million. Then, there's the franchise fee of 
$500 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems likely that some or all four of the major players --  
Broad, Roski, Ovitz and Burkle -- will be involved in the ownership 
group, assuming the owners like what they hear next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Semcken said the groups have been working for three or four  
weeks on the stadium design and site plan proposals. Chadwick 
called the result ``truly a collaborative effort.''

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Accused at Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Fueling a nagging controversy over Lance Armstrong,  
currently leading the Tour de France, Le Monde newspaper again 
reported today that traces of a banned anti-inflammatory drug had 
been detected in the American's urine. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor on the medical commission of the International Cycling  
Union, however, repeated that no cases of improper drug use had 
been uncovered, which could mean that any rider who tested positive 
for such a drug has a medical waiver for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily said Armstrong was tested July 4, the day after he won  
the race prologue, and that traces were found of a corticosteroid. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs which

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota, seeking a replacement for  
basketball coach Clem Haskins, has received permission to interview 
Rice coach Willis Wilson and Gonzaga coach Dan Monson. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota officials also plan to interview Bill Self of Tulsa  
and Jim Crews of Evansville, according to the Star Tribune of 
Minneapolis. The Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported that Barry 
Collier of Butler is also a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mark Dienhart asked for and got clearance to  
talk to Wilson on Monday, Rice athletic director Bobby May said. 
Dienhart also received permission from Gonzaga athletic director 
Mike Roth to talk to Monson. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, who was in California on a recruiting trip, is not  
actively looking at the Minnesota job, Roth said, and will talk to 
Golden Gophers officials if he can fit them into his recruiting 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press reported that Dienhart was expected to

	It was not clear whether Wilson is even interested in leaving  
Rice, where he has revived a once-stagnant program. May said he was

<HEADLINE> Druckenmiller Accuser Takes Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A woman who accused San Francisco  
49ers reserve quarterback Jim Druckenmiller of rape testified 
Wednesday that she passed out in a bed and awoke to find him having 
sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution rested its case after the testimony by the  
22-year-old Virginia Tech graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	The accuser testified that she vaguely remembered a friend  
putting her to bed after a night of drinking in March. She passed 
out and awoke to find Druckenmiller on top of her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was he doing?'' asked Peggy Frank, a Montgomery County  
assistant commonwealth's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having sex,'' the woman replied. ``It took me a while to  
realize what was going on. I was disoriented. I had no idea where I 
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who showed little emotion during her testimony, said  
she got dressed afterward, felt scared and wanted to go home. She 
declined Druckenmiller's offer of a ride and called a male friend 
to come and get her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, the woman said she did not recall  
kissing Druckenmiller earlier in the evening or telling him she 
loved him and wanted to have sex with him. She did not recall 
taking her clothes off in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you remember saying yes when Jim asked you about your  
promise that you had made earlier, if you two could still have 
fun?'' asked Deborah Caldwell-Bono, the defense lawyer. The woman 
said she did not recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The rape charge against Druckenmiller resulted from a night of  
partying by the athlete and a group of friends and his accuser and 
some of her friends. Druckenmiller, a Virginia Tech graduate, and 
the others went to two bars and ended up at a party at a Blacksburg 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Several witnesses testified for the defense Wednesday that the  
woman was flirting with Druckenmiller hours before the alleged 
attack. Three men who know Druckenmiller said they heard the woman 
say she wanted to have sex with him that night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the woman said she was ``just talking to him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Page Verlander, a sexual assault nurse examiner called by the  
defense, testified that she believes the sex between the accuser 
and Druckenmiller was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that the woman was completely undressed and her  
underwear was intact. Based on her experience treating unresponsive 
patients in emergency rooms, she said, it would be ``extremely 
difficult'' for one person to fully undress someone who is passed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Barnette, a nurse who examined the alleged victim,  
testified Tuesday that the woman filed charges after being told 
that rape examinations cost $1,800 for people who do not file 
charges but are free for women who take the case to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the accuser testified that she told the nurse she had good  
medical insurance and her parents would not mind paying for the 
examination. The woman said she was concerned about the publicity 
that would follow if she went to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, 26, faces five years to life in prison if  
convicted.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Makes Tax Cut Bill a Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Nothing's ever definite in this business,''  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said in the chaotic run-up to a 
critical vote on tax cuts. Except this: He made passage of the 
legislation an unmistakable test of his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months into his job, the Illinois Republican couldn't have  
been clearer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be as plainspoken as I can be,'' the former  
wrestling coach told his fractious rank and file earlier in the 
week, according to officials with knowledge of the meeting. ``I 
need each and every one of you to vote for this tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With moderates rebelling against the bill's $792 billion price  
tag, Hastert once again urged unity Wednesday. Other key issues are 
just over the horizon, spending bills and health care among them, 
and he warned of political chaos for the Republicans in the months 
ahead if the tax cut bill were to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He warned us that it will repeat itself,'' said Rep. Fred  
Upton, a Michigan moderate and one of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	As leader of a narrow majority, Hastert has little room for  
error. The Republicans hold 222 seats, to 211 for Democrats and one 
independent who votes with the Democrats, and one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined not to rely on any Democratic votes for the tax bill,  
the GOP leadership could afford to suffer only four defections and 
still be certain of prevailing. The bill was held off the floor all 
afternoon and into the early evening to give the leaders time to 
line up the votes they needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked this as hard as anything I've seen,'' one  
Republican lawmaker said of Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big deal,'' concurred the speaker's spokesman, John  
Feehery. ``We want to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Hastert called two separate groups of  
dissidents to his office and sought their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	A nonbinding provision dedicating Republicans to debt reduction  
was agreed to. So was a measure to help certain union laborers with 
their pension benefits, a provision designed to make it easier for 
several moderates to climb on board. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday afternoon, it was one-on-one with the last  
holdouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steven Kuykendall, a California freshman, was invited to  
the speaker's office down the hall from the House floor. So was 
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a veteran New Yorker who has spoken often 
of the importance of staying in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. John Porter, susceptible, perhaps, to an appeal from a  
fellow Illinoisan. And Rep. Ray LaHood, another lawmaker from 
Illinois, who once arranged meetings of this sort with recalcitrant 
lawmakers when he was an aide to former GOP Leader Bob Michel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's pitch, by all accounts, was respectful, calm, and  
utterly unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
	To moderates concerned about the size of the tax cuts, he  
stressed that the pending bill is only a first step. Negotiations 
with the Senate will follow, but it was important to lay down a 
marker. 
</P>
<P>
	His room to maneuver was limited, too, by the smallness of the  
majority. Moderates were unhappy that the tax cut was too big, but 
any effort to shrink it risked howls from some conservatives, who 
already felt it didn't provide enough relief to married couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, by early evening, a compromise was in sight. There would  
be no reduction in the nominal size of the tax cut, but a portion 
of it would be made conditional on a year-to-year decline in the 
government's borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax cut advocates suggested there was less to the change than  
met the eye. There is no across-the-board cut in legislation making 
its way through the Senate, and there may be none in the bill that 
ultimately goes to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But the provision seemed likely to entice enough rebellious  
Republicans to swing behind the measure, and enable Hastert to 
claim victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a very good listener,'' said Upton.  
``Everyone has his chance to speak. Newt (Gingrich) was certainly 
more of a table pounder and in your face.'' Hastert, he said, is 
``very practical. He listens, he makes his points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speakership was practically thrust upon Hastert in January,  
after Newt Gingrich gave up his seat in Congress and the heir 
apparent, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, resigned unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Hastert has made good on a promise to try to make the  
House a more genteel place than it was under Gingrich, 
bipartisanship is elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, determined to gain a majority in the 2000 elections,  
are more interested in depicting Republicans as political 
extremists than in helping them to achieve legislative 
accomplishments. ``The Republican party has been hijacked by the 
extreme right wing,'' Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said 
over the weekend as he and other Democrats celebrated the defection 
of Rep. Michael Forbes from the GOP to their side. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of Hastert's difficulties have come from the Democrats,  
though. At times -- on a vote on the war in Kosovo and on gun 
control, for example -- he has seemed overshadowed by the powerful 
Republican whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the difficulties, Hastert long ago decided that he'd  
take his stand on the budget that Republicans muscled through the 
House earlier this year, tax cuts and spending restraint included. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned a lot of lessons in this first six months,'' he  
told the rank and file Tuesday, according to officials familiar 
with his remarks. ``The most important one is that we gain the 
confidence of the American people when we keep moving as planned. 
When we second-guess one another, hesitate, and break apart, then 
people begin to wonder if we are capable of leadership.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Museum Construction Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 10 years of planning, raising money and  
fighting over its design, officials will break ground Sept. 28 for 
a new National Museum of the American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-story structure will occupy a 4.3 acre site between the  
Capitol and the Washington Monument. It will be the last available 
spot on the Mall -- right next to the Air and Space Museum, the most 
popular showplace of the Smithsonian Institution's 17 facilities. 
Last year museum officials there counted 28 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas J. Cardinal, a Canadian of Blackfoot Indian ancestry,  
designed the unusual curving structure with an overhanging roof and 
undulating walls of rough-hewn limestone. It recalls the cliffs 
where native Americans built multistory houses in the Southwest. 
Windows are positioned to catch the sunlight during the solstices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been silly to build an American Indian museum  
with a lot of Greek columns,'' said J. Carter Brown, chairman of 
the capital's Commission on Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian has invited 554 leaders of recognized tribes to  
the ceremonial space, named the Potomac -- like the nearby river -- 
where some will bless the building and grounds. Landscaping will 
reflect a variety of American Indian territories including some 
wetland, said Leonda Levchuk of the museum's public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
	The 250,000 square foot building is scheduled to open in late  
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian museum was long a landmark in uptown Manhattan. In  
1989 it became part of the Smithsonian and five years later moved 
to its present spot in the old Customs House near New York's 
Battery district. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved the project for Washington and has  
appropriated $39 million. Originally estimated at $110 million, the 
total cost is now expected to run higher. Some $36.7 million from 
private sources has been raised, Ms. Levchuk said. Moving is under 
way for more than 800,000 artifacts and other pieces -- the world's 
most comprehensive collection of Indian materials -- to the 
Smithsonian's Cultural Resources Center in suburban Suitland, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking was delayed a year by the firing of Cardinal in a  
contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Cardinal's basic design will be used, a new architectural  
firm added a large, thick column to hold up the roof. But then that 
column was eliminated in the model the commission unanimously 
approved last month.

<HEADLINE> Profits at UAL Fall 17 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The parent of United Airlines and Shuttle by  
United reported today its second-quarter profits tumbled 17 percent 
amid fare wars and problems with a new computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended June 30, UAL Corp. said its operating  
earnings on a fully distributed basis fell to $349 million, or 
$2.86 a share, from $418 million, or $3.24 a share, in the 
year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fully distributed earnings assume shares owed to employees who  
control a majority stake in the carrier are distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings for the nation's largest airline well exceeded Wall  
Street expectations of $2.66 a share, according to a survey of 
analysts by First Call Corp. But analysts lowered their estimates 
last month after UAL said it would earn between $2.40 and $2.80 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 2.2 percent to $4.54 billion from $4.44 billion as  
a late-quarter summer air fare sale helped boost ticket revenue. 
The Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based carrier launched a fare war after 
seeing passenger traffic decline in late April and May. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased business from the fare sale helped offset losses  
from problems with a new computer pricing system, United Chairman 
James Goodwin said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraged by the fact that most of the challenges we  
faced in the second quarter are now behind us,'' Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter included a gain of $669 million, or  
$3.88 a diluted share, on the sale of stock in the Galileo 
reservations system and a loss of $3 million, or 2 cents a share, 
from the extinguishment of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong U.S. travel demand and a modest rise in demand from  
United's important Asian region should help the carrier post a 
modest increase in unit revenue during the third quarter, Goodwin 
said.

<HEADLINE> Belle Waives No-Trade Clause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle has agreed to dismiss the no-trade  
clause in his contract with the Baltimore Orioles, freeing the team 
to try to unload the temperamental slugger. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's five-year, $65 million contract includes a three-year  
clause barring him from being traded, but he apparently consented 
to lift the trade ban soon after the Orioles learned of a June 4 
incident in which he allegedly made obscene gestures to fans in the 
bleachers at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago White Sox manager Jerry Manuel recently told Chicago  
reporters that Belle informed him of his decision to renounce the 
trade clause. The (Baltimore) Sun, citing club sources, confirmed 
Belle's decision in a story that ran in today's editions of the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle played two seasons with the White Sox before joining for  
the Orioles as a free agent after discovering an escape clause in 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle is hitting .275 with 20 homers and 59 RBIs for Baltimore,  
but his time with the team has been filled with controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle stopped talking to the Baltimore media after a clubhouse  
tirade during spring training was reported. He also threw a beer 
bottle through a television in the visitor's clubhouse at Tropicana 
Field and has been booed by the home fans for an apparent lack of 
hustle.

<HEADLINE> Freshmen Ineligibility Problematic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Stopping short of supporting a proposal to  
make male freshmen ineligible to play basketball, members of an 
NCAA panel tried to be ``practical idealists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had to temper the enthusiasm of some with the  
realities of what we can accomplish,'' Syracuse University 
Chancellor Kenneth ``Buzz'' Shaw, the committee chairman, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked these folks to be `practical idealists,''' Shaw said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said opponents of freshmen ineligibility raised practical  
concerns as well as issues of fairness. He and NCAA President 
Cedric Dempsey also suggested that such a move was likely to bring 
a court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the committee wants the NCAA to encourage incoming  
freshmen athletes to attend summer school to get used to the more 
challenging academic programs they will face in college. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals would tie the number of scholarships to schools'  
academic success, limit the number of new scholarships colleges can 
award each year to four, establish new regulations for recruiting 
and offer several steps aimed at cleaning up the sport's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a showcase sport,'' Shaw said. ``It is very important  
to the people in this country, and we must and we do expect and 
demand more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said the committee wanted to offer athletes more help  
succeeding in the classroom while also demanding more of them 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
	``This combination of extending opportunity while greatly  
increasing our expectations for student performance creates what I 
believe will be seen as a stern compassion for basketball 
student-athletes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-member committee was formed to study issues such as low  
graduation rates, gambling scandals, recruiting problems and the 
influence of agents. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NCAA statistics, only 41 percent of male  
basketball players in the 1991 entering class got their degrees, 
including just 37 percent of black players. That was the lowest of 
all groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the committee's recommendations, the NCAA would consider  
not just a program's graduation rate, but how many students were in 
good academic standing when they left school. 
</P>
<P>
	Those schools with rates of 75 percent or higher would be  
allowed 14 full scholarships; schools with rates of 33 percent to 
74 percent would be allowed 13; schools with rates below 33 percent 
could award 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also urged changes in the recruiting process that  
Shaw said were designed to increase the influence of high school 
and junior college coaches on their players, and keep academics in 
the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations would increase the period during the academic  
year when coaches could evaluate players while shortening it during 
the summer, tighten regulations on events at which high school 
players are evaluated and ban agents from any involvement in them. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also urged stiffening the penalties for gambling  
and considering new rules to enforce proper behavior during games. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, which go to the NCAA's executive committee Aug.  
5, could be in place by fall 2001 if the executive committee 
approves them, Shaw said.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Embraced at Braves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga,  
sidelined since being diagnosed with back cancer in February, 
attended Wednesday's game against the Florida Marlins and said 
he'll complete radiation treatments early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga said he'll then join the Braves for workouts, and he  
expects to play in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, I want to be in uniform right now,'' a grinning  
Galarraga said. ``But I'd better take it easy this year to be ready 
for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 38, lives an hour north of Pro Player Stadium in West  
Palm Beach. He attended the game with his wife and children and was 
greeted with hugs from teammates when he walked onto the field 
during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga said he has been working out four times a week. He  
runs and bikes for an hour but hasn't resumed lifting weights yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to feel stronger now and more comfortable,'' he  
said. ``Sometimes I want to do more, but I want to do what the 
doctors say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered a cancerous tumor pressing against  
Galarraga's spine Feb. 18. He underwent chemotherapy for four 
months and looks forward to finishing radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga said the treatments have destroyed at least 98 percent  
of the tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The radiation is to kill everything in there so it never comes  
back again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga was an All-Star last year for the Braves, when he had  
a .305 average with 44 homers and 121 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Machinists Pave Way for Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Machinists in Portland, Ore., Wichita, Kan., and  
here all voted Wednesday overwhelmingly in favor of considering a 
strike if contract talks fail with Boeing next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, 98 percent of the voting International Association  
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers members were in favor of 
granting union officials the authority to call for a strike vote. 
There were 14,426 Machinists in favor of the measure and 295 voted 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was similar in Kansas and Oregon. In Wichita, 3,880  
Machinists voted yes, while 120 voted against it. In Portland, 640 
Machinists voted in favor of it, while 20 voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
	This vote does not authorize a strike. Union members would have  
to vote again before their leaders could call a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The current 44-month contract, which covers 36,000 workers in  
Washington state, 1,800 in Portland, Ore., and 11,500 in Wichita, 
expires Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists struck for 69 days after negotiations broke down in  
1995 in a walkout that slowed production, delaying delivery of 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks come at a time Boeing is cutting thousands of jobs  
from its work force, both union and nonunion. Boeing plans to 
reduce its 231,000 work force to about 205,000 workers by the end 
of this year. By the end of the year 2000, Boeing plans to reduce 
its work force to between 185,000 and 195,000.

<HEADLINE> Colgate Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Colgate-Palmolive's second quarter profits rose  
a better than expected 12 percent, as a result of rebounding sales 
for its consumer products in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate made a profit of $228.1 million or 36 cents per share in  
the second quarter, compared to $203.5 million, or 31 cents per 
share in the same period last year. Results beat Wall Street 
expectations by two cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 4 percent to $2.29 billion from $2.26 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate's North American sales rose 3.5 percent and its Latin  
American operations saw sale rise 1 percent. Sales in the company's 
Asian and African unit rose 7 percent, led by strong gains in China 
and India. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited a number of new products sales in the United  
States and abroad for its rising sales. Those include new Colgate 
Double Cool Stripe and Colgate Sensation whitening toothpastes, as 
well as new herbal toothpastes under the Sorriso and Kolynos brand 
names. New Palmolive dishwashing liquids have also boosted sales. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, profits were $437 million, or 68  
cents per share, compared to $400 million, or 61 cents per share, 
in the same period a year ago. Sales in the first six months of 
1999 rose 1 percent to $4.46 billion from $4.42 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate, one of the world's largest consumer product makers,  
sells Colgate toothpaste, Palmolive liquid soap and Speed Stick 
underarm deodorant.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen early Thursday amid  
trader caution over more possible intervention by Japan's central 
bank. Tokyo stock prices slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.34 yen in early trading, down 0.66 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
118.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 121.62 points,  
or 0.67 percent, to 18,135.90 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Wednesday, the average closed down 275.06 points, or 1.48 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar's relative strength from its New  
York level came after interbank players bought back dollars on 
fears of another round of Bank of Japan dollar-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese newspapers reported the central bank intervened  
Wednesday evening in Tokyo, when the dollar was trading above 
118.50 yen. But the amount of intervention was rather small, the 
Nihon Keizai financial daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second such move by Japanese finance authorities  
following Tuesday's intervention in New York, where the Federal 
Reserve stepped into the currency market to buy the greenback on 
behalf of the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BOJ can get into the market at any time once the dollar is  
below 118 yen,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka, a trader at Nippon Credit 
Bank. ``For now, no players appear to be courageous enough to 
continue selling dollars around and below 118 yen,'' Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has frequently intervened in recent weeks to  
prevent a stronger yen, seen as a threat to the nation's fledging 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen tends to reduce the value of Japanese exporters'  
foreign revenue in yen terms by making exports from Japan more 
expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is still struggling to bail out of its worst recession  
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 124.48 yen, even  
with its rate late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices opened weaker amid continued  
profit-taking in high-technology issues and exporter blue chips. 
Market players also remained wary about movements in the foreign 
exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 11.42 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,488.69. 
The TOPIX closed down 15.89 points, or 1.05 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7300 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7500 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.60 yen from 100.43 yen.

	Stocks End Up a Bit; Dow Up 6.65  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed marginally higher today as  
Goodyear provided the first major blemish in an otherwise stellar 
earnings season and prevented blue-chip stocks from recouping 
yesterday's losses. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow 
Jones industrial average was up 6.65 at 11,002.78, having erased a 
gain of nearly 60 points. It was the third straight decline for the 
blue-chip index, which reached a new record close just last Friday. 
Broader stock indicators fared better than the Dow. The Nasdaq 
composite index rose 29.48 to 2,761.60.

	Goodyear Earnings Fall As Expected  
</P>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings for the Goodyear Tire  
&AMP; Rubber Co. were down to $65.7 million from $199 million in the 
same period a year ago, but profits were within the range the 
company set last month. The Akron-based tire maker said today the 
decline was because of weakness in emerging market economies in 
Europe and Latin America, and the company's efforts to reduce 
inventory and reorganize its manufacturing system. Goodyear 
released a statement on June 24 warning that earnings would be 
significantly below brokers' estimates of around 80 cents a share. 
Goodyear shares fell today, sapping the Dow's attempt to rebuild 
from yesterdy's losses. Goodyear stock was down 2 7/8 at 54 3/4.

	New Home Construction Falls Sharply  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments,  
feeling the pinch of rising mortgage rates and shortages of skilled 
workers and some building materials, plunged in June to the lowest 
level in just over a year. The Commerce Department reported 
Wednesday that work began last month on 1.57 million units at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate, a drop of 5.6 percent from May. 
June's activity -- while still brisk -- marked the lowest level in 
housing starts since May 1998, when they were at 1.54 million. The 
overall decline in June reflected a 8.7 percent drop in the 
construction of single-family homes and came despite a 10 percent 
increase in apartment construction. New home construction was down 
or held steady in most parts of the country.

compared with $1.62 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the same 
period a year ago. The results were line with the expectations of

	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s operating  
company profits fell 9 percent in the second quarter as revenue 
fell because of currency fluctuations and the absence of businesses 
sold since last year. The maker of SnackWell's and Oreo cookies, 
Ritz crackers and other snacks and grocery products reported 
operating company profits in its April-June quarter slipped to $231 
million from $253 million a year earlier. Operating company profits 
exclude onetime items and expenses such as interest payments and 
taxes. Net income amounted to $65 million, or 24 cents per share, 
compared with a loss of $200 million, or 76 cents per share, a year 
ago. However, Nabisco took a $406 million restructuring charge in 
June 1998, depressing results for that quarter.

vehicles, vans and pickup trucks. The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration, which made the announcement today, launched 
the probe after receiving reports of performance problems on an 
array of GM vehicles manufactured in the 1990s. Currently, the 
agency has on file 10,861 reports of brake problems on General 
Motors S and T trucks, which included reports of 2,111 crashes and 
293 injuries. The vehicles under investigation include the 1991-97 
Chevrolet Blazer, GMC Jimmy and the Oldsmobile Bravada sport 
utility vehicles; the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma, Cyclone and 
Typhoon pickup trucks; and the 1992-95 Chevrolet and GMC Suburban

``iBook'' borrows from the playful, unusual design of the popular 
iMac desktop computers that Apple introduced last summer: Priced at 
$1,599, the iBook comes in two fruity colors, blueberry and 
tangerine. And in contrast to the boxier shape of most laptop 
computers, it is rounded at the edges. It also has a pullout handle 
for carrying it around without a protective suitcase. Apple stock

good move for Toys R Us right now.'' Toys R Us stock was unchanged

<HEADLINE> Albert Belle Voids No-Trade Clause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle has voided the no-trade clause in  
his five-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles, who no longer 
covet the idea of hanging onto the moody outfielder for a minimum 
of three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's $65 million contract includes a three-year clause  
barring him from being traded. He apparently lifted the ban soon 
after the Orioles learned of a June 4 incident in which he 
allegedly made obscene gestures to fans in the bleachers at Camden 
Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago White Sox manager Jerry Manuel recently told Chicago  
reporters that Belle informed him of his decision to renounce the 
trade clause. The (Baltimore) Sun, citing unidentified club 
sources, reported Belle's decision Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles didn't comment and Belle's agent, Arn Tellem, did  
not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Any team acquiring Belle would have to assume a large part of a  
contract that includes $12 million in deferred money. And, as the 
Orioles have learned, there's more to Belle than mere hitting and 
fielding. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Euro Up Again Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The euro strengthened against the dollar for a  
third straight day Wednesday, rising above $1.05 for the first time 
in more than five weeks and extending its gains to 4 percent since 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound raised hopes in Europe that the anemic regional  
currency has finally reversed its plunge toward parity with the 
dollar. Still, economists cautioned that the euro's impressive 
performance since flirting with a record low on Monday is not 
sufficient proof of a permanent recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro rose to $1.0530 in late trading Wednesday in New York  
from $1.0413 late Tuesday. During trading Monday, the euro slid as 
low as $1.0108, matching an all-time low reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell against the yen in markets that have become  
skittish over repeated intervention by the Bank of Japan. Japan's 
central bank has frequently bought dollars in an attempt to keep 
the yen from growing so strong that it will derail an economic 
recovery from a deep recession. The dollar finished at 118.10 yen 
Wednesday in New York compared with 118.95 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has bounced back following signs of  
better-than-expected economic growth in Germany and hints that the 
European Central Bank might raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think that it's probably bottomed out,'' said David Kern,  
chief economist at National Westminster Bank Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Several analysts were not ready to declare a recovery for the  
euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to say that just yet. Confidence in the  
euro is still not fully repaired,'' said Lee Ferridge, chief 
currency strategist for Rabobank of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it serves as little more than an accounting unit, 11  
European countries launched the euro with great fanfare on Jan. 4, 
when it rose as high as $1.1886 during its first day of trading, a 
level it has since been unable to match. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was promoted as a symbol of regional cooperation and  
ultimate political unity. Participating countries plan to introduce 
actual euro-based notes and coins for everyday use in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But the euro began lurching downward almost as soon as it  
debuted on world financial markets, plummeting almost 15 percent. 
Many traders predicted its imminent slide to parity with the dollar 
-- a psychological barrier that analysts said could trigger a 
further selloff by frightened investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Parker, chief economist for The Royal Bank of Scotland,  
said the euro began to reverse course late Monday after an 
unidentified corporation placed a large order for euros. Other 
traders, who had been betting on even bigger declines, felt the 
need to buy the currency to limit losses or lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the euro's rise gained steam after Germany's Ifo  
institute released data indicating that the business climate in 
Europe's biggest economy was better than expected. Other 
encouraging signs of German growth, together with last week's 
suggestions from the European Central Bank that it might tighten 
lending rates, also bolstered the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates in Europe would make returns more attractive on  
investments denominated in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the improving economic outlook we see for the second half  
of the year, the euro should remain stronger against the dollar,'' 
Parker said. ``I personally believe it could be touching $1.10 by 
the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferridge agreed that the euro's recent surge reflected  
underlying economic trends and wasn't just a short-term aberration. 
The announcement Tuesday that the U.S. trade deficit swelled in May 
to a new record of $21.3 billion helped weaken the dollar and buoy 
the euro further. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's started playing catch-up with the fundamental background  
that started improving a few weeks ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kern of National Westminster said there still are obstacles that  
could stymie growth in Europe and hold down the euro, such as 
Europe's rigid labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some weakness in the euro is justified but nothing like the  
scale of the weakness that we saw,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's performance against the yen has been buffeted by  
Japan's determination to keep an economic recovery effort alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Haruhiko Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs at  
Japan's Ministry of Finance, said Wednesday that Japan is ``always 
ready'' to keep the yen from strengthening before the economy 
recovers. A stronger yen discourages sales of Japanese exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker said Japanese authorities probably won't let the yen  
appreciate beyond 118 per dollar, due to concern about a 
``premature'' strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, as Japanese markets were closed for a holiday, the  
Bank of Japan asked the Federal Reserve to buy dollars in an 
intervention that sent the yen lower. On Wednesday, Kuroda 
confirmed that the Bank of Japan had intervened again. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5258  
Swiss francs, down from 1.5415 a day earlier; and 1.5001 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4913 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound rose to $1.5778 from late Tuesday's quote of  
$1.5689. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are  
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8574  
German marks, down from 1.8783; and 6.2305 French francs, down from 
6.3012.

<HEADLINE> Basset Reaches Deal on Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASSETT, Va. (AP) - Bassett Furniture Industries Inc. agreed to  
pay a $575,000 fine and undertake $1.6 million in pollution 
prevention projects in a settlement reached Wednesday with the 
Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The company violated the limits of particulate pollution at two  
plants, a complaint filed Wednesday in federal court in Danville 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA has issued five notices of violation to the company  
since April 1997, EPA spokeswoman Donna Heron said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the penalty, Basset agreed to follow an  
environmental management plan and to spend $1.6 million on 
supplemental environmental projects not otherwise required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassett said it has worked closely with the EPA on the projects  
to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our stated goals is to take a leadership role in the  
area of environmental compliance. Our work with the EPA over the 
last two years has taken the company a long way toward meeting that 
goal,'' said Rob Spilman, the company's president and chief 
operating officer.

<HEADLINE>  Five AL Umps Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some baseball umpires are breaking ranks with  
their union after deciding not to quit, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Five American League umpires have changed their minds and won't  
resign, and 13 umps never quit to begin with, a high-ranking 
baseball official told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, union head Richie Phillips said 57 of the 66  
unionized umpires had resigned, effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who never quit included 11 AL umpires, according to the  
official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified. Also, 
two NL umps never quit, according to union president Jerry 
Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean that as of now, only 48 of the 66 unionized  
umpires plan to resign: 34 of them in the NL and 14 in the AL. Two 
AL umpires were hired during the 1979 strike and are not members of 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball owners are prepared to accept the resignations of all  
umpires who quit, and hire new umpires. A statement from 
commissioner Bud Selig could come later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips didn't return phone calls to his office in  
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires, boxed in by a no-strike clause in a labor contract  
that expires on Dec. 31, decided to resign after concluding owners 
would lock them out next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Barnett, Jim Joyce, Dave Phillips, Rocky Roe and Dale  
Scott are the umpires who rescinded their resignations, according 
to another high-ranking baseball official. Barnett, in his 31st 
year, is the senior umpire in the major leagues, and Phillips, in 
his 29th season, is tied for third in seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Davey Phillips is protecting a disability claim and Larry  
Barnett is doing the same,'' said Crawford, an NL umpire in his 
23rd season. ``Jim Joyce, I spoke to him today. He just re-thought 
his position, that maybe he should have thought this out a little 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford said the two NL umpires who have not resigned were Mark  
Hirschbeck and Greg Bonin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been able to get the information to them,''  
Crawford said. ``Until they tell me they're not going to sign it, 
my feeling is these guys will eventually sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford insisted the union was strong despite the defections  
and little sympathy from fans, who booed umpires in several cities 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about public opinion. Public opinion is not what  
we're after,'' Crawford said. ``What we're after is protecting the 
rights we bargained for over the past 21 years, that's what we're 
doing. We're never going to win a popularity contest with the 
public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some umpires said they heard rumors some of their colleagues had  
change their minds, possibly to protect claims related to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're out to protect themselves. They're thinking of  
themselves,'' said Rick Reed, one of the AL umpires who has 
resigned. ``In that light, we wouldn't think any worse of them at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips held another conference call with minor league umpires,  
whom he is trying to organize. While there were reports they would 
strike on Friday, no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation, the Gulf Coast League sent a memorandum to team  
business managers telling them to have replacement umpires on hand 
Friday. The replacements would get $40 per game if they are not 
used, $95 per game if they are used. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said that if replacements could not be found, a coach  
should call balls and strikes from behind the mound, and that a 
coach or player not in the game should work the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulf Coast League president Tom Saffell declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Pat O'Conner, a vice president of the minor leagues' governing  
body, the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, 
said similar memos have been sent by all minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have in place ... a pool of substitute umpires,'' he said.  
``We're just beefing that replacement pool and getting them pretty 
much on standby ... if our guys decide they're not going to come to 
work.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Wants New Nuclear Labs Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY JOHN DIAMOND   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Wednesday to place  
responsibility for nuclear weapons development and security under a 
new agency that would bypass the Energy Department bureaucracy and 
report directly to Secretary Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 96-1 on an amendment to a bill reauthorizing  
government intelligence programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson had indicated he could support the reorganization,  
which leaves ultimate responsibility for the weapons programs 
within the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans overcame initial Democratic resistance after  
lawmakers reached compromises that added to the energy secretary's 
authority for overseeing the newly created agency, dubbed the 
Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, tacked on to a still-pending intelligence  
authorization bill, stems from widespread concern over alleged 
espionage at U.S. nuclear weapons labs, which fall under the 
Department of Energy's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional committees, as well as a Clinton  
administration-sponsored commission study, have concluded that 
blurry lines of authority between the labs and the department 
allowed widely known security concerns to be ignored for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got a structure that addresses accountability in  
the weapons labs,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the 
sponsors of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said in a statement it wanted to examine the  
final version of the bill before throwing in its support. 
</P>
<P>
	``If language is adopted that would undermine Secretary  
Richardson's ability to effectively manage the department, 
including efforts to reorganize the department's handling of 
counterintelligence and broader security matters, the secretary of 
energy would recommend that the president veto the bill,'' the 
White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has not yet considered similar legislation but some  
members there have said they would favor even stronger legislation, 
establishing an agency with greater independence, similar to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	And House committee leaders with jurisdiction over intelligence,  
military and scientific matters have said they want the bill to be 
freestanding, not part of broader legislation on other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., pushed for changes that would give  
Richardson and his successors greater authority over the new 
agency, which would be charged with research and development of 
nuclear weapons as well as counterintelligence and security at the 
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most were accepted, helping pave the way for the near-unanimous  
vote, and Levin said that will improve the chances that a bill will 
ultimately be sent to the White House and signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't have a strong healthy consensus over here, it  
seems to me we are in a much weaker position in getting this law 
actually passed in the House and signed by the president,'' Levin 
said.

<HEADLINE> Hawking Awaits Unified Theory Proof </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTSDAM, Germany (AP) -- Stephen Hawking remains confident that  
physicists will prove string theory -- a so-called ``theory of 
everything'' to explain the universe -- but said today it might take 
longer than he had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's best-known physicist, who was attending a conference  
on string theory, revised his prediction in the 1980s that there 
was a 50-50 chance the theory would be proven in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we have made great progress in the last 20 years, we  
don't seem much nearer to our goal,'' he said. Hawking's odds on 
proving the theory are the same, but he now says it could take 
another 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	If proven, string theory would unite the two main theories of  
physics: Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum 
theory. Scientists hope it will unlock the mysteries of black holes 
and the origins of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The weeklong annual conference, this year called ``Strings  
'99,'' is being held in Germany for the first time. The host is the 
Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics -- also known as the 
Albert Einstein Institute -- in the city of Potsdam, on the 
outskirts of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference site is just down the road from Einstein's summer  
home, where he spent his last years in Germany pondering a unifying 
theory for physics. The scientist never returned to his native 
country after an overseas trip in 1932, because friends warned him 
of the dangers he faced as a Jew under Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	Einstein continued work on a unified theory later at Princeton  
University, but never found a solution. In fact, said Hawking, a 
unified theory may not have a solution that is applicable all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be no theory that can be applied in different  
situations, just as there is no map that covers the entire world,'' 
he said, speaking through a computer attached to his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawking holds the Cambridge University post once held by Sir  
Isaac Newton and is the author of ``A Brief History of Time.'' Now 
57, he has suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, since his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing back at critics who say a unified theory will serve only  
scientists, Hawking said there will be a tangible benefit in 
solving humankind's deepest mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't understand the origin of the universe or why we are  
here,'' he said. ``A complete unified theory might not bring much 
material benefit, but it would answer that age-old question.''

<HEADLINE> Kramer Looks for Work in San Diego </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A year and a half after spurning the Chargers,  
quarterback Erik Kramer is back in San Diego looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, stunned by his dismissal from the Chicago Bears on  
Tuesday, was scheduled to take a physical exam either late 
Wednesday evening or early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers want to sign either Kramer or Neil O'Donnell by the  
start of training camp Friday morning to add to their mix of Jim 
Harbaugh, deposed starter Ryan Leaf and Craig Whelihan. 
</P>
<P>
	If San Diego signs Kramer, he would join fellow Bears castoff  
Harbaugh. The Bears released Harbaugh on March 16, 1994, less than 
a month after signing Kramer as a free agent from Detroit. If it's 
O'Donnell, he'll be joining the team that upset his Pittsburgh 
Steelers in the AFC championship game on Jan. 15, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, the Chargers say the starting job is  
Harbaugh's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to put ourself in position that if anything did  
happen to another quarterback, we'd have another way to go,'' 
general manager Bobby Beathard said. ``We want the young guys to 
come along, too. But we'd like someone who's been there and has 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers meet one of Kramer's key criteria. Asked Tuesday in  
Chicago where he'd be going, he said without hesitation: ``To any 
team that plays the Bears twice, or anyplace that plays them at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears visit San Diego on Nov. 21. Chicago (4-12) and San  
Diego (5-11) finished last in their respective divisions in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer's stay in Chicago was marked by injuries. He started the  
first four games of the 1996 season but a neck injury kept him out 
the rest of the year. Then there were shoulder and knee injuries 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers had hoped to have Kramer in for a physical  
Wednesday morning, but his flight was delayed, Beathard said. 
Tennessee is also known to be after O'Donnell, and Beathard didn't 
know if the Chargers would lose the chance to continue talks with 
him while waiting for the results of Kramer's physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard said he's gotten over being spurned by Kramer while he  
was testing the free agent market in early 1998. Kramer ended up 
staying with the Bears. A week later, Stan Humphries retired rather 
than risk suffering any more concussions, leaving the Chargers 
without an established veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were actually laughing about it,'' Beathard said. ``He  
wanted a guarantee that we wouldn't draft a quarterback. I said, 
`We can't give you that guarantee.' We were disappointed we lost 
him. Now that he's available, we won't let our disappointment from 
then interfere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers made a big deal with Arizona to move up one spot in  
the 1998 draft in order to take Leaf with the second pick. Given an 
$11.25 million signing bonus, Leaf was a bust on the field and a 
problem off it, forcing the Chargers to shop for veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Geep Chryst, San Diego's offensive coordinator-quarterbacks  
coach, could help smooth the way for Kramer. He was on Chicago's 
staff during Kramer's first two seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence in Eric comes from the fact that he made a lot  
of plays for us when we were in Chicago and was a quality leader. 
Since that time he's been banged up. It's a matter now of due 
diligence, I guess, in finding out where the shoulder is at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, 34, led the Bears in passing last season despite missing  
the last eight games. He completed 60 percent of his passes for 
1,823 yards and nine touchdowns. He threw for 10,582 yards and 63 
touchdowns in five years with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers coach Mike Riley said Harbaugh wasn't concerned with  
the possibility of adding another veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``His deal with the whole thing is, whatever can help make this  
team better, he's all for it,'' Riley said.

<HEADLINE> Burton Want Fund-Raiser Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dan Burton, leading an investigation of  
campaign fund-raising abuses, asked two federal judges Wednesday to 
delay sentencing of two former Democratic fund raisers until 
Congress can obtain their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on Government  
Reform, said that once Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie and John Huang are 
sentenced, they would have no incentive to cooperate with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie pleaded guilty in May to campaign finance violations and  
agreed to cooperate in a Justice Department investigation of 
illegal Asian donations to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang was arraigned in June on a conspiracy charge as part of a  
plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton wrote U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. in Little  
Rock, Ark. that, ``The committee is continuing an active 
investigation of Mr. Trie and continues to turn up new leads. The 
committee should have an opportunity to explore these matters with 
Mr. Trie prior to sentencing when it is most likely that Mr. Trie 
will cooperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton wrote U.S. District Judge Richard A. Paez, in Los  
Angeles, that Huang ``has never cooperated with the committee's 
investigation. If you delay Mr. Huang's sentencing until the 
committee has had the opportunity to question him, it would 
substantially increase the likelihood of Mr. Huang's truthful 
cooperation with the committee.''

<HEADLINE> Other Areas Rival Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- When Disney Co. executive Laurie  
McCartney decided to break away and launch her own Internet 
company, she didn't bother looking for office space in the Silicon 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I wanted to be in L.A.,'' she said. ``And it's actually  
easier to recruit good technical workers here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, that might have been a foolhardy decision. But  
these days, the Silicon Valley is facing fierce competition for its 
position as the heart of the Internet industry as regions from 
Seattle's ``Silicon Forest'' to New York's ``Silicon Alley'' tout 
tax incentives and their own well-educated work force to recruit 
companies away, a regional economic group warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney said her eStyle online shopping company is benefitting  
from the Hollywood style and buzz, and that her employees like 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network shows the key  
factor Internet executives use for choosing a location is access to 
a talented pool of employees. And while the Silicon Valley is home 
to almost 500,000 well educated and motivated high tech workers, it 
is also suffering a major work force shortage -- lacking about 
160,000 workers this year, Joint Venture said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regions, like Washington, D.C.'s ``Silicon Dominion'' and  
Austin's ``Silicon Hills,'' offer a more abundant work force with 
lower salary expectations, as well as a lower cost of living, less 
traffic and congestion and supportive local governments, said the 
group, whose focus is to maintain the region's economic vitality. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it currently holds a leadership position, Silicon Valley  
faces significant pressures which may threaten its status as the 
hub of the Internet industry,'' said Ben Smith, a principal at A.T. 
Kearney's Silicon Valley management consulting office. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, San Jose-based Adobe Systems, Inc., a computer  
graphics company, cut 350 jobs in San Jose and Scotland, but 
announced plans to expand its Seattle operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Skorny, senior director of Adobe Internet Products, said  
they opted for the so-called Silicon Forest ``to draw from the 
extensive pool of Internet talent in the Pacific Northwest 
corridor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it was Texas, not California, that led high-tech employment  
growth between 1990 and 1996, according to a recent study by the 
American Electronics Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The state added 70,000 jobs during that period, many of them in  
Austin, which has emerged as a hotbed for high tech startups due in 
part to the tremendous success of Dell Computer. In addition, 
Austin offers Internet companies reduced utility rates, a ``fast 
track'' permit and inspection process, and publicly funded research 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities also offer perks to the high-tech industry: the  
Boston Office of Business Development supports small companies, New 
York City helped 170 technology companies lease wired space via the 
Plug 'N Go program, and Los Angeles grants tax breaks to multimedia 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzalez said he's working to improve  
traffic, education and housing costs in the Silicon Valley to 
remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an economy here that is envied around the world,'' he  
said. ``But we can't rest with that. We must continue to adapt and 
innovate in order to lead the digital world into the next 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the pressures, many Silicon Valley leaders said they  
wouldn't consider leaving the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the work ethic, the culture,'' said Rod Schrock, CEO of  
AltaVista Co., an Internet search engine company based in Palo 
Alto, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, after AltaVista was bought by Compaq Computer Corp.,  
Schrock considered relocating the company before a major expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed,'' he said. ``Only in the Silicon Valley can you  
galvanize an organization to do great things, put out an all-out 
effort to succeed, without limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pradeep Jotwani, a senior vice president at Hewlett-Packard,  
made a similar decision recently with one of his divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly have more talent drain in this area than we do in  
Idaho or Colorado, where we also have facilities,'' he said. ``But 
the talent here has this mindset that you can't find elsewhere. I 
was concerned that in a different locale they just wouldn't be as 
aggressive.''

<HEADLINE> 5-Year-Old Shot by Brother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PARK, Fla. (AP) -- A 6-year-old boy fatally shot his  
5-year-old brother Wednesday as the boys played with a shotgun they 
found in their grandparents' bedroom, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Andrew Wilson was pronounced dead at his grandparents' home  
in this West Palm Beach suburb, according to the Palm Beach County 
Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	His older brother, whose name was not released, admitted to his  
father and then to police he accidentally fired the shotgun, said 
Paul Miller, a sheriff's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kid or kids found the gun underneath a bed in the master  
bedroom, brought the gun in the back bedroom,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys and a 4-year-old brother were being cared for by their  
grandmother, who was watching television at the time of the 
shooting, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't intend to shoot his brother. He's very distraught,''  
Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Triple-A Umps Ready for Majors Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More major league umpires changed their minds  
Wednesday about resigning. And even though their Triple-A 
counterparts were ready to step in, it was too early to say how 
many would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 8-10 more umpires may be withdrawing their  
resignations, two baseball officials said, but umpires said 
baseball may be exaggerating the number to sway wavering umps. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NL umpires have changed their minds about resigning, said  
NL umpire Bruce Froemming, a union board member. Wally Bell's 
reversal was received by the National League on Wednesday and 
rookie umpire Jeff Nelson told the league his will be arriving 
shortly, one baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	A top minor league official said Triple-A umpires decided they  
would work major league games if they are called up. However, they 
were being pressured not to work, according to Pat O'Conner, a vice 
president of the governing body of the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to get them to change their minds,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union head Richie Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford  
said they had no knowledge of any pressure attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was reacting to ``recent bashing by the media, jeering  
from irate fans, continued stonewalling from management and the 
union's own internal turmoil,'' Crawford issued a four-word 
statement: ``What else is new?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had turmoil,'' Crawford said later in San  
Francisco. ``We've always had fans against us. We've always had 
baseball management against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two top baseball officials, speaking on the condition they not  
be identified, said baseball was told more withdrawals of 
resignations were on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-three of the 66 unionized major league umpires quit last  
week, effective Sept. 2, but five are known to have changed their 
minds. Ten more defections would mean at least one-third are intent 
on staying, although Phillips said additional resignations will be 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming, a union board member, said Phillips had become the  
issue for some umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become personal,'' Froemming said. ``We're not  
divided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig hasn't set any deadlines for umpires to  
withdraw their resignations, but one aide said Selig will announce 
his plans Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig is prepared to accept resignations and hire new umps,  
several baseball officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several AL umpires who voted in March against giving Phillips a  
new contract have renewed calls to replace him, but the majority 
still backs him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That group was there long before March,'' Phillips said.  
``That group existed for at least five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has attempted to organize minor league umpires and has  
held a series of telephone conference calls, with another scheduled 
for Friday. While there had been a threat of a Friday walkout in 
the minors, no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll give the National Association ample time to  
prepare,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, the National Association of Professional Baseball  
Leagues, the minor leagues' governing body, has instructed its 
teams to have alternate umpires at games. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league umpires, bound by a no-strike clause, decided on  
the resignations because they fear owners will lock them out after 
their labor contract expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bud said it's sad,'' Froemming said. ``What's sad is that  
baseball doesn't have enough respect to address a situation that 
they know was coming. ... It looks like they want a war, for 
whatever reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Froemming disputed the claim that Triple-A umps had  
voted to work major league games if asked to. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a very confusing vote,'' Phillips said, adding that  
a new ballot was under way.

<HEADLINE> Flood Cooled Atmosphere in Ice Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Global warming sometimes can lead to cold weather, researchers  
said today in a report that outlines how a giant flood can trigger 
a worldwide freeze in a matter of decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say that as the glaciers melted at the end of the Ice  
Age, so much cold fresh water gushed into the North Atlantic 8,200 
years ago that it cooled the atmosphere for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The cold spell has been well known to researchers, but its cause  
was a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	The flood scenario, described in today's issue of the journal  
Nature, demonstrates how global warming can, paradoxically, provoke 
a global freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	If a modern glacier such as the Greenland Ice Sheet melts as a  
result of rising temperatures in the next century, it could trigger 
a similar flood and climate fluctuation, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, that's the interest here,'' said Richard Alley, a  
climate expert at Penn State University. ``We've been pretty lucky, 
the climate hasn't varied much in 8,000 years. But could the big 
changes come back?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study by University of Colorado and Canadian researchers  
examines evidence of a huge flood in the Hudson Bay region of 
Quebec and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered parts of North America with ice  
up to 2 miles thick for more than a million years. As it retreated 
toward the poles, the ice sheet left in its wake at least two lakes 
containing more water than the Great Lakes combined. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Hudson Bay, ice held the water in place like a plug in a  
bathtub. But when the plug finally melted, trillions of gallons 
gushed into the Labrador Sea, shooting out at 100 times the rate 
water leaves the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent research showed the temperature dropped  
significantly within several hundred years of the flood. But nobody 
could pinpoint if these two events were connected, said the study's 
lead author, University of Colorado geologist Don Barber. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence linking the temperature drop to the flood includes  
radiocarbon dating of clams in the flood sediment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic Gulf Stream normally acts like a conveyor belt to  
deliver warm tropical water to temperate regions. By adding so much 
fresh water in such a short time, the flood shut down the Gulf 
Stream, Alley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in Greenland and Europe dropped by 6 to 15 degrees  
for at least 200 years, according to ice core data.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Criticized, Mourned on Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While much of the world paid tribute to John F.  
Kennedy Jr., some begged to differ and turned to the Internet to 
vent their anger over him, his family and government rescue 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``WHO CARES?'' asked a message posted by ``kleim'' on the site  
deja.com. ``If a family of four ordinary serf-class Americans would 
go down in the Atlantic, the Coast Guard would look for a few 
hours, with one helicopter, and declare them dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another observer sarcastically chastised the family of Robert F.  
Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s late uncle, in a note titled ``John-john's dead 
-- let's go sailing!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone else here think it was in poor taste -- to say the  
least -- for members of rfk's family (including ethel and rory) 
deciding to spend the day sailing, instead of staying secluded at 
the kennedy compound?!'' asked ``flycow'' -- who noted that the 
Kennedys ``did have the `mourning' ray-bans on, but none of them 
seemed to be too broken up!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was chastised by ``Angie'': ``Here here. I personally find  
sailing, and the water, very peaceful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A man named Bill Graham took a triple swipe at the Kennedys, the  
media coverage and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy ``is gone ... GET OVER IT!'' he wrote, expressing anger  
that ``massive public resources and my tax dollars are being spent 
with such reckless abandon to find a KENNEDY. ... And anyone who 
says that the Coast Guard, the FAA, the Navy et al would devote the 
assets and manpower to a search like this for some guy off the 
street is crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennedy-admiring ``Cindy'' didn't agree: ``Ah, I bet if this  
was the son of the (almost) late (NEVER) great, Ronald Reagan, 
you'd be singing a different tune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discussion was spread across the Web, including a mass  
chat-fest on America Online, where JUDE861 wrote that Kennedy ``DID 
NOTHING FOR ANYONE BUT HIM AND HE KILLED HIS WIFE AND SISTER WITH 
HIS POOR JUDGMENT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Objected ``DOLPHINSUE'': ``It was a horrible accident.''  
</P>
<P>
	And ``JACKJOVE'' concluded: ``They are all only human like the  
rest of us.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's June Trade Surplus Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell slightly  
in June from the same month last year, the government said 
Thursday. But the politically sensitive trade surplus with the 
United States rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported  
by Japan minus those imported, dropped 2.9 percent to 1.213 
trillion yen ($10.3 billion), the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus was in line with the average forecast of 1.180  
trillion yen ($10 billion) by Tokyo-based economists surveyed by 
Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus with the United States bucked the overall  
trend, increasing 18.2 percent to 655 billion yen ($5.55 billion), 
the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, fighting its worst recession in 50 years, has been under  
heavy pressure from the United States and other trading partners to 
rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak economy to spark demand 
for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	June marked the third straight month of year-on-year decline in  
the overall surplus. In May, it dropped 31.5 percent from the year 
before, while in April it decreased 12.6 percent on year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of this year, Japan's imports fell  
faster than exports, reflecting weak demand amid the recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen helped push exports down 8.9 percent, but  
didn't help boost imports, which tumbled 9.2 percent. The dollar 
averaged 118.30 yen for the first six months, down from 131.11 yen 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, a stronger yen tends to hurt exports because it makes  
Japanese products more expensive abroad and lessens the value of 
dollar revenue. It should have the opposite effect on imports into 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first six months of the year, exports to the United  
States fell 6.8 percent after six straight terms of rises. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports of most products to America dropped, with the exception  
of automobiles, which have been growing continuously since the 
latter half of 1996, according to a Finance Ministry official 
briefing reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unlikely that exports or the trade surplus would rise  
further, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the month of June, steel exports to the United States  
continued their plunge, falling 59.2 percent to 16.25 billion yen 
($138 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's exports to Asia rose for the first time in 18 months,  
reflecting a pickup in the region's economy. The trade surplus with 
Asia grew for the first time in five months to 398 billion yen 
($3.4 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 23 percent  
from the previous year to reach the second highest total ever 
recorded.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A memorial Mass for John F. Kennedy Jr. and his  
wife will be celebrated Friday in the Roman Catholic church where 
his mother used to pray, and President Clinton and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton plan to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 a.m. service for JFK Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy, ``will be closed to the public and the press -- it is for 
friends and family only,'' family spokesman Will Keyser said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be held in St. Thomas More Church on Manhattan's Upper  
East Side. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis worshipped there. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese  
of New York, said it was his understanding that the service would 
be a memorial Mass, not a funeral. Under Catholic doctrine a 
funeral Mass can only be celebrated if the remains of the deceased 
are present. Sources have indicated the Kennedy family may want a 
burial at sea for JFK Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only memorial service for Kennedy's sister in-law,  
Lauren Bessette, will be held Saturday evening at an Episcopal 
church in Greenwich, Conn. The ceremony will also include 
remembrances of Kennedy and his wife, but is meant especially for 
Ms. Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have tended to forget that she is a person in  
her own right,'' said Mary Marks, parish secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's mother, Ann Freeman, and stepfather, Dr. Richard  
Freeman, will attend, and Ms. Bessette's twin sister, Lisa Ann, is 
also expected to be there, Ms. Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials announced Wednesday that the bodies of  
Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law had been located off the coast 
of Martha's Vineyard. The plane piloted by Kennedy crashed Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Irish community planned a public memorial service For  
Thursday night at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is intended to supplement whatever service the family will  
arrange and perhaps accommodate mourners who might not otherwise 
have an opportunity to pay their respects,'' said Brian O'Dwyer, 
head of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center.

<HEADLINE>  Basque Separatists Mark Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Basque separatists celebrated the release  
from jail of 22 Basque leaders, saying the court ruling that led to 
their freedom today proved they had been political prisoners. The 
government insisted the ruling showed only that Spanish law is 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the imprisoned politicians came hours after the  
Constitutional Court overturned the Supreme Court verdict that sent 
them to jail on terrorism charges in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As leaders of Herri Batasuna, considered the political wing of  
the armed group ETA, they had been convicted on the terrorist 
charges and sentenced to seven years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has now been proven to be a clearly political verdict,''  
said spokesman Joseba Permach. 
</P>
<P>
	Permach spoke at one of the gatherings outside each of the four  
jails in northern Spain where the 22 separatist leaders had been 
imprisoned. Another Herri Batasuna leader also convicted in the 
case was released last year due to ill health. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokesman Josep Pique immediately rejected the  
suggestion that politics played a role in the leaders' 
imprisonment, insisting the Constitutional Court's decision showed 
``the rule of law works regardless of who you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Beirut, Lebanon, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar  
told reporters the government would respect the Constitutional 
Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The guilty verdicts and long sentences were praised by Spain's  
government and mainstream opposition parties but criticized from 
inside the restive northern Basque region. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the jailed Basque leaders is expected to boost  
the peace process that has accompanied ETA's 10-month cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has  
killed nearly 800 people in bombings and shootings since it began 
its violent campaign for an independent Basque state in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against the Herri Batasuna leadership stemmed from its  
use of free air time during Spain's 1996 election campaign to 
broadcast an ETA video in which masked gunmen proposed negotiating 
Basque self-determination with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitutional Court ruling quashed the convictions on the  
grounds that the statute under which the Herri Batasuna leadership 
was tried was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Since announcing the truce in September, ETA has met once with  
the government for a preliminary round of talks but there were no 
reports of progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A memorial Mass for John F. Kennedy Jr. and his  
wife will be celebrated Friday in the Roman Catholic church where 
his mother used to pray, and President Clinton and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton plan to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 a.m. service for JFK Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy, ``will be closed to the public and the press -- it is for 
friends and family only,'' family spokesman Will Keyser said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be held in St. Thomas More Church on Manhattan's Upper  
East Side. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis worshipped there. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese  
of New York, said it was his understanding that the service would 
be a memorial Mass, not a funeral. Under Catholic doctrine a 
funeral Mass can only be celebrated if the remains of the deceased 
are present. Sources have indicated the Kennedy family may want a 
burial at sea for JFK Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only memorial service for Kennedy's sister in-law,  
Lauren Bessette, will be held Saturday evening at an Episcopal 
church in Greenwich, Conn. The ceremony will also include 
remembrances of Kennedy and his wife, but is meant especially for 
Ms. Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have tended to forget that she is a person in  
her own right,'' said Mary Marks, parish secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's mother, Ann Freeman, and stepfather, Dr. Richard  
Freeman, will attend, and Ms. Bessette's twin sister, Lisa Ann, is 
also expected to be there, Ms. Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials announced Wednesday that the bodies of  
Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law had been located off the coast 
of Martha's Vineyard. The plane piloted by Kennedy crashed Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Irish community planned a public memorial service For  
Thursday night at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is intended to supplement whatever service the family will  
arrange and perhaps accommodate mourners who might not otherwise 
have an opportunity to pay their respects,'' said Brian O'Dwyer, 
head of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Pushes for Friday Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former hockey star Mario Lemieux wants to  
close on his deal to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins by Friday, 13 days 
before a deadline set by a judge, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz agreed July 14 to give  
Lemieux until Monday to finalize his proposal, including securing 
all the money from his investors. Markovitz said the deal must 
close within 10 days of receiving the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the support we've been receiving from the mayor and the  
Public Auditorium Authority, I don't think there's anything that 
could stop this deal now,'' Lemieux attorney Doug Campbell said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Friday is the  
goal for the closing, but next Wednesday might be more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who has put together a $50 million plan to buy the  
Penguins, is under pressure to complete the deal because the team 
must start selling season tickets and signing player contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is under protection from creditors, but Lemieux's  
proposal could remove it from court supervision. Besides coming up 
with the money, Lemieux also must reach final agreements with SMG 
Inc., the Penguins landlord at the Civic Arena, and broadcaster Fox 
Sports Net Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Lemieux attorneys met with Fox lawyers, who also are  
trying to meet the Friday goal. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG's attorney, Daniel Shapira, said the two sides are closer to  
an agreement. He called a Friday closing ``aggressive, but 
possible.''

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa went  
to a hospital for tests on his stomach Wednesday and missed a game 
against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests found that La Russa has nothing more severe than an  
irritated stomach, the Cardinals announced. He remained at Good 
Samaritan Hospital for observation Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa had tests on his stomach Monday and watched most of the  
Cardinals' 4-2 loss to Minnesota on Tuesday from the clubhouse. His 
stomach began bothering him again Wednesday morning after the team 
arrived in Cincinnati, Cardinals assistant publicity director Brad 
Hainje said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds team Dr. Timothy Kremchek arranged for more tests at Good  
Samaritan Hospital. The results matched those from Monday.

<HEADLINE> 3 Drug Cos. Report Higher Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Profits for three major drugmakers matched or beat Wall Street  
expectations Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough, maker of the top-selling antihistamine  
Claritin, and Eli Lilly, maker of the best-selling antidepressant 
Prozac, both had higher earnings than projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers Squibb matched analysts' profit estimates.  
</P>
<P>
	Here are the results:  

</P>
<P>
 *Bristol-Myers Squibb    	
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter profits rose 14 percent, driven by strong sales  
of its diabetes and cancer medications. The company overcame 
slowing sales of its cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol, its 
top-selling drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company earned $952 million, or 47 cents per  
share, up from $835 million, or 41 cents per share, in the same 
period a year ago. Results matched Wall Street expectations, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 11 percent to $4.92 billion from $4.43 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Taxol, a cancer drug, rose 19 percent to $362 million  
and Glucophage, an oral diabetes drug, rose 47 percent to $350 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pravachol sales rose just 5 percent in the second quarter to  
$380 million. The drug is losing market share to Warner-Lambert's 
Lipitor, which dominates the cholesterol drug market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers' beauty care sales, which include Clairol hair  
products, rose 4 percent to $626 million. Sales of nutrition 
products, including infant formula, rose 4 percent to $428 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, Bristol-Myers earned $2.02  
billion, or $1 per share, up from $1.76 billion, or 87 cents per 
share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 10 percent to $9.77 billion from $8.88 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers stock fell $1.37 1/2 to close at $70.12 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
 *Eli Lilly and Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Lilly's second-quarter profits rose a better-than-expected 17  
percent, driven by rebounding sales of the antidepressant Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis-based Lilly earned $576.4 million, or 52 cents per  
share, compared to $491.3 million, or 44 cents per share, during 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street estimates by one penny, according  
to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 9 percent to $2.34 billion from $2.16 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Prozac, the world's best-selling depression drug, rose 4 percent  
to $688.1 million, including a 7 percent jump in the United States. 
U.S. Prozac sales have been pushed higher by an intensified 
consumer advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first quarter, Prozac sales had fallen 4 percent, the  
first time the popular drug had experienced a sales decline. Prozac 
has steadily lost market share in recent years to newer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Zyprexa, an antipsychotic drug, rose 20 percent to  
$393.0 million in the latest quarter. Sales of Evista, an 
osteoporosis drug, rose 22 percent to $66.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the anticlotting medicine ReoPro rose 13 percent to  
$114.2 million. Lilly's partner in selling ReoPro, Centocor, 
announced Wednesday it is being bought by Johnson &AMP; Johnson in a 
$4.9 billion stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first half of 1999, Lilly's profit rose 19 percent to  
$1.20 billion, or $1.08 per share, from $1.01 billion, or 90 cents 
per share. Sales rose 8 percent in the six month period to $4.59 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly stock fell 81 1/4 cents to close at $73 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
 *Schering-Plough Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter profits rose a better-than-expected 20 percent,  
as sales of the antihistamine Claritin continued their climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough earned $547 million, or 37  
cents per share, up from $455 million, or 31 cents per share, in 
the same period a year ago. Results beat Wall Street estimates by 
one penny, according to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 15 percent to $2.45 billion from $2.12 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Claritin sales jumped 19 percent to $819 million, including a 22  
percent rise in the United States, where Claritin controls more 
than half the allergy market. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's animal health products rose 2 percent in the  
second quarter to $172 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's hepatitis C and cancer drugs rose 50 percent  
in the second quarter to $408 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first half of 1999, Schering-Plough's profit rose 20  
percent to $1.09 billion, or 73 cents per share, up from $905 
million, or 61 cents per share. Sales rose 15 percent to $4.64 
billion from $4.03 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough stock rose 12 1/2 cents to close at $52.75 on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Grissom's Capsule Back on Shore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- After 38 years at the bottom of the  
sea, Gus Grissom's Mercury capsule was brought ashore Wednesday on 
the anniversary of the flight that made him the second American in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings back a lot of emotion,'' said Lowell Grissom, the  
late astronaut's 65-year-old brother, who welcomed the salvage team 
back. ``This was the only craft that Gus didn't bring home, and he 
would be extremely pleased that Liberty Bell 7 is back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 arrived by ship at Cape Canaveral one day after  
being pulled from the Atlantic in remarkably good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom made a 15-minute suborbital flight aboard Liberty 7 on  
July 21, 1961, but the 7 1/2-foot aluminum and titanium capsule sank 
after splashdown when its hatch blew open prematurely and it filled 
with water. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom narrowly escaped drowning and insisted until his death  
in a 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he did nothing to cause the 
hatch to blow. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately financed salvage team did not find the capsule's  
hatch, which could have shed light on whether its explosive bolts 
malfunctioned or whether Grissom activated them prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a steel drum containing the capsule was lifted by  
crane onto the dock and opened. Through the capsule's open hatch 
could be seen dangling wires and a pile of corroded debris, along 
with gray and green fabric straps that held Grissom and his 
parachute in place during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is pleasure,'' Max Ary said as he sprayed water onto the  
capsule to keep the chunks of corrosion from hardening in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule will be taken to Ary's Kansas Cosmosphere and Space  
Center in Hutchinson, Kan. There, it will be taken apart, cleaned 
of salt and put on display. 
</P>
<P>
	Ary proudly showed off two of the seven Mercury dimes that were  
still inside the spacecraft. Grissom had taken them aboard as 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	Betty Grissom, the astronaut's widow, said once more that she is  
against the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one time we thought this was great, but how it's being  
handled is -- No,'' she said from her Houston home. ``This restoring 
is just out of control.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Scores Win in Divorce Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds scored a victory off the field  
Wednesday when the state Supreme Court granted a hearing on his 
attempt to enforce a premarital agreement that would deny his first 
wife a share of his baseball earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court ruled in April that the prenuptial  
agreement, signed the day before the marriage in 1988, was void 
because evidence showed that Sun Bonds hadn't voluntarily given up 
her right to half her husband's earnings during marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate court modified its ruling a month later and  
ordered a new trial during which Bonds could try to prove the 
agreement was voluntary, despite Mrs. Bonds' lack of legal advice 
and the pressure she faced to sign the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's high court, with votes of six of its seven  
justices, set the appellate ruling aside Wednesday and said it 
would hear the case at a future date. The ruling could set 
standards for challenges to premarital agreements in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Nachshin, a lawyer for the outfielder, predicted the  
court would find the agreement enforceable. ``This is a total 
vindication for Barry Bonds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige Wickland, a lawyer for Mrs. Bonds, disagreed. Noting that  
the court has agreed in a separate case to decide whether a woman 
can agree before marriage to give up the right to alimony, she said 
the Bonds case could establish safeguards for all premarital 
waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake in the case is half the money and property that Bonds  
accumulated during the six-year marriage, which started when he was 
a young outfielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates and ended when he 
was an $8 million-a-year star with the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Bonds, a Swedish immigrant, met Bonds in Montreal in 1987,  
when he was making $106,000. The day before their wedding in 
February 1988, she signed an agreement that all their earnings 
during the marriage would be held separately rather than as 
community property, which is divided equally at divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	After their divorce, a San Mateo County Superior Court judge  
ruled that Mrs. Bonds had understood the agreement and signed it 
voluntarily. But the 1st District Court of Appeal ruled 2-1 in 
April that the judge had failed to examine the agreement in light 
of the couple's ``unequal bargaining power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court noted that Bonds was accompanied to the meeting by two  
lawyers and a financial adviser, while his future wife, who spoke 
limited English, was accompanied only by a Swedish friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' agent told Sun before the meeting that there would be no  
wedding unless she signed, the court said. It said one of Bonds' 
lawyers told her she might want her own lawyer but no one mentioned 
the potential conflicts that might require one. The court also said 
the agreement was poorly written and difficult for a non-lawyer to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts must ``strictly scrutinize'' prenuptial agreements in  
which one side has no lawyer and no meaningful opportunity to get 
one, said the opinion by Justice James Lambden. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking state Supreme Court review, Bonds' lawyers said the  
appellate decision cast a cloud over valid premarital agreements 
and failed to defer to the findings of the trial judge, who had 
heard the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Bonds ``led everyone to believe she understood what she was  
agreeing to, that it reflected her wishes as well as Barry's, and 
that she was signing the agreement voluntarily,'' lawyer Richard 
Sherman wrote.

<HEADLINE> Sonics May Get Wizards' Richmond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics are talking to the  
Washington Wizards about a trade for all-star shooting guard Mitch 
Richmond, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unidentified sources, The News Tribune of Tacoma reported  
Tuesday that Richmond and his manager opened talks last week with 
the Sonics and several other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond is disenchanted with the Wizards because he suspects  
the team intends to wait to offer him a new contract until the 
eight teams with salary-cap space spend money on other players, 
leaving Richmond with no alternative but to accept a low offer from 
Washington, The News Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond is also considering Sacramento, for whom he played  
seven seasons before being traded to Washington, and Golden State, 
for whom he played his first three seasons, the newspaper reported. 
Other teams reportedly interested in acquiring Richmond include 
Miami, Indiana, the Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago Bulls and Orlando 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Chicago and Seattle have salary-cap space, giving them more  
flexibility. The other teams would have to work out a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rules of the new collective bargaining agreement,  
Richmond is what is a ``base-year-salary'' player. That means that 
while Richmond may sign a contract worth $11 million with 
Washington, the Sonics would only have to take back half of that in 
salary cap, or $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics are $3.5 million under the salary cap, which means  
they would have to free up $2 million more to be able to take on 
Richmond's new salary.

	Armstrong leads cycling's biggest race by 6 minutes, 15 seconds.  
He was 11th Wednesday in the last climbing stage and most likely 
will cross the finish line on the Champs Elysees in Paris on Sunday 
as the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think he's really strong and it's great,'' said Kelly,  
who met Armstrong two years ago while they both struggled through 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	She won't be in Austin as the race winds down, however. After  
helping Armstrong's foundation raise $17,000 with a radio charity 
drive, she discovered her neuroblastoma, which started as tumors 
behind her kidneys, had re-emerged. Kelly's family was forced to 
move her closer to her doctors in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	On the nights she spent in the hospital, which didn't carry the  
cable channels broadcasting the race, her doctor videotaped the 
footage for her to watch later. She is confident Armstrong will 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just crossing my fingers,'' Kelly said. ``And hoping.''  
</P>
<P>
	So are many people in Austin. Armstrong's bid to become only the  
second American to win the Tour de France has quietly captured the 
attention of the city where he lives and trains part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the hype surrounding Ricky Williams, the Heisman  
Trophy-winning running back from the University of Texas, there are 
no highway billboards urging Armstrong to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been a sudden rush on yellow jerseys, the signature  
shirt of the Tour leader. 
</P>
<P>
	But this city is a hotbed of amateur cyclists. And many are  
watching television, the Internet and the sports pages to see if 
the 27-year-old Armstrong can complete his astonishing comeback 
from testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After his 1996 diagnosis, he had two operations and underwent  
extensive chemotherapy. He began his comeback early last year and 
doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer will return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been following it like the Super Bowl. If I could afford  
to go to Paris, I would go,'' Austin resident Charlie Jones said. 
``I don't ride myself, but I have found myself at the bike shop 
looking at bikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Aust, manager of Freewheeling Bicycles, said interest in the  
race is greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance is a local hero,'' he said. ``The place where I go to  
breakfast, people are always asking me about Lance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which raises money to fight  
urological cancers, director Karl Haussmann spent Wednesday 
watching the race on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to get good live coverage or even taped coverage,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate interest in the foundation has skyrocketed as  
Armstrong charges toward Paris, he said. The foundation has been 
flooded by correspondence from cancer patients who have heard 
Armstrong's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those folks are just e-mailing like crazy. These people are so  
fired up by Lance's success,'' Haussmann said. ``A woman who just 
started chemo for breast cancer said she was motivated by what 
Lance was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Armstrong has hit the morning radio talk shows as  
well. Listeners hear as much about his looks as his ride through 
the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Lance. He's gorgeous,'' one female caller cooed on the  
radio Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Mayor Kirk Watson wants the city to honor Armstrong when  
the race is finished -- win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great things about Austin, we still feel like a  
small town,'' Watson said. ``This is one of our guys doing good. 
That's why everybody's talking about it. We've watched him through 
some highs and lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The city toasted Williams and the Texas football team with a  
downtown parade in January that drew thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do something special for Lance,'' Watson said. ``He's  
won as far as I'm concerned. I hope he's wearing the yellow jersey 
when it's all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Kelly, she might be wearing a shirt from Armstrong on  
Sunday. Since meeting him at a 1997 autograph session, Armstrong 
has given her T-shirts from various races. She sleeps in them every 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	He also gave her a bike.  
</P>
<P>
	``I used to ride a lot, but a lot of the times I've been tired.  
So I go fishing and drive a golf cart around,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Davidson welcomes the race as a respite from the rigors of  
Kelly's chemotherapy and blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a distraction and gives her a reason to keep going,'' the  
mother said. ``It's a big part of our life right now.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Sells Subsidiary for $940M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Ryder System Inc. will sell its public  
transportation services subsidiary to Britain's largest bus 
operator, FirstGroup PLC, for $940 million, the company announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidiary operates school bus transportation systems for  
public and private school districts. It also provides public 
transit contracting and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryder plans to use part of the proceeds to buy back some of its  
stock. The rest will go toward capital investment and working 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very positive development for both Ryder and  
FirstGroup,'' said M. Anthony Burns, Ryder's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows FirstGroup to enter the U.S. public sector  
transportation market with established, well-regarded businesses 
that are profitable market leaders,'' he added. ``For Ryder, this 
is another important step in the execution of our long-standing 
strategy to better focus our available capital resources to grow 
our integrated core businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryder's primary businesses are transportation and distribution  
logistics and truck leasing and rental. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale must be approved by U.S. regulators and FirstGroup  
shareholders. Officials expect the transaction to be completed in 
late summer or early fall.

<HEADLINE> New Stock Trading System Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In another challenge to the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
four major financial firms announced plans to launch an electronic 
stock trading system, which would give them a share of the booming 
online and after-hours stock trading business. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity Investments; Charles Schwab; Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;  
Jenrette; and Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg plan to pool their technology 
to create an electronic system to match buyers and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For any (electronic trading system) to really work, critical  
mass is extremely important,'' said Bob Mazzarella, president of 
Fidelity Brokerage Services. ``If you look at the players involved, 
we put together quite a robust group to provide that liquidity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, which has yet to be named, is expected to be up  
and running by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail and institutional clients may be able to buy and sell  
stocks and options after traditional markets have closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly gives us a platform to deal with after-hours  
trading,'' said Mazzarella, adding that no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, as well as other  
traditional exchanges, are under pressure to extend their trading 
day to allow investors in different time zones more access to the 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology that has allowed millions of people to trade online  
has spawned the creation of trading networks that link buyers and 
sellers, bypassing the traditional exchanges. Nine separate 
electronic trading firms have sprung up in the past few years, the 
largest being Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's top-name companies are all getting into the game.  
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Etrade, for example, own stakes in 
a trading network called Archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
	These trading systems, known as electronic communication  
networks, or ECNs, have already stolen away between 20 percent and 
25 percent of the trading volume from Nasdaq, Mazzarella said. 
About 1 billion shares are traded daily on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Nasdaq declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture will use the existing electronic trading  
system of Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, which is the nation's largest 
specialist and market-making firm in stocks and options. The 
trading system currently trades 20 million shares a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading volume on that exchange, however, should skyrocket with  
the addition of business from Charles Schwab, the San 
Francisco-based brokerage firm; DLJdirect, the online trading arm 
of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette; and Fidelity's Capital Markets 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Each company will own 25 percent of the new venture.  
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't be in this if we didn't believe we could have an  
impact on the business that will be going through this new ECN,'' 
Mazzarella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazzarella said he expects to get regulatory approval and be up  
and running by the end of the year. The firms focus on trading 
limit orders of Nasdaq listed stocks. A limit order is an order to 
buy or sell a security at a specific price, and protect customers 
from getting a bad deal.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Re-Sign Haley, Seek Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The 49ers re-signed defensive end  
Charles Haley on Wednesday and intensified their pursuit of 
Lawrence Phillips, the free-agent running back with a troubled 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working towards signing Lawrence,'' said general manager  
Bill Walsh, adding that director of football operations John McVay 
was in the midst of talks with Phillips' agent, Mitch Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had hours of conversation, negotiations and exchanges,''  
Walsh added. ``We're hopeful but it's certainly not completed. My 
personal feeling is that Lawrence wants to play here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said the 49ers hope to have some kind of resolution in the  
next 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, which has lost running back Garrison Hearst  
indefinitely due to complications from a broken left ankle, is 
vying with Buffalo and Green Bay for Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips's inconsistent play and off-field problems cost him  
jobs with the Rams and Dolphins. He drew renewed interest from NFL 
teams after a trouble-free campaign in NFL Europe, where he was the 
first player ever to rush for 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley, one of the league's premier pass rushers the only player  
to win five Super Bowl rings, was signed to a four-year contract 
worth $5.6 million, including a $1.2 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Haley, who quit football in 1996 because of back  
problems, abruptly ended his two-year retirement when the 49ers 
asked him to come back and play for them during the playoffs. He 
performed surprisingly well and the 49ers, Carolina and Washington 
sought to sign him for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley said familiarity was one of the main factors in his  
decision to return to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to be around people that I knew, so I wouldn't  
have to reinvent the wheel,'' Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added he was grateful to Walsh and coach Steve Mariucci for  
giving him another chance with the 49ers after his first tenure 
ended with his 1992 trade to Dallas following clashes with coaches 
and teammates alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get these opportunities many times in life. They've  
put a lot of confidence in me and I'm not going to let them down,'' 
Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers plan to use him as a situational pass rusher, much as  
they did in two playoff games last season. Mariucci said Haley's 
work during training camp will be limited because the team wants to 
make sure he'll be fresh for the start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley, noting his own past problems, said Phillips also deserved  
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with Lawrence. I think if he comes here,  
he'll be a great asset,'' Haley said. ``In society, we like to 
judge too quickly. Everybody should get a second chance, a third 
chance and maybe even a fourth chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh acknowledged there was an element of risk in pursuing  
Phillips. He said the team has received some negative feedback from 
fans and ticket holders upset the club would consider signing a 
player with a history of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' criminal offenses include slapping a woman who  
wouldn't dance with him at a Florida nightclub and dragging a 
former girlfriend down a flight of stairs by her hair while at 
Nebraska. He reportedly has become religious and has quit drinking.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Earnings Fall 26 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Exxon Corp. reported today second-quarter  
earnings declined 26 percent because of a drop in profits at its 
refining operations and depressed natural gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest oil company earned $1.21 billion, or 49  
cents per share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 65 cents per 
share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were line with the expectations of analysts surveyed  
by First Call Corp. Exxon stock was up 6 1/4 cents at $78 in afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's revenue was $29.42 billion, compared to $29.37 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the price of crude oil recovered during the quarter  
from 20-year lows, Exxon was unable to translate that gain into 
higher profits because it could not raise the prices it charges for 
its refined products as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Refining and marketing earnings in the United States fell to  
$124 million from $226 a year earlier. Outside the United States, 
refining and marketing earnings dropped to $34 million from $412 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon was also hurt by a drop in natural gas prices, which fell  
in the United States and overseas. Outside North America, the 
company reported natural gas prices were down 16 percent from a 
year ago, and at their lowest level in over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company did report an increase in exploration and  
production earnings, which rose to $269 million in the United 
States from $187 million last year. Overseas, exploration and 
production earnings came to $500 million, an increase of $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemicals earnings fell to $274 million from $295 million,  
partly because of lower commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Exxon earned $2.23  
billion, or 91 cents per share, vs. $3.4 billion, or $1.38 per 
share in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month revenues were $56.3 billion vs. $59.3 billion during  
the same period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Enjoys Media Focus on Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- News conferences such as Wednesday's  
70-minute, wide-ranging session were few and far between last year 
when the Monica Lewinsky sex and impeachment scandal was Topic A. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that wonkier topics are in the news -- taxes, Medicare,  
China-Taiwan relations -- President Clinton is happily back before 
the microphones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The questions you're asking on a regular basis are the issues  
that we're working on,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
earlier. Lockhart agreed that such sessions were rare during the 
scandal and impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president enjoys press conferences ... but there  
are just times where they're not necessarily the most productive 
thing to do,'' Lockhart said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's name did not come up Wednesday. Instead, Clinton  
talked at length about his hopes for peace and stability in a 
variety of hot spots around the world, plugged the political 
aspirations of Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
and mused fondly about John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Clinton's tone was good-humored and  
thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's news conference is part of the White House plan to  
hold such events every four to six weeks, Lockhart said. Clinton 
held a similar session last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has seemed to enjoy other recent question-and-answer  
sessions. He faced the press twice during Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak's recent visit to Washington, each time mixing foreign 
policy with jocularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made reporters laugh Tuesday when he paused after  
leaving the podium during a brief Rose Garden appearance, then 
agreeably strode back to take another question. 
</P>
<P>
	Head cocked but his back partly turned, Clinton listened as a  
reporter shouted the question about a holdup in Senate 
consideration of a nuclear test ban treaty. After thinking a 
moment, Clinton turned and grinned as he returned to the 
microphones. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the same playfulness was on display Wednesday, as  
Clinton expansively told reporters he would miss them when he 
leaves office after the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the event began, Clinton gave a joking response to a  
reporter's complaint that bright lights overhead in the White House 
East Room made it difficult to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting a long time for the halo to appear,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the news conference ended, Clinton left the White  
House for a golf game. As always, a few reporters and photographers 
were in tow.

<HEADLINE> Earnings Fall at United, American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The parent companies of United Airlines and American Airlines  
reported Wednesday their second-quarter earnings fell as lower 
ticket prices eroded profits. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways Group Inc. also saw its earnings fall, due to higher  
labor costs as well as cheaper fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Trans World Airlines Inc. reported a bigger-than-expected loss  
in the quarter as labor troubles and a threat of a strike scared 
travelers away. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
                             *UAL Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The parent company of United Airlines and Shuttle by United  
reported its operating earnings on a fully distributed basis fell 
to $349 million, or $2.86 a share, from $418 million, or $3.24 a 
share, in the year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fully distributed earnings assume shares owed to employees who  
control a majority stake in the carrier are distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings for the nation's largest airline exceeded Wall  
Street expectations of $2.66 a share, according to a survey of 
analysts by First Call Corp. But analysts had lowered their 
estimates last month after UAL said it would earn between $2.40 and 
$2.80 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL's stock rose $1.56 1/4 to $64.06 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 2.2 percent to $4.54 billion from $4.44 billion as  
a summer air fare sale helped boost ticket sales. The Elk Grove 
Village, Ill.-based carrier launched a fare war after seeing 
passenger traffic decline in late April and May. 
</P>
<P>
	While the airline sold a greater number of tickets, it had a  
lower profit margin because of the reduced fares, and that hurt its 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the increased business from the fare sale helped offset  
losses from problems with its Orion computer pricing and 
seat-allocation system, chairman James Goodwin said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong U.S. travel demand and a modest rise in demand from  
United's important Asian region should help the carrier post a 
modest increase in unit revenue during the third quarter, Goodwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraged by the fact that most of the challenges we  
faced in the second quarter are now behind us,'' Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter included a gain of $669 million, or  
$3.88 a diluted share, on the sale of stock in international 
reservations system Galileo and a loss of $3 million, or 2 cents a 
share, from the extinguishment of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, UAL earned $747 million, or  
$6.30 a share, compared with $343 million, or $2.80 a share, from a 
year ago. Sales were $8.7 billion, up from $8.49 billion a year 
ago. 

</P>
<P>
                             *AMR Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest airline earned $268 million, or  
$1.70 per share, compared with $409 million, or $2.30 per share, in 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues during the quarter climbed about 1.8 percent to $5  
billion from $4.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's earnings topped Wall Street analysts' expectations  
of $1.66 a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call 
Corp. AMR's stock rose 12.5 cents to $69.25 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR attributed the second-quarter profit decline to flight  
delays and cancellations due to bad weather at its hub airports in 
Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago and troubles with a new Federal 
Aviation Administration computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	It also suffered the same profit erosion as United Airlines due  
to the summer fare sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth, Texas-based company said the crash of Flight  
1420 in Little Rock, Ark., on June 1 had little impact on bookings 
during the quarter. Ten people were killed in the crash and more 
than 80 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, AMR earned $426 million, or  
$2.65 a share, compared with $699 million, or $3.91 a share, in the 
same period a year ago. Sales were $9.49 billion, down from $9.56 
billion. 

</P>
<P>
                        *US Airways Group Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-largest U.S. airline earned $136 million, or $1.83 a  
share, compared with $194 million, or $1.95 a share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 results excluded a gain of $181 million from the sale  
of some securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $2.2986 billion, down from $2.297 billion last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways had warned in June that weaker-than-expected traffic  
in May and higher labor costs would hurt its profits in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's earnings matched Wall Street analysts' revised  
expectations of $1.83 a share, according to a survey of analysts by 
First Call Corp. US Airways' stock fell 50 cents to $40 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, the Arlington, Va.-based  
company earned $182 million, or $2.34 a share, compared with $293 
million, or $2.89 a share, a year ago. Revenues were $4.358 
billion, down slightly from $4.359 billion a year ago. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Trans World Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The No. 8 U.S. carrier lost $6.2 million, or 18 cents a share,  
compared with profits of $19.49 million, or 21 cents a share, a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $866 million, compared with $884 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based airline's earnings were below Wall Street  
analysts' expectations of a loss of 12 cents a share, according to 
a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. TWA's stock fell 6.25 
cents to $4.68 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA said that labor negotiations with the International  
Association of Machinists union and the threat of a strike hurt its 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, union leaders agreed to an offer that would bring the  
16,000 mechanics, ramp workers, ticket agents and flight attendants 
to 90 percent of the projected industry wage standard by summer 
2001. Over the past decade, workers have taken several cuts in pay 
and benefits to keep the struggling airline aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	The rank and file must still approve the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``The high-yield business traveler did not want to take a  
chance, and they left us,'' TWA president and chief executive 
William F. Compton said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, the airline lost $27.77  
million, or 60 cents a share, compared with a loss of $36 million, 
or 82 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues were $1.63 billion, down 
from $1.65 billion.

<P>
	JARRATT, Va. (AP)-- A man who abducted and killed a college  
student by smashing her head with a 69-pound boulder was executed 
by injection Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy David Strickler, 33, was convicted in the 1990 slaying of  
Leann Whitlock, a 19-year-old sophomore at James Madison 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Whitlock was kidnapped from the parking lot of a  
Harrisonburg shopping mall and found dead eight days later in a 
wooded area. Police said her head had been struck four times with a 
69-pound boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickler's lawyer had said that co-defendent Ronald Lee  
Henderson, who received three life terms, was the killer and that a

<HEADLINE> Belle Waives No-Trade Clause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle has agreed to dismiss the no-trade  
clause in his contract with the Baltimore Orioles, freeing the team 
to try to unload the temperamental slugger. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's five-year, $65 million contract includes a three-year  
clause barring him from being traded, but he apparently consented 
to lift the trade ban soon after the Orioles learned of a June 4 
incident in which he allegedly made obscene gestures to fans in the 
bleachers at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago White Sox manager Jerry Manuel recently told Chicago  
reporters that Belle informed him of his decision to renounce the 
trade clause. The (Baltimore) Sun, citing club sources, confirmed 
Belle's decision in a story that ran in today's editions of the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle played two seasons with the White Sox before joining for  
the Orioles as a free agent after discovering an escape clause in 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle is hitting .275 with 20 homers and 59 RBIs for Baltimore,  
but his time with the team has been filled with controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle stopped talking to the Baltimore media after a clubhouse  
tirade during spring training was reported. He also threw a beer 
bottle through a television in the visitor's clubhouse at Tropicana 
Field and has been booed by the home fans for an apparent lack of 
hustle.

<HEADLINE> Fed OKs Loans for Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve Board has approved a plan  
to make special loans to banks, thrifts and credit unions that 
might need emergency money because of consumer fears about the Year 
2000 date change. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's governors voted 5-0 Tuesday to offer the  
special loans to financial institutions from Oct. 1 through next 
April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to public comments, the Fed decided to move up the  
program's starting date to Oct. 1 instead of the Nov. 1 first 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan should help banks, thrifts and credit unions ``more  
confidently commit'' to making loans to other financial 
institutions and to businesses through the transition to the new 
century, the Fed said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the Fed ordered an additional $50 billion of new  
currency put into circulation to handle in run on banks and 
automated teller machines late in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking industry officials have said the special loans would  
provide an extra cushion of cash even though very few banks are 
expected to need it.

<HEADLINE>  Sean Elliott Needs New Kidney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- As the San Antonio Spurs drove toward the NBA  
championship, Sean Elliott kept a frightening secret: He needed a 
kidney transplant and might be playing his last games. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Wednesday his condition has worsened, and the  
31-year-old forward hopes to have a transplant as soon as a 
matching donor is found. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation that I've known about for a while, so for me  
it really hasn't been a shock,'' Elliott said. ``Ask me if I'm a 
little scared, yeah, I'm a little worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott says he has no pain and is staying upbeat, even hoping  
to resume his NBA career after the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great career, and if that's the end of it, so be  
it. But I don't really think that's the end of it,'' Elliott said. 
``I want to play and I feel like I am going to play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The illness affects both his kidneys. The healthy donor kidney  
would be placed in Elliott's body along with the two malfunctioning 
kidneys, his doctor said. Elliott must have the transplant to avoid 
dialysis treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members underwent blood screening this week to see if  
they qualify as kidney donors. If there is no family match, Elliott 
will be placed on a transplant waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 62,000 Americans are awaiting a heart, lung, liver,  
kidney or pancreas. Last year, 4,000 people died before they could 
get the organ they needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Reineck, a kidney specialist who has been treating  
Elliott, said there is no precedent for a professional athlete 
returning to a sport after a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that it could be two to three months after the  
transplant before it is known whether Elliott can play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott learned of his condition after about four years in the  
league. His disease is known as focal glomerulosclerosis, one of a 
variety of kidney diseases that result in severe, prolonged loss of 
protein into the urine. The cause of his disease is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineck said the disease, if not treated, could lead to  
exhaustion, weakness, nausea and weight loss. However, he said 
Elliott has ``an excellent long-term prognosis for living a normal 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can get through it,'' Elliott said.  
</P>
<P>
	Elliott learned of his need for a transplant with about a month  
left in the regular season. However, Reineck said he and Elliott 
have known for more than a year that a transplant would most likely 
be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found out a couple things over the last couple of days about  
his situation that he was playing with,'' teammate Tim Duncan said. 
``I really didn't know the extent. To know now that he was playing 
with this makes what he did and what we did all season so much more 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said Spurs management knew of his plight, as did  
teammate Steve Kerr late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt I had a responsibility to the team,'' Elliott  
said. ``It's been something I've been living with for a while, so I 
really didn't let it creep into my mind that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Will Perdue said players suspected something because of  
the medical attention Elliott received before games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obvious he didn't want it to be a distraction,'' Perdue  
said. ``I know Sean is going to try (to play) whether the doctor 
tells him to or not. ... We all hope this is something he can 
conquer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said he takes some solace in knowing many people have  
had kidney transplants and then go on to lead productive lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of people out there who have to do it every day,  
so why should I have to be the exception?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott averaged 11.9 points and four blocks in the playoffs,  
helping the Spurs win their first championship. He had 14 points 
and four assists in a 96-89 victory over the New York Knicks in 
Game 4 of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest playoff moment was a game-winning 3-pointer with  
nine seconds left in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals 
against Portland. Balancing on its toes, Elliott barely stayed in 
bounds as he shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Schmidt, the team physician, said the shot was nothing  
compared to the grit Elliott showed coping with his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a true testament to him, not only as an athlete but as  
an individual,'' Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs drafted Elliott out of Arizona in the first round in  
1989. They traded him to Detroit for Dennis Rodman, Isaiah Morris 
and future considerations in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons tried to deal him to the Rockets in 1994 but the  
agreement fell through when Elliott failed his physical because of 
his kidney condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons sent him back to the Spurs later that year. Elliott  
battled back from knee injuries and turned in a strong performance 
this past season as the Spurs won their first title.

<HEADLINE> Mercury Drops Billy Ray Cyrus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- With sales of his records down sharply  
from his debut eight years ago, Billy Ray Cyrus has been dropped by 
Mercury Records. 
</P>
<P>
	His manager insists the split isn't reason for Cyrus to sing a  
new refrain of ``Achy Breaky Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is interest in Los Angeles as far as film and TV, but  
that will never take over Billy's career,'' Al Schiltz said. ``His 
first priority is music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old country star earned sudden fame in 1992 with  
``Achy Breaky Heart,'' a single that crossed over to the pop charts 
and helped sell 9 million copies of his first album, ``Some Gave 
All.'' His sales have slipped to about 136,000 with his latest 
effort, ``Shot Full of Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split was friendly, Mercury Nashville president Luke Lewis  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is with a great deal of respect for an artist who brought a  
lot of success to this label that I make this announcement, 
allowing Billy Ray to pursue other career options,'' Lewis said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defects at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuban pistol shooter Abel Juncosa  
Reyes defected when his team arrived at the Pan American Games, 
sources confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes walked into a Royal Canadian Mountain Police station on  
Tuesday and asked to remain in Canada. He was turned over to 
federal immigration authorities, then released, pending an 
immigration hearing, probably in September. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Cuban team said Reyes remained under  
police protection after seeking asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team is being housed at the Southport athletes village  
outside of Winnipeg. It was expected to be subjected to heavy 
security measures after five members of the Cuban basketball 
delegation defected at the Tournament of the Americas in Puerto 
Rico last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban national team pitching coach Rigoberto Betancourt Herrera  
defected in May following an exhibition game victory against the 
Orioles in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Cuba's top athletes have defected during international  
competitions in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most promiment was baseball pitcher Orlando ``El  
Duque'' Hernandez, who fled Cuba in December 1997 and signed with 
the New York Yankees. Other defectors include Hernandez's 
half-brother, Livan of the Florida Marlins, and major leaguers Rene 
Arocha, Osvaldo Fernandez, Rey Ordonez, Ariel Prieto and Rolando 
Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, three Cuban swimmers left a training camp in  
Puerto Rico and defected. Jose Perez defected after winning the 
bronze medal in the 400-meter hurdles during a San Juan track meet 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before Reyes' defection occurred, Brian Koshul,  
press secretary for the Pan American Games Society Inc., said games 
officials would not actively assist athletes wishing to defect. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Amtrak's Finances Improving Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak's financial outlook is getting  
brighter, but a new government report says the national railway 
still may not meet a deadline to wean itself from federal 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to our prior assessment, Amtrak's outlook has  
improved, but significant risks to self-sufficiency remain,'' said 
the report, released Wednesday by the Transportation Department's 
inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	The report praises Amtrak's recent efforts at marketing,  
privatizing food service and creating new businesses, such as an 
express package delivery service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the payoffs are uncertain at this time,'' the report  
says, ``but many are likely to generate vitally needed revenue by 
the time Amtrak must be operationally self-sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak projects it will wean itself from federal funds in 2002,  
just ahead of its mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inspector general continues to disagree with some of  
Amtrak's projections. It says the railway must find ways to 
compensate for $695 million in revenue that might not be achieved 
from 1999 through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	One key will be high-speed service in Amtrak's Northeast  
Corridor. The new ``Acela'' service starting later this year will 
speed passengers between Boston and Washington at up to 150 mph. 
Any significant delays in introducing high-speed service would hurt 
Amtrak's chances at self-sufficiency, the inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says Amtrak revenue and ridership continued to rise  
in the six months through March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act prohibited Amtrak  
from using any federal funds for operating expenses after fiscal 
2002. Since its creation in 1971, Amtrak has received about $22.7 
billion in operating and capital subsidies from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparations are under way in case Amtrak fails to meet its  
deadline for self-sufficiency. The Amtrak Reform Council is charged 
with developing a plan for a restructured intercity railroad if it 
concludes Amtrak will not meet its financial goals.

<HEADLINE> GM To Recall 3.5M Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is recalling more than  
3.5 million pickups, sport utility vehicles and vans to fix 
anti-lock braking systems that consumers claim led to thousands of 
crashes, a federal safety agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall concludes one of the longest defect investigations  
ever conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, agency officials said. All the vehicles will be 
fixed for free. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will ask owners of 1.1 million small pickups and sport  
utility vehicles from model years 1991-1996 to take them to 
mechanics so an anti-lock brake sensor switch can be replaced. The 
vehicles are four-wheel drive Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy SUVs 
and Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma pickups, along with some Cyclone 
and Typhoon pickups, GM officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the vehicle is operating in two-wheel drive, the anti-lock  
brake system can erroneously behave as if the vehicle is in 
four-wheel drive, a condition that could result in extended 
stopping distances, NHTSA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lange, GM's engineering director for product safety, said  
the stopping distance could be as much as 10 percent to 30 percent 
longer. He said 30 percent ``could be too long'' for a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is recalling about 2.5 million additional pickups, sport  
utilities and vans with two-wheel drive to change the computer 
software on the anti-lock braking systems. 
</P>
<P>
	When the vehicles move from a surface with good traction to a  
surface with poor traction, such as ice or packed snow, then back 
to a surface with good traction, there might not be enough brake 
pressure to the wheels, Lange said. Lange said it happened rarely 
but ``can result in longer stopping distances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those vehicles, all two-wheel drive, are: 1993-1996 Chevrolet  
Blazer and GMC Jimmy SUVs, 1994-1996 Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma 
pickups, 1992-1995 Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari vans and 
1993-1996 G-vans, which are full-size GMC and Chevrolet vans, Lange 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was not calling the software fix for the 2.5 million vehicles  
a recall, but rather a ``special policy'' campaign, since the 
company says there is no safety defect in those vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration described the  
switch replacements as a ``safety recall'' and the software changes 
as a ``service recall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But regardless of the wording, consumers were being asked to  
take in the more than 3.5 million vehicles so switches are replaced 
or computer software is changed. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA had received 10,861 reports of brake problems on the  
pickup trucks and SUVs with ``EBC4'' brake units. Consumers 
reported 2,111 crashes and claimed the crashes resulted in 293 
injuries, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement closes the book on the agency's longest  
outstanding investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was probably the most challenging defect investigation  
we've been involved with, from a technical standpoint. It was very 
complex,'' Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into anti-lock brakes on 1991-1997 Chevrolet  
Blazers, GMC Jimmy and Oldsmobile Bravada sport utility vehicles 
and Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma pickups began in October 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A second investigation into 1992-1995 GM and Chevrolet Suburban  
anti-lock brakes started in September 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suburbans are still under investigation, and GM is  
considering what action to take on those vehicles' anti-lock 
brakes, although the company ``commits'' to some action for 
consumers on the issue, NHTSA and GM said. Some 512,000 of the 
Suburbans are on the road, NHTSA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have reported 2,400 brake problems on the Suburbans.  
They have reported 782 crashes and claimed those crashes caused 68 
injuries, according to agency statistics.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Berenson Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Wednesday rejected a California  
lawmaker's resolution demanding that Peru release an American woman 
serving a life sentence after being convicted of treason. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters said Lori Berenson, 29, was  
unfairly convicted and should be released after being behind bars 
for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has asked Peru to give her an open,  
civilian trial, arguing that she was denied due process in a 
summary military trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters tired to add the resolution to a bill to increase  
security at U.S. embassies. The House defeated her proposal 234-189 
after some members objected that Congress should call for a fair 
trial, not release. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she was wrongly convicted, we want her to have a fair  
trial,'' said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who tried to get language 
in Waters' amendment changed. But the congresswoman refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody threatened to blow up the U.S. Capitol and  
happened to be a Peruvian national and was convicted, we would look 
very, very askance on the Peruvian congress saying she must go 
free,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenson, a native of New York and former Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology student, was convicted in 1996 of helping 
pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels plan a thwarted 
attack on Peru's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has said Berenson she is a  
terrorist and will serve her full sentence in Peruvian prisons. Her 
parents say she is innocent.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong: It Was Only Skin Cream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Responding to a nagging controversy over Lance  
Armstrong, the International Cycling Union explained Wednesday that 
the American had used a cream to treat a skin allergy, resulting in 
small traces of corticosteroids in his urine. 
</P>
<P>
	It said a prescription for the cream, Cemalyt, had been  
presented to the UCI, and that its usage was permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UCI declares with the utmost firmness that this was an  
authorized usage, and does not constitute a case of doping,'' it 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it was making the statement, which in other cases would  
violate medical secrecy, at the request of Armstrong and his team, 
the U.S. Postal Service. They have been dogged by repeated 
questions from the French media about drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a remarkable comeback from testicular cancer,  
has a strong lead in the Tour de France and came close to sewing up 
victory on Wednesday when he maintained his lead in the final 
climbing stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs which  
are not classed as steroids, are nonetheless banned unless 
prescribed by doctors for specific medical conditions such as 
asthma. Asthma inhalers, for instance, contain the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, Le Monde newspaper has reported that traces of a  
corticosteroid had been detected in the American's urine, and also 
in the urine of a number of other riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has said repeatedly he never took a banned substance.  
He says he has taken no medication for several years, since his 
cancer treatment in late 1996.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Rebounds After Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s operating  
company profits fell 9 percent in the second quarter as revenue 
fell due to currency fluctuations and the absence of businesses 
sold since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of SnackWell's and Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and  
other snacks and grocery products reported operating company 
profits in its April-June quarter slipped to $231 million from $253 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating company profits exclude onetime items and expenses  
such as for interest payments and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income amounted to $65 million, or 24 cents per share,  
compared with a loss of $200 million, or 76 cents per share, a year 
ago. However, Nabisco took a $406 million restructuring charge in 
June 1998, depressing results for that quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results were below the 27 cents forecast by analysts  
surveyed by First Call. Shares of Nabisco closed on the New York 
Stock Exchange on Wednesday off 31 1/4 cents a share at $42.18 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's reorganization and portfolio restructuring are  
yielding excellent results,'' said James M. Kilts, president and 
chief executive officer. ``We're turning the corner on earnings and 
enter the back half of the year with good momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues slipped to $2.02 billion from $2.13  
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sold some businesses last year,'' including College Inn  
broths, EggBeaters and the Fleischmann's and Parkay margarine 
brands, explained company spokesman Henry Sandbach. Excluding those 
transactions, sales would have been up 1 percent and net income 
would have risen 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, unfavorable exchange rates helped cut international  
sales 7 percent, to $579 million from $630 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilts said restoring previous cuts in advertising funding was  
boosting sales, particularly in the company's U.S. biscuit 
division, where revenues in the second quarter climbed to $897 
million from $864 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the U.S. foods division totaled $547 million, led by  
strong performances by Planters nuts, hot cereals and condiments 
such as A.1. steak sauce and Grey Poupon mustard. While that was 
down 14 percent from a year earlier, taking into account the 
product lines sold off, the division's sales were up 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1999, operating company profit fell  
15 percent, to $418 million from $491 million. Net income was $101 
million, or 38 cents per share, versus a loss of $145 million, or 
55 cents per share, in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 5 percent to $3.88 billion from $4.09 billion in  
1998.

<HEADLINE> Bush Subpoenaed in Funeral Home Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican  
presidential front-runner, has been subpoenaed in a whistleblower 
lawsuit filed by the ousted head of the Texas Funeral Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Wednesday  
that Bush plans to oppose the subpoena, which seeks a deposition 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in March by Eliza May, who was fired the  
month before as executive director of the funeral agency after 
leading its investigation into the embalming practices of Houston's 
Service Corporation International, owner of 3,700 funeral homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May's lawsuit alleges that SCI, whose political action  
committee gave Bush $35,000 in 1996 and 1997, worked with Bush's 
staff to interfere with the investigation. The inquiry led to a 
recommended fine of $445,000 against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attorneys are going to oppose it,'' Ms. Edwards said.  
``Governor Bush has no personal knowledge of the facts in the case 
and was not involved in the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May, who until last summer was treasurer of the Texas  
Democratic Party, sent a funeral agency employee to the Texas 
Ethics Commission to investigate SCI's campaign contributions to 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed her lawsuit against the funeral commission, SCI and  
Robert Waltrip, the company's founder and chairman. She did not 
name Bush as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's between Eliza May and the state of Texas. Us being named  
is a publicity stunt,'' said SCI spokesman Bill Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May was hired in 1996 by the nine-member funeral commission,  
which included six Bush appointees. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Chuck Herring, wasn't available to comment, his  
office said Wednesday. Last month, he told the Austin 
American-Statesman that he had been trying for nearly two months to 
arrange a date for the governor's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	SCI is fighting the recommended fines and says the funeral  
agency misinterpreted state embalming law. 
</P>
<P>
	The fines were assessed against the company for allegedly using  
unlicensed embalming companies, allowing unsupervised apprentices 
to embalm bodies, failing to inform families how much SCI paid 
third-party embalmers and refusing to comply with funeral 
commission subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says Ms. May was dismissed nine months after she was  
called into the office of Joe Allbaugh, Bush's executive assistant, 
and asked to explain inspections on April 10, 1998, at two SCI 
affiliates -- one in Dallas and another in Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's office has said Allbaugh's role was simply that of  
listener and that his presence had nothing to do with SCI 
contributing to Bush's gubernatorial campaign.

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror Reports Income Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror reported a 6 percent increase in  
second-quarter operating earnings as the company made gains on 
newspaper advertising revenue and benefited from lower newsprint 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose publications include the Los Angeles Times,  
Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and Field &AMP; Stream, earned $74.7 million 
from continuing operations, or 92 cents a share, in the quarter 
that ended June 30, up from $70.5 million, or 72 cents a share, in 
the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's total net income for the quarter was $85.3 million,  
which included a one-time gain of $10.7 million from the sale of 
Hollywood Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper ad sales rose 10.6 percent to $512 million. About 40  
percent of that increase came from Times Mirror's acquisition of 
the Recycler and Newport Media last February, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ad revenues from the company's eastern newspapers rose 7.4  
percent, while the Los Angeles Times had a 4.8 percent gain in ad 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsprint costs fell 11.4 percent for the quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported its first year-to-year increase in quarterly  
operating profit after five straight year-to-year declines, said 
Mark Willes, Times Mirror chairman, president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to implement strategies that we expect will  
result in sustainable earnings improvement at the Times,'' Willes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 6 percent to $801.3 million from $755.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Times Mirror had net  
income from operations of $123.5 million, up from $116.5 million, 
excluding one-time gains and charges. Revenues rose 5.3 percent to 
$1.55 billion from $1.47 billion.

<HEADLINE>  John Deere Classic to Begin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COAL VALLEY, Ill. (AP) -- This tournament has been called the  
Miller Classic, Quad Cities Open, Hardee's Classic and Quad Cities 
Classic. It's been held in September and in July. It's been played 
just before the British Open and on the very same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's event has a new name -- the John Deere Classic -- and  
it's being played the week after the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The course is still the par-70, 6,762-yard Oakwood Country Club  
in Coal Valley because the new Deere Run course is not yet ready. 
</P>
<P>
	The purse is $2 million, up from $1.35 million last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jones is back after winning last year's Quad Cities  
Classic. On the final day, Jones, the 1996 U.S. Open winner, 
rallied from a four-way tie for third, three strokes behind 
third-round leader David Toms, the 1997 winner here. Jones finished 
with a 4-under-par 66 and a 17-under 263 total.

<HEADLINE> Training Camp Begins for Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Let the pad popping begin -- training camp is  
in session for the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies, free agents and a few other veterans reported Wednesday  
to the new Browns first training camp since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of about 35 players will practice in pads for the  
first time Thursday and will be joined by the rest of the team on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the team has had four minicamps, those were padless  
sessions with little contact. But now touch football is over and 
there will be a new sense of urgency on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 90 players who will strap on orange helmets Sunday,  
nearly half will be cut before Cleveland's regular season opener 
game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't if I'm ready for it but I'm going to work hard every  
day and hopefully be a part of it,'' said Tarek Saleh, a three-year 
veteran who was taken from Carolina in the expansion draft and is 
hoping to win a spot either as a linebacker, fullback or special 
teams player. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday was quiet for players, but not for workers at the  
Browns suburban Cleveland headquarters, where training camp is 
being held. They were scurrying around making final preparations 
for the Browns first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns will be giving free tickets to football-hungry  
Cleveland fans who want to sit in the stands at Berea and watch 
practice. The bleachers can hold up to 4,500 people and it's a 
pretty safe bet that finding a spot won't be easy, at least not in 
the first few days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chris Palmer said the early days of training camp, which  
runs through Aug. 23, will be about learning who can hit and who 
can't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris Spielman doesn't have to show us what he has in pads,''  
Palmer said. But rookie linebacker Rahim Abdullah ``has to step up 
and show us that he can hit with the big boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might also help to learn quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	From the time the Browns practice together for the first time in  
camp, they will have just two weeks to prepare for their Aug. 9 
debut against the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall of Fame game at 
Canton.

<HEADLINE> Heart Attacks More Fatal for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Young women with chest pain should seek immediate medical care,  
according to researchers who reported today that heart attacks are 
twice as likely to kill women under age 50 than men in the same age 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprising gap narrows and eventually disappears later in  
life, Yale University researchers found. The discovery suggests 
that biological factors -- not differences in medical care -- largely 
explain why heart attacks are more deadly for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many studies, this one and a second study in today's New  
England Journal of Medicine found that women's heart attacks in 
general are more likely to be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yale doctors found 17 percent of female heart attack victims  
die while still in the hospital, compared with 12 percent of males. 
However, when the researchers broke the numbers down by age, they 
came to the surprising conclusion that the difference results 
entirely from a much higher death rate among the younger victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women, even among younger  
women, less than 65,'' said Dr. Viola Vaccarino, who directed 
Yale's study. It was based on a review of the records of 384,878 
heart attack victims between 1994 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Among patients under age 50, when heart attacks are especially  
rare among women, just 3 percent of the male victims died, compared 
with 6 percent of females. 
</P>
<P>
	By age 75, the death rate for both sexes is about equal, at 19  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, experts have speculated about why heart attacks  
are more deadly for women, and some have suggested that differences 
in medical treatment play a role. While this may be part of the 
story, the new work suggests that biology is probably a more 
important factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably biological mechanisms play a major role, but we need  
to look at the big picture and take into account all aspects of the 
women and their care,'' Vaccarino said. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier work, the Yale team and other researchers found that  
women wait hours longer after a heart attack before going to the 
hospital, then are treated less aggressively than men. That delay, 
which allows further damage to the oxygen-starved heart, results 
partly because women tend to experience less painful heart attack 
symptoms. Sometimes they feel only pressure or a burning feeling, 
not crushing pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also noted that younger female victims are more  
likely than men to have other health problems, such as diabetes, 
high blood pressure and heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the treatment differences and women's poorer overall  
health only explained one-third of the mortality difference. Those 
factors being equal, women had a 7 percent higher risk of dying for 
each five years below age 75. By age 80, the men had a slightly 
higher risk. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Laura Wexler of the University  
of Cincinnati called the discovery ``striking and new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Do these women have some especially potent risk factor, or do  
they lack a protective factor that is normally present in women?'' 
she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically heart disease afflicts women about a decade later in  
life than men, probably because the female hormone estrogen 
protects their hearts through youth and middle age. Those who are 
struck at an early age may have differences in the way their bodies 
use this hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, directed by Dr. Judith Hochman of St.  
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, looked at 12,142 men 
and women who had bad heart attacks, milder ones or severe chest 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	In all three categories, women were up to twice as likely to  
suffer serious complications. Among those who had heart attacks, 
the women were 50 percent more likely to die within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, these studies suggest that there are  
gender-specific factors at play in heart attacks that are not 
necessarily related to differences in care but to the underlying 
disease process,'' said Dr. Lynn Smaha, president of the American 
Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reasons, several experts stressed the need for  
women to seek testing and treatment at the first hint of heart 
trouble and to try to prevent it by controlling their weight, 
exercising and quitting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have to look for new treatments'' because the  
current ones, based mostly on research on men, don't work as well 
on women, added Dr. Kevin Schulman of Georgetown University Medical 
Center in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov's Remarks Irk Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Published remarks by Gov. Gray Davis  
have left some lawmakers in his own party wondering whether the 
usually reserved Democrat sees himself as a leader or a monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my vision that commanded a 20-point victory, the  
largest in 40 years,'' Davis told the San Francisco Chronicle's 
editorial board for a story published Wednesday. ``People expect 
government to reflect the vision that I suggested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic lawmakers are generally more liberal than Davis, who  
takes a centrist approach on many issues. Davis said that because 
he won election last fall in a landslide, lawmakers should defer to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody else in the Legislature ran statewide,'' he said.  
``Their job is to implement my vision. That is their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statements irked many, including Democratic lawmakers whose  
relationship with the first-term governor have already been 
strained by Davis' attempts to stall legislation. The Democrats 
have a majority in the Assembly and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're a government of checks and balances,'' said  
Senate leader John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa said he has a good working  
relationship with Davis, but said ``the Legislature is a separate 
but equal branch of government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us have made commitments and promises to our  
constituencies that we have to keep and honor,'' Villaraigosa said. 
``I hope the governor understands and respects that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the governor has  
``tremendous respect'' for the Legislature. Davis believed he was 
speaking off the record for a portion of the interview, Bustamante 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle managing editor Jerry Roberts said the newspaper ran  
lengthy quotes by Davis ``so there would be no question about the 
context'' of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis served in the Assembly from 1982 to 1986. Critics said his  
comments were proof he has become too enamored with his power. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a monarchy, and Gray Davis is not the king,'' said  
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says GOP Tax Cut Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he would not sign  
``a risky plan'' by Republicans to cut taxes by $792 billion, 
arguing that it would rob money from education, Medicare, Social 
Security and national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	As the House prepared to vote on the GOP proposal, the president  
said in an East Room news conference that he supports tax cuts but 
only those that save money for other priorities. Americans want 
``tax cuts in the national interest, not special interests,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress passes the wrong kind (of tax cut), of course I  
will not sign it,'' he said. ``I will not allow a risky plan to 
become law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging news conference, his second in two months,  
Clinton repeated that the United States favors a one-China policy 
and said he was confident that China and Taiwan could resolve their 
differences peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we don't want to see escalate,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crisis in the region was triggered when Taiwan's president,  
Lee Teng-hui, asserted that Taiwan and China are two states. He 
called the pronouncement a necessary step to prepare the capitalist 
island for talks on eventual reunification with the communist 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese moved today to soften its statement and defuse the  
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he would view greater conflict in the region with ``the  
gravest concern,'' Clinton said, ``I believe the pillars (of U.S. 
policy) are still the right ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and said  
he will decide ``in a timely fashion'' whether to reappoint him. He 
said Greenspan's seat should not become an election-year issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was asked several questions about efforts to  
recover the body of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law 
from plane wreckage off Martha's Vineyard. He said the answers 
should come from Coast Guard officials and the families of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	He ventured into the 2000 presidential race, claiming he was  
just ``having a little fun'' when he seemed to criticize GOP 
front-runner George W. Bush in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He did say that candidates must make their positions clear and  
say what they would do as president. Vice President Al Gore's 
supporters accuse Bush of not taking stands on important issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Use whatever slogans you want,'' Clinton said, without  
mentioning Bush by name, ``but tell us where you stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he assured Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in  
a telephone call today that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's 
proposals for peace would be made ``in complete good faith'' and 
any changes to previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements would have 
to be made by mutual consent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out of my way not to describe Prime Minister Barak's  
proposals, or to advocate or not advocate,'' Clinton said. ``I 
think he felt good about that.'' Clinton and Barak discussed 
Mideast peace efforts in four days of talks last week and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tax cuts, Clinton said the Republican plans would cause  
substantial damage to the economy. ``This is not rocket science,'' 
he said. ``This is arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the decision facing Congress is simple: ``Whether we  
move forward with the fiscal discipline that got us to where we are 
today; or do we return to the kind of risk-taking that got us in 
the recessions and deficits before?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed about $250 billion in net tax cuts, but  
administration officials have endorsed a $295 billion measure put 
together by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and congressional Democratic leaders  
have presented unified opposition to the large Republican tax cuts 
as threats to the long-term solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare and to sufficient levels of government spending.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Earnings Fall 67 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. reported its  
second-quarter earnings fell 67 percent, and the company's stock 
dropped sharply as investors, expecting a smaller decline, reacted 
to the news. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 1 tire manufacturer said Wednesday it had  
earnings of $65.7 million, or 41 cents per share, down from $199 
million, or $1.25 per share, for the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear had warned in late June that earnings would be  
significantly below analysts' estimates at the time of around 80 
cents a share. The results released Wednesday were still below 
revised expectations of 45 cents per share, and investors sent 
Goodyear stock down $2.87 1/2 a share, or nearly 5 percent, to $54.75 
in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear said the decline was due to weakness in emerging market  
economies in Europe and Latin America, where sales of cars have 
been depressed. The company also cited its efforts to reduce 
inventory and reorganize its manufacturing system as reasons for 
its earnings drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $3.05 billion, down from $3.14 billion a year  
earlier. The strong dollar helped decrease the value of Goodyear's 
overseas sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Samir Gibara said the  
company has reduced its worldwide inventories by $145 million this 
year and should see the benefits in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the economies in Latin America stabilize, we should be able  
to see favorable comparisons in the fourth quarter of 1999 compared 
with the same period in 1998,'' Gibara said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Goodyear earned $91.2 million, or 57  
cents per share, down from $375.8 million, or $2.36 per share, in 
the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $6.04 billion, down from $6.23 billion.

<HEADLINE> Romanowski Signs Contract Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski has  
signed a contract extension that will pay him $32.2 million over 
the next seven years, including a $4.2 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to live out the contract,'' said Romanowski, who will  
be 39 when the deal he signed Tuesday expires in 2005. ``Right now 
that's my goal, to go after Clay Matthews' record. He played until 
he was 39 or 40. If I could do that, it would be quite a feat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews was 40 when he finished his 19-year career with the  
Atlanta Falcons in 1996 -- and led the team with 6.5 sacks that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski earned his second trip to the Pro Bowl last season  
with 95 tackles, a career-high 7.5 sacks, two interceptions, three 
forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to continue to play that way and even raise that  
level,'' he said. ``In a way (the contract extension) puts that 
much more pressure on me to perform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th-year pro had two years left on his contract and got a  
5-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski's deal and a five-year extension for center Tom Nalen  
will free up about $1 million under the Broncos' salary cap and 
allow them to sign first-round draft pick Al Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Broncos have not finalized a deal with Wilson, a  
linebacker from the Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos general manager Neal Dahlen said negotiations with  
Wilson's agent as ``close to getting finalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also without contracts Tuesday were third-round pick Travis  
McGriff, a wide receiver and kick returner from the University of 
Florida, and fifth-round selection David Bowens, a defensive end 
from Western Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Training camp begins Friday in Greeley.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico 80, Canada 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A turnover by Steve Nash on the  
game's final possession allowed Puerto Rico to defeat Canada 80-75 
Wednesday night in a crucial Olympic qualifier game. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a complicated tiebreaking formula, Puerto Rico needed to  
win by at least four points to avoid playing the United States in 
the semifinals. And everyone in the raucous Roberto Clemente 
Coliseo knew it as Nash brought the ball upcourt with 18 seconds 
left and Canada trailing by five. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash drove to his right and threw a crosscourt pass that was  
picked off. Sherman Hamilton of Canada stole the ball back and got 
off a 3-pointer at the buzzer, but it missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The result set up a likely semifinal rematch between Puerto Rico  
and Canada on Saturday, when one of two berths in the 2000 Olympics 
will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll be tough for both teams. I know it will be tough  
for them to beat us twice,'' said Nash, who plays for the NBA's 
Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which played Venezuela later Wednesday night,  
will likely play Argentina for the other Olympic berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ortiz scored the final seven points for Puerto Rico on a  
3-pointer with 1:38 left for a 76-75 lead, a jump hook with 53 
seconds left for a 78-75 lead, and a layup among three defenders 
with 18 seconds left for the crucial five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After a timeout, Canada had one last chance to get a basket that  
would force Puerto Rico into a likely semifinal matchup with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that if we made a basket, they were out, and if we  
lost by more than nine points, we were out,'' Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to turn it over, so I threw a nice crosscourt  
pass,'' he said, shaking his head at his mistake. ``I went to throw 
it back to our big guy, but he went to the basket when I thought he 
was going to pop out. It went right by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went wild as the buzzer sounded, knowing that Puerto  
Rico's chances for a second straight Olympic berth had vastly 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico led for almost the entire first half and took a  
45-44 lead to the locker room at halftime. Hamilton opened the 
second half with a 3-pointer and Philadelphia 76ers draft pick Todd 
MacCulloch followed with a basket for a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico retook the lead on a fast-break layup by Jerome  
Mincy and a 3-pointer by Carmelo Travieso to start a 9-0 run, 
leaving Canada playing catch-up for the next 10 minutes until 
Michael Meeks tied it at 67 with 6:58 left and MacCulloch made a 
put-back 38 seconds later to put Canada up 69-67. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team scored again until Eddie Casiano made a 3-pointer  
to put Puerto Rico up 70-69 with 3:07 left, and Nash made a 
3-pointer with 2 1/2 minutes left for a 73-70 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgar Padilla hit a 3-pointer to tie it and MacCulloch converted  
a layup with 1:56 left, setting the stage for Ortiz's three clutch 
shots and Nash's critical turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier games, Brazil defeated Uruguay 100-74 and Argentina  
beat the Dominican Republic 85-71.

<HEADLINE> Francis To Sign With Grizzlies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Steve Francis came to town  
Wednesday to begin talking contract with the Vancouver Grizzlies 
and to begin mending fences with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis seemed far from thrilled when, as the No. 2 pick in last  
month's NBA draft, he was selected by the Grizzlies. He said 
Wednesday his look of displeasure stemmed from a realization he'd 
be leaving the area where he grew up and leaving behind the 
grandmother who raised him after his mother died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a place where we can make a name for ourselves in  
history,'' Francis said as he held up a Grizzlies jersey with the 
No. 23 on it. ``We can be the first people who took this team to 
the playoffs. I feel comfortable about what's going on for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his draft-day reaction, ``A lot of people are going to  
think what they want to think,'' Francis said. ``If they want to 
take it as I'm a bad guy because I want to express my feelings, I 
express my feelings on the basketball court, too. I'm never going 
to change that, expressing my feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't Vancouver, it was just the fact I was going to be so  
far from my family, my grandmother, my brothers and sisters,'' the 
6-foot-3 guard from Silver Spring, Md., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who played a year at Maryland, has ventured away from  
home only once before, that to play a year of junior-college ball 
at San Jacinto, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis's agent, Jeff Fried, said Francis would sign with the  
Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not commenced any negotiations but we don't foresee  
any problems whatsoever,'' Fried said. ``He'll be a Vancouver 
Grizzly and perform very well. The people in this city will get to 
know him and like him very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis came to Maryland as point guard, his natural position,  
but was switched to the off guard and averaged 17 points a game. 
He'll likely remain a 2-guard with Vancouver, since Mike Bibby is 
the team's point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played 2 last year. It wouldn't be that big of a change,''  
Francis said. ``I think I'm a player. I can play all five positions 
if you ask me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be the sole guy that can change it but I  
definitely can help this team win more than eight games'' out of 
50, Francis said. ``I think I can bring some of my leadership to 
the table as far as knowing how to win.''

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Stock Markets Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended sharply lower  
Wednesday after Wall Street's overnight plunge triggered heavy 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, share prices slid on profit-taking in the high  
technology sector following a similar move in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Nikkei-225 stock index fell 275.06 points, or 1.48  
percent, closing at 18,257.52 points. On Monday, the average had 
jumped 284.28 points, or 1.56 percent, to 18,532.58 -- its highest 
closing level since Sept. 10, 1997. Japanese financial markets were 
closed Tuesday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.7 percent on Tuesday and  
Asian markets caught the negative sentiment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, shares ended slightly lower on Wall Street's fall.  
Traders said that government buying and perceptions that tensions 
with China have eased for the moment kept the market off its lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Stock Price Index fell 20.20 points, or 0.26  
percent, to close at 7,786.65. The index shed almost 13 percent 
over the previous week on reports of Chinese military maneuvers in 
response to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's assertion earlier 
this month that Taiwan must deal with China ``on a state-to-state 
basis'' infuriated Beijing. The drop prompted the Taiwanese 
government to intervene and buy shares to prop up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices slumped, with traders worried about  
Wall Street and the feud between China and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index shed 180.74 points, or 1.3 percent, to close  
at 13,419.66. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares plummeted on local concerns, with investors  
selling on continued worries over financial difficulties at Daewoo 
Group, rising interest rates and renewed jitters over a possible 
devaluation of the Chinese yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	The main Korea Composite Stock Price Index, or Kospi, closed  
down 33.34 points, or 3.3 percent, at 965.11. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stayed slightly above its late  
Tuesday level in New York on speculative dollar-buying amid notions 
that the Bank of Japan might intervene to weaken the yen again, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.00 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.42  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its level of 118.95 yen 
late Tuesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices fell as investors cashed in on recent  
gains. The Straits Times Index lost 40.57 points, or 1.9 percent, 
to end at 2,097.34. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower following the losses on  
Wall Street. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected 
companies fell 31.97 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,519.45. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian stocks closed lower. The All Ordinaries Index  
ended at 3,111.4, down 15.7 points, or 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices ended down. The NZSE-40  
Capital Index fell 15.36 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,204.40. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished slightly higher on  
expectations of corporate restructuring developments. The benchmark 
Composite Index slipped 5.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to end at 
836.65. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower on sluggish regional  
markets and increasing political uncertainty stemming from the ill 
health of the country's former president, Suharto. The Composite 
Index fell 1.3 percent, or 8.754 points to 641.107. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher on the release of  
banking and finance stock results that met market expectations. The 
Thailand SET Index rose 1.8 percent, or 8.91 points to 496.86.

<HEADLINE> NL Goes 135-116 in Interleague Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time in three years, the NL beat  
the AL in interleague play, going 135-116. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by a 12-3 record by the Houston Astros this year, the NL is  
362-327 in the three years of interleague play. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance averaged 33,482, up 21.7 percent from the intraleague  
average of 27,512. But even without interleague play, attendance is 
usually higher in June and July than the first two months of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's attendance was helped by the increase in games  
between traditional rivals to six. The Mets set a three-game record 
by drawing 161,481 for their series against the Yankees. The Angels 
set an Edison Field record by drawing 127,446 for a three-game 
series against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Interleague games averaged 33,407 during their first season in  
1997 and 31,447 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City's Joe Randa had the highest batting average, hitting  
.508 (33-for-65). He was followed by San Diego's Eric Owens (.431) 
and Philadelphia's Doug Glanville (.419). 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Jeff Bagwell had the most homers with nine, followed  
by Arizona's Jay Bell, Detroit's Dean Palmer and Philadelphia's 
Scott Rolen with eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida rookie Bruce Aven drove in a major league-leading 27  
runs, followed by Magglio Ordonez (22) of the White Sox and Kansas 
City's Carlos Beltran (21). 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Mike Hampton was the top pitcher with a 4-0 record.  
Seven pitchers had 3-0 marks. Florida's Alex Fernandez had the top 
ERA at 0.75, followed by Arizona's Randy Johnson (0.84) and 
Montreal's Carl Pavano (1.17). 
</P>
<P>
	The NL East had the best mark of any division, going 51-39  
against the AL East, led by a 14-4 record against Tampa Bay. The NL 
Central went 47-42 and the NL West was 37-35. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego (11-4) had the second-best record, followed by Oakland  
and the Mets at 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, Anaheim, Kansas City and Colorado followed the Devil  
Rays for the worst record, winning one-third of their games. 
</P>
<P>
	NL teams were 117-97 in the first season, but the AL had a  
114-110 advantage last year.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Up a Bit; Dow Up 6.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were held to minor gains Wednesday as a  
mixed bag of corporate earnings reports hampered Wall Street's 
recovery from sharp losses in the previous session. Internet 
companies helped the technology sector outperform most other 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.65 to close at 11,002.78  
after dropping 191 points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators fared better than the Dow. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.19 to 1,379.29, and the Nasdaq composite index, 
laden with technology stocks, rose 29.59 to 2,761.77 after a 
98-point drop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, investors pushed stocks to record highs on the  
promise of strong corporate earnings for the second quarter. This 
week marks the peak of the earnings reporting season, with more 
than 1,000 companies scheduled to release their profit figures. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Goodyear provided the first major blemish in an  
otherwise stellar earnings season. The tire and rubber maker, a 
component of the Dow industrials, said second-quarter earnings fell 
67 percent, steeper than analysts had expected. Goodyear was down 
2 7/8 to 54 3/4, preventing the Dow from making a stronger advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, two other Dow components posted solid earnings. Eastman  
Kodak earned $1.52 per share, beating analysts' expectations by a 
penny, and Exxon met analysts' prediction of earnings of 49 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak slipped 1/4 to 73, and Exxon rose 3/16 to 78 1/8.  
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, companies have met Wall Street's high  
expectations, but investors have used the good news as an excuse to 
sell stocks to lock in their profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market advanced very strongly from its lows at the end of  
May,'' said Robert Streed, chief investment counselor at Northern 
Trust in Chicago. ``Now that the good news is on the table, people 
are simply taking profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan became the latest of many banks and brokerages  
to report strong second-quarter earnings. Shares rose 7/16 to 81 
5/16 after the bank posted earnings of $1.55 a share. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected $1.37 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does seem clear that both the technology and financial  
sectors are coming in well above expectations,'' said Chuck Hill, 
director of research at First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks shot up 10 1/8 to 87 15/16, after the company, which  
develops Internet software, said late Tuesday it broke even in the 
second quarter. Analysts had anticipated a slight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Centocor rose 7 7/8 to 57 3/8 after Johnson &AMP; Johnson agreed to  
acquire the biotechnology company for $4.9 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet music provider MP3.com, which went public Wednesday at  
an initial price of 28, opened trading at 92, a stunning gain in 
light of the market's weakness. It fell back, however, to close at 
63 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Streed said market indexes, which remain near record highs, were  
ripe for Tuesday's fall. The continued weakness Wednesday raised 
some concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market needs some stabilization. If it doesn't settle  
down, you have to wonder how much downside risk remains out 
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market may be slightly subdued by the prospect  
of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the 
House Banking Committee, scheduled for Thursday. Since the Fed 
raised interest rates last month, the U.S. economy has shown 
virtually no sign of inflation, but traders will listen carefully 
to Greenspan's words, seeking hints on the Fed's future course. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by roughly a 10-to-9  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume came to 
947.00 million shares, compared to 926.13 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.21 to 647.48, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.91 to 806.81. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.08 to 454.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
fell 1.5 percent. In Europe, Germany's DAX index fell 1.4 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 
1.0 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Tries To Boost Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans hoped to push the year's biggest  
spending bill through a House subcommittee today, aided by a new 
willingness to spend billions more than the party has previously 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	A subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee planned to  
vote on a measure exceeding $300 billion for education, health, 
labor and welfare programs for the coming fiscal year. Besides 
being the largest of the 13 annual spending bills, it is 
perennially one of the most controversial because it is home for 
many of President Clinton's highest priorities, many of which are 
reduced by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Though last-minute changes by GOP leaders were possible, the  
bill offered by the subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Porter, 
R-Ill., was likely to boost spending for the National Institutes of 
Health next year to $16.9 billion, according to documents obtained 
by The Associated Press. That would be well above its $15.6 billion 
this year and the $15.9 billion Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall education spending was expected to exceed the $33.5  
billion spent this year. And Porter was planning to provide the 
same $1.4 billion Clinton requested for home-heating aid for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was also planning cuts in Clinton's requests for the  
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, adult job training, 
social services aid to states, and some child care spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill's price tag is for automatically paid benefits  
like Medicaid. The rest covers annually approved programs like 
teacher training and biomedical research.	   Until now, Republicans had planned to spend $77 billion on those 
annually approved programs. That figure is now likely to rise to 
about $89 billion, or slightly less than this year. With $89 
billion, ``I think we have a pretty good chance of getting it 
through,'' said Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra $12 billion will come from about $20 billion in budget  
savings that House Republicans are seeking. They plan to use the 
money to boost the size of Porter's measure and two others covering 
veterans, housing, commerce, law enforcement and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings under consideration included federal payments to the  
states for Medicaid and in administrative expenses for the program, 
according to Republicans. Medicaid is the health-insurance program 
for low-income people, and such cuts surely would be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget savings are aimed at getting the GOP out of a tough  
box in which it must balance its claims of fiscal conservatism with 
the reality that Clinton -- and many lawmakers of both parties -- are 
demanding more spending than the 1997 budget-balancing deal would 
allow next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings will be used for extra spending aimed at attracting  
enough votes to pass the crucial spending measures. By claiming 
that the extra spending is paid for, Republicans hope to argue that 
they are still obeying spending limits enacted in the budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra $20 billion in spending also would allow Republicans  
to say they are spending a bit less than they are this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the extra money proves enough to move the measures  
through Congress, all three bills could face veto threats from 
Clinton because he wants billions more for them. 
</P>
<P>
	About $3 billion of the extra spending is expected to go to a  
measure financing the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. 
And about $6 billion would go to a bill for veterans, housing, 
environmental and science programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who is writing the Senate's version  
of the education, health, labor and welfare bill, said he, too, is 
searching for extra funds. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in an interview that during a White House affair last  
weekend for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, he asked Clinton to 
meet with him to discuss finding more money for the measure, and 
Clinton accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to move initial versions of all 13 annual  
spending bills for fiscal 2000 through Congress by the time 
lawmakers begin their summer recess on Aug. 6. So far, six have 
passed the House and the Senate has approved seven.

<HEADLINE> Minnesotans Oppose Tax for Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A poll shows strong opposition to using  
taxpayer money for a new Minnesota Twins stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of five Minnesotans oppose a public subsidy for a  
stadium; 68 percent are strongly opposed while 12 percent are 
simply opposed, according to a Star Tribune/KMSP-TV Minnesota poll 
conducted earlier this month and published Wednesday. Opposition is 
about 6 percentage points higher than in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman's plan to build a stadium requires  
that at least two-thirds of the cost be paid by the city and the 
state. Residents will vote this fall on whether to approve a 
half-cent sales tax to raise the city's portion, estimated at $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton said her city's leaders  
are looking for a way to keep the Twins while addressing the 
concerns of residents.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Makes Deal With Distributors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp. is hiring the nation's two largest  
grocery distributors to stock $3.9 billion of goods a year on the 
shelves of its 2,151 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary agreement announced Wednesday with Supervalu  
Inc. and Fleming Cos. Inc. enables the nation's third-largest 
retailer to avoid building an expensive food delivery system of its 
own -- like the one competitor Wal-Mart Stores Inc. already has in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart and market leader Wal-Mart are among retailers designing  
stores that combine groceries and discount goods under one roof in 
a bid to draw in more customers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wal-Mart built its own food distribution system for its  
sprawling Supercenters, some Wall Street analysts have said Kmart 
needed another company's help. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to do something, given the advances Wal-Mart has  
taken and the indications that Target is heading in the same 
direction,'' said Michael J. Schroeder, an analyst with Wasmer, 
Schroeder &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart said the deal would let it cut inventories by $150  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very positive announcement,'' said retail analyst  
Walter Loeb. ``It gives the company more flexibility. It frees up 
cash and gets expenses down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supervalu and Fleming will provide about 3,250 items, such as  
pet food and cleaning supplies, to the Kmart stores. They also will 
supply food and perishables at 102 Super Kmart stores, which 
already contain full-service grocery departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart chairman Floyd Hall said in October that the company would  
consider merging or aligning with a grocery business. Kmart had 
also been rumored to be the target of a takeover by a grocery 
chain, but analysts said a merger or acquisition would take time 
and money away from the core business. 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb said Hall ``feels as I do that this gives the company an  
opportunity to emphasize high-profit product lines, and make sure 
they have the volumes necessary for the holidays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart's stock was down 18 3/4 cents to close at $15.62 1/2 a share  
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Loeb said traders might 
be waiting to see how the deal affects Kmart's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleming was up 87 1/2 cents at $12.37 1/2 on the NYSE, where Supervalu  
rose 12 1/2 cents at $24.37 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervalu is the largest wholesale distributor to supermarkets  
in the country, supplying about 4,800 stores and running 366 stores 
of its own. The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company will supply about 
1,350 of Kmart's stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleming, a competitor of Supervalu based in Oklahoma City, will  
supply about 800 Kmart stores. Fleming is the second-largest 
grocery wholesaler, supplying about 3,000 stores and running 280 
stores of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	The distribution service plan will begin immediately, Kmart  
said, and companies expect to reach three-year agreements within 30 
days.

<HEADLINE> Science Helped Find Kennedy Wreckage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTIS AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. (AP) -- There were no apparent  
witnesses to the plane crash of John F. Kennedy Jr. No flight plan. 
No radio contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet using radar analysis and sonar, rescuers in a few short days  
narrowed 9,000 square miles of ocean to a few thousand square yards 
where the plane had gone down. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal aviation officials began by determining from radar  
readings one of the last locations of Kennedy's plane Friday night 
-- at 1,800 feet, about 17 miles west of the Martha's Vineyard 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Wreckage that washed up near the island's shores -- including  
luggage, a headrest and other pieces of the plane -- provided other 
vital clues. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration used computer models to determine how far the 
wreckage drifted, based on winds, tides and ocean currents. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer pinpointed where the wreckage would have been 18  
hours earlier in a process known as hindcasting -- think of 
forecasting in reverse. NOAA does the same thing in oil spills to 
determine where a leak may have originated. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer models generated a search grid of 4 miles by 6  
miles, or 24 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rude (pronounced ``Rudy'') and the Whiting, two NOAA vessels  
that are generally used to survey coastal waters and make nautical 
charts, began Monday using a technique known as side-scan sonar to 
detect objects on the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonar, which stands for Sound Navigation and Ranging, sends out  
sound signals and analyzes the echo that bounces back. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a gardener mowing a lawn, the ships meticulously plied  
every corner of the target area, covering about 6 to 8 square miles 
a day, said Sam De Bow, commander with the NOAA corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The sonar detected about 18 objects with edges that were  
straight -- in other words, manmade objects. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers from the Navy and Massachusetts State Police determined a  
handful of those objects were merely boulders. But they couldn't be 
sure about some others, since they could only spend about 15 
minutes in the murky water during each dive. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an ROV -- an underwater remote-operated vehicle, with  
lights and camera -- that found what divers couldn't. At 11:30 p.m. 
Tuesday, the ROV identified a fuselage as that of Kennedy's Piper 
Saratoga, 116 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology used wasn't new -- it was honed during the search  
for wreckage of the 1998 Swissair and 1996 TWA airline disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	But De Bow said the search for the Kennedy plane was remarkably  
swift, ``especially for the size of the aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was confirmation that we knew what we were doing,''  
De Bow said. ``And it confirmed that we'd done everything right and 
we were pretty proud of the effort.''

<HEADLINE> Jennifer Lopez Keeps Sizzling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Temperatures inside the Manhattan studio where  
Jennifer Lopez is shooting yet another magazine cover inch toward 
100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheese cubes on a nearby table have mutated into  
indistinguishable blobs of cholesterol, colorful summer fruit is 
now brown and the day's stash of soda bobs idly in a bucket of 
melted ice. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lopez doesn't complain as she's poked, prodded and slimed by  
her team of professional handmaidens and assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's hard to feel sorry for her. After all, the Bronx-born  
Lopez, just turned 29, has it all: looks, talent, fame, money. 
Movie insiders say she is commanding $5 million for playing a 
doctor in ``The Cell,'' a thriller that begins filming next month. 
Meanwhile, her single ``If You Had My Love'' from her first album 
``On the 6,'' has remained at the top of music charts since its 
debut June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl isn't just hot, she's sizzling.  
</P>
<P>
	Tune into ``Oprah'' and there she is, working those custom-made  
leather capris. Women's World Cup? It's Lopez live. Magazine 
covers? She's graced them from Elle to InStyle to Cosmo to Vibe, 
since her breakthrough role as slain Tejano star Selena in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Still no sympathy? Well, how about this: It's nearly 100 degrees  
in this studio and she's wearing a white, cotton TURTLENECK 
sweater! OK. The itsy-bitsy denim shorts showing her much-hyped 
derriere probably allow for some ventilation, but it's still 
steamy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never complain, never explain,'' Lopez says after finishing  
the first photo shoot and going through a 90-minute process of 
washing and straightening her honey-blond hair, changing and posing 
for another round of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not being a diva,'' one member of her entourage insists.  
``She just wants to give you a totally different look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's oppressively hot and late in the day, and she still has the  
movie premiere for Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam'' to go to and an 
early morning trip to the Adirondack Mountains for an outing with 
underprivileged children at a summer camp. She does it once a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A true diva would have blown off the interview. Instead, a weary  
and wilted Lopez apologizes for the delay -- a clearly undiva-like 
thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearing the end of an 18-month publicity tour first plugging her  
movie ``Out of Sight'' with George Clooney, and now the album, she 
is clearly ready to get back to moviemaking and away from prying 
media eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think of the one question people ask you over and over  
and imagine being asked that question, like, 10,000 times,'' she 
says, rolling her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	So, there will be no revelations here about her supposed  
relationship with record producer Sean ``Puffy'' Combs or Sony 
Music chairman Tommy Mottola. In fact, there will be few 
revelations at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that people want to know who I'm with and what  
I'm doing ... but I just don't feel I have the obligation to let 
everyone know everything about me. You've got to hold something 
back for yourself,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even Oprah got her to 'fess up, although she admitted she  
was ``seeing someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gone is the unguarded Lopez, the woman who reportedly dissed  
fellow stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz in a magazine 
interview during the budding days of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	In her place is the media-savvy Lopez, a woman who's been asked  
umpteen questions about her voluptuous anatomy, doled out sex 
advice (women don't like to have a certain body part twiddled like 
radio knobs), posed in her old Catholic high school uniform and 
been hit on by male interviewers (no, they didn't get dates). 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the questions are a little way out ... but that's  
just part of what this is,'' she says, shrugging. ``In return I get 
to do what I love. I get to act. I get to sing. I get to perform in 
great movies. I'm not complaining about that part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What she doesn't like are the many pop judgments about her.  
</P>
<P>
	``Someone comes in and talks to you for half an hour and they  
write their impression of you and that's what the world goes by. 
Then when some people meet me they say, ``You're not so bad. You're 
just a regular girl, like me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That seems true enough of this Catholic-bred young woman from  
working-class Castle Hill in the Bronx who doesn't drink or smoke. 
She is the product of a stable and loving Puerto Rican family that 
includes her father, David, a computer technician, her mother, 
Lupe, a kindergarten teacher, and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	She is -- excuse the pop judgment -- what every mother would like  
her daughter to be: secure, grounded, in control, talented and 
ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
	But fame was more than just a dream for Lopez, who began her  
career dancing as a Fly Girl on Fox's ``In Living Color'' in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, she says in earnest, her destiny: ``The closest I can  
get to explain it is to tell you I have this thing inside me that 
tells me I'm going to do this or die trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, who can sing, dance and act, has taken knocks from some  
in the media for being too ambitious. But she's not about to 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``People try to write about it as if it's a negative but I don't  
see it that way. ... If I hadn't made it, I would still be trying 
to make it. You know what I mean? There's nothing else I could 
possibly do. I would just be working and working at getting 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if someone forced her to chose between singing, acting or  
dancing? ``I'd pick one and do the other two in secret,'' Lopez 
says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the 6'' was named for the No. 6 subway train that carried  
her from the Bronx to the classes, auditions and clubs she 
frequented during her salad days in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dreams were all born riding on that train,'' she says. ``It  
couldn't be a more perfect title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez co-wrote three songs on the album, produced by Sony's The  
Work Group division, and was backed by heavyweight industry friends 
such as Combs, producer Emilio Estefan Jr., Latin singer Marc 
Anthony and rappers Poke and Tone of the Trackmasters. 
</P>
<P>
	And she is amused by the idea that she, Ricky Martin, Anthony  
and Enrique Iglesias are riding a so-called Latin explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attitude is: What explosion? We've been here all along. It's  
just that the music industry has only now realized the United 
States has some 30 million Hispanics under the age of 30. 
</P>
<P>
	But a word of caution to anyone who tries to lock Lopez into  
that Latino box: Don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, I'm an American girl. I'm proud of my Latin heritage but  
I was born here. My first language is English.''

<HEADLINE>  Kennedy To Be Buried at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Navy divers found the bodies of John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law in the wreckage of 
Kennedy's plane Wednesday, and his family prepared to return him to 
the sea for burial. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families endured a painful, five-day vigil before  
the bodies were finally brought to the shore of Cape Cod on 
Wednesday night and taken to the medical examiner's office for 
autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy destroyer, the USS Briscoe, was headed to Cape Cod for  
Kennedy's burial at sea at 9 a.m. Thursday, sources said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. The sources did not know whether all 
three victims would be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Fisher, the head of a business that leases out guides to  
help vessels navigate through unfamiliar waters, said his office 
was called by Navy officials Wednesday night and told there would 
likely be cremations and a burial of the ashes at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found 116 feet below the surface after ships  
from the Navy, Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration spent the night scouring a site 7 1/2 miles southwest 
of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	After a search that had the nation transfixed since Saturday,  
the plane's body, or fuselage, was spotted by underwater cameras at 
11:30 p.m. Tuesday. The bodies of all three victims were found in 
the fuselage, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with visibility of 5 to 8 feet, divers encountered  
``twisted wreckage,'' with wires and seats askew, ``the kind of 
thing you can imagine that would be the result of a high-impact 
contact with the water,'' Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep TV cameras away, officials banned flights within five  
miles of the recovery effort, which was led by the USS Grasp, a 
Navy salvage ship. JFK Jr.'s uncle Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and his 
sons, Patrick and Edward Jr., were aboard the Grasp while the 
bodies were being recovered and accompanied the remains to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said the bodies were brought to the surface ``in a way  
that respected the situation they were in. It was something we were 
very sensitive to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A large section of the fuselage that included the instrument  
panel was recovered. More of the plane will be brought to the 
surface and taken to the Coast Guard Air Station on Cape Cod for 
examination. It will be six to nine months before the accident's 
cause is determined, said James Hall, chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference, President Clinton defended his  
decision to pour so many federal resources into the search for the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	He said rescue and recovery efforts in the first four days  
``were consistent with what would have been done in any other 
case.'' He said Coast Guard officials told him they could locate 
the plane and its passengers if given more time, so he agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``it was the right thing to do,'' partly because of the  
Kennedy family's role ``in our national lives, and because of the 
enormous losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Briscoe, which had been conducting routine training near  
Virginia, was sent to Massachusetts to pick up family members for 
the at-sea burial ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, was piloting his single-engine plane Piper Saratoga  
from New Jersey when it dropped from radar 16 1/2 miles from Martha's 
Vineyard Airport on Friday night. Also aboard were his 33-year-old 
wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and his wife had planned to drop Ms. Bessette off at  
Martha's Vineyard and continue on to Hyannis Port to attend the 
wedding of his cousin Rory. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of flight data showed the plane dropped precipitously  
after Kennedy took a right turn, away from the Vineyard, and 
experts said he may have been disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	After her brother's body was found, Caroline Kennedy went for a  
quiet bicycle ride with her husband before returning to the 
seclusion of their summer home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the Bessette sisters issued a statement thanking  
everyone who assisted in the exhaustive search for the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our children are with us in spirit each and  
every moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' said Ann 
Freeman, their mother, and Dr. Richard Freeman, their stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
	A private Mass for Kennedy and his wife was scheduled for Friday  
morning at a Roman Catholic church in New York City where his 
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, prayed. Clinton and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only service for Kennedy's sister-in-law is  
planned for Saturday night at an Episcopal church in Greenwich, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Admirers of the family expressed relief that the bodies were  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, that'll bring some closure, at least, for the  
Kennedys,'' said Angelo Catalano of Sayreville, N.J., as he visited 
the site of Kennedy's apartment in New York. ``It's a shame. He had 
such a great future ahead of him. There's no telling where he 
could've gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shrine of offerings left by mourners outside the apartment  
building grew so large Wednesday that police said most of it would 
be taken away in vans and delivered to charities and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bodies were recovered, 67-year-old Pearl Heck of  
Franklin, Ind., stared at the Grasp through binoculars from the 
Aquinnah coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a witness to history. It looks so peaceful out  
there, the waves, the water, the sun,'' she said. ``I'll always 
remember this moment.'' 
</P>

wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and his wife had planned to drop Ms. Bessette off at  
Martha's Vineyard and continue on to Hyannis Port to attend the 
wedding of his cousin Rory. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of flight data showed the plane dropped precipitously  
after Kennedy took a right turn, away from the Vineyard, and 
experts said he may have been disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	After her brother's body was found, Caroline Kennedy went for a  
quiet bicycle ride with her husband before returning to the 
seclusion of their summer home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the Bessette sisters issued a statement thanking  
everyone who assisted in the exhaustive search for the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our children are with us in spirit each and  
every moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' said Ann 
Freeman, their mother, and Dr. Richard Freeman, their stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
	A private Mass for Kennedy and his wife was scheduled for Friday  
morning at a Roman Catholic church in New York City where his 
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, prayed. Clinton and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only service for Kennedy's sister-in-law is  
planned for Saturday night at an Episcopal church in Greenwich, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Admirers of the family expressed relief that the bodies were  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, that'll bring some closure, at least, for the  
Kennedys,'' said Angelo Catalano of Sayreville, N.J., as he visited 
the site of Kennedy's apartment in New York. ``It's a shame. He had 
such a great future ahead of him. There's no telling where he 
could've gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shrine of offerings left by mourners outside the apartment  
building grew so large Wednesday that police said most of it would 
be taken away in vans and delivered to charities and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bodies were recovered, 67-year-old Pearl Heck of  
Franklin, Ind., stared at the Grasp through binoculars from the 
Aquinnah coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a witness to history. It looks so peaceful out  
there, the waves, the water, the sun,'' she said. ``I'll always 
remember this moment.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns China on Using Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Confronting a crisis in Asia, President  
Clinton refused to recognize Taiwan's assertion that it is a 
separate state. But he warned China that any use of force to 
resolve their dispute would be viewed ``with the gravest concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The one-China policy is right,'' the president said Wednesday.  
He said he postponed a Pentagon mission to assess Taiwan's air 
defense needs because ``I didn't think this was the best time to do 
something which might excite either one side or the other and imply 
that a military solution is an acceptable alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration sent representatives both to Taiwan and China  
to defuse tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a 70-minute news conference in the East Room  
where he juggled questions on a half-dozen foreign policy hot spots 
from the Middle East to Northern Ireland. He also rebuked 
Republicans for a ``risky'' $792 billion tax-cut plan that he said 
would deprive education, Medicare, Social Security and national 
defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress passes the wrong kind (of tax cut), of course I  
will not sign it,'' he said. ``I will not allow a risky plan to 
become law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a calming message to Wall Street, Clinton said Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has done ``a terrific job.'' But he 
said it was too soon to say whether he would reappoint Greenspan 
when his term expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he loves his job and doesn't mind long hours, Clinton  
rejected the suggestion that his presidency is losing steam. ``I 
don't feel myself winding down, I feel myself keying up,'' the 
president said. ``I want to do more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for politics, Clinton said Vice President Al Gore, like  
Richard Nixon in 1959, must overcome the ``mixed blessing'' of 
being the No. 2 man who has to convince voters he is prepared to 
serve in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a good man with a good record,'' Clinton said of Gore.  
He had high praise, too, for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is 
campaigning for a New York Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The president declined to renew his criticism of Republican Gov.  
George W. Bush for espousing ``compassionate conservatism.'' But 
Clinton challenged, ``Use whatever slogans you want but tell us 
where you stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan-China crisis was set off July 9 when Taiwan's  
president, Lee Teng-hui, said his country wanted to deal with China 
on a ``special state-to-state'' basis. The assertion outraged 
Beijing, which said Taiwan was moving toward a declaration of 
independence -- and war. Beijing views Taiwan as a rogue province 
that must be reunited with the mainland eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``one-China'' policy has been a backbone for decades of U.S.  
dealings with China and Taiwan, across the Taiwan Strait from the 
mainland. Before Clinton's news conference, Sen. Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised 
Lee for ``having the courage to state the obvious -- that the 
Republic of China on Taiwan is a de facto sovereign state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, meanwhile, denied reports of possible  
curtailment of arms sales to Taiwan. But Rep. Benjamin Gilman, 
R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations Committee, 
said he had placed a hold on U.S. arms transfers globally until the 
administration resolves the question of arms transfers to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, at the White House, said, ``The one-China policy is  
right. The cross-strait dialogue is right. The peaceful approach is 
right, and neither side in my judgment should depart from any of 
those elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Clinton spoke, Taiwan said it was changing the wording  
of its new stance toward China, but kept the message unchanged -- 
that it wants to be treated as an equal with Beijing in any 
reunification talks. 
</P>
<P>
	On another foreign policy front, Clinton said he spoke with  
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat about the just-concluded visit to 
Washington of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Clinton assured 
Arafat that Barak is ``completely committed to resolve all the 
issues'' in the peace process ``in an expeditious manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said he was encouraged by Syrian President  
Hafez Assad's statements that he is open to negotiations with 
Israel to work toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Iran, Clinton said he was reluctant to talk about  
pro-democracy demonstrations, fearing that expressions of support 
would undercut the forces of openness and reform. He said people 
everywhere want to be able to pursue their religious convictions 
and freedom and still be deeply loyal to their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was ``very disappointed'' by the breakdown of  
the peace process in Northern Ireland. He said neither side wants 
to abandon the Good Friday agreement that created the groundwork 
for peace. ``My instinct is that we will get this worked out.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: 'Girls' Guide' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like her creator, Jane Rosenal is quick with a  
wisecrack and a cigarette, and full of witty, incisive observations 
on the perils -- and pleasures -- of life as a single New York woman 
searching for love. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't take long to feel as though you've known her for  
years. Jane's quirky humor, endearing anxieties and not-quite-right 
romances make her an easy, amusing companion from the start in 
``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' a new collection of 
short stories by Melissa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Six stories look at Jane over several decades. First, she's a  
high-schooler watching her older brother fall in and out of love, 
then a recent college grad enamored of a charming alcoholic nearly 
30 years her senior, later a thirtysomething with a marriage 
proposal from a perfect man with whom she can't quite connect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared me to think that my brother had failed at loving  
someone,'' Jane says in the first story, ``Advanced Beginners.'' 
Then she adds: ``I had no idea myself how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love is what she spends the book -- and much of her life -- trying  
to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank admits she created Jane partly in her own image. Both moved  
from the Philadelphia suburbs to Manhattan. Both struggled to find 
meaning in not-so-satisfying jobs in publishing and advertising. 
Both are single and lost much-loved fathers to leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bank, pure New York cool as she sips white wine and lights  
cigarette after cigarette, seems more self-assured, a little 
tougher than her sometimes hapless heroine. 
</P>
<P>
	She won't say quite how far the similarities go.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of the emotion, whether things happened to me or not, is  
autobiographical,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one story, ``The Floating House,'' Jane suffers through an  
excruciating Caribbean vacation with her boyfriend, his 
ex-girlfriend and her new husband. Bank based it on a dinner she 
once had with a similar group. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-girlfriend was ``6-feet tall,'' had ``gorgeous, long  
blond hair'' and was getting a Ph.D. from New York University, Bank 
recalled. ``It was a nightmare. ... You take that emotion, and that 
becomes the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Girls' Guide'' ends with a title story in which Jane, near  
the end of her romantic rope, sheepishly turns to ``How to Meet and 
Marry Mr. Right,'' a fictional version of ``The Rules,'' the 1996 
dating guide that urged women to play hard to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank, 38, was asked to write the story by an editor at Francis  
Ford Coppola's literary magazine, Zoetrope, but said it fit 
perfectly into the collection that she'd been working on for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fascinated by women, smart women I loved, following this  
sort of retrograde dating manual,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying voice is really, 'Don't be yourself,''' she  
said. ``'If you are yourself, men will never love you. You've got 
to be wily and trick them.' ... That's sort of the opposite of who 
Jane is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the ``Girls' Guide'' heroine turns to the dating guide when  
-- after a string of Mr. Wrongs -- she meets a terrific man and 
becomes frightened of losing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Faith and Bonnie, the authors of ``How to Meet and Marry Mr.  
Right,'' invade Jane's thoughts as grown-up personifications of the 
chirpy, blow-dried cheerleaders she knew in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't be funny!'' they urge the wisecracking Jane. ``Funny is  
the opposite of sexy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Jane starts to call Robert, the man she's fallen for, they  
warn her off: ``Not yet,'' they chime. ``Make him wonder a 
little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert, taken with his glimpses of the real Jane, grows  
impatient with the manipulative games. Only when Jane realizes she 
may lose him does she toss aside Faith and Bonnie. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the deciding moment in the hunt,'' they tell her.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is New York,'' she snaps back. ``Nobody hunts!''  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the book's title, Bank joked that her account of Jane's  
romantic ups and downs is largely ``a how-not-to guide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of women have a lot of voices in their heads about who  
they're supposed to be and what they're supposed to do,'' Bank 
said. ``People try to create a life they don't mind hanging out in, 
and, especially for women, it's a complicated process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank spent more than a decade working days and writing her  
stories on nights and weekends. She got so involved with her 
characters, she said, that her friends would call and say, 
``'What's going on with you?' and I'd almost want to say, 'Things 
are going REALLY GREAT with Robert.' And then I'd have to say, 'I'm 
writing a new story.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, it paid off. Viking shocked the publishing world  
last year by giving Bank a $275,000 advance for ``The Girls' 
Guide,'' an unprecedented sum for a short story collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewers are buzzing about the book -- The New York Times  
praised ``Jane's wonderfully clear sense of the trickiness of 
language'' -- and Coppola put Bank to work turning her title story 
into a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank hopes ``The Girls' Guide'' won't be seen as just a women's  
book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jane is trying to love somebody,'' she said. ''I think that's  
probably a pretty universal quest.''

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Earnings Fall As Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings for the Goodyear Tire  
&AMP; Rubber Co. were down to $65.7 million from $199 million in the 
same period a year ago, but profits were within the range the 
company set last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron-based tire maker said today the decline was because of  
weakness in emerging market economies in Europe and Latin America, 
and the company's efforts to reduce inventory and reorganize its 
manufacturing system. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear released a statement on June 24 warning that earnings  
would be significantly below brokers' estimates of around 80 cents 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter were 41 cents,  
down about 67 percent from $1.25 a share for the same period in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Samir Gibara said  
the company has reduced its worldwide inventories by $145 million 
this year and should see the benefits in the second half of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the economies in Latin America stabilize, we should be able  
to see favorable comparisons in the fourth quarter of 1999 compared 
with the same period in 1998,'' Gibara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear's second-quarter sales were $3 billion, down from $3.1  
billion in 1998. A strong U.S. dollar in foreign markets decreased 
the value of sales.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushing $792B Tax Cut to Floor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Short on votes, House Republican leaders  
struggled today to line up enough support among rebellious 
moderates to pass a $792 billion tax cut, and said they intended to 
press ahead with an evening showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second day in a row, Speaker Dennis Hastert appealed for  
unity at a closed-door meeting of the GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	With no firm time set for debate to begin, GOP leaders projected  
with certainty that they would go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a gamble. I don't think it's a bad thing to  
lose, but I do think it's a bad thing not to fight,'' said Rep. 
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the Republican Conference chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are expected to oppose the measure in overwhelming  
numbers, claiming the size of the tax cuts would deprive other 
priorities of money and could lead to huge deficits in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	More troubling for the GOP leadership was the opposition of a  
small group of moderates, who favor a smaller cut of about $500 
billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a 222-211 majority with one independent who  
customarily votes with the Democrats and one vacancy. Thus, 
Republicans can afford to lose only four votes if they are to pass 
the bill, central to their agenda, with GOP support alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., met late into the night Tuesday with about a  
dozen shaky GOP moderates and said the votes needed for passage 
likely would be whipped up at the last minute on the House floor. 
Debate was expected to begin in the early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never have them until right before the vote,'' Hastert told  
reporters. Earlier, he had appealed to GOP rank and file in a 
private caucus for party unity: ``I need each and every one of 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican moderates stood in the way.  
</P>
<P>
	Some questioned the accuracy of projected budget surpluses  
totaling $2.9 trillion over 10 years, while others wanted more of 
the money used to pay down public debt. Still others said it would 
eat up the money needed for Medicare and critical government 
spending -- particularly if the economy turns sour. 
</P>
<P>
	``The votes are not there at this point,'' said Rep. Michael  
Castle, R-Del., who has offered a $514 billion alternative tax 
bill. ``We need to have a smaller tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders planned to offer moderates a chance to vote on a  
nonbinding resolution stating that Congress would commit to 
reducing the $3.6 trillion debt to $1.6 trillion over 10 years, but 
many of them complained it had no teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's being tossed out at the 11th hour and it has no  
meaning,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	In part to placate the moderates and in part to meet Senate  
budget rules, Archer on Tuesday reduced the bill's overall cost 
from $864 billion to $792 billion -- the same level as a Senate GOP 
alternative. That means almost no significant tax relief would 
occur until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Republican said the savings would come by phasing in  
the 10 percent income tax cut slower, delaying the pace of repeal 
of both estate taxes and the alternative minimum tax, and by 
cutting corporate capital gains rates from 35 percent to 30 
percent, instead of down to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would cut top individual capital gains rates from  
20 percent to 15 percent, give new breaks for health care and 
education and raise the standard deduction for joint filers to ease 
the ``marriage penalty'' that hits millions of two-income couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Casting the bill as a hallmark of GOP smaller-government  
philosophy, the chairman of the tax-writing House Way and Means 
Committee, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, told the Rules Committee that 
support for tax cuts ``define the difference between Republicans 
and Democrats. ... This debate is about downsizing the power of 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and congressional Democratic leaders,  
meanwhile, presented unified opposition to the large Republican tax 
cuts as threats to the long-term solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare and to sufficient levels of government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Capitol Hill news conference, Treasury Secretary Lawrence  
Summers warned that huge tax cuts also could have unwanted economic 
consequences, including higher interest rates, greater inflation 
and a larger public debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax cuts that have been put on the table represent a  
reversal of course,'' Summers said. ``Confidence is crucial. It is 
time for us to make the right and prudent decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed about $250 billion in net tax  
cuts and Summers spoke favorably of a $295 billion measure put 
together by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee.

<HEADLINE> New Drug May Break Cocaine Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	European scientists have developed a drug that uses a promising  
new approach to ease cravings for cocaine in addicted rats, 
according to a study in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	BP 897 is the first drug to target the ``conditioning'' effect  
of cocaine, or the way, for example, that the sight of a street 
corner where the addict used to buy cocaine can evoke a craving, 
said Maria Pilla, a psychologist at the University of Cambridge in 
England who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other drugs available either mimic cocaine so much that  
they themselves can become addictive, or block its effects so well 
that addicts overload on cocaine to deal with the pangs of 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether BP 897 works in humans remains to be seen. Full-scale  
tests could begin as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	BP 897 eases the cravings associated with cocaine withdrawal by  
mildly stimulating the brain while regulating dopamine levels, a 
brain chemical that can create intense pangs for the narcotic. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first drug that creates a balance in the brain to  
help addicts deal with withdrawal, said Gary Aston-Jones, a 
University of Pennsylvania neuroscientist who co-wrote an 
accompanying commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocaine is particularly hard to kick because of its ability to  
``condition'' users and evoke cravings the way an old song or a 
whiff of perfume can trigger a flood of memories. An addict in 
rehab can get a craving for cocaine just by returning to the room 
where he used to snort it. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilla and her colleagues reported that BP 897 helped rats  
addicted to cocaine break away from the effects of conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers first trained rats to give themselves cocaine  
through a catheter by pulling a lever. A light was rigged to go on 
every time the rats did this, conditioning them to associate the 
light with the high. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the rats were taken off the cocaine. When researchers  
continued to turn the light on, the rats were reminded of the drug 
and pulled the lever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rat is probably going through an intense craving at this  
point,'' said Pierre Sokoloff, a French researcher who worked on 
the project at the National Institute for Health and Medical 
Research in Paris. ``This is a state that simulates withdrawal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But once scientists gave them BP 897, the rats sought cocaine  
only half as much as before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this could be very significant,'' Aston-Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although it hasn't been tested with other addictive drugs, BP  
897 might also be effective in treating heroin or tobacco addiction 
because they, too, condition addicts, said Jonathan Druhan, an 
expert in drug addiction at the University of Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE>  Pirates May Lose Second Catcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- First Jason Kendall, now Keith Osik.  
</P>
<P>
	Osik, the Pittsburgh Pirates' starting catcher since Kendall  
broke his ankle earlier this month, left Wednesday's game against 
the Chicago Cubs with a strained left hamstring and may be headed 
for the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought it was a cramp at first, but it's more tender now  
to the touch,'' manager Gene Lamont said. ``We're making plans to 
get somebody here tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osik was running to third base in the third inning when he

<HEADLINE> Rypien Not Heading to Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Quarterback Mark Rypien said he will not  
go to training camp in hopes of catching on with a National 
Football League team this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rypien, 36, sat out last season after his 3-year-old son died of  
cancer, and his wife was also diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart and mind are not there,'' Rypien, a former Washington  
State player, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rypien has not ruled out joining San Diego, Seattle or  
Washington once the season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm keeping a slight door open in case I get gung-ho to get in  
shape, or something happens to Ryan or Jim,'' Rypien said, 
referring to San Diego quarterbacks Ryan Leaf and Jim Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rypien, the MVP of the 1992 Super Bowl, had his throwing  
shoulder operated on in February. He said it feels great. 
</P>
<P>
	Rypien is part owner of a new ice rink in the Spokane suburb of  
Liberty Lake that is scheduled to open in October. The owners are 
trying to lure a minor league hockey team to the rink.

	Bodies Found in Kennedy Plane Crash  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- The bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his  
wife and sister-in-law have been located off the coast of Martha's 
Vineyard, federal officials announced today. Sen. Edward Kennedy 
and his two sons are at the scene to assist in the identification 
of the bodies. An autopsy on Kennedy is to be conducted at 
Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne on Cape Cod by the state 
pathologist, according to the office of Philip Rollins, Cape and 
Islands district attorney.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A private Mass will be held Friday in New York  
``to celebrate the lives of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and John F. 
Kennedy Jr.,'' officials announced today. The service will be held 
at the St. Thomas More Church, according to a statement issued by 
an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. Kennedy, his wife and her 
sister, Lauren Bessette perished last Friday night when their small 
plane, piloted by Kennedy, crashed off Martha's Vineyard.

	Clinton Says GOP Tax Cut Risky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he would not sign  
``a risky plan'' by Republicans to cut taxes by $792 billion, 
arguing that it would rob money from education, Medicare, Social 
Security and national defense. As the House prepared to vote on the 
GOP proposal, the president said in a lengthy East Room news 
conference that he supports tax cuts but only those that save money 
for other priorities. Americans want ``tax cuts in the national 
interest, not special interests,'' he said.

	Pentagon Postpones Taiwan Visit

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he delayed a

``excite either one side or the other'' in the crisis between 
Taiwan and China. Asked at a White House news conference whether 
the United States would come to Taiwan's aid in the event it was 
attacked by China, Clinton said the United States ``would be 
required to view it with the gravest concern,'' but he stopped 
short of saying American military force would be used. Instead of 
the military officers, administration officials were traveling 
today to China and Taiwan to urge both sides to maintain a peaceful 
dialogue.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- After 38 years at the bottom of the  
sea, Gus Grissom's Mercury capsule was brought ashore this 
afternoon on the anniversary of the flight that made him the second 
American in space. ``It brings back a lot of emotion,'' said Lowell 
Grissom, the late astronaut's 65-year-old brother, who welcomed the 
salvage team back. ``This was the only craft that Gus didn't bring 
home, and he would be extremely pleased that Liberty Bell 7 is 
back.'' Liberty Bell 7 arrived by ship at Cape Canaveral one day 
after being pulled from the Atlantic in remarkably good condition.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors has agreed to recall some 3.5  
million vehicles to conclude a five-year government investigation 
into problems with anti-lock brakes installed on sport utility 
vehicles, vans and pickup trucks. The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration launched the probe after receiving reports of 
performance problems on an array of GM vehicles manufactured in the 
1990s. The agency has on file 10,861 reports of brake problems on 
General Motors S and T trucks, which included reports of 2,111

	New Drug May Break Cocaine Addiction  
</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) -- European scientists have developed a  
drug that uses a promising new approach to ease cravings for 
cocaine in addicted rats. The University of Cambridge in England 
pioneered the study. BP 897 eases the cravings associated with 
cocaine withdrawal by mildly stimulating the brain while regulating 
dopamine levels, a brain chemical that can create intense pangs for 
the narcotic. The only other drugs available either mimic cocaine 
so much that they themselves can become addictive, or block its 
effects so well that addicts overload on cocaine. Full-scale tests 
on humans could begin as early as next year.

	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Navy divers found the bodies of John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law amid the wreckage of 
Kennedy's plane, all but ending the painful, four-day vigil their 
families endured during the search of the waters off Martha's 
Vineyard. A dive was under way today to bring the bodies to the 
surface. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and his sons, Patrick and Edward 
Jr., were taken by boat to the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship

	GOP May Make Tax Cuts Conditional  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans, searching for needed votes  
for a $792 billion tax relief package, weighed a plan today to make 
across-the-board income tax cuts conditional on year-to-year 
progress in reducing the nation's debt. Officials said that under 
the proposal each annual installment of the gradual 10 percent cut 
would take effect only if the government's cost of borrowing 
declined. But Democrats, led by President Clinton, almost uniformly 
opposed the tax cut, contending it would take too much of the 
projected $2.9 trillion surplus over the next 10 years.

1,000 reservists blocked roads near the central Serbian town of 
Kragujevac and inside the southern town of Pirot, demanding their 
money immediately. Independent economists believe immediate payment

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Under age 50, women's heart attacks are twice as  
likely as men's to be fatal, but the gap narrows and eventually 
disappears later in life. The discovery by Yale University 
researchers suggests that biological factors -- not differences in 
medical care -- largely explain why heart attacks are more deadly 
for women. This study, like many others, found that women's heart 
attacks in general are more likely to be fatal.

<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Boeing Co. has been chosen to supply  
seven new early warning and control aircraft to the Australian air 
force in a deal worth more than $1.3 billion, the government 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister John Moore said Seattle-based Boeing had been  
chosen as preferred provider from a panel of three potential 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The others were Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Systems Co.  
</P>
<P>
	Moore said contract negotiations would now begin, with the aim  
of signing the final contract early next year and the first of the 
aircraft being delivered in 2004-05. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Boeing was selected ``after a thorough evaluation  
across a range of areas including operational capability, 
Australian industry involvement, cost and risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Boeing and its radar supplier Northrop Grumman had  
extensive experience in the construction of early warning planes.

<HEADLINE> AOL's Profits Nearly Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. reported a nearly  
three-fold increase in quarterly profits on stronger revenues from 
subscribers and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Wednesday that its profit, excluding  
one-time charges, came to $156 million, or 13 cents a share in 
AOL's fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30. That was up from 
AOL's profit of $58 million, or 5 cents per share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted per-share  
earnings of 11 cents for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter reached $1.38 billion, up 46 percent  
from revenues of $943 million in the same quarter in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	New subscriptions accounted for much of the revenue growth, with  
AOL's total membership growing to 17.6 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Case, AOL's chairman and chief executive officer, said  
renewals by subscribers during the year ``was at an all-time high, 
showing the overall strength of the franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from advertising and Internet transactions nearly  
doubled to $306 million from $164 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full fiscal year, AOL earned $396 million, or 34 cents a  
share, excluding one-time charges. That was up from a profit of $59 
million, or 6 cents a share, in fiscal 1998. Revenues rose to $4.8 
billion from $3.1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Rules Issued for Fertility Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a bid to improve the quality of services at  
fertility clinics, the Centers for Disease Control published 
guidelines Wednesday that legislatures can use as a model for state 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said issuing  
guidelines was the proper role for the federal government as states 
seek to crack down on a virtually unregulated $2 billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``What should never be left to chance is the quality of the  
services provided by America's fertility clinics and 
laboratories,'' Shalala told reporters on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with her, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said many of the  
nation's 300 fertility clinics already comply with the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the guidelines are ``an indication to unscrupulous  
operators that you better clean up your act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines recommend various practices regarding laboratory  
hiring, training and recordkeeping.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Plans Job Cuts Despite Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. plans to cut up to  
2,500 jobs despite posting a 9 percent jump in operating profits in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak benefited from deep cutbacks in costs, prompted by  
Japanese inroads in the U.S. photography market in 1997. But its 
gains in the three months ended June 30 were offset in part by an 
11 percent drop in domestic film prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak sold 2 percent more rolls of film around the globe and 4  
percent more at home than a year ago, helping push revenues up 2 
percent to $3.61 billion from $3.54 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they didn't cut costs, earnings wouldn't be up,'' said Jack  
Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Cutting costs is not 
a one-time event for any company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extending an aggressive two-year plan to trim $1.2 billion in  
costs through the end of 1999, the world's biggest photography 
company said Wednesday it will eliminate an additional 2,000 to 
2,500 jobs over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,300 layoffs will come in Rochester, where the giant  
Elmgrove manufacturing hub that churns out everything from cameras 
to slide projectors will be shut down. About 7,000 people work at 
the 525-acre plant, which opened in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1997, caught off-guard when Tokyo-based nemesis Fuji  
slashed film prices, Kodak set about cutting 19,900 jobs out of a 
worldwide payroll of 100,500. Because of attrition and improvements 
in some businesses, it now estimates 17,700 workers will be laid 
off under that plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making outstanding progress in improving the company's  
ability to compete effectively in a very difficult global 
environment,'' chief executive officer George Fisher said. ``These 
steps are necessary for us to accelerate the momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak said operating profits, which exclude one-time charges,  
were $716 million, up from $655 million a year ago. Its net income 
totaled $491 million, or $1.52 a share, compared with $495 million, 
or $1.51 a share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results edged analysts' expectations by a penny, according  
to First Call Corp., but created some uneasiness on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers leave one kind of feeling queasy about the health  
of their overall business -- that they had to absorb so much 
restructuring just to get $60 million in benefits,'' said B. Alex 
Henderson of Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors reacted lukewarmly to the news, pushing shares down 25  
cents to $73 in Wednesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak cut costs by $135 million in the second quarter, up from  
$80 million in the previous quarter. It will record a pretax charge 
of about $300 million in the third quarter to cover the new job 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected film prices to dive in the peak  
picture-taking summer season but not quite as steeply as they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak is determined not to lose market share on its home turf to  
Fuji. Its 67 percent share of the rolls of film sold in the United 
States edged up 1 percentage point in the quarter, it said. In 
dollar terms, however, Kodak film sales nationwide fell 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses in digital photography, the recording of images on  
computer chips, narrowed to $28 million in the quarter from $45 
million in the first quarter. Digital sales jumped 54 percent to 
$556 million -- about 15 percent of overall sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak expects to pull in its first profit from digital sales  
before long, potentially creating new jobs in that fast-growing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Kodak earned $682 million, or $2.11  
per share, down from $720 million, or $2.20 per share, in the same 
period last year. Sales rose to $6.7 billion from $6.45 billion.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for Pop Star Trevi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An arrest warrant has been issued for pop  
star Gloria Trevi amid allegations of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A state government spokeswoman in Chihuahua said Tuesday she had  
no information on the warrant, or whether a warrant also had been 
issued for Trevi's former manager, Sergio Andrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question the pair about allegations they  
lured underage girls into sex with Andrade. Trevi dropped out of 
sight months ago and Andrade hasn't been seen publicly in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevi became famous in the late 1980s, singing brashly of  
youthful frustration -- ``To the devil with school! To the devil 
with the teacher!'' -- and of sexual liberation. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevi's lawyer, Francisco Gastelum, said he was with the singer  
and Andrade at a home in Casas Grandes, about 75 miles south of the 
Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had every intention of presenting ourselves to the  
authorities for questions,'' but after receiving word that there 
was an arrest warrant, ``we immediately decided to hide,'' Gastelum

<HEADLINE> Board of Trade Going For-Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade's board of directors  
has voted to consider changing the world's largest futures exchange 
from membership-only to a publicly traded entity. 
</P>
<P>
	In an acknowledgment that it faces heavy competition from  
overseas and domestic exchanges as well as all-electronic systems, 
the board voted late yesterday to begin assessing the viability of 
becoming a for-profit organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unprecedented competitive environment we face dictates  
beyond doubt that we need to consider alternative structures,'' 
Board of Trade Chairman David Brennan said in a letter to members 
released today. ``We need the resources and flexibility to assure 
that our customers continue to prefer using CBOT markets rather 
than our competitor's systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the issue is a thorny one and is likely to face heavy  
opposition from members who would see a 151-year tradition of 
governance disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, people who want to buy and sell  
futures and options purchase a ``seat'' on exchanges for hundreds 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in turn, offers them the opportunity for massive profits  
that do not have to be shared with others. They also get a chance 
to approve the exchange's executives and board of directors and 
have a major say in any undertakings as owners of the Board of 
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brennan has apparently joined his predecessor, Patrick  
Arbor, in believing the current system is too unwieldy and hampers 
the exchange from making quick responses to competitive threats. 
The idea of becoming for-profit first surfaced nearly two years ago 
but was quickly shelved amid member dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures are promises to buy or sell a certain quantity of a  
certain item at a set time in the future. Traders bet they will 
make money if the daily price of the good being bought rises or 
falls in the interim. The system helps set the market price for 
everything from corn and soybeans to hedging risks on Treasury 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agriculture products that made the exchange a world  
leader have since been replaced in importance by trading of 
financial futures and options, such as Treasury bonds, which have 
made face-to-face trading less important. 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Trade membership in June approved an alliance with  
all-electronic rival Eurex of Germany, albeit with great 
reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange also faces competitive threats domestically  
-- from the Nasdaq Stock Market, which is considering launching 
competitive contracts from its wide terminal system and from 
brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, which already has. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to a for-profit company, however, could take months or  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues that must be addressed is what the new  
governance structure would look like and how to separate trading 
rights from ownership and assess a dollar value to each. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange said a task force will begin analyzing those  
issues.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Say FAA Computers Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's air traffic control system has  
been deemed free of the Year 2000 computer bug, the Transportation 
Department announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	System repairs completed by June 30 have been examined and  
approved by Science Applications International Corp., an 
independent contractor, and the department inspector general, an 
in-house watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
	The certification was something of a turnaround for the FAA and  
a bright spot for the Transportation Department, both of which have 
endured harsh criticism by Congress and outside groups for a lack 
of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	One on congressional report card, the Transportation Department  
repeatedly has gotten an ``F'' for readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Some older computers were designed to recognize dates in a  
two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 1999. There is widespread 
concern computers not updated may malfunction on New Year's Eve, 
when 1999 turns to 2000 -- which some computers may misconstrue as 
1900 instead of the start of the new century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration has 628 computer systems. Of  
that total, 424 were designated ``mission critical,'' meaning they 
played a vital role in the agency's operations. Of those 424 
systems, 152 required Year 2000 repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency conducted a live test of its repairs in Denver in  
April. It plans to continue testing its systems and contingency 
plans for the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Accused at Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Fueling a nagging controversy over Lance Armstrong,  
currently leading the Tour de France, Le Monde newspaper again 
reported today that traces of a banned anti-inflammatory drug had 
been detected in the American's urine. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor on the medical commission of the International Cycling  
Union, however, repeated that no cases of improper drug use had 
been uncovered, which could mean that any rider who tested positive 
for such a drug has a medical waiver for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily said Armstrong was tested July 4, the day after he won  
the race prologue, and that traces were found of a corticosteroid. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs which  
are not classed as steroids, but are considered banned substances 
unless prescribed by doctors for specific medical conditions such 
as asthma. Asthma inhalers, for instance, contain the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	If the report is confirmed, the next question would be whether  
Armstrong has a medical certificate allowing him to take a drug 
that is normally banned. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Le Monde reported that a number of riders had been  
found to have traces of corticosteroids in their urine, including 
Armstrong, who has made a remarkable comeback from testicular 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's news to me,'' Armstrong said Tuesday in a TV interview.  
``I haven't heard that. They haven't told me. This is the first I 
know of this.'' He said again that he has taken no medication for 
several years, since his cancer treatment in late 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor with the anti-doping commission of the cycling union  
reached by The Associated Press, would not confirm or deny that 
traces of corticosteroids had been found in Armstrong's urine. But 
he indicated that if it were true, Armstrong was covered by a 
medical certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Schattenberg confirmed that a number of cyclists had traces  
of corticosteroids, but that ``all doping tests conducted since the 
prologue have been negative.'' Armstrong has been tested a number 
of times throughout the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Any case of drug use discovered would immediately be announced,  
Schattenberg said.

<HEADLINE> Greece To Name New Head for 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The president of the International Olympic  
Committee said Wednesday the Greek government assured him it will 
appoint a new head of the organizing committee for the 2004 
Olympics in Athens during the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Antonio Samaranch said his assurances came from Prime  
Minister Costas Simitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stratis Stratigis, resigned as president two weeks ago after  
reportedly feuding with the government over his intention to attend 
the wedding of the daughter of Greece's deposed king in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who was in Athens to attend an annual ceremony of the  
Olympic Academy, was met at the airport by the Organizing 
Committee's managing director, Costas Bakouris. The IOC president 
dismissed reports that he was concerned over the vacancy. ``I am 
not concerned. Everything is going well,'' media quoted him as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no official word on possible successors to  
Stratigis. Among those mentioned are Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, 
who led the city's successful bid to host the games.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Takes Icarus-Like Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For three decades, Kim Woo-choong was  
South Korea's rising star. 
</P>
<P>
	A self-proclaimed workaholic who liked to boast he had never  
taken a day off, Kim loved doing business. In a span of 32 years, 
Kim built Daewoo from a one-room textile exporter to the nation's 
second largest conglomerate, a company with $65 billion in assets 
that produces goods as diverse as ships, cars, electronics, clothes 
and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, however, Kim's star fell, his Daewoo narrowly  
averting the biggest bankruptcy in South Korean history -- a failure 
that government officials feared would send the country's economy 
plunging into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The near collapse laid bare the truth of what Koreans liked to  
call the ``Kim Woo-choong myth,'' the belief that his success was 
built on hard work, entrepreneurship and globe-spanning vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Icarus of Greek legend who tried to reach the sun on  
wax wings, Kim, 63, built his empire on billions of dollars in 
short-term loans that melted away in the heat of a crippling 
business downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Daewoo's creditors agreed to delay repayment of $8.3  
billion in debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new loans 
to keep the teetering conglomerate afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, Daewoo hopes to sell enough of its 40  
subsidiaries to overcome its liquidity problem -- a task many 
analysts say it is not likely to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's cosmetic, no solution at all,'' said Suh Sung-won, head  
of research at SG Securities in Seoul. ``Creditors were desperate 
but found no solution, so they decided to give themselves six more 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the hurriedly put-together rescue plan, experts smelled a  
deep-seated government fear that if Daewoo failed, it would drag 
down the entire nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government controls many of Daewoo's creditor banks, either  
directly or indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo and four other family-owned conglomerates, known as  
chaebol, generate a combined $298 billion in sales annually, 
compared to South Korea's gross domestic product of $375 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of suppliers, retailers and wholesalers depend on  
business with Daewoo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Daewoo goes down, the whole economy will shake,'' said Lee  
Pil-sang, an economist at Seoul's Korea University. ``The 
government is putting off the pain for six months. But will the 
pain disappear in six months? I seriously doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Daewoo has been a crisis waiting to happen.  
</P>
<P>
	As it pushed its overseas expansion drive, its debt soared from  
$19 billion in 1995 to $50 billion last year, more than five times 
its equity. That excludes an estimated $10 billion its foreign 
joint-ventures have borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Kim always managed to find loans, with government  
backing, to finance his new ventures. Indeed, debt-driven expansion 
was a common strategy for South Korean conglomerates that 
spearheaded the country's dramatic rise from the ashes of the 
1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	But few have practiced it more aggressively than Daewoo.  
</P>
<P>
	Starting out as a textile salesman in 1967, Kim built his empire  
largely through taking over troubled companies at home, using his 
well-oiled connections with past authoritarian governments. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, Kim's ambition became even loftier. Under his  
slogan of ``global management,'' Daewoo went on a worldwide 
shopping spree, buying dilapidated auto and home appliance plants 
in former communist countries and Third World nations. At the 
height of Kim's overseas drive, Daewoo took over one company every 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo now runs 600 overseas companies and is a household name  
in much of Eastern and Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Daewoo, it's has always been borrowing, borrowing and  
expanding, expanding. Making profits was a second priority,'' said 
Lee of Korea University. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo's trouble began when Asia's financial crisis engulfed  
South Korea in late 1997 and banks began tightening their purses. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also then that Kim made a fatal policy mistake and  
angered the government of President Kim Dae-jung, who is urging the 
bloated conglomerates to slim down. While other conglomerates were 
selling assets and focusing on profitability, Daewoo continued to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the developing world's demand for cheap cars, TV sets  
and other goods Daewoo produces did not grow as rapidly as Kim had 
expected. Smelling trouble, creditors began calling in short-term 
loans that accounted for more than half of its total borrowing. In 
August alone, $6.4 billion in loans came due. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo came to the government with both hands up.  
</P>
<P>
	If Daewoo fails to keep its promise of reform within six months,  
the government says, creditors will start breaking up the 
conglomerate by disposing of $8.42 billion of stock and real estate 
Daewoo put up as collateral, including Kim's personal stock worth 
$1.04 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate to persuade creditors to give him more time, Kim vowed  
to either restructure the conglomerate by the end of this year or 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether Daewoo can meet the deadline is a big question,'' said  
Lee Chae-kwang, a senior analyst at Daiwa Securities SBCM Co. 
Daewoo's ability to raise enough new financing in the short term is 
doubtful because most of its subsidiaries on the chopping block are 
only marginally profitable at best, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim may be fighting his last battle.''

	JFK Jr. To Be Buried at Sea  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Navy divers found the bodies of John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law in the wreckage of 
Kennedy's plane today, and his family prepared to return him to the 
sea for burial. The victims' families endured a painful, five-day 
vigil before the three bodies were finally brought to the shore of 
Cape Cod and taken to the medical examiner's office for autopsies. 
A Navy destroyer, the USS Briscoe, was headed to Cape Cod for 
Kennedy's burial at sea at 9 a.m. tomorrow, sources said. Kennedy 
was piloting his plane with his wife, Carolyn, and her sister 
Lauren Bessette, when it crashed Friday night.

<HEADLINE> MP3.com Shares Soar in First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Investors eagerly snapped up shares of Internet  
music company MP3.com Inc. on its first day of trading Wednesday, 
proving once again that a high-tech company doesn't have to be 
profitable to attract money on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the initial public offering in MP3.com were priced at  
$28 and ended the day at $63.31 1/4 for a gain of more than 125 
percent. The stock, which trades under the symbol MPPP, reached as 
high as $105 before settling down. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the most actively traded stocks on the Nasdaq,  
which ended the day up 1.08 percent at 2761.77 
</P>
<P>
	The offering raised more than $774 million for the San  
Diego-based company, which offers free music that can be downloaded 
onto compact discs from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3.com is one of several new media companies that hope to  
parlay the digital technology used in the downloading process into 
a flourishing electronic commerce enterprise -- but some analysts 
have doubts about the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know where the impetus is on the part of the  
investors to put money on a company with really no revenues, no 
patent or exclusive technology that will protect them from 
competition, and really no expertise in the industry,'' said 
analyst Mark Hardie of Forrester Research, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company posted a loss of $1.4 million on revenues of  
$666,000 for the quarter ending March 31. Most of its income comes 
from advertising on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Recording industry officials blame the Internet music  
distributors and MP3 technology for an increase in song piracy and 
are working with software companies to develop secure methods of 
selling and distributing music online. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3.com officials -- who have said they intend to use the  
proceeds from the IPO for marketing and promotions, capital 
spending, and concert sponsorships -- are prohibited from discussing 
their prospects or immediate plans during a 25-day quiet period 
under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3.com, which offers free downloads of more than 100,000 songs  
from 18,000 Web sites, hopes to generate future income through 
increased advertising, online sales of CDs and music-related 
merchandise, promotional activity fees and selling consumer 
information collected through electronic-commerce, according to the 
prospectus for the IPO.

``reaffirms its conviction that it acted in full compliance with 
the relevant national and European laws, and consequently (the 
veto) will stay in force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges irregularities in a proposed alliance  
between the Champalimaud Group, which controls the insurer Mundial 
Confianca and three banks, and Spain's Banco Santander Central 
Hispano. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government has been accused of attempting to shield what  
is Portugal's second-largest financial group from a foreign 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission, the European Union's executive body, says the  
Portuguese veto appeared to violate rules on free competition 
within the 15-nation bloc as well as specific EU rules governing 
takeovers in the insurance sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission on Tuesday gave Portugal a month to clarify its  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	After the government blocked the alliance, Portugal's largest  
private bank, Banco Comercial Portugues, launched a takeover bid of 
$4.54 billion in cash for Mundial Confianca and the three banks.

<HEADLINE> Davis Wants His 'Vision' Implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has  
offended lawmakers of his own party by declaring in an interview 
that the Legislature's job is ``to implement my vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my vision that commanded a 20-point victory, the  
largest in 40 years,'' Davis told the San Francisco Chronicle's 
editorial board. ``People expect government to reflect the vision 
that I suggested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leader John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat, disagreed.  
``I think we're a government of checks and balances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic lawmakers' relationship with the first-term governor  
was already strained by his attempts to stall legislation. The 
Democrats have a majority in both the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Davis' fiercest critics pounced on his remarks as proof  
he has gotten carried away with his own power. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a monarchy, and Gray Davis is not the king,'' said  
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights, which thinks Davis should take a more aggressive approach 
toward HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis told the Chronicle in a story published Tuesday that  
members of the Assembly and Senate ``have a totally different view 
of the world than I do.'' Democratic lawmakers are generally more 
liberal than Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that because he won election last year in a landslide,  
the Legislature should defer to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their job is to implement my vision. That is their job,''  
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Moore, chairman of the Southern California Political  
Scientists Association, called Davis' remarks a ``slap in the 
face'' to the idea that the Legislature and governor share power. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the governor has  
``tremendous respect'' for the Legislature. Bustamante said the 
governor believed a ``significant portion'' of the interview was 
off the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle managing editor Jerry Roberts said he stands by the  
story.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Trade Speculated in Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Penny Hardaway met with Los Angeles Lakers  
executive Jerry West recently, fueling speculation the unrestricted 
free-agent guard might be reunited with former teammate Shaquille 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times and Orlando Sentinel reported the Lakers  
have considered adding Hardaway, possibly in a sign-and-trade deal 
with the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black confirmed Wednesday that West met  
with Hardaway last week, but he wouldn't comment on what was 
discussed or what the meeting was about. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as a potential deal is concerned, Black said, ``We won't  
comment on any potential trades or free-agent signings as per club 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, who turned 28 Sunday, and the 27-year-old O'Neal  
combined to lead Orlando to the 1995 NBA Finals against Houston, 
which swept the Magic in four games. O'Neal signed a free-agent 
deal with the Lakers in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers are over the salary cap, meaning the only way they  
could pay Hardaway anything close to market value would be to work 
out a sign-and-trade deal with the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	One name mentioned as a possibility in that scenario is Glen  
Rice. The Lakers recently picked up their $7 million option on Rice 
for next season.

<HEADLINE>  Stroke Hospitalizes Suharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Former President Suharto, who ruled  
Indonesia for 32 years, was talking, sitting up and receiving 
visitors in his hospital room today, a day after suffering a mild 
stroke, doctors and friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors carried out tests including a CT scan on the 78-year-old  
retired five-star general and said his condition had improved since 
being hospitalized Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudjono Martoatmodjo, the director of Pertamina Hospital, said  
Suharto had been scheduled to undergo a yearly checkup, but on 
Tuesday complained of a headache. 
</P>
<P>
	``He agreed to go to hospital and after being examined, the  
doctors found that he had suffered a mild stroke,'' Sudjono said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a problem with blood vessels in his brain, but he can  
still talk and we hope that he will improve today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said patients suffering a stroke of Suharto's type had a 50  
percent chance of full recovery and the ex-president could be back 
to normal within a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon said Suharto was able to  
sit up in bed. Only close relatives were allowed to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Post quoted sources close to Suharto's family as  
saying he had collapsed in his bathroom at his residence in central 
Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, who like many Indonesians uses one name, was forced to  
step down last year amid riots and protests against his 
authoritarian reign and mishandling of Indonesia's worst economic 
crisis in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Long criticized for his human rights record and undemocratic  
ways, Suharto has denied allegations that he misused his power to 
enrich himself, his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his resignation, he has led a reclusive life and has  
rarely talked publicly.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *This Week's Editorial Excerpts    	
</P>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	July 16  
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on Israeli Prime Minister Barak's  
peace efforts: 
</P>
<P>
	Peace-minded Arabs throughout the region have high expectations  
for Israel's newly sworn prime minister, former armed forces chief 
Ehud Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	Those hopes were reinforced when, three days after being sworn  
into office, he commenced a whirlwind diplomatic tour to stress his 
commitment to peace and meet with the leaders of Syria, Jordan and 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Those good intentions may be hurt by his call for Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat to abandon his request for the full and 
immediate implementation of the Wye River memorandum, an 
American-brokered land-for-security deal concluded last fall in 
Wye, Md. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, understandably, is looking for the path of least  
political resistance around Israeli factions opposed to dealing 
with Palestinians. But it's unrealistic to expect Arafat, who has 
similar domestic political problems and who has had to negotiate 
with a succession of Israeli prime ministers, to go back to square 
one. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Israel has a leader willing to seriously consider  
peaceful coexistence with Palestinians. Safety, freedom of movement 
and self-governance are pivotal to new progress in a long-stalled 
peace process. 

</P>
<P>
	July 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald, on John F. Kennedy Jr.:  
</P>
<P>
	Collectively, America gasped: John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife,  
Carolyn, and her sister Lauren Bessette dead. 
</P>
<P>
	As a toddler John-John captured the nation's heart playing under  
the desk of his father, the 35th President -- and then its grief 
with a poignant final salute. ... 
</P>
<P>
	For much of America John F. Kennedy Jr. was, as is his sister,  
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, a special person -- the progeny 
through which a venerated President's ideals and inspiration might 
spring back to life. Yet Mr. Kennedy got no closer to politics than 
to establish George, a slick magazine blending politics and 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	What he might have become and achieved -- given a longer,  
forgiving life -- now passes to speculation adding to the mystique 
of a family that reflects America's hopes and despairs. 

</P>
<P>
	July 20  
</P>
<P>
	Journal Star, Peoria, Ill., on moon-walk anniversary:  
</P>
<P>
	In a heartbreaking symbiosis, of sorts, today we celebrate the  
occasion of man's walking on the moon while simultaneously mourning 
the son of the president who first challenged America to tackle 
that frontier. Triumph and tragedy sometimes move hand in hand, 
stride for stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Adventure has its risks, as we sadly recognize now with the  
passing of John F. Kennedy Jr. and as those involved with this 
nation's space program are quick to remind us in this era of 
seemingly routine space travel. But just because mankind's search 
for fullness and meaning entails some danger does not mean we 
should cease testing our limits. We must go on, while learning from 
the bad fortune that sometimes makes us question our pursuits. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 20  
</P>
<P>
	The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on moon landing anniversary:  
</P>
<P>
	``The Eagle has landed,'' astronaut Neil Armstrong told America  
and the world 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those four words described one of mankind's most audacious,  
remarkable feats: the Apollo 11 manned space flight and the landing 
of Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon. Although it was followed 
by other landings on the moon, nothing ever approached the drama 
and the importance of the first one. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the drama of the moment. When the cool-thinking  
Armstrong realized that the computer navigation would set Eagle, 
the lunar lander, down among dangerous boulders in a gaping crater, 
he acted. A crash landing or even an awkward one would have damaged 
the landing struts and left both astronauts forever stranded on the 
moon. Instead, Armstrong manually guided the craft, landing it 
flawlessly in a flat area in the Sea of Tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the political importance of the landing. It  
symbolized victory in a propaganda-rich technological race with 
Cold War roots. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, there was the irony and drama of the era and the year  
in which the landing took palce. In 1969 the nation was divided by 
the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. Competing visions of 
America tore violently at the national fabric; the country appeared 
to be coming apart at the seams of race, class and generation. Yet, 
in the middle of seemingly endless chaos, American technology and 
will had produced a spectacular result. 
</P>
<P>
	For one day the vast differences dividing the country, if not  
forgotten, were at least suspended, as Americans, joined by others 
across the world, watched the events unfolding on the moon in awe. 
Viewers realized they were watching a momentous event, not just in 
American history, but in the history of humanity. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 19  
</P>
<P>
	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on U.S. foreign aid:  
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of years ago, people who railed against human greed  
were called prophets. Today they're dismissed as whiners. Consider 
Brian Atwood, erstwhile director of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development. During his six years as the nation's 
foreign-aid chief, Atwood preached a gospel of strategic generosity 
that should have converted all who heard it. But few in Congress 
got his religion, and now the man himself has quit the pulpit. It's 
a shame to think that the last voice for sharing America's bounty 
with the world has left the Washington wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's more of a shame that Washington's leaders wouldn't heed  
the call. As Atwood noted in leaving his job earlier this month, 
America's foreign-aid budget has long been the plaything of the 
GOP's ``conservative fringe.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	If they cared, they wouldn't be crowing about Atwood's departure  
-- and about the damage they've done to America's foreign-aid 
effort. In the last eight years, the staff of Atwood's agency has 
been cut by a third. The budget has declined from $14.1 billion to 
$13.7 billion over the same stretch -- quite a dramatic drop when 
inflation is considered. And if the Senate has its way, the budget 
will be hacked another 6 percent next year. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 16  
</P>
<P>
	Times Recorder, Zanesville, Ohio, on prisoner's last words:  
</P>
<P>
	Condemned prisoners may or may not have a constitutional right  
to voice their last words just before their execution, but it seems 
only right they be permitted to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal suit  
against a 1997 Ohio law requiring convicts to put their last words 
in writing six hours before they die. 
</P>
<P>
	The law may be well-intended, but it is silly and inhumane.  
</P>
<P>
	A person facing imminent execution has one last opportunity to  
be a human being. In Ohio, that last chance has been turned into an 
essay contest. 

</P>
<P>
	July 5  
</P>
<P>
	The Intelligencer, Wheeling, W.Va., on TV labels and kids:  
</P>
<P>
	In a clever appeal to the Yuppie culture of wanting to do just  
the right thing for kids, the television industry packages a great 
deal of kids' programming as ``educational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as a new study from the Annenberg Center at the University  
of Pennsylvania notes, a lot of programs labeled as ``educational'' 
are dandelions sold as roses. 
</P>
<P>
	Shows such as ``Duck Tales'' and ``Hercules'' are called  
``educational'' by some broadcasters, even though the program's 
creators don't claim as much. Even ``NBA Inside Stuff'' has the 
``educational'' label. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, only about one-third of children's  
programming that is labeled as ``educational'' in station filings 
with the Federal Communications Commission actually is highly 
educational. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more disturbing, however, is the coarse content of many  
supposed ``kids'' shows. Forty-five percent of children's programs 
available in the 1998-99 season contained one or more instances of 
problematic language, and 12 percent had one or more instances of 
sexual innuendo. For kids' programs the only acceptable number 
should be zero. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, of course, is that TV still is TV, and if it  
was a ``vast wasteland'' when then-FCC Commissioner Newton Minnow 
decried its content a generation ago, then it is even worse now. 
</P>
<P>
	The best thing any parent could do for a child is to throw out  
the TV and buy a few good books. 

</P>
<P>
	July 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Hillary Clinton's use  
of military planes: 
</P>
<P>
	In his column ... Paul Greenberg notes that Air Force One, the  
presidential jet, has virtually become Hillary Clinton's campaign 
plane for a run for the Senate from the state of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Republican National Committee, she has flown  
Air Force One and other military planes 11 times to destinations in 
New York state at a cost to taxpayers of $220,555. According to the 
White House, she is not flying commercial airlines because military 
planes provide better security. 
</P>
<P>
	Once she starts her campaign for the Senate, she will be  
required to reimburse the Treasury for her use of military aircraft 
and other government services provided to her as first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	So it's not surprising that the first lady calls her virtual  
campaign trips to New York at the taxpayers' expense ``listening 
tours.'' 

</P>
<P>
	July 15  
</P>
<P>
	The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin, on tattoos:  
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts is one of only three states that prohibit artistic  
tattooing. (The others are Oklahoma and North Carolina.) But soon, 
that could change: A bill to permit the process has survived 
committee review and gone on to the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Civil libertarians are also challenging the ban in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Tattoos, of course, are not just for sailors anymore; Madonna  
and Dennis Rodman have them, as do numerous other prominent 
figures. Former Secretary of State George Shultz has long been 
rumored to have a tiger tattoo, a legacy of his Princeton days. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Teenagers get tattoos as a rite of passage. Adults get them as a  
change of pace. In fact, tattoos have become so thoroughly middle 
class that, before long, a sign of rebellion may be the decision 
not to get one. So why, in otherwise liberal Massachusetts, does a 
prohibition of this widely accepted practice still exist? 
</P>
<P>
	The Bay State's ban took hold in the 1960s, after a hepatitis  
scare. But since then, sterilization procedures have improved. Most 
states have found that it simply makes more sense to regulate the 
practice than permit it to flourish underground, as it does 
nowadays in Massachusetts. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This is one case in which normally progressive Massachusetts is  
behind the times. The state should lift its prohibition on 
tattooing. If new safety concerns emerge from the FDA study, the 
issue can easily be revisited. 

</P>
<P>
	July 19  
</P>
<P>
	Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on North Korea's missile launch:  
</P>
<P>
	There is no tangible sign from North Korea that it intends to  
stop preparations for the launch of a new ballistic missile, 
despite repeatedly voiced concerns and warnings from Japan, the 
United States and South Korea. The North's defiance is extremely 
regrettable. 
</P>
<P>
	It is important to recognize that the North's development and  
deployment of missiles threatens the safety of Japan and South 
Korea, and is extremely damaging to the security of not only 
Northeastern Asia but of the world as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlined strategy toward the North of Japan, the United  
States and South Korea, is to extend aid and improve relations on 
condition that the North abandons the development and possession of 
nuclear weapons and missiles. Such a policy to pursue dialogue will 
become more effective when it is backed by a firm diplomatic stance 
that would involve taking measures disadvantageous to the North if 
the country heads in the opposite direction to peace and stability. 

</P>
<P>
	July 20  
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on Taiwanese President Lee  
Teng-hui's recent reference to Taiwan and China as separate states: 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Lee is risking not only the success which Taiwan has  
achieved in the past decades, but also regional stability. That is 
why both the U.S. and Japan have reiterated their adherence to the 
one-China policy. Beijing is responding with carefully-calibrated 
steps to sustain the pressure on Taiwan. (Chinese) President Jiang 
Zemin's reminder -- made in conversation with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton -- that the use of force remains an option for China, should 
focus minds in Taipei. Taiwanese ignore that at their peril. 

</P>
<P>
	July 20  
</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on China and Taiwan:  
</P>
<P>
	The revived tension between China and Taiwan recalls the early  
stages of the confrontation in 1996, when Chinese military 
exercises, including the firing of missiles, came close to sealing 
the Taiwan Strait to international shipping and prompted the U.S., 
after weeks of anxious dithering, to deploy two carrier groups as a 
deterrent. For new as well as familiar reasons, it could be 
dangerous to let matters get that far this time round. 
</P>
<P>
	... All parties need to be extremely careful. This is more  
dangerous than many of the Cold War standoffs in Europe. China may 
not yet have the capacity for a conventional invasion; but it is 
inherently more likely to try to overwhelm Taiwan by force than the 
Soviet Union, at least after the Berlin airlift, ever was to invade 
Germany. Language in these circumstances is highly sensitive. 

</P>
<P>
	July 20  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	The West has made clear that Slobodan Milosevic has no place in  
its vision of a peaceful, democratic Balkans, yet it is failing to 
press home the advantage gained by victory. Behind the hesitancy 
lies the fear of disintegration that has bedeviled policy towards 
the old Yugoslavia since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the West opposed the breakup of the Titoist federation  
lest it set a precedent for the Soviet Union. The same mindset is 
apparent in the refusal to endorse independence for Kosovo and the 
tentative support for Montenegro's attempt to attenuate its links 
with Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic is odious, self-determination is desirable, but  
maintaining the constitutional status quo is more important than 
both: thus the message of Western conservatism. Despite the 
rhetoric about the iniquity of the Yugoslav president, it is as if 
we were happiest with the devil we know. 

</P>
<P>
	July 19  
</P>
<P>
	Le Matin, Lausanne, Switzerland, on death of John F. Kennedy  
Jr.: 
</P>
<P>
	The star system is doing fine. The richest country in the world,  
the United States, is mourning the disappearance of a man who was 
good but didn't do much either for his planet or for his country, 
or even for himself. John Kennedy Jr. was only the modest editor of 
a periodical. But he was the son of a mythical character, of an 
American president killed in circumstances which elicited a lot of 
ink, and the nephew of another pretender to the White House, Bob 
Kennedy, also assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	These ingredients were enough to make the well-behaved young  
playboy a peerless personality. America saw in him what it had 
never had -- a dynasty. John-John could have been a third candidate 
for the presidency. That would have made people dream of 
traditional values, the sort which allow a family, then a clan, 
then a tribe and finally a nation to believe somehow in the 
permanence of its civilization. 
</P>
<P>
	The tears cried by the Americans are like those cried by the  
English after the tragic death of their princess, Lady Diana. 
Across the Atlantic, they are mourning a prince who was never 
crowned. 
</P>
<P>
	The irony is that those tears are set to benefit the enemy clan  
of this Democratic family: the Bush family, conservatives who are 
probably counting on this reassuring desire for `historical 
continuity' in the forthcoming elections. 

</P>
<P>
	July 20  
</P>
<P>
	Corriere Della Sera, Milan, Italy, on death of John F. Kennedy  
Jr.: 
</P>
<P>
	Families tend to conserve the power, money, authority and  
prestige gained by their founders. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States in recent times this phenomenon has assumed  
immense proportions. The two children of ex-President George Bush 
have become governors and one of them wants the White House. 
Elizabeth Dole, wife of the senator who was the Republican 
candidate in the last presidential election, has aspirations to the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	And now there is the case of John F. Kennedy Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	The young Kennedy was a pleasant, intelligent man full of  
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion provoked by his end reminds one of that caused by  
the loss of Diana, Princess of Wales. Together beauty, success and 
death create an irresistible combination. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kennedy case there is something more: The apparent  
conviction of a part of American society that the Kennedys are a 
hatchery of leaders, a genetic resource for the future of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	All this in a nation that discharged the king of England.

hereditary prince it reminds itself that it is a republic.

	Haaretz, Jerusalem, on Mideast peace agreement:  
</P>
<P>
	The disputed points have been debated to death, the conditions  
for compromise are known and many of them have already been agreed 
upon. Even the Netanyahu government was aware of the need for a 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria, 
and the need for territorial compromise and the establishment of a 
Palestinian state on most of the West Bank. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is to be hoped that as soon as Barak returns from his  
sucessful trip to the United States, he will immediately appoint 
his negotiating teams and instruct them to arrive at a proper 
arrangement, without unnecessary delays.

<P>
	The Jordan Times, Amman, on Mideast peace:  
</P>
<P>
	The signals coming from Damascus that it is readying itself for  
comprehensive regional peace among all regional parties are many 
and strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent and most significant was (the) news that Syria  
has sent a message to Palestinian factions opposed to the Middle 
East peace process advising them to refrain from military 
activities (and) instead focus on political operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The message embedded in this single piece of ``advice'' are  
many. It is a de facto extension of the olive branch ... to Israel 
and other neighboring states. ... 
</P>
<P>
	As it seems that the Palestinian factions will accept their new  
directives, we can't help but feel the region that has just climbed 
another rung on the ladder to comprehensive peace.''

	The Australian, Sydney, on 30th anniversary of moon landing:  
</P>
<P>
	... The Apollo 11 mission is worthy of commemoration as a rare  
feat that truly benefited humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was enormously expensive. ... It was also motivated  
by politics and fear after Russia shocked the world by launching 
the first satellite into orbit and then sending the first man into 
space. Yet its value was as much in testing and extending the 
limits of the human spirit as any material gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The technological benefits have been impressive. ... In hardware  
terms the moon missions ultimately delivered satellites that affect 
every aspect of our lives. The science also delivered miniaturized 
computer technology, sophisticated insulation and advances that led 
to ultrasound and laser surgery techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet some of the most important gains are not so easily measured.  
The Apollo landing bestowed to all mankind the precious gifts of 
inspiration and wonder. An entire generation, eyes fixed to 
television screens, was suddenly convinced that if a man could walk 
on the moon, anything was indeed possible. ...

<HEADLINE> Phillies Recall Triple-A Catcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies recalled catcher  
Bobby Estalella from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said the move was made because of starting catcher Mike  
Lieberthal's discomfort in his right elbow, which he hyperextended 
while swinging the bat several days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal is to undergo an MRI on Thursday, and team physician  
Dr. Michael Ciccotti will examine him as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal has not been placed on the disabled list. To make  
room for Estalella, right-hander Joe Grahe has been optioned to 
Scranton. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the fourth stint in the majors for the 24-year-old  
Estalella, who has 14 home runs and 33 RBIs in 211 at-bats during 
67 big league games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Scranton, he was batting .232 in 74 games with eight home  
runs, 16 doubles, and 37 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Guards Accused in Inmate Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- An inmate sentenced to die for killing  
a prison guard in 1987 was beaten to death in his cell over the 
weekend by prison guards, according to authorities who have started 
a murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Valdez was found dead in his cell at the Florida State  
Prison in Starke after a brawl Saturday. Prosecutors said he had 
broken ribs and boot marks on his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine guards have been suspended pending an investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim Moore, commissioner of the state Department of Law  
Enforcement, said his agents were questioning the guards, trying to 
find ``somebody to come forward and tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for them to decide who wants to be a  
defendant and who wants to be a witness,'' he said Wednesday. ``And 
I'm talking about a defendant in a murder trial, not a minor 
infraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valdez, 36, shot and killed a prison guard while trying to help  
a friend break out. Valdez was free at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in a prison wing for particularly violent prisoners and  
had been known as a troublemaker. Guards said he had been found 
with knives in his cell in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the guards acknowledged a fight in which Valdez was  
badly bruised but said that the injuries didn't lead to his death 
and that Valdez was given a checkup and cleared to return to his 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Johnson, a police union lawyer for the guards, said Valdez  
climbed on the bars and flung himself to the floor several times. 
He was being monitored and officers found him on the floor 
unconscious. They entered his cell and found him not breathing, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said during searches of guards' homes, law enforcement  
officers seized the clothes and boots they were wearing the day 
Valdez died.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Beck Returns After 8 1/2 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rod Beck jogged out of the Chicago Cubs'  
clubhouse and headed straight for the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
	After two months off, he couldn't wait to get back to work.  
</P>
<P>
	``It feels real good,'' he said. ``The arm feels good.  
Everything feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck was activated Wednesday from the disabled list, 8 1/2 weeks  
after surgery to remove bone spurs and several chips from his right 
elbow. The Cubs had expected him to be out 12 to 14 weeks, but Beck 
promised all along he'd return long before that. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he wanted to be back at Wrigley Field a few days ago,  
but the Cubs sent him to Triple-A Iowa for some additional 
rehabilitation work. In two games, he struck out six of the seven 
batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have him back,'' manager Jim Riggleman said.  
``Hopefully, he'll hold up fine. He's looked good in everything 
he's done so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck, who last year became just the fifth reliever to save 50  
games in a single season, won't go back to his closer role right 
away. Riggleman said he'll probably use him in middle-relief 
situations at first and see how he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to come in right now and get some guys out and  
just keep building,'' Beck said. ``Long-range, I do hope I'll get 
the chance to close again, and I think I will. But I know I have to 
earn it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck converted 51 of his 58 save opportunities last season and  
played a big role in Chicago's run for the NL wild-card berth. But 
he faltered at the start of the season, going 2-4 with four blown 
saves and a 10.54 ERA. He was even booed at home by Cubs fans after 
being one of their favorites last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, on May 17, the Cubs placed him on the disabled list. He  
had surgery five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what he was going through before the surgery,'' said  
teammate Terry Mulholland, who also played with Beck in San 
Francisco. ``I know what he's capable of now. It's good to see that 
happen to a guy like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bone spurs date back to Beck's days in San Francisco, and he  
said he's been taking medication for years to mask the pain. Now he 
doesn't have any pain, and his arm extension is the best its been 
since he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He even picked up some velocity during his rehabilitation. He  
was clocked at 92 mph in Iowa, the fastest he's thrown in at least 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my 500-game oil change and I'm ready to go,'' he said.  
``The load has been lifted off my shoulders, knowing I can go out 
there with a clear conscience. Everything's fixed. I'm 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring any further injuries, I should be able to put up the  
numbers I'm capable of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago sure can use him. Since June 9, the Cubs have gone 12-24  
and dropped to last place in the NL Central. Their 5.51 ERA is 
second-worst in the NL, and the relievers' have converted just 22 
of 40 save opportunities with a 5.73 ERA as the Cubs dropped 10 
games behind Houston in the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Beck's return) is going to pay a whole lot of  
dividends for him and for the ball club,'' Mulholland said. ``On 
the field, when Rod's healthy, you're not going to find many more 
closers better. Off the field, to have him in the clubhouse, it's 
the confidence and gung-ho attitude he has every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said he'll do what he can. And he pointed out that the Cubs  
went 5-2 in games he attended while on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it'll make a difference,'' he said. ``I'm not  
vocal. I just expect to win when I come to work every day.''

<HEADLINE> New Home Construction Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments fell  
sharply in June to the lowest level in just over a year, a possible 
sign that one of the economy's strongest sectors is beginning to 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started work last month on 1.57 million units at a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate, a drop of 5.64 percent from May, 
the Commerce Department said today. That marked the lowest level 
since May 1998, when new housing starts were at 1.541 million. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance followed a big jump in new home construction  
in May after having dipped sharply in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts had expected construction activity to hold steady  
in June. But some economists predicted a slightly decline, saying 
that recent upticks in mortgage rates could end up lowering 
builders' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing starts were down or held steady in most parts of the  
country, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The West suffered the biggest drop in new housing starts,  
falling 14.8 percent in June to 352,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The South reported a 4.6 percent decline in new housing starts  
to 701,000 units. Housing starts in the Northeast held steady at 
159,000 units in June and were actually up a small 0.3 percent in 
the Midwest to 359,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall decline in housing starts last month reflected a  
steep drop in the construction of single-family homes, but an 
increase in apartment construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Single-family home construction fell 8.7 percent in June to 1.27  
million units, while apartment construction rose 10 percent to 
297,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Home building and other construction activity, driven by low  
mortgage rates, were a key contributing factor to the strong 
economic growth in the early part of the year. Sales of new and 
existing homes had hit record highs during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pace of home sales has cooled in recent months,  
reflecting rising mortgage rates. Sales of new homes fell 5.1 
percent in May and sales of existing home dropped 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending also fell in May with decreases reported  
in single-family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and motels, and 
big government construction projects, the government reported 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, worried that the economy was not slowing  
quickly enough to keep inflation under control, increased interest 
rates on June 30. But economists are likely to view today's report 
as another reason why they believe the Fed won't increase rates 
again at its next meeting in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets were on alert pending Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan's appearance Thursday before the House Banking Committee, 
when he will deliver the Fed's mid-year report on prospects for 
economic growth and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report comes as home builders -- while optimistic about  
the prospects for home sales in the present and near term -- have 
voiced concerns about shortages of skilled construction workers and 
building materials, such as gypsum wallboard, insulation and, in 
some markets, bricks, the National Association of Home Builders 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	These shortages continue to cause problems and sometimes delay  
building schedules, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Home builders also have begun citing rising lumber prices and  
rising interest rates as other important concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates have been creeping up for the past two months.  
This year, their low of 6.74 percent was set at the end of January 
and their high of 7.71 percent was set at the beginning of July. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the number of new housing starts authorized by building  
permits -- a good barometer of future activity -- rose 1.9 percent in 
June.

<HEADLINE> EU Inspectors Raid Coke Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European Commission inspectors have raided  
Coca-Cola offices in four countries in a probe to determine whether 
the world's largest soft drink company is abusing its dominant 
position in the market, the Financial Times reported in Thursday's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials investigating the practices of Coke in Germany,  
Austria and Denmark this week raided offices in those countries, as 
well as in Britain, where the main bottler for Austria has its 
headquarters, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the raids were the beginning of an investigation  
into whether Coca-Cola abused its position in those markets by 
offering incentives to retailers to increase sales, carry the 
full-range of Coke products or stop selling competitors' drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola confirmed the raids had been conducted and said it was  
cooperating fully, the Financial Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission officials said the investigation is in its early  
stages and will determine if there is sufficient evidence to launch 
a full case against the soft drink maker, the newspaper said. If 
Coke was to be found guilty of the violations it would be subject 
to fines of up to 10 percent of the turnover of the businesses 
involved, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission also has written to retailers and  
distributors to seek their views. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the investigation is another blow to Coca-Cola in  
Europe. A health scare originating in Belgium last month saw Coke 
products removed from the shelves in four EU countries.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Hearst To Have Ankle Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers running back  
Garrison Hearst will have surgery to restore circulation to the 
ankle he broke last year, and expects to be off the field for most 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst will have the surgery Saturday in Baltimore. It will be  
performed by team physician Michael Dillingham and consulting 
physician Michael Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh said Tuesday that  
Hearst, who rushed for a team-record 1,570 yards last season, will 
need 14 to 16 weeks to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst was expected to make a full recovery after breaking his  
ankle on the team's first possession in their 20-18 playoff loss to 
the Atlanta Falcons. But as the new season approached, reports were 
grim -- circulation to the ankle was impaired, slowing healing, and 
Hearst might be forced to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the news in the last week or so has been more  
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	``Garrison's (latest) MRI revealed that circulation to the  
injured ankle has improved,'' said Walsh in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers on Tuesday signed former Philadelphia back Charlie  
Garner to a two-year, $1.44 million contract. They have been 
talking to controversial running back Lawrence Phillips, whose 
off-the-field legal problems cost him jobs with the Los Angeles 
Rams and Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, coming off a trouble-free, 1,000-yard season in  
Europe, would compete with Garner for the starting slot.

<HEADLINE> George Brett Bracing for Tears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- When George Brett is inducted into the  
Hall of Fame on Sunday, he'll be thinking about the two 
strong-willed men who shaped his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Brett, a stern father, had some definite ideas about how to  
play baseball. Charlie Lau, the Kansas City Royals' laconic batting 
coach, wanted to remake his son's entire approach to hitting. Jack 
Brett was saying not on your life. 
</P>
<P>
	It's little forks in the road like this that determine the  
destiny of young people, and, in this case, the destiny of a young 
expansion team as well. 
</P>
<P>
	If Brett hadn't made the right choice a quarter-century ago,  
Nolan Ryan and Robin Yount might be getting inducted this Sunday as 
merely a twosome. And a World Series flag would probably not be 
flying over Kauffman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, memories of those insecure days when his father was  
pulling in one direction and Lau was pulling in another -- and his 
future hung in the balance -- are sweet and vivid for the greatest 
player in Royals' history. While speaking of his father and his 
baseball mentor at a recent sports commission dinner, he nearly 
broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	It could happen again Sunday during his acceptance speech.  
</P>
<P>
	``Talking about teammates is going to be easy, I think,'' said  
the three-time American League batting champ. ``To talk about 
Whitey Herzog is going to be a no-brainer. But to talk about my 
father and Charlie is going to be tough. That's why I'm probably 
going to save them for last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although many fans may not realize it, Brett did not exactly  
look like a can't-miss prospect when the Royals first brought up 
the scatter-armed third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the 1974 season, he already had been sent back  
to the minors once and was barely hitting .200. Lau, who helped 
develop such major league stars as Kansas City's Hal McRae and Joe 
Rudi of the California Angels, took him under his wing and became a 
father-like figure to the young Californian. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad didn't like Charlie,'' Brett said. ``My dad thought  
Charlie was screwing me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lau had Brett, who never hit .300 in the minor leagues, get into  
a near-crouch and hold his bat almost level as he awaited the 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad called it the modified corkscrew stance,'' Brett said.  
``He said it would never work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reluctantly, George decided to do something the four Brett  
brothers almost never did while growing up -- defy his dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to convince him that when you're hitting .200 at the  
All-Star break and you're 21 years old, and you're making an error 
a game, I'd better start doing something offensively,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You made it to the major leagues because of what you  
accomplished in the minor leagues,'' Jack Brett argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did I accomplish in the minor leagues?'' George  
countered. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1976, Brett won his first batting title and was on his way to  
stardom as the Royals won their first of five AL West 
championships. 
</P>
<P>

	``He's my father, for crying out loud,'' Brett said. ``And I

<HEADLINE> State Rep. Probed Over Kosovo Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- When a state lawmaker left with fellow reservists  
on a military flight during the Kosovo crisis, a yellow ribbon was 
placed on his desk to symbolize hopes he would return safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The ribbon is gone: Rep. Tom Gordon came back from Europe last  
week, telling reporters that he had been held hostage by Serbs and 
had gone through ``six months of hell.'' And now the freshman 
legislator faces a federal investigation into how he got overseas 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions arose last weekend after Rep. J.D. Hayworth,  
R-Ariz., said he had fired Gordon from a part-time staff job 
because Gordon allegedly faked being called up by the Naval Reserve 
and had conned him out of a congressional travel voucher to get 
onto military flights to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action saddens me deeply,'' Hayworth said. ``But Rep.  
Gordon lied to me and my staff, and has acted in a manner that I 
believe is inconsistent with the high ethical standards people 
expect from their elected representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon did not return repeated calls from The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Republican was elected in 1998 to represent a  
rural district that stretches across northern Arizona and includes 
most of the Navajo Indian Reservation. His district is 
overwhelmingly Democratic, but Democrats ran only write-in 
candidates last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has said he joined the Naval Reserve in 1987 after active  
duty in the Navy from 1984 to 1987. Before he left, Gordon said he 
had served as a staff officer with a SEAL commando unit but was not 
a SEAL himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Naval Reserve officials said Wednesday that Gordon is a  
lieutenant commander but has been on inactive status since 1992, 
meaning he was not assigned to any unit and did not periodically go 
on active duty to drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayworth's travel pass got Gordon on a May 5 flight from the  
Arizona Air National Guard base to another Air Force base. He then 
flew on other military flights to the Balkans, said Joe Eule, 
Hayworth's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks later, Hayworth's office was contacted by a  
military officer in Europe who wanted to know who Gordon was and 
why he was engaged in unauthorized activities, Eule said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was tracked down last week in Sarejevo.  
</P>
<P>
	An FBI spokesman said the agency is conducting a preliminary  
criminal investigation, and Hayworth has urged Arizona House 
leaders to consider their own ethics probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who worked as a constituent liaison for Hayworth, has  
told reporters since Friday that he would make a public statement 
soon. In those interviews he has said he was held hostage by Serbs 
in Bosnia and could explain everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just come back from serving overseas and basically going  
through six months of hell,'' Gordon said. ``Lots of things need to 
be explained, and in due course, they will be. The only thing I'm 
going to do right now is spend time with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State House Speaker Jeff Groscost said Gordon assured him on  
Wednesday that he could explain everything. Groscost said he urged 
Gordon to provide written documentation by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to finding out exactly what's going on,''  
Groscost said. ``In talking to Tom, he feels that he can fill in 
the gaps and make this all understandable.''

<HEADLINE> United Parcel Service Planning IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- For the first time in its 92-year history,  
package delivery giant United Parcel Service wants to deliver a 
piece of itself to investors on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS, one of the largest privately held U.S. companies, announced  
plans Wednesday to sell 10 percent of its shares to the public by 
year's end. The move could raise about $2.5 billion, making it one 
of the largest initial public offerings of stock in history. 
</P>
<P>
	However, executives said they aren't as interested in raising  
money for a company that already has nearly $25 billion a year in 
revenue as they are in having publicly traded stock that they can 
exchange in acquisitions as they expand worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We carefully considered the challenges and opportunities of  
the changing marketplace for the future of our business,'' James P. 
Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of UPS said Wednesday in 
announcing the plans. ``We firmly believe that this plan positions 
UPS for continued leadership in an increasingly competitive 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees and retirees now own about two-thirds of the company  
while the founders' families and foundations own the remaining 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock offering of some 55 million shares is designed to  
allow current UPS shareowners to keep 90 percent of the total stock 
and control 99 percent of the voting shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans to go public surprised some analysts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone always kind of wondered if it would happen,'' said  
Alex Brand, an analyst for Scott and Stringfellow in Richmond, Va. 
``You kind of think if somebody gets to be $25 billion in revenues, 
why do they need to go public?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to create a pool of publicly held stock that UPS can  
use in acquisitions and other business deals, said UPS spokesman 
Norman Black. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need the money,'' Black said. ``We need a particular  
type of currency -- in this case, stock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UPS has decided to go public at the same time its No. 1 rival,  
Federal Express, is outperforming the market. FDX Corp., the parent 
of Federal Express, stock is up 48 percent over the last 12 months, 
compared with a 21 percent gain in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the UPS stock offering and UPS's reputation as a  
global giant will likely prove popular with investors, said Linda 
Killian, portfolio manager for the Renaissance IPO Fund, which 
focuses on initial offerings by privately held companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's likely to be attractive to mutual funds and pension funds  
as well as individual investors who have used the service and know 
what it does, unlike most Internet sites,'' Ms. Killian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UPS offering would rival the IPO of Goldman Sachs, the  
securities firm, which went public this year, raising $3.66 
billion, the second biggest initial offering ever. The largest IPO 
was last year's $4 billion offering by the oil company Conoco. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS plans seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange with the  
stock symbol ``UPS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UPS's ventures into electronic commerce, a hot issue on Wall  
Street, could also bolster the public offering, Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS controls 55 percent of deliveries of packages ordered over  
the Internet, according to documents the company filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	That alone ``is going to make a lot of institutional investors  
and retail investors make this a backdoor e-commerce play,'' Brand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS was founded in 1907 by James E. Casey as a messenger and  
delivery service in Seattle. Casey started the employee-stock 
ownership program 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, ownership in the company is divided into 546 million  
shares held by more than 125,000 shareowners. Kelly said each UPS 
share is worth $47, putting the value of the company at about $25.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Each business day, UPS delivers 12 million packages via its  
trademark brown trucks and brown-uniformed employees. The 
Atlanta-based company's decision to go public comes almost two 
years after a 15-day strike by the Teamsters union that all but 
shut down operations. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS has since recovered financially. The company earned $1.7  
billion last year, up 92 percent from $909 million in 1997, the 
year of the strike. Revenues last year totaled $24.8 billion, up 10 
percent from $22.5 billion in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Grissom's Capsule Lifted From Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Like a ghost, the Mercury space  
capsule emerged from its 38-year-old grave at the bottom of the sea 
and came back to shore today to begin a new life as a monument of 
space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	An underwater salvage team spent eight hours in darkness late  
Monday and early yesterday reeling in the Liberty Bell 7 flown by 
astronaut Gus Grissom, the second American in space. 
</P>
<P>
	It arrived by ship at Cape Canaveral this morning, the 38th  
anniversary of its sinking after splashdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition leader Curt Newport, who watched the capsule complete  
its three-mile trip back to the surface, described the experience 
as similar to traveling through time. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were diving on it, it was on the bottom, it was still  
1961. When we got it up to the surface, all of a sudden it was 
1999. So it was almost like having this thing punch to the surface 
through some type of time portal or something,'' he said in a 
ship-to-shore news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7 1/2-foot aluminum-and-titanium capsule sank after splashdown  
on July 21, 1961, when its hatch blew open prematurely and the 
spacecraft filled with water. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom narrowly escaped drowning, and insisted until his death  
in a 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he did nothing to cause the 
hatch to blow. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap forever marred Grissom's otherwise successful  
15-minute suborbital flight, which was the nation's second manned 
space shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport's team did not find the capsule's hatch, which could  
have shed light on whether the explosive bolts malfunctioned or 
whether Grissom activated them prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Liberty Bell 7 was safely aboard ship, Newport rummaged  
through the spacecraft, which had a sulfurous odor. He and a 
colleague noticed something shiny and found seven Mercury dimes 
Grissom carried into space as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule was quickly placed in a specially designed container  
filled with sea water to prevent corrosion. The spacecraft is to be 
trucked to the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center, where it will 
be taken apart and cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Discovery Channel, which financed the expedition at a  
cost of millions, will take it on a three-year tour before 
returning it to the Kansas museum for display. 
</P>
<P>
	Anything made of aluminum, like the control panels, had  
deteriorated. But considering the harsh conditions underwater, the 
capsule overall was in surprisingly good condition, particularly 
the fabric, Newport said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport located the spacecraft on May 1, about 300 miles  
southeast of Cape Canaveral. But he had to leave it there when the 
cable to the expedition's robot vessel snapped in rough seas. 
Newport and his crew went back to get the capsule this month. 
</P>
<P>
	When Newport finally located the capsule again, the ship's robot  
vessel was used to attach a sling to the capsule. Then, sturdy 
Kevlar cord was used to reel in the capsule, which weighed about 
3,000 pounds with the water inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb experts removed and threw overboard an explosive device in  
the capsule that was supposed to go off when the spacecraft sank in 
1961 to help NASA pinpoint its location. The device never 
detonated. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of problems recovering Liberty Bell 7 -- two days were  
wasted because of bad navigational data and the recovery vessel 
kept breaking -- Newport had no time to search for the hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer to the enduring mystery of why the hatch blew may  
have been in the inside-the-capsule camera that was running when 
Liberty Bell 7 splashed down. But the camera was found broken open 
and the film was ruined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's going to be any way to answer that  
question, ever,'' Newport said. He has no intentions of going back 
to look for the hatch: ``Finding the spacecraft was good enough.''

<HEADLINE> Rival NFL L.A. Groups Work Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rival groups led by billionaire Eli Broad and  
former Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz have agreed to present 
the NFL owners with a unified stadium design and site plan to help 
bring a team back to Los Angeles, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups also expect the NFL to contribute an estimated $150  
million toward the effort, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
The paper cited unnamed sources in reporting the developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad and Ed Roski led one of the groups vying for the league's  
32nd franchise, and Ovitz and food magnate Ron Burkle headed the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups have essentially been operating separately with  
competing ideas on how the stadium and Exposition Park should be 
revamped to accommodate the venture. NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue and some owners had suggested the groups work together. 
In May, Broad wrote a letter to the Ovitz team in an apparent 
overture to join forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the progress we have made,'' Ovitz said on  
Tuesday. ``Everybody is pitching in. We have been working very well 
with Broad partner Ed Roski and his associates. We're about as well 
organized as a group as we have ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has told Los Angeles it needed to come up with a  
feasible plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Goodell, the NFL's vice president of football operations,  
says the league is encouraged by what is going on in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a unified plan developing on how to bring  
the NFL back to this market on a successful basis,'' Goodell said. 
``The economic challenge we have here remains the most significant 
hurdle that we will have to address with the membership league 
owners, and that might include a league contribution to the 
project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL expects the Los Angeles stadium to cost $400 million,  
with an additional $150 million spent on additional parking, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Chadwick, who was appointed by Gov. Gray Davis to represent  
the state in the negotiations, has drafted a set of proposed terms 
outlining the details of an agreement between Sacramento and the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick said the league's willingness to pay a big portion of  
the tab for the stadium parking project at Exposition Park was a 
positive development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at this as the state,'' he said. ``If they're willing  
to contribute in excess of $100 million for the preservation and 
renovation of this state facility, that is a great, great thing. 
... This is money that goes into our property and our 
neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan that the Broad and Ovitz groups have agreed to present  
would include the construction of more than 15,000 parking spaces 
at the park in South-Central Los Angeles, creating a total of 
21,900 spaces, the paper said. The unified stadium design is only a 
slightly modified version of the one that Ovitz presented to the 
league during its meetings last month in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Report: VA Wastes $1 Million a Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs is wasting  
up to $1 million a day on unneeded medical facilities, and its 
proposal to fix the problem is unlikely to work, congressional 
investigators concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office report, obtained Wednesday, said  
the VA's proposed restructuring plan gives too much power to vested 
interests likely to compete against each other: medical schools, 
unions, veterans' organizations and state veterans agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The backdrop for the wasted spending is a VA hospital system  
that dropped from 49,000 patients a day in 1989 to 21,000 in 1998, 
with nearly half the decline occurring in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of VA hospitals is expected to ``decline significantly  
over the next 20 years,'' as the veteran population drops from the 
current 25 million to an estimated 16 million by 2020, said the 
report by Stephen P. Backhus, the GAO's expert on veterans health 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was submitted to a House Veterans Affairs  
subcommittee and obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Backhus said the VA ``could rely too heavily'' on those with  
special interests, called ``stakeholders,'' who ``may have vested 
interests in maintaining the status quo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The VA health care system's past experience ``suggests that this  
could result in a protracted decision-making process that continues 
the expenditure of scarce resources on unneeded buildings'' -- 
already totaling up to $1 million a day, Backhus said. 
</P>
<P>
	VA spokeswoman Laurie Trantner said in response, ``We recognize  
that the current health care delivery costs money and there's a 
potential for savings. We are working cooperatively with the 
(congressional) committees to reach a solution that will benefit 
veterans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said committees to be formed to help change the system  
``will balance local interests and national priorities that will 
serve local veterans' needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report will be formally presented at a House Veterans  
Affairs subcommittee hearing on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the subcommittee on  
oversight and investigations, said the agency must address 
``findings that one in four veterans' health care dollars'' is 
spent on operating and maintaining facilities that include ``empty 
old buildings and 5 million square feet of vacant space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said experts have described the VA health care system as  
``archaic, decrepit, dysfunctional and inefficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO gave the VA credit for beginning, in 1995, to transform  
itself from a hospital operator to a health care provider that 
relies on community-based medical and residential facilities and 
outpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the report said that over the next two  
decades, most VA health care buildings will approach or pass their 
useful life expectancy. More than 40 percent have already operated 
for more than 50 years, including almost 200 built before 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was sharply critical of the VA's proposal to form  
local committees that will determine their own leadership. Composed 
of members with potentially competing interests, the committees 
``could struggle to achieve consensus on difficult decisions 
affecting the status of VA hospitals and other health care 
assets,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our view, this arrangement could lead to conflict among the  
various stakeholders sitting on the committees if they attempt to 
protect their interests at the expense of the overall process,'' it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As examples, the report said medical schools might be reluctant  
to change long-standing business relationships, and unions could be 
reluctant to support staffing reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report instead suggested using full-time VA planners or  
consultants with ``no vested interests in the geographic area'' to 
recommend changes, in consultation with the ``stakeholders.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nazi Guard Loses U.S. Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 79-year-old retired aircraft worker was  
stripped of U.S. citizenship by a federal judge because of his 
service as a Nazi concentration camp guard during World War II, the 
Justice Department announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Negele, of St. Peters, Mo., was ineligible for U.S.  
citizenship because he served in the Nazi SS Death's Head Battalion 
as a guard of civilian prisoners at Sachsenhausen concentration 
camp near Berlin and at the Theresienstadt Jewish ghetto in 
Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, U.S. District Judge E. Richard Weber 
ruled Tuesday in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is a powerful affirmation that it is still  
possible to secure a measure of justice on behalf of the victims of 
Nazi inhumanity, despite the passage of many years,'' said Eli M. 
Rosenbaum, head of the department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special 
Investigations. ``Men like Negele helped ensure that victims of 
Nazi barbarism could not escape and thereby facilitated the 
perpetration of the Nazis' abominable crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negele can appeal the ruling. If he does not appeal or appeals  
unsuccessfully, the government will ask an immigration court to 
order him deported, Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's 91-page ruling cited expert testimony and documents,  
including captured Nazi personnel records, introduced by the 
government to show that Negele, who was born in Romania, 
voluntarily joined the Waffen SS in November 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, Negele admitted serving in the Waffen SS, but said he  
had been drafted, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sachsenhausen, which the court described as part of a Nazi  
program of ``annihilation through labor,'' Negele was selected for 
special training in the use of a guard dog, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SS regulations stated that dogs were trained to attack  
prisoners when ordered by their handlers, to subdue escaped and 
escaping prisoners and if necessary to ``bite without mercy.'' 
Thousands died there of overwork, starvation, disease, hanging, 
gassing, medical experiments and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Negele was transferred to the walled fortress town of  
Theresienstadt, which served as an internment camp and a collection 
center for Jews about to be moved by train to extermination at the 
Auschwitz and Treblinka death camps in Poland. Tens of thousands 
died in the ghetto of disease or starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the government, Negele admitted at trial he guarded  
the outside perimeter of Theresienstadt with the same dog he had at 
Sachsenhausen and that his job was to prevent escapes and to use 
the dog to catch escapees. 
</P>
<P>
	Negele entered the United States in 1950, using a visa obtained  
in Stuttgart. The court found that he concealed his guard service 
by falsely stating on that visa application that he had served in 
the German army. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. immigration law would have barred him from entering this  
country had he disclosed his service in the Waffen SS and as a camp 
and ghetto guard. The judge found that the U.S. citizenship he 
obtained in 1955 was procured illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the special investigations office began work in 1979, 63  
Nazi persecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship and 52 have 
been expelled from this country. Another 250 people are under 
investigation by the office.

<HEADLINE> Elliott's Illness Common Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The disease afflicting San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott is  
a common form of kidney disorder that affects thousands of 
Americans each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's doctors said Wednesday he needs a kidney transplant to  
avoid dialysis and the symptoms of focal segmental glomerular 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The disorder is a common disease that may cause permanent kidney  
failure in children and adults. Its cause is unknown in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 percent of adults with large amounts of protein in  
their urine will be found to have focal sclerosis, according to the 
National Kidney Foundation of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Focal sclerosis is one of more than 20 different kinds of  
glomerulonephritis, a disease that affects the kidneys' filtering 
units. Focal sclerosis in adults usually develops between the ages 
of 15 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms include fatigue, nausea and headache. If large amounts  
of protein are lost in the urine, swelling of the ankles and belly 
may occur, the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most patients with focal sclerosis progress to kidney failure  
and require dialysis treatments or kidney transplant. The process 
might take up to 20 years but generally occurs within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who progress to kidney failure generally are young and  
good candidates for kidney transplants. Focal sclerosis can in a 
minority of cases recur in the transplanted kidney, a more common 
occurrence when the donor is a blood relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lauren McDonald, kidney specialist at the Mockingbird  
Dialysis unit in Dallas, said the disease is not life-threatening 
if treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many patients with this illness that are able to  
lead normal lives,'' she said. ``However, the physical demands of a 
professional career may not be practical for him to pursue if he 
becomes sicker.''

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi To Sell Small SUV in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has joined the growing  
list of automakers with plans to introduce a small sport utility 
vehicle in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese automaker announced Wednesday that it will export a  
small SUV to the United States in two years, likely as a 2002 
model. It will compete with the successful Toyota RAV4 and Honda 
CR-V and will be preceded by new models from Ford Motor Co., Mazda 
Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``With anticipated growth of the SUV segment continuing through  
2005, we believe we need more than two models to meet customer 
demand, as well as to help secure the future growth of Mitsubishi 
Motors in the U.S.,'' President Katsuhiko Kawasoe told analysts and 
journalists at a briefing in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The new SUV should arrive in showrooms in two years as a 2002  
model. It will compete with the successful Toyota RAV4 and Honda 
CR-V and will be preceded by new models from Ford Motor Co., Mazda 
Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Small SUVs priced in the low $20,000 range lack the big profits  
of midsize and full-size SUVs. But automakers see them as an 
effective way to lure young buyers who will be more likely to stay 
with the brand when they trade up, said analyst Jim Hall of 
AutoPacific Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's entry will be called the Escape and will be based on a  
modified Mazda 626 chassis, with Mazda and Mercury versions 
expected. Korea's Hyundai is preparing to debut its Santa Fe SUV as 
soon as next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawasoe offered no details of Mitsubishi's SUV, except that it  
will be ``completely new'' and built in Japan. Mitsubishi currently 
sells the Montero full-size SUV and the midsize Montero Sport in 
the United States; a redesigned Montero is scheduled to go on sale 
in fall 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of the small SUV will increase Mitsubishi's U.S.  
sales target to 300,000 vehicles by 2004, Kawasoe said. Last year, 
Mitsubishi sold 190,515 vehicles in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawasoe left open the possibility that Mitsubishi might merge  
with another automaker, but said that joint ventures and other 
collaborations without capital tie-ups were the company's 
preference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not reject any possibility out of hand,'' he said.  
``If we believe we can enjoy a true equal partnership, then we may 
proceed with a possible wide-range tie-up. Again, our scenario is 
streamlining, restructuring and profitability first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters, Mitsubishi said:  
</P>
<P>
	--It plans to reduce its 24 car models worldwide by 40 percent  
and the number of ``platforms,'' the common chassis and major parts 
used for different models, to six from 12 by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	--Net income for fiscal 1999 should total $16.5 million on sales  
of $29 billion, which will allow it to restore dividend payments. 
</P>
<P>
	--It has raised its three-year cost-cutting goal to $3.5 billion  
by fiscal 2000. Last year, Mitsubishi cut $884 million.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar traded lower against the yen at midday  
Thursday on the view Japan has relaxed efforts to weaken its 
currency. Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.13 yen, down 0.87 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 118.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 365.59 points,  
or 2 percent, to 17,891.93 at the end of the morning session. On 
Wednesday, the average closed down 275.06 points, or 1.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar lost ground amid market  
speculation its slide below 120 yen suggests Japan now accepts a 
slightly stronger yen in response to U.S. complaints following 
earlier Japanese dollar-buying intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese leaders have said they believe excessive yen  
appreciation undercut a budding economic recovery in 1993, and are 
seen as unlikely to agree to any significant rise in their 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese newspapers reported the central bank intervened  
Wednesday evening in Tokyo, when the dollar was trading above 
118.50 yen. But the amount of intervention was rather small, the 
Nihon Keizai financial daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second such move by Japanese finance authorities  
following Tuesday's intervention in New York, where the Federal 
Reserve stepped into the currency market to buy the greenback on 
behalf of the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has frequently intervened in recent weeks to  
prevent a stronger yen. Gains by the yen make Japanese exports more 
costly abroad, and thus less competitive, while reducing the value 
of foreign revenue in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is still struggling to bail out of its worst recession  
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 124.18 yen at midday,  
below its rate of 124.48 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices closed the morning session  
lower amid continued profit-taking in high-technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, market players remained wary that the dollar's decline  
against the yen could hurt earnings at exporters. Share prices at 
Sony, TDK, Toyota and Honda all fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 26.02 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1,474.09. 
The TOPIX closed down 15.89 points, or 1.05 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond  
traded at 1.7500 percent, even with Wednesday's finish. Its price 
remained at 100.43 yen.

<HEADLINE> 76ers To Keep Guard for $3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Guard Eric Snow has agreed to a multiyear  
contract with the Philadelphia 76ers worth about $3 million per 
year, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, who joined the Sixers in January 1998, was scheduled to  
visit with the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday but canceled the visit 
``because we think we can get this done,'' said Steve Kauffman, 
Snow's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kauffman declined to confirm Wednesday the $3 million number  
reported by The Inquirer but did say that he and Sixers general 
manager Billy King have agreed in principle to a dollar amount and 
contract length. 
</P>
<P>
	``But until I review the proposed documents, I don't feel I can  
absolutely confirm that,'' Kauffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kauffman said a number of teams have offered substantially more  
money, but Snow wants to stay in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers would not confirm or deny the report. A contract  
cannot be signed until Aug. 1, when the NBA lifts its one-month 
moratorium on all deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Free-agent forward George Lynch is also ready to re-sign with  
the Sixers, the Inquirer reported.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Documents Reveal Little </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Documents made public Wednesday show organizers  
seeking the 1996 Olympics for Atlanta made early contact with 
International Olympic Committee members later disciplined for their 
role in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press joined two other media outlets Wednesday in  
taking a preliminary glimpse through Olympic documents that 
initially showed no evidence of wrongdoing on the scale of Salt 
Lake, where organizers gave cash, free college scholarships and 
other gifts to secure the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One memo shows former Olympics chief Billy Payne ordering a $875  
live bulldog to help secure the bid of the Cuban IOC member, and 
another shows him requesting free airfare for two IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a show of how Payne and his staff tried to find the  
personal touch, one memo reminds a staffer to get some baseballs 
signed by home run king Hank Aaron for officials from the 
baseball-mad Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the documents reviewed Wednesday ranged from mundane  
thank-you notes to tersely-written letters quibbling over printing 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,500 boxes of documents had previously been kept private by  
the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games and the Georgia Amateur 
Athletic Foundation -- the organization founded by Payne to bid for 
the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An index of the boxes of documents was made available Monday --  
with requests taking two days to process. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight additional boxes of what ACOG feels are private documents  
are under review by congressional investigators in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They were not listed in the index made available to the public  
Monday, and are at the center of a continuing legal fight between 
ACOG and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The newspaper, which 
sent 10 reporters to pore through the boxes Wednesday, has joined 
with state Attorney General Thurbert Baker in arguing the papers 
are covered by the Georgia Open Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Memos and letters written by Payne and other early bid workers  
show that after Atlanta was nominated as the U.S. bid city in April 
1988, the bid committee was in contact with IOC members Kim Un-Yong 
of Korea, Anton Geesink of Finland and Phil Coles of Australia -- 
all disciplined by the IOC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim and Geesink were accused of accepting inappropriate gifts  
from Salt Lake organizers, while Coles was accused of helping Salt 
Lake by providing information on fellow IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members eventually resigned or were expelled in the  
wake of the scandal, which also has prompted the probe by the U.S. 
House Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter dated Oct. 4, 1988, Payne wrote to invite Kim to  
visit Atlanta while in Chattanooga, Tenn., to attend a piano 
recital by his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was censured by the IOC for allowing Salt Lake organizers to  
grant several favors, including setting up a recital for his 
daughter. ACOG previously admitted giving Kim a $616.25 Tiffany 
jewelry box. 
</P>
<P>
	Geesink was also reprimanded this spring for accepting cash  
payments which he said were later given to Finnish sports 
federations. In a March 30, 1989 letter to Geesink, Payne asked for 
an invoice for the transportation that ``was allocable to your 
visit to Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Please include the cost of your upgrade to first class from  
Atlanta to New York and any other costs that were incurred as a 
result of the tribute you paid us by your visit,'' Payne said in 
his letter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a later memo, Payne asked which church would be appropriate  
for Geesink during another trip to Atlanta on March 26, 1989 -- 
Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC regulations at the time limited IOC members to one visit to  
each bid city, and only one family member per trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in Payne's correspondence was a 1988 letter to  
Coles, thanking him for his help during the 1988 Games in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	In helping land the bid, Payne called in several favors from  
friends at the Augusta National Golf Club, which hosted several 
rounds of golf for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	And documents revealed that organizers were able to give IOC  
members tours of the state thanks to planes loaned by Gulfstream 
Aerospace of Savannah. Company officials were also invited to 
accompany visits to IOC members abroad as part of a sales strategy.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Terrance C.Z. Egger, general manager of the St.  
Louis Post-Dispatch since 1996, was promoted to publisher Wednesday 
by Pulitzer Inc. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cites Vietnam Talks Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has made significant  
progress in negotiations with Vietnam toward establishing normal 
trade relations, the State Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is seeking a comprehensive agreement  
that would require Vietnam to make commitments on market access for 
goods and services, intellectual property and investment. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said concluding an  
agreement would pave the way for normalizing trade relations 
between the two countries. It also would expedite Vietnam's entry 
into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made significant progress in narrowing the number of  
outstanding issues, but there are some issues that do remain,'' 
Rubin said. ``We hope that these discussions will be sufficient to 
enable us to conclude an agreement and will achieve the 
objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vietnamese officials said last week that the two sides had  
substantially narrowed their differences in an eighth round of 
negotiations in Washington last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks on a trade pact started in September 1996 but have stalled  
over Vietnam's reluctance to open its markets to U.S. investment 
and services and fears that its fledgling businesses would be at a 
disadvantage in competing with American companies.

<HEADLINE> Pause in F-22 Program Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed pause in the $60  
billion-and-climbing program to build 339 next-generation F-22 
stealth fighters would kill the plane the Air Force considers 
critical to future U.S. dominance in the air, the service's acting 
secretary told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton separately told a news conference that it  
would be a mistake to abandon the radar-evading aircraft that has 
``real potential to add to our national defense.'' It can be paid 
for without compromising defense priorities, he said, ``and that is 
what I will fight to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Balking at a high-tech aircraft plagued with delays and cost  
overruns, the House Appropriations Committee last week voted to 
divert $1.8 billion from the F-22 to purchase more F-15 and F-16 
stealth models and pay for pilot bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The full House is expected to debate the issue in a few days.  
The lead developer of the high-tech fighter is Lockheed Martin, 
which oversees final assembly at its plant in Marietta., Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters, at a Senate Armed  
Services Committee hearing on his nomination to be secretary, 
defended the F-22 program. He noted Tuesday's successful test of 
its capabilities, which he said showed it can maneuver like ``no 
other airplane in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peters said reversing a plan to order six more planes -- the Air  
Force now has two -- would elevate costs and kill the program on 
which $24 billion already has been spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The F-22 operates at altitudes that no other airplane can  
easily operate at. It operates at speeds that are unparalleled,'' 
Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to take the F-22 out of inventory, we would be  
looking at a massive change in direction'' in Air Force planning 
for dominance over the next 18 years, he said. That planning is 
based on the assumption an aircraft such as the F-22 will be 
available over the next decade and longer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Air dominance has been the key to the joint force for many  
years, and no American serviceman has died in attack from the air 
since the Korean War,'' Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the program goes forward, he said, additional costs would  
total about $85 million a plane -- less than switching to a 
less-capable aircraft. Total cost of each F-22 has been estimated 
as high as $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-117A shot down in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo conflict  
was a first-generation stealth fighter. The new F-22s are ``fourth 
and fifth generation,'' Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., Armed Forces Committee chairman, said  
he wants to work out some middle ground between the full funding of 
$3 billion proposed in Senate legislation and the reduced funding 
in the current House bill. The House version would still spend $1.2 
billion to continue research and development of the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	The action by House appropriators was based on a desire to have  
the Air Force reconsider the F-22's Cold War roots and decide 
whether the plane is needed now, said Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif. 
The earliest stealth models were developed in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and other skeptics have said Air Force pilots and  
planes are stretched thin and may benefit little from a program 
aimed at delivering hundreds of planes a decade from now.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Hearst To Have Ankle Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers running back  
Garrison Hearst will have surgery to restore circulation to the 
ankle he broke last year, and expects to be off the field for most 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst will have the surgery Saturday in Baltimore.  
</P>
<P>
	In another move, the 49ers scheduled a news conference today to  
announce the signing of defensive end Charles Haley, who ended a 
two-year retirement and played in the playoffs for San Francisco 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Haley reportedly will receive a $1.3 million  
signing bonus and a $600,000 salary as part of a four-year 
contract. The deal includes a clause that could void the contract's 
final three years. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh said that Hearst, who  
rushed for a team-record 1,570 yards last season, will need 14 to 
16 weeks to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst was expected to make a full recovery after breaking his  
ankle on the team's first possession in their 20-18 playoff loss to 
the Atlanta Falcons. But there were reports that circulation to the 
ankle was impaired, slowing healing, and Hearst might be forced to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the news in the last week or so has been more  
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	``Garrison's (latest) MRI revealed that circulation to the  
injured ankle has improved,'' said Walsh in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Greene Shows His Power in 200 Meter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Maurice Greene powered away from Francis Obikwelu  
in the last 40 meters to win the 200-meter sprint in the Golden 
League meet on Wednesday, showing he's still in top form heading 
into the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	With Michael Johnson and Ato Boldon absent, the race always  
looked to be a battle between Greene, the only starter to have run 
a sub-20 second 200-meter sprint, and Obikwelu. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was Greene, who recently broke the 100-meter world  
record, who dominated his Nigerian rival, clocking a time of 20.13 
seconds. He won by .07. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones again showed she has no equal at 200 meters,  
outclassing the field in 21.99 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The American, 23, is unbeaten in 18 races spanning three years  
and is still the only woman to have run below 22 seconds this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd hoped for a challenge from European champion Christine  
Arron, but the French woman was a poor fifth in 22.27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris meet is the third of the seven Golden League events. A  
$1 million jackpot will be shared among those athletes who win in 
all seven meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Jones, Wilson Kipketer retained a chance of a share of the  
jackpot with a masterful victory in the 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan-born runner, the world record holder at the distance,  
ran with only one shoe at the end but still eased away from his 
rivals in the final straight to win in 1 minute, 44.89 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain what happened. I lost a shoe 200 meters from  
the finish during the sprint,'' he said. ``But the important thing 
is that I won the race in Paris where I wasn't able to race last 
year and remain unbeaten in the Golden League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer set the 800-meter record two years ago during a season  
in which he also won his second world championship gold medal. He's 
currently battling back to form after a bout of malaria. 
</P>
<P>
	He insists that he is not thinking of the jackpot.  
</P>
<P>
	``My aim is to run a good race, one by one,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Svetlana Masterkova isn't thinking of the jackpot anymore for  
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 800, the Russian lost her chance of a share of  
the prize money when she was convincingly beaten by Mozambique's 
Maria Mutola. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle between Masterkova, who narrowly missed out last year  
on the jackpot in the 1,500-meter event, and Mutola was one of the 
most eagerly awaited of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first Golden League meeting in Oslo, Masterkova squeezed  
past Mutola. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was dominated by Mutola in Paris, who took the lead at  
the halfway stage and powered away in the last 200 meters to win in 
1:58.25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a difficult start to the season but I am happy to come  
back and defend my title in Paris,'' Mutola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Masterkova said she was hampered by injury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I nearly fell at the end of the first lap. I have a problem  
with an ankle which stopped me running as I wanted to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Barmasai of Kenya won his third consecutive Golden  
League 3000-meter steeplechase and Gabriela Szabo won at 3,000 
meters to also keep in the hunt for a share of the end of season 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanian, who had already clocked the two best times of the  
year, kept on the shoulder of Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco for two laps 
as the two runners opened a massive lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With 300 meters to go, Szabo lengthened her stride to win in  
fine style by more than 10 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouaziz had the consolation of setting an African record of 8  
minutes, 26.64 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging star Noah Ngeny fell well short in an attempt to beat  
Hicham El Guerrouj's one-year old 1,500 meter record. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Kenyan stood an outside chance of breaking the  
record after completing 1,100 meters in 2:34 but he couldn't 
maintain world-record pace in the final 300 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny, the second-fastest man in history at 1,000 meters and one  
mile, finished in 3:28.84, much slower than El Guerrouj's 3:26.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Fall in Japan / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today amid concern  
over whether Japan's central bank would step in to support the 
dollar. Tokyo share prices dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.00 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.42  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its level of 118.95 yen 
late Tuesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Nikkei-225 stock index fell 275.06 points, or 1.48  
percent, closing at 18,257.52 points. On Monday, the average jumped 
284.28 points, or 1.56 percent, to 18,532.58 -- its highest closing 
level since Sept. 10, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed Tuesday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stayed slightly above its late  
Tuesday level in New York on speculative dollar-buying amid notions 
that the Bank of Japan might intervene to weaken the yen again, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haruhiko Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs at  
Japan's Ministry of Finance, said today that Japan is ``always 
ready'' to keep the yen from strengthening before the economy 
recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York trading Tuesday, the Federal Reserve intervened on  
behalf of the Bank of Japan in an apparent attempt to help Japan's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank has frequently intervened in recent weeks  
to prop up the dollar and weaken the yen, trying to safeguard the 
country's fledging recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while reducing the value of exporters' 
foreign revenue in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 118.62 yen and 119.69 yen in today's  
trading. In other currencies, the euro was traded 124.48 yen, up 
from 122.14 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Japanese high-technology shares lost ground  
after their U.S. counterparts suffered losses Tuesday in New York. 
Traders said the recent strengthening of the yen also sparked 
selling of export-oriented stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 655.82  
million shares, up from Monday's turnover of 618.57 million shares. 
Advancers outnumbered retreaters 628 to 578, with 119 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section shed 15.89 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,500.11. The 
TOPIX closed up 8.98 points, or 0.60 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.7500 percent from Monday's finish of 
1.7850 percent, driving its price up to 100.43 yen from 100.12 yen.

<HEADLINE> Johnson &AMP; Johnson Buying Centocor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson is buying Centocor, one of  
the nation's top biotech firms, for $4.9 billion in stock, in a bid 
to accelerate pharmaceutical sales and diversify its medicines 
under development. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J, a health care conglomerate which makes most of its money  
from prescription drugs and medical devices, has been under 
pressure to find new blockbuster drugs after several products fell 
short of sales expectations in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Although J&AMP;J's profits have recently turned upward -- following a  
major restructuring and layoffs announced last fall -- the company 
still has been criticized for having too few drugs in its pipeline 
to compete with competitors like Merck and Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	With the proposed acquisition, J &AMP; J gains several new drugs,  
most notably ReoPro, a drug used to prevent blood clotting, a 
common cause of heart attacks. ReoPro, which had $365 million in 
sales last year, could propel sales of J &AMP; J's cardiovascular 
stents, tiny devices that hold arteries open. The anti-clotting 
agent is often used in conjunction with stents. 
</P>
<P>
	Centocor co-markets ReoPro with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly,  
which takes a portion of the sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Centocor also makes Remicade, a drug approved last year to treat  
the bowel disorder Crohn's disease. The Malvern, Pa.-based company 
is also seeking approval to use the drug to treat rheumatoid 
arthritis. It also has several products in human testing that treat 
cancer and heart attacks. Analysts said Centocor benefits from J &AMP; 
J's financial strength and large sales force. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of synergy between the two companies,'' said  
Mario Corso, an analyst with ABN AMRO Inc. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly Johnson &AMP; Johnson has deep pockets so Centocor can put  
more funds behind the marketing of their products'' Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
	But J&AMP;J will pay a heavy price for Centocor, at least in the  
short term. 
</P>
<P>
	J &AMP; J expects the purchase to cut its earnings by 15 cents a  
share this year and 5 cents a share in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Centocor reported second-quarter profits of $9.1  
million on $115.1 million in sales, which was in line with Wall 
Street expectations. Shares of Centocor rose $7.87 1/2, nearly 16 
percent, to $57.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
gained $1 to $97.43 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, Centocor had operating profits of $43.1 million on  
revenues of $338.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had been attempting since May to negotiate a deal.  
</P>
<P>
	The sale is expected to be completed in November, subject to  
approval by regulatory agencies and Centocor shareholders.

	New Home Construction Falls Sharply  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments fell  
sharply in June to the lowest level in just over a year, a possible 
sign that one of the economy's strongest sectors is beginning to 
cool. Builders started work last month on 1.57 million units at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate, a drop of 5.64 percent from May, 
the Commerce Department said today. That marked the lowest level 
since May 1998, when new housing starts were at 1.541 million. 
June's performance followed a big jump in new home construction in 
May after having dipped sharply in April.

	AOL, Sun Alliance To Be iPlanet  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The alliance between two of the largest  
Internet players in the world, Sun Microsystems and America Online 
Inc., announced today that its brand name will be iPlanet. Just 100 
days after its launch, the group's president, Mark Tolliver, said 
the alliance now has more than 300 customers, all of them companies 
doing business online. He said the brand name will help customers 
identify their products. Sun and AOL began their joint effort 
earlier this year, after AOL bought Netscape Communications. The 
Alliance had been nicknamed the ``dot com'' software company. It is 
aimed at giving companies tools, software, and services to take 
their businesses online.

	Japan Consumer Confidence Improves  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank said today that corporate and  
consumer confidence were improving and that the country's economy 
has stopped deteriorating. But the Bank of Japan, in a monthly 
report, noted that rising confidence had not yet translated into 
economic progress. ``This improvement in corporate sentiment, 
however, has not necessarily stimulated business activity, because 
firms strongly feel that they have excess capacity and employees 
and their profits remain weak,'' the central bank said. It also 
said that improved consumer sentiment ``is not strong enough to 
push up private consumption.'' Private spending accounts for nearly 
two-thirds of the nation's total economy.

	Japanese Auto Production Falls  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hurt by sluggish sales at home and falling exports,  
Japan's five leading automakers produced fewer cars in June 
compared to a year earlier, the companies said today. But while 
they cut back at home, the companies reported big increases in 
production overseas. Domestic auto production is watched closely as 
an indicator of economic health because it accounts for a big part 
of Japan's industrial output. Troubled No. 2 automaker Nissan Motor 
Co. reported the biggest cuts at facilities in Japan. Nissan cut 
domestic production 18.3 percent in June to 112,734 vehicles as 
sales at home sank 22.6 percent to 61,514. Nissan's exports 
declined 12 percent to 54,391.

technology sector following a similar move in New York. The 
Nikkei-225 stock index fell 275.06 points, or 1.48 percent, closing

<HEADLINE> Northrop Grumman Earnings Up 22 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Northrop Grumman Corp.'s second-quarter  
earnings rose 22 percent, beating Wall Street expectations, because 
of increased aircraft contracts and higher sales by Logicon, the 
company's information-technology subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop Grumman earned $113 million, or $1.64 a share, in the  
second quarter, up from $93 million, or $1.34 a share, for the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of  
$1.58 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the three months ended June 30 was $2.27 billion, up  
6 percent from $2.14 billion in 1998's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of the B-2 bomber had revenues of $1.3 billion for its  
aerostructures sector, a 7 percent increase that offset a slight 
decline in sales for its electronic systems division. Logicon's 
revenues rose 27 percent to $365 million, largely because of 
increased contract work with NASA and the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop Grumman is doing well on military contracts but still  
has ``challenges in the commercial aerostructures segment that must 
be resolved,'' Kent Kresa, Northrop Grumman chairman, president and 
chief executive officer, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Co. has cut orders from Northrop Grumman, which produced  
parts of the fuselage for eight 747 planes in the second quarter, 
down from 13 in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Northrop Grumman earned  
$201 million, compared to $81 million in the first half of 1998. 
The first half results from 1998 were lowered by a $186 million 
charge to cover costs of terminating Northrop Grumman's proposed 
merger with Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop Grumman also said it was merging three employee pension  
plans. The merger will not affect workers' retirement benefits, but 
it will reduce net income by about $20 million in the second half 
of the year, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Waugh, Northrop Grumman's chief operating officer, said  
merging the pension plans would improve cash flow and reduce 
operating costs down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Northrop Grumman closed Wednesday at $74.75, up $1.81 1/4  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ex-UCLA RB Used Parking Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former UCLA running back Skip Hicks  
reportedly had a handicapped parking permit two years ago, when he 
scored a school-record 26 touchdowns and gained 1,282 yards for the 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	About to start his second year with the Washington Redskins,  
Hicks was issued three of the handicapped parking placards over the 
period from December 1996 to June 1998, according to Department of 
Motor Vehicle records cited Wednesday by the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks has a history of knee problems, but was healthy as a  
senior in 1997, when he carried the ball 258 times and averaged 
nearly 5 yards per attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The DMV report did not indicate the nature of the injury or  
illness that Hicks claimed entitled him to the placard. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message for Hicks' agent, Howard Silber, was not  
immediately returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen current and former Bruin football players have been  
charged with misdemeanor counts of illegally possessing the 
placards. Authorities contend they obtained the permits by 
submitting applications with phony illnesses certified by fictional 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, they would face up to $1,000 in fines and six  
months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks was not among those charged. Nor were Cade McNown or Larry  
Atkins, who completed their UCLA careers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, an All-American quarterback as a senior, was a  
first-round draft choice of the Chicago Bears, while Atkins, a 
safety, was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange County Register reported Tuesday that Atkins, a UCLA  
second-team All-American defensive back, had a handicapped placard 
in the spring of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown had the permit from February through mid-June 1997,  
shortly after his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown was quoted Tuesday in the Chicago Tribune as saying he  
was injured during winter conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't use it (the placard) for more than two weeks, and  
then I hung it up,'' he said. ``And I don't think I ever parked in 
handicapped spaces. I can count on one hand the number of times I 
used it at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentioning it at the same time (as the stories regarding his  
14 teammates) is not right. For lack of better words, I've been 
defamed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA sports information director Marc Dellins declined to answer  
questions concerning placards assigned to Hicks, Atkins or McNown.

<HEADLINE> Sean Elliott Needs New Kidney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 liott, Spurs; EDITS  
</P>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott needs a kidney transplant  
because of worsening renal function but still hopes to play for the 
NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old forward could be operated on as early as next  
month, or as soon as a match is found. Family members underwent 
blood screening Monday to see if they qualify as donors. If there 
is no family match, Elliott will go on a transplant waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Schmidt said today Elliott learned of his  
deteriorating condition with about a month left in the regular 
season. Elliott said he told only teammate Steve Kerr of his plight 
during the playoff run. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott was a valuable member of the Spurs despite playing with  
kidney disease for years. A person can lead a normal life with only 
one kidney but the rigors of professional basketball present 
special dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt said Elliott consulted with his family before deciding  
on the transplant. Elliott said he is in no pain and feels fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of people out there who have had to do it every  
day,'' he said. ``Ask me if I'm a little scared, yeah, I'm a little 
worried. But at the same time I'm looking at it as a positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors said they don't know a precedent for a pro athlete  
returning to competition after such an operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either way, I think he has an excellent long-term prognosis  
for living a normal life,'' said Dr. John Reinieck, a kidney 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be two or three months after the operation  
before Elliott's return to basketball could be assessed. But 
Elliott, a 10-year NBA veteran, doesn't think his career is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather go out the way I want to go out,'' he said. ``I  
think every athlete feels that way. ... I feel like I am going to 
play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on when I could have the surgery done and how I  
come back from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reinieck said Elliott needs the transplant by late this year or  
he will require dialysis to avoid such symptoms as exhaustion, 
nausea and, in later stages, weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real difficult situation personally for all of us who  
have known each other for a long time,'' Spurs general manager and 
coach Gregg Popovich said. ``When you think of it in those terms, 
the basketball doesn't matter very much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully people will have an even greater respect for what  
this young man has done given the circumstances under which he had 
to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott averaged 11.9 points and four blocks in the playoffs,  
helping the Spurs win their first championship. He had 14 points 
and four assists in a 96-89 victory over the New York Knicks in 
Game 4 of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest shot of the playoffs was a game-winning 3-pointer  
with nine seconds left in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals 
against Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The off-balance shot came with Elliott on his tiptoes and almost  
out of bounds. It ranks with some of the toughest game-winning 
shots in NBA playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt said the shot was nothing compared to the grit Elliott  
showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a true testament to him, not only as a player but as an  
individual,'' Schmidt said. 
</P>

	Elliott was drafted out of Arizona by the Spurs in the first  
round in 1989. He was traded to the Pistons for Dennis Rodman, 
Isaiah Morris and future considerations in 1993. The Pistons tried 
to deal him to the Rockets in 1994 but the agreement fell through 
when Elliott failed his physical because of his kidney condition.

	The Pistons sent him back to the Spurs later that year for the  
rights to Bill Curley and a 1997 second-round draft choice.
