D-BACKS: TOO EARLY TO KNOW  
 TEAM STILL SENDS MIXED MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON _ The Diamondbacks' meteoric sprint out of the spring
training gate with a nine-game winning streak had their fans
feeling euphoric. Since then, the club has fallen from orbit and
re-entered the atmosphere of the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Is it cause for concern or merely a minor glitch? Just how good
are the Diamondbacks, anyway? How much stock should be taken in
their spring record?
</P>
<P>
   After a day of rest Monday, the club stands at 13-7-1 entering
today's split-squad games at Tucson Electric Park against the
Anaheim Angels at 1:05 p.m. and the Chicago White Sox at 7:05.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff, upgraded considerably over the winter, has
shown some improvement, but the bullpen remains a mystery. The club
ERA is 4.55, compared to a 4.94 finish in the first spring.
</P>
<P>
   A more significant improvement is on offense. The club is
hitting .291, slightly ahead of its spring pace of .289 last
season, but at 7.3 runs per game is averaging almost two more runs
per game than last spring's 5.7, when the record was 16-15. The
club has scored 10 or more runs in eight games. During the regular
season, the club averaged 4.1 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're scoring six or seven runs a game, that helps the
pitchers, and when the pitchers are more relaxed, they pitch
better, and that in turn helps the offense. So each is dependent
upon the other,'' said left-hander Randy Johnson, who has a 1-0
record, a 3.46 ERA and 16 strikeouts in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The record itself is not a true measuring stick of progress or
problems, but a winning record does help create confidence entering
the season, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope that will help you start off well,'' Johnson said.
``You can't just turn it on when the season starts. A good spring
record doesn't guarantee you anything. Kansas City has one of the
best records in baseball this spring. Does it mean they'll go to
the World Series? No. You have to go out and produce, earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Arizona's top producers this spring has been catcher
Kelly Stinnett, who is hitting .440 with four home runs. While he
wants to keep things in perspective, he can't discount what a
successful spring can mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've listened to some people on the radio, and they've said,
`Take it easy, take it easy, it's only the spring.' Well, I'm
sorry, I can't take it too easy. Going out and playing hard, trying
to win whether it's the spring or regular season, that's the way
I've been taught,'' Stinnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go out and get in shape and all that stuff, but
winning does give you that confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams started slowly at the plate, in part
because he's using a more wide-open batting stance. He has been
swinging the bat with more authority of late, and his average has
inched up to .250, still quite a way from where he would like it to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what spring is for. You just keep trying things,
working on things to help make you better. Sometimes it takes
longer than you want,'' said Williams, who has one homer, one more
than he had last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look at just the record. You obviously would
like to win as much as you can, but we who are out there every day,
those involved with the game every day, see things a little deeper.
The things you do before the spring training games start, in those
couple of weeks, all the work you put in, you know what it takes to
get where you are. You see the cause for the success.''
</P>
<P>
   Some guys even work on off days. Right-hander Todd Stottlemyre
had his regular turn on the mound Monday, but instead of skipping
it because of the off day or having it pushed back and the rest of
the rotation pushed back, he was scheduled to pitch five innings in
a minor league game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about the wins, it's how you approach the game, get
into your routine, prepare for the season,'' Stottlemyre said.
``I'd like to have better numbers (he is 0-0 with a 5.59 ERA), but
I'm more concerned about my mechanics. . . . Victories in the
spring are nice, but you don't want to get a false sense of
security.'' &QL;

WITH TRADE, COYOTES GET RENEWED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The vortex was spinning out of control, gathering
force, spewing debris.
</P>
<P>
   Swirls of paranoia over a wobbly stadium referendum. Perceived
sabotage from Jerry Colangelo and the Evil Empire. A mysterious man
floating an offer to buy the entire organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that lingered like sore groins. Losing streaks that
wouldn't end. A coach whose job came down to two points on a
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the relationship between fact, fiction and the Phoenix
Coyotes, it was all nasty and black, sucking the life from a hockey
team trying to cultivate a hockey town in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, Robert Reichel drops in, skates like he's
been here all along, changing the face and the outlook of the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say a fresh start,'' Rick Tocchet said. ``I'd say
renewed life.'' &QL; 
`Robert Reprieve'
</P>
<P>
   For so many reasons, the Coyotes needed this. They needed to
break Daniel Briere's heart, get in the game, invest in the
present. They needed to shake up the room with a symbol of hope,
something more substantial than new sweaters. They needed to make a
big-time move, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   So Robert Reichel becomes Robert Reprieve. A legitimate
second-line center who can make plays and watch his own back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only proven,'' Jeremy Roenick said. ``He's
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Reichel does many things. He solidifies the top
two lines, relieving Tocchet of his baby-sitting chores. He allows
everyone else to slide into roles where they can succeed. And he
provides a dash of giddiness where queasiness had set in, the
growing fear of another first-round flame-out.
</P>
<P>
   Really, what's important here is the message. To the paying
customers and the people who might be tempted to vote on the Los
Arcos project. And, of course, to the players.
</P>
<P>
   From the time they learn to skate backwards, hockey players hear
all about holding up their end of the bargain. Well, that applies
to ownership, too.
</P>
<P>
   Without its own commitment to excellence, management cannot ask
a team to pursue a Cup with zealous belief. When a team knows it is
flawed, the shadows and distrust are always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at this like a beginning or an end,'' Coyotes
coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``Rather, a piece that has been missing
all season long.'' &QL; 
Payroll an issue
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that team payroll has become an issue with the
Coyotes. Across the league, players have privately commented on the
thrifty nature of the organization. Which is why a bold stroke like
Reichel does wonders for morale.
</P>
<P>
   It's important because, somewhere along the way, owner Richard
Burke has grown resentful. Of the deal he signed at America West
Arena, the battle for a new stadium, the heavy losses that keep
pouring in. It's nice to know he didn't penalize his team for a
lack of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this might be a temporary boost. Smith has already
promised that Briere's ice time ``will be a lot more next season,''
just as he expects Reichel to be around a few years. You have to
wonder if that makes Roenick expendable.
</P>
<P>
   It would be silly, seeing that Roenick has flair, a guy who
actually sells tickets in the NHL. But in an organization with a
history of cost-cutting, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't give a (bleep),'' Roenick said.
``I love it here in Phoenix, but if they want to deal me, that's
their prerogative. If they feel they can make the team better by
doing it, that just means I go somewhere else and try to win the
Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, all that matters is the present. That Reichel
and Roenick provide an answer for Yzerman and Fedorov, Forsberg and
Sakic, Nieuwendyk and Modano. That Burke held up ``his'' end.
</P>
<P>
   For all the chaos on the periphery, the focus finally landed
where it needed to be all along.
</P>
<P>
   On the ice. On the belief that the product comes first and
everything else will fall into place. &QL;

BIBBY'S RETURN HOME TAKES ON FAMILIAR LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Vancouver's  &UR; Mike Bibby, who played his high school
basketball at Shadow Mountain and collegiately at Arizona, got his
hair cut by a familiar barber, had lunch with his mom,  &UR; Virginia,
and visited some old friends Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bibby, who used to make America West Arena his personal
stage as a prep star, played his first NBA game there.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he's had to adjust to the NBA's travel schedule, but
doesn't have any second thoughts about leaving Arizona after two
seasons. He was the second player taken in the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going by quick,'' Bibby said. ``It's all right. There's
nothing really that different except I'm making more money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More'' money?
</P>
<P>
   Teammate  &UR; Shareef Abdur-Raheem, who played at California, wasn't
going to let that one go by without comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all you (media) guys said about my school, he's making
more money now,'' Abdur-Raheem said. ``I want to read that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Per diem,'' Bibby claimed. &QL; 
De-Kleine-d &QL; 
Suns center  &UR; Joe Kleine said he has removed himself from
consideration for the vacant head coaching position at
Arkansas-Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine interviewed in Dallas for the job on March 13, and he
said he spoke with officials from the school over the weekend.
Kleine said he would have to agree to leave the Suns now to get the
job, and he is not willing to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first time I talked to them, I told them I wouldn't
leave until the season is over,'' Kleine said. ``They wanted to
interview me anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost case &QL; 
A U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Suns forward  &UR; Clifford
Robinson must pay a partnership the $517,000 he owes on a home
loan, the Associated Press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a 2-1 ruling, said Robinson waited too long to
claim he was defrauded. The claim arose from Robinson's dispute
with his former financial advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court said Robinson was bound by a 1993
contract with one of the lenders for his $1.5 million home in
Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, then with the Portland Trail Blazers, paid interest on
the loan for three years but failed to pay the $468,000 principal,
which was due in a balloon payment in May 1996. The damage award
also includes late fees and interest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Geil, Robinson's lawyer, said he would recommend that
Robinson appeal to the Supreme Court. If a lender commits fraud, he
said, ``I think it's fair that it should be treated as a defense to
any collection'' on the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson filed claims in August 1996 against the lenders saying
he had been defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's former agent,  &UR; Larry Gillman, paid Robinson $457,000
in a 1997 settlement stemming from a separate suit that alleged the
agent took kickbacks from contractors building Robinson's home and
that Gillman used the money to remodel his own home. &QL;

EARLY PRACTICES COULD BE IN WORKS FOR ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The fear of a particularly hot summer has
prompted Arizona State Coach
 &UR; Bruce Snyder to consider a dramatic change in the team's practice
schedule for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say, ``Rise and shine''?
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are thinking about early-morning practices
instead of the late-afternoon schedule the team has followed
recently. Workouts would get under way at approximately 6:45 a.m.,
allowing enough time for the players to attend morning classes.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder emphasized it is one of several options he is
considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear this could be the hottest summer of the
millennium, and with the Valley becoming more and more humid than
it was 15, 20 years ago, you have to take a look a things,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Night practices were considered but Snyder believes they are not
conducive to academic success. A 7 p.m. practice would require a 3
p.m. training table (a four-hour differential is recommended) and
the time between ``with a big stomach of food is probably not the
best time to study,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early-morning practices would allow for the rest of the day to
be spent on academics.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's three sub-.500 seasons in the last decade have coincided
with some of the worst heat and humidity in the Valley in years.
</P>
<P>
   Several other teams in the country practice in the morning, but
it is more popular with basketball programs. Temple basketball
Coach  &UR; John Chaney does it, and former Southern California Coach
 &UR; George Raveling did it for years. &QL; 
Academic help &QL; 
In an effort to improve academic retention on the football team,
ASU has hired former fullback  &UR; Kelvin Fisher as the coordinator of
academic accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt he could address a need, which was a hands-on approach
with teaching young people how to navigate through the
university,'' Snyder said. ``He'll help teach them how to take care
of their business, how to be responsible, how to act, where to sit
in class, time management, all the different things to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who played at ASU from 1988-91 and amassed 1,763 rushing
yards, will serve as a liaison among the players, coaches,
professors and academic counselors.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils lost two starters, linebacker  &UR; Larry Johnson and
wide receiver
 &UR; Ricky Boyer, and No. 2 tailback  &UR; Marlon Farlow for all of last
season because of academics.
</P>
<P>
   Three current starters _ wide receiver  &UR; Tariq McDonald,
defensive tackle
 &UR; Junior Ioane and cornerback  &UR; J'Juan Cherry are not participating in
spring drills because of academics. &QL; 
Back in action &QL; 
The Sun Devils resumed spring practice Monday and have 12 workouts
remainings. Three scrimmages, the maximum allowed, are scheduled
for Saturday, for April 2 and for April 8. &QL;

RANGERS GAIN GRETZKY BUT STILL LOSE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Wayne Gretzky is back in the lineup. The New York
Rangers are falling further back in the playoff race. The league's
trading deadline is Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their worst performances of the season, the Rangers
were beaten, 6-3, Monday night by the Tampa Bay Lightning, the
worst team in the National Hockey League, before a howling crowd in
the half-filled Ice Palace. It was the Rangers' fourth game in a
row a without victory (0-2-2). They held a lead briefly, but
squandered it, a recent habit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 10th-place Rangers remain five points behind
eighth-place Boston in the quest for the final playoff berth in the
Eastern Conference, they lost ground because the Bruins were idle
and the Rangers have played two more games. New York also has
played two more games than ninth-place Florida, which holds a
1-point lead on the Rangers. The Panthers, who were also idle
Monday night, will play host to the Rangers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rangers' third game in four nights, and they started
Dan Cloutier, the rookie goalie, who lasted less than two periods
and departed with a stick-shattering display in the corridor behind
the Rangers' bench after giving up five goals on 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, in his 20th NHL season, will not be traded, but other
Ranger veterans are candidates, including the injured defenseman
Ulf Samuelsson, who is expected to miss two to three weeks with a
broken bone in his right foot. Others who might draw bids from
playoff contenders include left wing Kevin Stevens, who scored his
20th goal of the season Monday night, and John MacLean, who has 25.
</P>
<P>
   Niklas Sundstrom and Adam Graves scored the other Ranger goals.
Colin Forbes scored twice for the Lightning, which had lost its
three previous games and five of its previous six.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky last played on Feb. 22 in Calgary, then missed 12 games
with a protruding disk in his neck that limited his mobility and
caused him pain. The condition improved after a cortisone
injection, and Gretzky began skating last week, apart from the
team, without contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've skated really hard,'' Gretzky said. ``There is no pain
and tremendous mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky traveled with the Rangers to Tampa on Sunday night,
after a 2-2 tie with Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden, he said
he would practice during the road trip and return to the lineup for
the third game, Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia. But after
practicing with the team Monday morning, the decision was made to
dress him in his familiar No. 99 jersey. Christian Dube, another
center, was returned to Hartford to make room on the roster for
Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky had not scored in the eight games before his idleness
and came into Monday night's game still seeking his 1,072d
major-league goal, combining regular season and playoff games in
both the National Hockey League and the World Hockey Association.
His total of 1,071 tied him for first place with Gordie Howe, who
also played in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers used four lines Monday night, and Gretzky centered
the fourth unit. After Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead on an
even-strength goal by Mike Sillinger 10 minutes 47 seconds into the
first period, the Rangers scored twice in a 20-second span to go up
by 2-1. But the Lightning scored twice in a 16-second burst to go
up by 3-2.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stevens got the first Ranger goal, making it 1-1 at 12:24, on
the power play, finishing a rush and passing combination with Mike
Knuble and Marc Savard. It the first time Stevens has reached 20
goals in a season since he scored 41 with Pittsburgh in 1993-94.
Sundstrom made it 2-1 at even strength at 12:44 with his 13th; he
had no points in his previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes and Michael Nylander scored at 17:19 and 17:35,
respectively, making it 3-2, after taking advantage of sloppy
checking by the Rangers that left Cloutier vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier, Mike Richter's backup, last played on March 14, a 3-2
victory over the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum. He came into the
game with a 6-5-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Chris Gratton scored on the power play at
8:34 to make it 4-2 for the Lightning after a gratuitous
high-sticking penalty against Brent Fedyk of the Rangers. Forbes
got his second goal of the game on a rebound to make it 5-2 after
Brian Leetch turned over the puck in his own zone while the Rangers
were on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   When Richter skated out to replace Cloutier, the rookie goalie
stalked down the corridor behind the New York bench and smashed his
big stick to pieces.

JACK TARVER, 82, FORMER PUBLISHER OF THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla.)  (lh) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Tarver, who used his influence as publisher of The Atlanta
Journal and The Atlanta Constitution in the 1960s and early 1970s
to protect Ralph McGill, The Constitution's Pulitzer Prize-winning
editor, from bitter complaints about his support for the civil
rights movement, died of a heart attack on Sunday at his home in
Atlanta, his daughter, Margaret Tarver Jason, said. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one who propped up Ralph McGill's soapbox,'' said
James Minter, who held a number of editorial posts under the two
men.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver regularly tangled with fellow members of Atlanta's
conservative establishment during the civil rights years, Minter
said. Once when the owners of Rich's, Atlanta's biggest department
store, threatened to quit advertising, Tarver responded that he was
confident that Davison's, the city's second-largest department
store chain, would be delighted to get the space.
</P>
<P>
   But supporting McGill did not mean following all his suggestions
for civil rights coverage. The two men disagreed over whether to
send their reporters to places like Birmingham and Selma, Ala., to
cover confrontations, and Tarver prevailed with his cautious
decision to use news agency reports instead.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver's tenure as publisher of the Atlanta papers included a
climb up the executive ranks of Cox Enterprises, their parent
company. He was named president of Cox in 1969 and vice chairman in
1976, the year he stepped down as publisher. He held that position
until 1983, devoting much of his time to work with The Associated
Press news service, which he served as chairman from 1976 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the rise to prominence as a newspaper executive,
Tarver maintained an acerbic sense of humor. In a 1957 interview
after being named president of Atlanta Newspapers Inc., the Cox
holding company, he noted that his index finger on his left hand
was permanently crooked as a result of an accident at The Toombs
County Democrat, a one-man weekly that he founded in rural
southeast Georgia in 1939 at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized almost immediately after I got it caught in the
gears of that old flat-bed press that if I were ever going to
amount to anything in the newspaper business it would have to be on
the executive level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, he first won attention with a weekly humor column he
wrote for The Macon News after The Democrat closed. His review of
``Gone With the Wind,'' which was reprinted in more than 40
newspapers, said that Scarlett O'Hara ``was as changeable as a
baby's underwear.'' The movie was so long and the seats in the
theater so hard, he added, that by the time Rhett Butler tells
Scarlett, ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,'' neither did
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Such work caught the eye of McGill, who persuaded him to come to
The Constitution as associate editor and humor columnist in 1943.
But Tarver's business skills became apparent to the paper's owners
and he was recruited to help restore the paper to profitability in
1949. After The Constitution and The Journal came under the joint
ownership of what is today Cox, he rose rapidly through the ranks
to become publisher in 1958. The Constitution remains the evening
paper and The Journal the morning one; the two are published as one
on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Williams Tarver was born March 2, 1917, in Savannah,
Ga., the son of Otis M. Tarver and deLuth Williams Tarver. His
father owned a chain of hotels that was decimated by the
Depression, so Tarver took advantage of a football scholarship at
Mercer University in Macon. An injury ended his playing days, but
his coach kept him on as a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver began his newspaper career at The Vidalia Advance, a
weekly, in 1938 before moving to Lyons, Ga., the following year to
establish The Democrat. He later described that ill-fated effort to
create a second newspaper in ``a one-dentist town'' as proof that
he was optimistic by nature.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, who lives in Jacksonville, Fla.,
Tarver is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Birch Taylor; a
son, Jackson W. Tarver Jr. of Atlanta, and four grandchildren.

MILLER'S STATUS STILL IN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Suitors of free-agent linebacker Jamir Miller are
backing off, apparently in the belief that he ultimately will
re-sign with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, New England Patriots Coach Pete Carroll said that
while he likes Miller, the club will pursue him no further until it
sees whether Miller accepts the two-year offer worth about $6
million he has on the table from the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Cardinals' leading tackler last season, visited the
Patriots last week. He also has visited the Chicago Bears.
Representatives of the Tennessee Titans have had conversations with
Miller's agent, Steve Baker, but have not scheduled a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one is a unique situation for us,'' Carroll said. ``And
it's not one that we're going to move quickly on. It really is
going to depend on what happens with Arizona. We wanted to find out
where he was because he's a quality player and can help a club. But
we're not going after it at this time. We're just going to monitor
what takes place in the Arizona negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To attract him right now is more than we want to pay. Maybe it
goes further past the draft and things can change by then. We think
he's a good football player, but it's not the time for us to go
ahead and break the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice president of player personnel, has
said that he will do what he can to keep Miller, even if Miller
receives an offer from another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamir has to understand what his market value is, and we
appreciate that,'' Ferguson said. ``But we have an offer on the
table and we've got to do something in the next few days, or we
have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Miller (6 feet 5, 266 pounds) made it clear that he
wants to sign with a team that will use him as a pass rusher more
extensively than the Cardinals, who drafted Miller 10th overall in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he would like to do is rush the passer all the time as an
outside guy, which he has not been able to do with the two guys
(ends Andre Wadsworth and Simeon Rice) that they have in place,''
Carroll said. ``You could use Jamir as an outside rusher in nickel
situations. That's what he wants. He's also played nickel
linebacker behind the line of scrimmage. He's done a lot of things.
That is what makes him attractive. He's a very flexible player.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart is set on rushing the passer right now. That's why
he's hesitant to fully commit to Arizona, because they can't
promise him that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said that he believes ``strongly in what Jamir can do,
but nobody's going to design a defense for him. He's a young player
who can come back in here with an up-and-coming defense and really
establish himself, but we will determine what we are going to do if
and when he signs. There will be no promises. But I believe you
take care of your own, and we've made it clear that we want Jamir
back.''

DUKE UPSETS TENNESSEE, 69-63 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Georgia Schwetzer, the sophomore guard for
Duke, said, before Monday night's game against favored Tennessee
that ``it was just another game for us; we'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would have imagined that they would have been this ready.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw's career and the University of Tennessee's
reign ended in stunning fashion.
</P>
<P>
   With Holdsclaw, perhaps the best woman player ever in college
basketall, held to 8 points, 13 below her season average,
Tennessee, winner of the last three National Collegiate Athletic
Association titles, was upset by Duke, 69-63, in the East Regional
final at Greensboro Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The victory means the Blue Devils (28-6) and not the Lady Vols
(31-3) advance to the Final Four, where they will play Georgia in
one semifinal on Friday night. That winner will go on to Sunday's
championship game, something that had become a habit for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Duke's night, as the women's team matched the men's
team in reaching the Final Four this weekend, the first school to
do so since Georgia in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, a sophomore, led the Blue Devils with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, who won four straight New York state titles at Christ
the King High School before winning three straight collegiate
championships, just could not get going. She missed her first 10
shots, finished 2 for 18 from the field and fouled out with 25
seconds to play. The 8 points matched her season low.
</P>
<P>
   Semeka Randall led Tennessee with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Duke was not only ahead, but it also was dominating
Tennessee and turning Holdsclaw, the Vols' four-time all-America,
into a toothless tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Duke led at the half, 35-24, and Holdsclaw the leading scorer in
NCAA tournament history had just 1 point. Not only that but she was
0 for 10 from the field, and had three shots blocked and lost a
ball off her foot while driving the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she was sometimes double-teamed, but the senior star many
consider the greatest college player in the history of the women's
game was also forcing shots and missing shots she often makes so
regularly that in the previous three tournament games this year she
had scored 23, 37 and 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Holdsclaw had a lot of company in the area of misfiring. Her
all-America counterpart, Tamika Catchings, also was throwing up
air-balls as if they were confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Duke was getting consistent shooting from Schweitzer
_ she hit two of two from 3-point range, and five field goals in
five tries overall _ and from Michele VanGorp, the 6-6 sophomore
center, who also was five-for-five.
</P>
<P>
   Only Kellie Jolly was on her game for the Vols, hitting on four
of six shots, and leading the team with 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, ranked second in the nation, was seeking to get past
Duke, ranked 10th, in the East regional in order to reach the Final
Four for the fourth straight season, having won the title in each
of its last three attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Four semifinals will be played on Friday in San Jose,
Calif. Tennessee, under Coach Pat Summitt, has won five of the last
six NCAA titles and seven of the last eight.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Duke and Tennessee played, Dec. 6, in Orlando,
Fla., Tennessee won handily, 74-60. But the Blue Devils were able
to draw some confidence from the whipping because, after a sluggish
start, they felt they had given the great Tennessee team a
late-game run for its money.
</P>
<P>
   Duke entered Monday night's game having drawn moral strength
from its 76-63 victory over Old Dominion in Saturday's semifinals.
Like the Lady Vols, Old Dominion is an athletic team, a team that
uses pressure defense and offensive rebounding as prime weapons.
</P>
<P>
   What Old Dominion doesn't have that Tennessee does is the air
force. That is, Holdsclaw, the 6-2 senior who can fly, as well as
use such spinning, stop-and-go moves that she has virtually
revolutionized the concept of what a woman can do with a
basketball. She is so versatile, in fact, that the Tennessee media
guide lists her position thus: ``guard/forward/center.''
</P>
<P>
   For one half tonight though, she was just another player on the
court.

SUNS PULL AWAY FROM GRIZZLIES IN 4TH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Danny Ainge's season of survival continues.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't pretty. Nothing about mediocrity ever is. A .500 record
is an unforgiving tightrope. One misstep, and it's a very short
fall to being known as a loser.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns continued to walk it Monday night with an 89-84 victory
over the Vancouver Grizzlies at America West Arena in front of
18,855 fans, 168 fewer than a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Before tipoff, a Suns' victory looked like a gimme. Vancouver
arrived in the Valley with 14 losses in their past 15 games. The
Grizzlies appeared to be a mercy mission for a Suns team that was
mired in a three-game skid, their longest losing streak of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But about a week ago Ainge called this season an exercise in
survival. That isn't easy by definition.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Suns needed a rescue mission from a very
dependable source to survive for their 13th victory in 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Robinson's jersey number is 30. But these days it could
be 911. He arrived just in time against the Grizzlies, who led by
four with about six minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:34 left and the Suns on top of a 76-75 score, Robinson
hit a three-point goal. On Vancouver's next possession, he tied up
Shareef Abdur-Rahim as the Grizzlies forward stepped into the lane
in a move toward the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson controlled the tip as the Suns went on to extend their
lead to seven during the next minute on a couple of free throws
from Jason Kidd and Tom Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cliff has been stepping up night after night,'' said Kidd, who
was 11 for 22 from the free-throw line on a night when the Suns
free-throw percentage was 58.8 percent, a bricklayer's special.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Robinson drew the primary defensive assingment on
the opposition's most dangerous threat. Abdur-Rahim is the NBA's
third-leading scorer. Against the Suns, he had 26 points, about
three more than his average.
</P>
<P>
   But he failed to score in the final 90 seconds, because of
Robinson, who blocked one of his attempts with 1:21 left.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's presence has been pivotal throughout the season. His
emotional impact is as evident as his defense. With 7:30 left, he
came off the floor in anger after he was called for his third foul.
But it wasn't the call that angered him. He wanted to be more
involved in what had been a hit-and-miss effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I just feel as though I get taken out of the offense
because I'm playing so hard on defense,'' said Robinson, who had 10
points and eight rebounds. ``We seem to forget I can post up Rahim
just as well as he can post up. I don't want every shot, but I
don't mind one now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half was just another reminder that maybe the NBA
lockout wasn't as bad as everybody thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns 37 points at halftime equalled a season-low set last
month at San Antonio. The Grizzlies' 33 points didn't equal
anything. Their halftime output, a season low for a Suns foe, was
rock bottom. Then again, maybe not. The depths are apparently
unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   For the Suns, at least, the problem is their continuing
inability to maintain any momentum from quarter to quarter. This is
Team Schizo. Sometimes good, mostly bad.
</P>
<P>
   The good side was evident in the opening minutes against
Vancouver, the Midwest Division's bottom feeder. The Suns played a
crisp, up-tempo brand of basketball. It looked as if a day away
from the game after Saturday's loss at Houston had re-energized
them.
</P>
<P>
   They were shooting about 60 percent from the floor, had a
9-point lead midway through the opening quarter and moving
effortlessly at what appeared to be a runaway victory. But just
when it looked as though it would be breeze, the Suns suddenly went
into a stall.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Grizzlies ran off six straight points. Then, Ainge
went to his bench. Kidd's backup, Gerald Brown, got the call along
with Danny Manning and Joe Kleine.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, it was the chance to face Vancouver rookie Mike
Bibby. It was a match-up between probably the two best guards to
ever play for Valley high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was Arizona's Player of the Year at Carl Hayden High
before Bibby came on to dominate the state during his years at
Shadow Mountain. Brown _ with rookie Toby Bailey alongside at
shooting guard in the second quarter _ made a good account of
himself with six points in 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But, by then, the Suns' bad side had shown itself. What does it
look like? How about 27.3 percent shooting from the floor in the
second quarter? Ugly enough for you? Vancouver wasn't much better
at 40 percent, which wasn't enough for the Grizzlies to gain
control by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns held on to a four-point margin that looked tenuous.
During the third and fourth quarters, Vancouver would prove that it
was. &QL;

A BAD DEAL ALL AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking back, Steve Duchesne never fit in with this Los Angeles
Kings team, not for a moment, and didn't seem to recognize how dire
his situation had become.
</P>
<P>
   He was strongly disappointed that the team he had signed with
just last summer had so quickly given up on him, and appeared to
work harder in practice in the past week in a belated effort to
salvage what could not be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings signed Duchesne to a three-year, $11.25-million
contract last summer (with a fourth-year players option at $3.75
million), the move was widely acclaimed. The reasoning went that
Duchesne, an offensive defenseman, would elevate the Kings' power
play from ordinary to excellent, and that by addressing the power
play, the Kings would improve from a playoff team to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   But with his previous team, the St. Louis Blues, Duchesne had
been a supporting player behind Al McInnis and Chris Pronger. With
the Kings, he would be on the forefront of a team with much less
offensive talent. The pressure to perform was on and it was
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding this, the Kings quickly soured on Duchesne's
tendency to skirt physical contact. They wanted him to be something
he had never been. Though Duchesne had never been known as a
physical player, the Kings wanted Duchesne to adjust, at least
marginally. Duchesne didn't and his lack of power-play production
magnified his defensive deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Duchesne seemed reluctant to shoulder
responsibility when things didn't go well; for instance, a month
into the season he lost his balance during overtime, allowing
Calgary's Andrew Cassells to score a game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell down,'' Duchesne said that night. ``I worked hard. You
make mistakes. I feel really bad about losing the game like that,
but it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he felt much worse than that, and if he did, he
should have said so. When he didn't, his response was perceived as
nonchalance, and unfortunately, perception becomes reality.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the team's poor record and projected $15-million
deficit, Duchesne's disappointing performance has prompted the
Kings to reevaluate how they want to build their team.
</P>
<P>
   If they spend big money on a free agent in the future, it
probably will be on an elite offensive player who can score goals,
attract fans and win with a young, hard-working (and lower-paid)
supporting cast. It has not escaped the Kings' notice that the
Ottawa Senators sit atop the Eastern Conference despite a payroll
of $21 million, less than half that of the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   As for Duchesne's situation, it might be resolved today, an
expensive lesson for all.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rumor central:The NHL trading deadline is noon Tuesday. Some
teams are content with what they have heading into next month's
playoffs. Others will gear up by adding another piece to their
roster. And teams that will miss the playoffs are looking to dump
players and build for the NHL of Y2K. Here's a look at some of what
might and might not happen today:
</P>
<P>
   __ Kings: Realizing they won't win the Stanley Cup this year,
they could (and should) eye the future. The most attractive
veterans on the roster for teams seeking a short-term playoff fix
are defenseman Doug Bodger and winger Russ Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mighty Ducks: They aren't expected to do anything major.
``Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing,'' general manager
Pierre Gautheir said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Buffalo: The Sabres are interested in a defenseman, possibly
30-year-old Rich Pilon of the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   __ Calgary: When the Flames unloaded prospective free agent
Theoren Fleury three weeks ago, they were expected to drop out of
the playoff race. They haven't, and as a result, they probably
won't conduct the fire sale that had been anticipated. Instead, the
Flames might look to add players, possibly Pilon or Islanders
center Bryan Smolinski.
</P>
<P>
   __ Carolina: The Hurricanes are looking for a winger to play on
their top line with Keith Primeau and Ray Sheppard, and also might
be interested in a rushing defenseman, such as Duchesne, if he is
available at a vast markdown.
</P>
<P>
   __ Detroit: The Red Wings are struggling as they bid for their
third consecutive Stanley Cup. The Wings would like to add a
defenseman and a forward. On defense, they have interest in Ulf
Samuelsson of the New York Rangers (although Samuelsson will miss
several weeks after breaking a bone in his foot Sunday) or
possibly, Bob Boughner of Nashville. At forward, players who might
be Hockeytown-bound include Washington's Joe Juneau, Tampa Bay's
Wendel Clark and the Islanders' Trevor Linden.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tampa Bay: The bottom-feeding Lightning sent Benoit Hogue to
Dallas on Sunday and will try to unload such veterans as Clark,
Stephane Richer and Petr Svoboda.
</P>
<P>
   __ Justice files: The NHL continues to mete out discipline in
odd doses. Early in the season, Kings defenseman Rob Blake received
a three-game suspension for a slash to the arm that did not
seriously injure Vancouver's Harry York. Blake and York were
chasing a loose puck.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Detroit's Kirk Maltby slashed Colorado's Valeri
Kamensky, breaking the forward's arm and probably ending his
season. The play happened away from the puck, making Maltby's act
much less defensible than Blake's. Yet Maltby's punishment was just
one game longer than the one handed Blake earlier in the year.

SLAYING VICTIM'S FATHER FACES ACCUSED KILLER IN COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DONNA HUFFAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sobbing into his hands, Souren Mekhrabian turned
to the judge for help Monday when the man accused of killing his
son began to cross-examine him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is the man who murdered my son. I don't want to
see him,'' Mekhrabian said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Curtis B. Rappe told Souren
Mekhrabian he understands this is a difficult situation for the
grieving father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, under our system I have no choice. I have to
let him represent himself,'' he told Mekhrabian, who testified
through a Russian interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Standing just feet away was murder suspect Edward Dixon,
representing himself on the first day of his trial and
cross-examining Mekhrabian about the 1997 slaying of David
Mekhrabian in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, 42, is accused of stabbing David Mekhrabian to death
after David, 22, and his father rebuffed a request for 25 cents.
Dixon has been acting as his own attorney for more than a year in
the 18-month-old case.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Monday, Dixon peppered the grieving father with
questions about who else was in the area during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Mekhrabian broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was holding my dying son. I was not looking around to see
who was coming and going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about himself in the third person, Dixon denied killing
Mekhrabian during opening statements Monday, saying it is
impossible for him to have been in two places at once. Standing
before jurors in a blue Los Angeles County Jail uniform, Dixon also
said his fingerprints were not found on the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony, Rappe sustained about a dozen objections from
Deputy District Attorney Bob Villa &UR; , &LR;  who found many of Dixon's
questions vague, irrelevant, argumentative and speculative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're confusing things and dragging out the time,'' Rappe
said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon also won some arguments, as when the judge refused to
allow Villa to show the jury an enlarged color photograph of David
Mekhrabian taken two days before his death.
</P>
<P>
   David Mekhrabian left Israel in September 1997 for his first
visit with his family in three years. On Sept. 29, he rode with his
father to the Pershing Square Building in downtown Los Angeles to
pick up the victim's mother, Stella Mekhrabian, from work. The
building is just a few blocks from where he works, Souren
Mekhrabian testified.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting outside the building, the father and son were
hassled by a panhandler to whom Souren Mekhrabian said he had given
money in the past. But on this day, he had no money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult for Souren Mekhrabian to understand the
transient, whom he identified as Dixon. He said Dixon waved a knife
in his face, cursed and pushed him. So he said he asked a woman
standing nearby, Shakeh Esmaliei, to tell the transient the
Mekhrabians had no money. That's when David volunteered to explain
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minute later the woman began screaming. I looked at my son
and he said, `Papa, I was stabbed with a knife.' Then he fell to
the ground,'' Mekhrabian testified through tears.
</P>
<P>
   Although Esmaliei testified she saw the knife in Dixon's hand
and watched as he cleaned the blood from the blade, she said under
cross-examination that she could not identify the knife because it
went so rapidly from Dixon's pocket into David Mekhrabian's chest.
</P>
<P>
   Esmaliei said she was three feet away when she saw Dixon stab
the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Referring frequently to his brown file folder stuffed with
papers, Dixon challenged the fairness of how both witnesses
identified him to police. Both picked his photo out of six photos
of African-American men wearing similar clothes, Villa said.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to hourlong hearings with each witness, Rappe
ruled that no improper means were used to identify the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day's testimony, Dixon objected to having
to wear his jail uniform in court. Rappe pointed out clothes had
been brought for him but they did not fit. Dixon has gained almost
90 pounds since the arrest, he said.

SENATORS CLASH OVER U.S. ROLE IN AIR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A handful of senators clashed on Monday over the
American role in a NATO air campaign if Belgrade refuses to sign
the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The White House invited congressional leaders to discuss plans
for Kosovo on Tuesday, the same day that the Senate is to vote on a
measure to cut off the money for American troops to engage in a
NATO operation in Kosovo unless Congress gives prior approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I think Milosevic is a tyrant,'' said Sen.
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip. ``It still doesn't
mean we should go to war with Serbia. And if we start a massive
bombing campaign, we're going to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas complained that the
administration had not sought prior congressional approval for
American participation in a bombing campaign of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now picking sides in a civil war where the U.S. security
interests are not clear,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other Republicans acknowledged sensitivity to the
timing of the vote, given that officials are trying to negotiate a
cease-fire and settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats urged that the Senate postpone the vote. They conceded
that the White House needed to explain in a primetime television
address what American interests were served in Kosovo. But they
said the United States had a moral obligation to end the fighting
as well as a national security interest to halt the conflict before
it spreads and destabilizes southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about genocide and ethnic cleansing,'' said Sen. Joseph
R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee, who indicated that he would support military
action.
</P>
<P>
   A test vote on the measure, sponsored by the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senator Hutchison, was expected on
Tuesday. Lott needs 60 votes in the 100-member Senate to overcome
procedural barriers put up by Democrats and prevail, which many
believe is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The House earlier this month narrowly passed a nonbinding
resolution expressing support for sending U.S. troops to Kosovo as
part of a future NATO peacekeeping force.

VIRTUAL RACE-CAR DRIVERS, START YOUR PCs! 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than drive [ix]with[nm] the mass of humanity that will
inch and nudge toward Texas Motor Speedway this weekend, some
NASCAR enthusiasts will try to experience the thrills of racing in
a less-congested way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They'll be sim racing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They'll be racing against other gearhead gamers who are online,
on a network or one-on-one. They'll be clutching a steering wheel
or joystick in front of a personal computer loaded with software
that simulates the NASCAR experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these virtual drivers won't exactly face the G-forces
or smell the combustible fuel that real drivers encounter. But,
thanks to some software developers who tediously duplicate the
track to the closest detail, they'll get an idea of the strategy
involved in driving in a NASCAR environment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us will never get the chance to climb in a real stock
car and race,'' said Shawn D. Kosloff, publisher of Inside Sim
Racing Webzine. ``Sim racing offers us all of the thrills and
excitement of real racing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sim racers have been around since before the World Wide Web,
back when their races were conducted or posted move by move like a
chess match. As the .MDBU/Internet[ .MDNM/'Net.MDBU/].MDNM/ and
technology has developed, so.MDBU/,.MDNM/ too.MDBU/,.MDNM/ has
simulated racing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet search engines list scores of sites for online and
offline sim racing, several for Grand Prix and Formula driving, but
most for NASCAR interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR legitimized sim racing last season by sanctioning the
NASCAR Racing Online Series on the Total Entertainment Network
(www.ten.net). Veteran driver Dale Earnhardt Jr..MDBU/,.MDNM/ was a
frequent competitor in the 15-race series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To go along with this weekend's Primestar 500 at TMS, Sierra
Sports of Watertown, Mass., has introduced NASCAR Racing-1999
Edition _ good news for virtual drivers. Sierra software developers
toured TMS and updated the track's environment, complete with
changes to the notorious Turns 1 and 4, and the addition of a
10-story office and condominium tower at Turn 2 and seating on the
backstretch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the customer to see what the track is really like
through our products,'' said Dave Matson, a Sierra Sports
developer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an example of the attention to detail that goes with sim
racing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And depending on how competitive sim racers want to be, virtual
drivers can spend several hundreds on hardware, software, fees and
Internet connections. Standard PC specifications will work, but
most competitive drivers prefer high-end graphic cards and
connections to their Internet server simply because a
split-second-delay in data translation can result in a major
pileup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers have gone so far as to build or purchase their own
racing cockpits, Kosloff said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John O'Keefe of Lewisville, who helped develop a site called
Virtual Racing Online Connection (www.vroc.net) for online drivers,
said he was a competitive driver in California before moving to
Texas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the debate on virtual racing of whether it
makes you a better real-life racer or a better real-life driver,''
he said. ``I think it goes both ways.'' &QL;

BAYLOR GIVES BLISS DEADLINE FOR DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Mexico's Dave Bliss said last night that he is still
considering whether to become Baylor's next basketball coach as
sources say he has until today to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baylor is a special place, and I'm saying that not only
because I'm a Baptist,'' Bliss said. ``And I do love Texas. I'm
just glad they're not still playing in Heart O' Texas Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss visited the campus again over the weekend. Butler
University athletic director John Parry said that Bulldogs coach
Barry Collier also was in Waco over the weekend, but it was his
understanding that Collier had not been offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the search said he believed Baylor would
turn to Collier if Bliss decided to remain at New Mexico, but that
Bliss was the No. 1 option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding \RBaylor and Bliss\S have agreed on a
contract and now Baylor is waiting on Bliss to say yes or no,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   The source said he did not know what could be delaying Bliss'
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss met yesterday morning with New Mexico athletic director
Rudy Davalos and the two have scheduled to meet again this morning.
A source familiar with yesterday's meeting said that at that time
Bliss remained undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about contract, it's not about money,'' the New
Mexico source said. ``He has a red ball in one hand and a green
ball in the other. But everyone knows he cannot wait any longer to
make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry confirmed Collier's visit, but said, ``Based on our
communication, I don't believe that Barry has been offered the job.
And I think I would know.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years Collier has taken the Bulldogs to the NCAA
Tournament twice and three berths in the National Invitation
Tournament. Butler lost to Clemson in the NIT quarterfinals this
season to finish 22-10.
</P>
<P>
   Collier was an assistant under Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
for three years and for Don Monson at Idaho and Oregon.

<P>
   DALLAS _ Just like the award-winning halftime magic act, Quick
Change, the momentum changed quickly last night in the game between
the Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   One moment the Mavericks had the Lakers on the run, piercing
their defense with precision passes and accurate shooting. The next
moment the Lakers were playing like potential world champions.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Lakers had enough magic to hold off the
Mavericks, 96-93, before a sellout crowd of 18,121 at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are 9-18, while the Lakers improved to 19-9. It's
the seventh time this season the Mavericks have lost by six or
fewer points, as their offense crumbled again in the waning
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a winnable game,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson
said. ``We played them pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy with how hard we played and how well we played.
Again, it's not quite good enough. No complaints about the game.
They're very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Lakers are good, but the Mavericks missed too many
chances to drive a stake into the West Coast team. Most notably was
a wide-open layup Steve Nash missed with 16 seconds remaining and
the Mavericks trailing by four points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rushed it,'' said Nash, who had three points, eight assists
and four turnovers. ``It was in my heel \Rof his hand\S. I choked.
I don't want to make any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Glen Rice increased the Lakers' lead to 96-90
with 12.7 seconds remaining. Erick Strickland sliced the deficit in
half with a 3-point field goal with 4.3 seconds remaining, but the
Mavericks couldn't get the ball back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team did a good job,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said.
``They played good defense and got the job done when they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks put on a performance in the first period that was
worthy of an Oscar. They shot .579 in the quarter and led by as
much as 10 points (25-15).
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green ignited the charge with 11 points and eight rebounds,
and Michael Finley contributed eight of his 23 points and four
assists. But the Lakers were undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   In Shaquille O'Neal, Glen Rice, Kobe Bryant and Dennis Rodman,
the Lakers have a quartet of all-stars. But it was Travis Knight
who jump-started the Lakers' offense with five baskets and a steal
in the early stages of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got strung out a little bit on him because we were
double-teaming the ball in the backcourt, and on two occasions we
got open,'' Nelson said. ``He had a big quarter, and that's a guy
that you think you can contain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we concentrate on him, we can contain him. But we played
well in that quarter and he hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   After that the Lakers got serious, the Mavericks missed a bushel
of shots and the Lakers gradually pulled away to complete a
six-game road trip with a 3-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal survived the foul-fest the Mavericks swarmed him with to
score 25 points and grab nine rebounds. Bryant finished with 21
points and Rice added 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who picked up 17 rebounds, was being, well, Rodman.
After hitting a free throw in the third period, he drew a technical
for blowing a kiss at Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Rodman was disturbed because Nelson ordered Finley
to intentionally foul Rodman _ a .333 shooter from the line _
although Rodman didn't have the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so many weapons now that you can't really
concentrate on just Shaq,'' Nelson said. ``I thought overall we did
a pretty good job.''

WATCHING THE WORM: RODMAN ATTRACTS A CROWD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dennis Rodman bumped into the common folk last night at
Reunion Arena. Unlike himself, they had natural hair color, a
general respect for the broad guidelines of human civilization and
no tatoos.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 70-something lady who hung a Rodman No. 73 jersey
from a long string, hoping to reel in an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   There was Dr. Tony Evans, dressed in a three-piece suit and
toting a Bible on his way to pregame chapel. In the hall he passed
Rodman, wearing plaid pajama pants, a plain white T-shirt, a black
do-rag, sandals and enough body piercings to short-circuit a metal
detector.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Mavericks' Chris Anstey, whose eyes became
Australian for terrified when Rodman _ after 30 minutes of
scribbling notes while watching a tape of the Mavericks' last game
_ bolted into Dallas' locker room and began lifting weights while
listening to a blaring CD on his headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, the NBA's reigning bad boy, even crossed paths and
traded elbows with A.C. Green, the NBA's choirboy.
</P>
<P>
   And there were two unidentified white males, meeting with
Rodman, Dallas police and NBA security after the game concerning
what the men described as a previously filed lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   As much as two hours before the Lakers' 96-93 victory, Rodman's
first Dallas appearance since he jumped on stage with Pearl Jam at
Reunion last July had already generated scalpers, children in
rainbow wigs, the second sellout and the first real electricity of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   All in a day-and-night's work _ oh yeah, and don't forget the 17
rebounds and the technical foul for blowing a kiss _ for the
league's best attention and rebounder grabber.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the real excitement. All-Rodman, All-Night.
</P>
<P>
   That's where, lucky for Rodman, he always bumps into Kelly
Davis. For the last four years, it has been Davis' daily duty to
control the most uncontrollable person on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep his life as normal as possible,'' Davis said
with a sheepish grin. ``I'm his friend, a guy he trusts. When he
strays, I try to be a voice of reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, in another shrewd move, hired Davis off the Chicago
police force to be his bodyguard. Davis was there when Rodman
kicked a Minnesota cameraman in the groin, when Rodman showed up in
New York's Rockefeller Plaza in a wedding dress, and, yes, there
last week during Rodman's sabbatical to attend to personal
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about Carmen \RElectra\S,'' Davis said laughing.
``He was with her most of the time. If he's not with her, he's on
the phone calling her every second.''
</P>
<P>
   As Davis quickly found out, his job is as much about keeping
Rodman away from the public as much as vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life is crazy, more than people realize,'' Davis said.
``He can't go to the movies or the mall without getting hassled.
It's my job to keep his path as clear as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Davis' jobs last night included getting nine tickets for
Rodman's immediate family, including his mother, who still lives in
the Dallas area. Rodman spends lots of his time here in the summer,
and has a growing excavation company in Frisco. Davis said Dallas
is one of the safest places for Rodman, because people know him
best here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds crazy, but Dennis is quiet, shy and
introverted,'' Davis said. ``Off the court, he's as down-to-earth
as anyone you'd ever want to meet. Of course, he's got a marketing
side to him, and you can see for yourself how successful he is at
that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who was fined $100 for his eight-day leave, said he is
back with the Lakers for good and that his departure was more about
finding out if he really wanted to play basketball rather than
problems with drinking, gambling or Carmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy playing, as you can see,'' Rodman said after
lifting weights for an hour after the game. ``If I keep my head
right I can have a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the ultimate distraction, most feel Rodman is not
only good for the Lakers, but the NBA. His controversial tirades
and ferocious rebounding keep the league in the headlines and the
Lakers in the hunt for their first championship in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound strange, but he's worth the trouble,'' said
Lakers guard and former Mavericks star Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Added Shaquille O'Neal, ``It's cool to have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   By his standards Rodman was tame last night. Sporting a new
tattoo of a scantily-clad woman on the back of his right calf,
Rodman played an efficient, emotionless 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the game midway through the first quarter to an 80-20
cheer-jeer ratio, regularly called out Dallas' offensive plays to
teammates and LA's coaching staff, helped up Erick Strickland after
a second-quarter collision and drew his only technical in the third
for blowing a kiss toward Nelson after sinking a free throw created
by an intentional foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just having fun, entertaining the fans a little,''
Rodman said. ``But, unfortunately, the league is trying to take the
fun out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Rodman is all about entertainment. Just ask one of
the 18,121 common folk who paid to see something out of the
ordinary last night.

BAD REPAIR OF YEAR 2000 FLAW OVERPAYS FOOD STAMP USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what some are calling the most widespread damage yet from an
attempt to fix a year 2000 bug, New Jersey officials scrambled on
Monday to correct a computer error that gave $30 million in
unexpected credits to food stamp recipients, who crowded grocery
stores for the second day of a statewide shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers warn that the mistake points to the potential for
disruptions throughout the year, not just on the widely anticipated
witching day of Jan 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of New Jersey residents continued to carry the
windfalls in their food-stamp accounts through Monday afternoon.
State officials said they had fixed the problem by nightfall, and
now expect to take several days to decide whether those who used
the premature benefits will keep the bonus, or wait until May for
their next credit, a prospect that advocates for the poor say could
lead to desperation.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, New Jersey accidentally credited 194,000
food-stamp accounts with benefits that should have arrived April 1,
giving food-stamp recipients a large balance at a time of month
when most accounts are depleted. The error occurred after the State
Department of Human Services tried to fix a computer to defuse the
problems caused by a programming shortcut that reduced years to the
last two digits, meaning that some computers could mistake 2000 for
1900.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake affected the 90 percent of New Jersey's food-stamp
users who get their benefits by swiping a magnetic card, much like
a debit card, at the cash registers of grocery stores. People
discovered the mistake when they went to make purchases Sunday
morning and found a surprisingly large balance on the receipt. The
news galloped through low-income communities and grocery stores
reported runs similar to those before a huge snow storm. At noon on
Monday, 84,000 families still had use of the benefits, which
average about $75 for each person.
</P>
<P>
   At the Western Beef Supermarket in East Orange, where the
shelves were noticeably bare, Mary Smith of Newark, who had
returned for the second day in a row, said that the pandemonium on
Monday was nothing compared to Sunday. ``People were taking out
two, three carts of food at a time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One authority on the issues that computer people often refer to
as Y2K, Dr. Howard A. Rubin of Hunter College, said the New Jersey
episode appeared to be ``the biggest visible occurrence of Y2K
impact on the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gone wrong, but they've been spotty and caught
quickly,'' said Rubin, the chairman of the computer science
department. ``There have been problems with banking systems, but
nothing that has affected so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic food-stamp cards are administered by a private
contractor in Milwaukee. When the state transmitted information
about April benefits to the contractor early Sunday, a computer in
Trenton _ which had been adjusted for year 2000 problems two weeks
ago _ said the funds should be available on April 1, 1990, instead
of 1999, resulting in an instant credit.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Monday, officials doing a computer autopsy discovered
the reason. Because of an error introduced during the adjustment
two weeks ago, it failed to fill in the year this weekend when
data-processing workers were setting up the order for April's
benefits. According to state officials, one of the workers then
tried to fix the year manually by typing in ``1999'' but left off
the last ``9.'' The computer assumed the blank space was a zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was somebody who was well-intentioned, trying to help
things flow,'' said David C. Heins, director of the state's
Division of Family Development, which runs the food-stamp program.
``Based on a typing issue, it just didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's experience underscores warnings by computer experts
that fixing Y2K problems is not a risk-free business. It also
serves as a reminder that Y2K computer problems can strike both
before and after Jan. 1, 2000, the day most people fear.
</P>
<P>
   Harold G. Pakulat, the manager of database services at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that although ``January
1st gets all the press,'' people can expect small disruptions
throughout the year as governments and corporations finish their
fiscal years, and as new programs introduce new problems. ``As we,
quote, fix software, you hope for smaller and smaller bugs,''
Pakulat said. ``But software is written by humans and tested by
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey food-stamp users who called the toll-free ``customer
service help line'' on the backs of their food-stamp cards were
advised not to use the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, state officials confirmed what they called ``a
spike in usage.'' But the officials were unable to determine how
many people had used their April allotments, and so decided to wait
a day or two to decide whether those people would get a new credit
in April, or would receive no extra funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options range from forgiveness to full recoupment to
something in between,'' said Laurie A. Facciarossa, the director of
public affairs for the Department of Human Services. ``The
challenge for us now is determining how much was spent, who spent
it, and to look for a mechanism for possibly recouping those
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, food banks warned that extreme hardship could
result if the state cut future benefits to make up for the early
spending. ``To ask people to go six weeks without food stamps to
make up for the state's problem seems incredibly cruel,'' said
Betsy Shimberg, the policy analyst at Mercer Street Friends, which
is based in Trenton and runs a food cooperative for central New
Jersey.

LAKERS BREAK EVEN ON ROAD TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When at last the longest, most taxing road trip of the
compact season came to its merciful conclusion Monday, it was clear
the Lakers had endured something exhausting, something brutal.
</P>
<P>
   You could see it in the breakaway dunk attempt Kobe Bryant
clanged off the rim as the final buzzer sounded in a too-close
96-93 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. You could see it in the
10-point lead the Lakers nearly squandered in the final two minutes
at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward, the effects of six games in six cities in nine
days seemed perfectly summed up in Shaquille O'Neal's postgame
attire. His luggage and all his clothes having disappeared in
Orlando, O'Neal concluded this trip wearing an ill-fitting Dallas
Mavericks sweatsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Lakers come home having truly weathered something
extraordinary, and feeling grateful to have pulled out a 3-3
record.
</P>
<P>
   When the final buzzer sounded in Dallas, ending game, set and
road trip, all Bryant could do was laugh about his failed
pyrotechnics and hug the basket standard in a moment of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What'd we come out, .500 on this trip? Whatever. We'll take
it,'' said Bryant, who scored 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   The trip began with a loss and no Dennis Rodman and sunk to a
1-3 start before the Lakers rebounded in style with wins over the
Magic and Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing you can do about it,'' Bryant said. ``We would have
loved to win them all, but that's not the case, so just roll with
the punches. Good to come out with a win, though.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a close call.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, the Lakers came out sluggish and
surrendered a double-digit lead, as the Mavericks grabbed a
10-point advantage in the first quarter. And though the Lakers
remedied that in the third quarter, they nearly let it all slip
away in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice's 3-pointer gave the Lakers a 90-80 lead with 2:16
remaining. The win practically locked up, the Lakers' thoughts
perhaps turned to visions of Southern California beaches and
roller-blading women in thongs. They certainly weren't thinking
much about Gary Trent, although that might be understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Trent hit two jumpers and a layup in 18 seconds, and O'Neal
missed 3 of 4 foul shots as the Mavericks sliced the lead to 91-88.
Rick Fox hit 1 of 2 free throws, Bryant made 2 of 2 and Derek
Fisher missed a pair of foul shots as the Mavs stayed within four
points.
</P>
<P>
   But when Michael Finley missed an open 3-pointer and Rice came
up with the ball, then two free throws, the Lakers had survived
their latest faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we've played lately,'' Fox said, ``we first of all
want to get the win, regardless of how pretty or how ugly it looks.
And then from that point we can work on the aesthetics of the
performance. But a win is a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the prevailing feeling. But the Lakers, who improved to
11-0 with Dennis Rodman playing, are used to less stressful
meetings with the Mavs, who they've beaten 15 straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our fourth game in five nights. We're just kind of
tired,'' O'Neal said. ``I think fatigue set in a little bit.
However, we got a win. . . . We gotta get another win streak
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rodman's 17 rebounds drew much of the attention, the
lesser-known starting power forward made a strong contribution.
Travis Knight scored 10 of his 12 points in a 12-8 run to start the
third quarter and give the Lakers their first lead, which they kept
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left to do was get home. And to find O'Neal some
new duds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Bradley was gracious enough to give me these sweats, so
thank you Shawn,'' O'Neal quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all ready to get home,'' Bryant said. ``Ready to
see the Forum.''

VIRTUAL RACE-CAR DRIVERS, START YOUR PCs! 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than drive with the mass of humanity that will inch and
nudge toward Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth this weekend, some
NASCAR enthusiasts will try to experience the thrills of racing in
a less-congested way.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be sim racing.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be racing against other gearhead gamers who are online,
on a network or one-on-one. They'll be clutching a steering wheel
or joystick in front of a personal computer loaded with software
that simulates the NASCAR experience.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these virtual drivers won't exactly face the G-forces
or smell the combustible fuel that real drivers encounter. But,
thanks to some software developers who tediously duplicate the
track to the closest detail, they'll get an idea of the strategy
involved in driving in a NASCAR environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us will never get the chance to climb in a real stock
car and race,'' said Shawn D. Kosloff, publisher of Inside Sim
Racing Webzine. ``Sim racing offers us all of the thrills and
excitement of real racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sim racers have been around since before the World Wide Web,
back when their races were conducted or posted move by move like a
chess match. As the Internet and technology has developed, so, too,
has simulated racing.
</P>
<P>
   Internet search engines list scores of sites for online and
offline sim racing, several for Grand Prix and Formula driving, but
most for NASCAR interests.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR legitimized sim racing last season by sanctioning the
NASCAR Racing Online Series on the Total Entertainment Network
(www.ten.net). Veteran driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. was a frequent
competitor in the 15-race series.
</P>
<P>
   To go along with this weekend's Primestar 500 at TMS, Sierra
Sports of Watertown, Mass., has introduced NASCAR Racing-1999
Edition. Sierra software developers toured TMS and updated the
track's environment, complete with changes to the notorious Turns 1
and 4, and the addition of a 10-story office and condominium tower
at Turn 2 and seating on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the customer to see what the track is really like
through our products,'' said Dave Matson, a Sierra Sports
developer.
</P>
<P>
   It's an example of the attention to detail that goes with sim
racing.
</P>
<P>
   And depending on how competitive sim racers want to be, virtual
drivers can spend several hundreds of dollars on hardware,
software, fees and Internet connections. Standard PC specifications
will work, but most competitive drivers prefer high-end graphic
cards and connections to their Internet server simply because a
split-second-delay in data translation can result in a major
pileup.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers have gone so far as to build or purchase their own
racing cockpits, Kosloff said.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Keefe of Lewisville, Texas, who helped develop a site
called Virtual Racing Online Connection (www.vroc.net) for online
drivers, said he was a competitive driver in California before
moving to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the debate on virtual racing of whether it
makes you a better real-life racer or a better real-life driver,''
he said. ``I think it goes both ways.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rudy Tomjanovich was worried. His team looked loose and happy, on a
roll. And Tomjanovich, watching this, saw danger.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Things are going good, but this is a team that can lull you to
sleep in relaxed comfort,'' Tomjanovich said of the Sacramento
Kings. ``You think, `Let's play some offensive basketball.' And you
look up, and they're on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, that was obvious to every stunned fan at Compaq
Center. But Tomjanovich came to this unhappy realization 8{ hours
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Rockets build a 22-point lead, then blow all
but four points of it before beating the Kings 110-100, Tomjanovich
could not have described the Rockets' seventh win in their last
eight games better than he did before it started.
</P>
<P>
   That duty fell to center Antoine Carr, who was activated Monday
but unable to leave the bench as another huge lead disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The order of events, just a bit skewed Monday, should be clear,
Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You crush them, then you laugh,'' he said. ``After you cut the
jugular vein and they bleed to death, then you can laugh about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the Rockets couldn't help but bust out the grins
in the third quarter. Everything they tried offensively seemed to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen (25 points) and Michael Dickerson (23) were
attacking the basket with ease. Hakeem Olajuwon, who scored a
season-high 32 points, had his jump shot going as well as in any
game this season. Charles Barkley controlled the paint offensively
and the boards on both ends as the Rockets were on their way to
outrebounding the Kings 54-34.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley shut down more celebrated rookie Jason Williams,
who made one of eight shots for two points (he is 10-of-45 in his
past four games). And the Rockets had their best passing game,
finishing with a season-high 32 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were rolling so easily that they were picking
through offensive plays like Christmas presents. They pushed their
lead to 22 midway through the third quarter and were still leading
by 20 with 9:51 to go in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets almost let the Kings have the last laugh.
Sacramento went on a 23-7 run in 6:51 to pull within 99-95 with
three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   In that stretch, the Rockets made six of 11 shots but had eight
turnovers to let the Kings back in the game. The Rockets finished
with 23 turnovers, with Olajuwon giving away nine and Barkley six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had turnovers, and there wasn't that much defensive
pressure on,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We didn't have the mental
toughness to execute. We outrebounded them by 20, and we didn't get
more shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lacked the killer instinct to put this one away and get our
guys some rest. We have a back-to-back coming up (against Dallas
and Toronto on Wednesday and Thursday). We talk about this all the
time. We have to get hungrier and hungrier. If the lead is at 16
points, we've got to make it to 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings guard Vernon Maxwell haunted his old haunt with 10 of his
25 points during the spurt, and Chris Webber chipped in eight of
his 29. And if the prospect of losing the rest of a sizable lead
wasn't frightening enough, for a few moments it appeared the
Rockets would lose even more.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:05 left, Olajuwon fell to the court, having turned his
right ankle. He missed just 20 seconds, however, and said later
that he knew the ankle was all right after two or three minutes of
walking on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came down wrong,'' Olajuwon said.
</P>
<P>
   And just like Olajuwon, the Rockets quickly recovered. Barkley
made a jumper in the lane and three consecutive free throws to put
the game away. Dickerson took a long pass from Olajuwon to push the
lead back to double figures, and at least one Rockets player
believed that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our killer instinct is not as bad as people make it out to
be,'' Barkley said. ``We're still learning. Vernon Maxwell shot
them back in it. It would be great if we could win every game by 20
points, but it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's, however, was a lone voice of restraint, excluding
Maxwell, who would only say, ``This ain't my home no more.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Rockets were only too willing to lament the rout
that got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big deal,'' Pippen said of the team's continued
inability to increase safe leads. ``I would like to see our bench
get out there and have the opportunity to play and have some fun.
Our lackadaisical performance has really cost them a lot of games
when they could have gotten involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is. I think it's a lot more mental now
than anything. I think we're fighting it so hard to keep it from
happening, it's almost like we're jinxing ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Brent Price: ``Sooner or later, if you play enough with
fire, you're going to get burned.''

SONICS ENDURING `STRANGE YEAR' OF LIFE ON SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Thankfully for the Sonics, they caught Allen Iverson
on an off night.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's reigning player of the month showed up a little
off-kilter Monday night. Call it a temporary regression, although
the Sixers guard has outgrown the cold, hard knocks against him.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson dribbled out of control here and there. He took the ball
coast-to-coast when he should have passed off to a supporting cast
that, for the most part, he has helped be better in this
post-lockout, nutball season.
</P>
<P>
   The kid left the door open for Gary Payton to have himself a
small field day _ much deserved after the disaster in Denver Sunday
night and the Sonics' loss Friday at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's stumble and the Sixers' sub-par night was a small but
much appreciated gift from a suddenly promising Eastern Conference
franchise. It saved the Sonics a terrible fate in letting them
chalk up a 92-76 win. A loss would have put the Sonics at .500, and
there is no way this team or its fans are prepared to face such a
harsh reality as that.
</P>
<P>
   Mediocrity? The Sonics haven't shown much more than that all
season, despite a 6-0 early season mirage that only delayed the
inevitable truth about this former elite of the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost their identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty bucks we paid for this,'' one KeyArena patron screamed
Monday night when things started out a little sluggish and sloppy _
a common affliction for these now 13-11 Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   But $80 was probably worth it, if only because the win kept the
Sonics above .500, and psychologically, symbolically, there is no
way they are prepared for not being winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't lost this many games in a long time. This is a
strange year. I don't know if it's the lockout or what, but this is
strange,'' Detlef Schrempf said.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf's expectations for this season were the same as any
during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compete for the title. Win a lot of games during the regular
season. Secure home-court advantage,'' Schrempf said.
</P>
<P>
   If there was optimism at the start of the season among Sonic
veterans, it was that enough of the nucleus of the winning
franchise was intact and therefore capable of remaining a force.
But there was a slew of evidence that the Sonics were headed for a
serious slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah the (bulk of the starting) players are the same, but
you're missing some major ingredients,'' Schrempf said.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, any chance for momentum and chemistry were small.
There was George Karl's departure, the aging core of veterans, new
head coach Paul Westphal's lack of training-camp time to work out
lineup and personnel issues, a poor start by Vin Baker and overall
poor team shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Someone must have made the mistake of promising newcomer Billy
Owens starting minutes, because Westphal's tinkering with the
lineup has helped flatten the Sonics and turn them into a shell of
their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is even scared of us anymore,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost midway through this nutball, 50-game season, the
scouting report on the Sonics is simple and apparently common
knowledge throughout the NBA: Get a jump on them early because they
don't come out with intensity, and they can't or won't come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the personnel to come back,'' Payton said. ``We
can come back part of the way, but that's not all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors proved that Friday night by going on a 16-0 run in
the first quarter. The Sonics never regained the lead, losing
90-78. Same thing Sunday in Denver. The Nuggets barraged the
Sonics, shooting 50 percent from the floor in running up a 29-point
lead while the Sonics spat out a meager 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the Sixers offered little resistance. But the
funny thing was, even as the Sonics' lead stretched to 20-plus
points in the fourth quarter, KeyArena was well on its way to
clearing out.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be, at least in the old days, when the force was with
them, it was fun to stick around and watch the Sonics dominate.
Times they are changing, to quote Westphal's favorite singer, Bob
Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have not been a .500 team since 1990-91. That was the
second consecutive season they finished .500, but by then they had
drafted Payton No. 2 in the 1990 draft, making their misfortune pay
off with a ticket to the NBA lottery.
</P>
<P>
   They have won 55 games or more since 1992-93, with three seasons
over 60 wins. This too-close-for-comfort proximity to mediocrity
flies in the face of everything that's been established _ or so the
people in the $80 seats thought Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics themselves will take whatever they can get. Payton
wants 15 more wins, at least. He said he'll even take an eighth
seed in the post-season, if Baker's thumb injury means the Sonics
are in for a tougher road the next 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics are stunned almost to the point of catatonia when
it comes to coming to grips with the prospect of falling so far, so
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, (the losing) stinks,'' Hersey Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not sure everyone feels that way. We think we're
playing hard, but we're not. I'm so sick of thinking about it my
head hurts.''

BRYANT TAKES IT ALL IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The highlight shows Sunday night and newspapers across
the nation Monday morning were filled with tales of Kobe Bryant's
exploits in Orlando. The career-high 38 points, the 33-point second
half, the entire back-breaking performance he dumped on the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando coach Chuck Daly called it the 20-year-old's
``coming-out party on national TV.'' Horace Grant said Bryant could
have scored from half-court at will. The only one not raving about
it was Bryant himself. A day later, he was still aw-shucksing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it before,'' he said, ``in high school.'' As if
that's the same as bringing the Lakers back from a 24-point deficit
against a top NBA team on the road before a national audience. ``To
me it is. Because it's just basketball. It's not a big deal to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was nearly historic. The second-half outburst was four
points shy of Elgin Baylor's team record for points in a half. Yet
Bryant hesitated to call it his best game as a pro. With him, it
often looks as if he can just flip the switch and rattle off a
15-point quarter. And yes, it's something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just do it,'' he said. ``It's just part of me, it's in my
nature.'' Like he's unstoppable? Bryant had to laugh. ``Pretty
much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Parting shot: Shaquille O'Neal denies it, but waiting for him
in the locker room in Orlando was a crystal piece honoring him as a
former Magic player on the occasion of the team's 10th anniversary.
Derek Harper got one, too.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal's came with a handwritten note from Magic owner Rich
DeVos, who wrote, ``I can tell you still love this city and its
franchise, so stop bad-mouthing us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal pretended he never saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get nothing. I told you I wasn't gonna take it,'' he
said. ``If they ain't man enough to bring it over to me, I
definitely ain't gonna take it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hadn't heard about DeVos' words. But O'Neal did
refrain from Orlando-bashing after the victory. ``Because I got
class,'' he said Monday. ``You know, I could have ripped that whole
(bleeping) town apart, but I got class, brother.''
</P>
<P>
   So is he done Orlando-bashing?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I ain't done with it. I'm gonna show that they miss me and
they want me back,'' he said. ``That (stuff) happened three years
ago, 365 times three, that's a lot of days. There's a lot of
(stuff) that happens in three years, and they're still (ticked) off
and still crying about (O'Neal leaving). They (screwed) up, the
organization (screwed) up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should name me the general manager. I brought Penny here,
I brought Darrell Armstrong, I brought Horace (Grant), and I was
the one that told them to bring Chuck Daly and Dr. J. You can quote
me on that _ I'm the general manager of that team.''

BAKER-LESS SONICS SHOW LESS THOUGHT, BETTER REACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Perhaps Sonics coach Paul Westphal knew better than
anyone how his team would respond.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because he set the tone after learning that the team's
second-best player could be headed for an extended stay on the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal was calm and resigned. Meanwhile, his Sonics simply
followed suit Monday night and refused to hang their heads.
</P>
<P>
   They hung the Philadelphia 76ers instead.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Gary Payton's 26 points, 13 of which came in a decisive
third quarter, the Sonics overwhelmed the Sixers 92-76 at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sonics' third straight victory at home, and perhaps
their most germane. Not only did they snap a two-game skid, but the
Sonics (13-11) compensated for the loss of Vin Baker against a big
and talented Sixers (14-11) squad.
</P>
<P>
   Baker sat on the Sonics bench in street clothes with a cast and
plastic stabilizer on his right thumb. The 6-foot-11 power forward
has a partially torn ligament and could miss four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden void caused a shakeup in the lineup. Detlef Schrempf
started in place of Baker, and Billy Owens reclaimed his spot at
small forward. The Sonics then chucked the adversity about as
convincingly as Lennox Lewis beat Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team that showed up tonight is the one we like,'' Westphal
said. ``... We had the energy, and we moved the ball, we had good
scoring from several different players and we beat a real good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had lost two straight games against beatable teams,
being embarrassed at Golden State last Friday and falling short in
Denver on Sunday. In both games, the Sonics lacked early intensity
and fell behind by double digits in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, however, was completely different.
</P>
<P>
   After the first quarter ended in an 18-18 tie, the Sonics ran
past the Sixers and went ahead 45-35 at halftime. With a smaller
lineup, the Sonics used their speed and quickness to blow by the
Sixers and create easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tired in the first quarter,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown
said. ``Their energy was a lot better than ours. Their defense was
great. They did exactly what they wanted to do. The more we
struggled, the more they turned it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said the Sonics were ``thinking less and reacting
more.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the strategy as long as Baker is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been missing that lately. We need to get easy baskets,''
said Owens, who had 11 points on 4-for-8 shooting. ``We've got guys
who can run the floor, and we need to use that to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics outhustled the Sixers in every aspect of the game,
especially on the boards. Seattle held a 27-18 rebounding advantage
at halftime. The team's defense also stymied Philadelphia, which
shot just 37 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that we're not good enough to just show up
and overpower people,'' Schrempf said. ``Our style is to scrap.
That's how we've always played. We've always played with the
attitude that we're the underdog, but we haven't being doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf chipped in 17 points and 10 rebounds. Olden Polynice
also grabbed 10 boards.
</P>
<P>
   Payton won his battle with Sixers guard and NBA scoring leader
Allen Iverson, who finished with 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting.
Iverson left the game late in the third quarter after suffering a
cut on his lower lip. He received several stitches, and did not
return after missing all five shots he took in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Hersey Hawkins mostly guarded Iverson, whom the Sixers run most
of their offense through. The Sonics also occasionally
double-teamed Iverson, who had four turnovers and one assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he caught the ball, we tried to make a passer out of
him,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, meanwhile, collected eight assists and six rebounds to
go with his game-high point total.
</P>
<P>
   The game was decided in the third when Payton took control.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sonics leading 53-41 and 7:44 remaining in the period,
Payton scored 13 straight points in a six-minute span. Twice he
took Sixer guard Eric Snow to the basket and converted three-point
plays.
</P>
<P>
   His last field goal in the third was a 3-pointer that put the
Sonics ahead 64-46. Seattle took a 20-point lead into the fourth
quarter, which was garbage time.

NOW UCLA CAN SAY IT HAS BEEN THERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Another school with a storied men's basketball
program showed the UCLA women it could be done. Forty minutes
before the 15th-ranked Bruins met third-ranked Louisiana Tech in
the NCAA Tournament West Regional final on Monday night, Duke upset
three-time defending champion Tennessee in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Bruins be the Dukes of hazard in the Lady Techsters'
path to the Final Four?
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked like UCLA had copied Duke's blue(devil)-print for
success when it bolted to a 10-point lead after 13 minutes at the
Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Bruins had the inspiration. But that and pounds of
perspiration were no match for the sophistication that comes with
having been down this road before. In the end there simply was no
staving off the expiration of UCLA's finest season in two decades.
UCLA succumbed 88-62 in front of a partisan crowd of 5,302 that did
all it could from the opening tip to breathe life into the UCLA
players.
</P>
<P>
   Proving attendance numbers have no bearing on noise levels,
Bruins fans were louder than a lot of those 40,000-plus crowds were
at the Coliseum next door on Saturdays this past fall. They were a
formidable sixth man, though on this night what the Bruins really
could have used was an Amanda Wilson clone.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-0 forward was a big reason the Lady Techsters were able to
crash the boards and the Bruins' party. One of three senior
starters, Wilson finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds. In all,
the Lady Techsters grabbed 22 of the 35 rebounds at UCLA's end,
which placed the Bruins in double jeopardy. Not only was UCLA
denied second-chance baskets, Louisiana Tech was able to ignite its
patented fast break.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Lady Techsters missed the first shot, no matter; they
pulled down 27 offensive boards, giving them plenty of second and
third and even fourth chances. Their overall rebounding goes a long
way toward explaining the considerable discrepancy in shots.
Louisiana Tech took 82 to UCLA's 55.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were making their first appearance in the NCAA's
Elite Eight. Louisiana Tech, as UCLA coach Kathy Olivier was quick
to point out ``has been in this position so many times and it
showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this was Louisiana Tech's 13th NCAA Tournament game in
three years. There's not a play Olivier could diagram to defend
against that kind of experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Techsters, on the strength of an 11-0 run, wrested the
lead from the Bruins with 2:29 to play in the first half. UCLA
would lead only once after that, in the 23rd minute when LaCresha
Flannigan stole the ball and converted a layup, as the Lady
Techsters roared to their 10th NCAA Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (26-8) will get there one day, maybe even as soon as
next year. All the principals will be back in 2000, with the
possible exception of fourth-year junior point guard Erica Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   If she was indeed playing her final game as a collegian, Gomez
bowed out with a bravura performance, gamely contributing 20
minutes and a team-high ( &UR; !ital! &LR; egads) three assists (the Bruins
only had eight) on a gimpy right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Greco, one year removed from stardom at Crescenta
Valley High, ran the team when Gomez couldn't and fell victim _ as
so many more veteran guards have before her _ to the Lady
Techsters' pressure, which they applied like a tourniquet.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind working the ball inside to take advantage of their
height advantage; the Bruins' backcourt had all they could handle
just holding onto the ball. Greco had four of UCLA's 24 turnovers.
Marie Philman turned the ball over six times, mostly because the
Lady Techsters jumped on her passes as though the passes were meant
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just very quick and aggressive,'' a glum Oliver
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost for UCLA. There's no shame in failing as long as
you're able to learn something from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the experience of playing Louisiana Tech, who has
been in this situation, was great for us,'' Olivier said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on this first day of finals week for the Bruins, junior
Maylana Martin admitted to learning a couple of valuable lessons.

   ``We knew their quickness going in. We just have to be a little
smarter (and) do more ball faking to get them out of position ,''
said Martin, who played most of the second half with three fouls.
``In a big game like this you can't afford to have mental lapses
because (the other team) will capitalize on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The task ahead of UCLA is to capitalize on one super season.
There's nothing we saw Monday that suggested the Bruins won't.

UCLA CAN'T TAKE BIG LEAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Duke did it earlier Monday night, upsetting a
top-seeded team. So why couldn't UCLA duplicate the feat?
</P>
<P>
   Because Louisiana Tech wouldn't let the Bruins get a board in
edgewise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a size disadvantage, the top-seeded Lady Techsters
nonetheless used their speed and leaping ability to control the
tempo and take an 88-62 victory in the NCAA West Regional women's
final before 5,302 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech (30-2), winner of 22 in a row, now heads to its
10th Final Four in 18 years, beginning Friday in San Jose. It will
meet Purdue, the last team to beat the Lady Techsters.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded UCLA, which had never reached the regional final
until this season, had its five-game win streak ended and finished
26-8.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons the Lady Techsters were ranked third for much
of the season: an unyielding pressure defense and athleticism to
make up for their deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, athleticism led to 13 steals and a lot of
rebounds. Tech thoroughly controlled the boards, often getting
second, third or even fourth attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their leaping ability, and we didn't do a good job
blocking out,'' UCLA forward Maylana Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like UCLA held the board advantage in Saturday's semifinal
win over Colorado State, the Bruins found themselves on the short
end of a 49-30 rebounding margin. That included a 27-13 difference
on the offensive glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were good on the boards,'' UCLA coach Kathy
Olivier said, ``but they did a number on the offensive boards. We
had to stop them, but they were very quick and aggressive. They
took it to us on the second and third attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with the pressure defense, and it's easy to see how
Tech scored 11 in a row in the first half to turn a 28-18 deficit _
UCLA's largest lead of the game _ into a 29-28 lead it would
relinquish only once.
</P>
<P>
   Tech broke the game open with a 9-0 run in 1:32, and then poured
it on with a 31-12 run over the game's final 8:53.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Lady Techsters attempted 27 more shots and made 17
more field goals than the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Amanda Wilson scored 23 points and had 12
rebounds in being named the West Regionals' most outstanding
player. She was followed closely by senior forward Monica Maxwell
with 22 points and 13 rebounds. She, too, made the all-tournament
team.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of emotional lifts from Erica Gomez playing or
Michelle Greco starting could counter that.
</P>
<P>
   Greco started for Gomez, who had sprained her ankle, and had her
supporters. One brought a ``Greco 3:16'' sign. Another had one that
read ``Yo Quiero Greco.''
</P>
<P>
   And Greco didn't disappoint, scoring on two driving layups early
to give the Bruins a 10-6 lead. She played 35 minutes and finished
with six points, two assists and four turnovers in being named to
the all-tournament team.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez came in with 14:12 to play in the half to a standing
ovation. She alternated at the point with Greco and contributed six
points on free throws, three assists and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez appeared in pregame warmups with her ankle taped and in an
air cast. She was given the OK to play after X-rays Sunday revealed
no breaks. Gomez iced her ankle every two hours and followed that
with electrical stimulation, massage, elevation and a range of
motion exercises.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA used its height advantage early. Led by all-tournament
player Martin's eight points, the Bruins took a 28-18 lead with
7:25 to play. Martin finished with a team-best 16 points, but all
eight of her second-half points came in the final 1:21.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes:Although there were some initial fears about slow
ticket sales back in January, USC officials considered hosting the
regionals to be an overall success.
</P>
<P>
   The first session on Saturday drew more than 4,000 to the Sports
Arena and Monday night's final between UCLA and Louisiana Tech drew
5,302.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the USC women's team will play all of its home games
at the Sports Arena, instead of the on-campus Lyon Center, which
seats about 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   The change in venue was requested by USC coach Chris Gobrecht,
who is trying to raise the profile of the women's basketball
program.

   1. LEVI'S BLUES For decades, Levi's jeans have been cool. In the
1950s they were associated with James Dean, Marlon Brando and
teenage rebellion. In the Vietnam War era, they were a symbol of
the rock-and-roll generation. But today's trendy teenagers wouldn't
be caught dead in tight-fitting Levi's jeans. Baggy pants are in,
and Levi's missed the boat. Now it's trying to climb back aboard
with a new line and a new marketing strategy. By Hal Espen. From
The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (4,000 words) + edited
article available. 2. AN ADOPTION TRAGEDY When Martin and Phyllis
Juman adopted Michael in 1965, the adoption agency concealed from
them the fact that both his parents had serious mental illnesses.
In fact, as they later learned, his mother was a schizophrenic who
had undergone a lobotomy. When Michael too became schizophrenic and
learned the truth about his biological parents, he urged his
adoptive parents to sue the agency - a suit that is still alive and
raising provocative questions, though Michael himself has died. By
Lisa Belkin. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (6,600
words) + edited article available. 3. THE SALON MAKEOVER In David
Talbot's Web dream, his tweedy 'zine' is a full-service scandal
sheet for the global village. Launched in 1995 as an online
literary club, Salon still has at its core book reviews, political
and cultural commentary from writers like Garrison Keillor and
Camille Paglia, candid articles about sex, and a reader's feedback
forum called ``Table Talk.'' It has added sections on academia,
parenting, travel, personal finance and technology. While its
diversity has built Salon's audience, the most dramatic spikes in
readership have come when the site posts a big scoop. Talbot wants
to make Salon the leading brand for Web journalism. By Warren St.

 POLL SHOWS BUSH, GORE TIED IN STATE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore, who has made 53 trips
to California, still comes in a close second to Texas Governor
George W. Bush in a head-to-head matchup for the 2000 presidential
race in California, according to a new Field Poll.
<P>
   Were the presidential election to be held today in the nation's
most populous state, a Bush-Gore race would end in a statistical
tie. Bush would get 48 percent of the vote and Gore 46 percent _ a
difference smaller than the margin of error _ with 6 percent
undecided, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   And both Gore on the Democratic side and Bush on the Republican
side hold dramatic leads over their closest party rivals, former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and Elizabeth Dole respectively, the
poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is running 10 to 12 points behind in most of the national
polls, so relatively speaking, he's doing better in California than
nationally,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll.
``The bad news (for Gore) is, he's not ahead of Bush. Were the
election held today, it would be a very tight election.''
</P>
<P>
   With a year to go before the California 2000 presidential
primary, 37 percent of Republican voters polled say Bush is their
first choice for a party candidate. That's nearly twice the support
of Dole (19 percent) and more than rest of the pack of ``second
tier'' GOP candidates combined.
</P>
<P>
   But next year's March 7 presidential primary will be the state's
first under the ``open primary'' system, which allows voters, no
matter how they are registered, to choose candidates from any
party. Both Democratic and Republican leaders are trying to push
legislation to modify that law _ in one case, involving counting
ballots two different ways, and in another case, through a separate
count of presidential votes restricted to party lines.
</P>
<P>
   In an ``open primary'' race, Bush still edges out Gore, 24 to 23
percent, with Dole coming in at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Republican should score more votes in the open primary
than Gore, it will be written as a weakness, and probably
justifiably so,'' said DiCamillo. ``It is seen as a mini-general
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The polling of presidential preferences in California a year
before voters make their choices serves as a ``benchmark'' for the
2000 race, and already points up some key factors that could help
shape the race, said DiCamillo.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Gore, a standing vice president, faces unusually strong
challenges from Bush and Dole, who are already well-known and
viewed positively by most state voters, DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the criteria of early polls is that you have one
candidate who's very well known, and the rest not,'' said
DiCamillo. ``We're registering opinions about Bush and Dole that
are almost as high as we're getting for Gore. ... It's almost an
equal-footing comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the Field Poll:
</P>
<P>
   -- Looking toward a Republican field in the 2000 presidential
primary, an equal number of state voters _ 48 percent _ say they
would be inclined to vote for either Bush or Dole. Specifically
among GOP voters, 79 percent are inclined to vote for Bush,
compared to 12 percent who are not; 65 percent say they're inclined
to vote for Dole, with nearly a quarter saying they would not.
</P>
<P>
   -- Columnist Pat Buchanan appears to have the highest negative
rating among Republicans voters. One quarter of Republicans say
they're inclined to vote for him, but a whopping 65 percent say
they would not _ and only 10 percent remain undecided on the
question. ``That's a tough row to hoe, even in his own party,''
said DiCamillo.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. _ while still an unknown to most
Republicans _ manages generally positive ratings among party
loyalists. Fully 35 percent of GOP voters say they would be
inclined to vote for him, compared to just 28 percent who would
not, with 37 percent still holding no opinion. ``That shows some
room for expansion,'' said DiCamillo. ``He needs to build
awareness, to introduce himself and convince people to vote for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On the Democratic ballot for the 2000 primary, Californians
are split (47-47) on whether or not they would be inclined to
support Gore, with 6 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   -- But among registered Democrats, fully 73 percent said they
would be inclined to support Gore, compared with 20 percent who
would not and 7 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The Field poll was conducted March 3-14 among a representative
sample of 718 registered voters in California. The margin of error
is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points among general voters, and
plus or minus 5.8 percent among the Democratic and Republican voter
samples.

 &HT;    Oh, to be young again
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When I was eight, I asked for a strapless
bathing suit. My mother's response? ``NO! Absolutely not. You're
too young.'' No big surprise there. That was her answer to
everything.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was dropped, for the time being, but by summer I was
back at it, begging for a ``big girl'' bathing suit. Mother
reminded me I was not a big girl and had nothing to hold up a
strapless bathing suit. ``It'll fall right off of you,'' she
warned. I moved on to plan B.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in an old photo album is a shot of me standing
ankle-deep in the surf on Jacksonville Beach, clinging to my
shapeless old silver bathing suit and looking seriously silly. In
an attempt to transform myself into a sultry bathing beauty, I had
untied the black ribbon that held up the front of my suit, the one
my mother had so carefully double-knotted around my neck that
morning before she let me out the door, slipped it under my arms
and retied it in the back. At the time I thought myself stunning.
Truth is, I looked like a Christmas tree ornament with legs.
</P>
<P>
   And guess where the armholes hit?
</P>
<P>
   When I was 11, I had a fit for a see-through blouse and a
flesh-colored slip with skinny straps like Ginger Rogers was
wearing in her latest movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' my mother said as she handed me the garbage to
take out. ``You're too young.''
</P>
<P>
   When I was 12, I asked if I could shave my legs. ``Cer-tain-ly
(when she was really annoyed she pronounced every syllable) NOT!
What nonsense. You're too young to grow a beard.'' I thought she
meant on my chin and don't think I didn't sweat it when I finally
sneaked around and shaved. Daily, I checked my chin in the bathroom
mirror for telltale signs of a 5 o'clock shadow.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday afternoon over a particularly satisfying dinner of
fried chicken with rice and gravy, I began to take special notice
of our guest, Mrs. Ussery's chin. Before Mother could stuff a
biscuit in my mouth, I managed to blurt out the question: ``Mrs.
Ussery, did you shave your legs when you were too young?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ussery looked puzzled, Daddy dropped a drumstick in his
lap, and my mother decided I?d had enough to eat and ordered me
outside. Later, she explained that Mrs. Ussery's mustache and chin
whiskers were a hormone problem, not a shaving one. I'd never heard
of a hormone before so I asked what one was. Mother explained that
young ladies my age didn't have any so I wasn't to worry about it.
I asked when I could have some and she said we'd discuss it when I
was older.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 14, I wanted a strapless evening dress with sequins.
Mother asked where I thought I might be going to wear such a dress.
Nowhere, I confessed, but I thought it would be a good thing to
have on hand. She reminded me I still had no chest. I asked for a
pair of falsies for Christmas. Ho! Ho! HO!
</P>
<P>
   For my 16th birthday, I wanted a glass of wine with my birthday
dinner. Mother said the only wine that would cross my lips as long
as I lived in her house would be at communion. I reminded her the
Baptists used grape juice. She reminded me I was too young.
</P>
<P>
   And now life seems to have come full cycle. See-through blouses
are back and I don't even want one. Shaving my legs stopped being
fun the day after I'd started doing it, and over the weekend I went
shopping for a bathing suit. I've yet to figure out how that old
bag staring back at me in the three-way mirror managed to sneak
into my dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Life is all backwards. If my mother were still around, I'd
probably be bugging her for a new body and she'd still be giving me
the same old answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait until you're older.''

 &HT;    Youth should draw strength from family's past
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Tex. _ A seventh-grade homework assignment has
provided some surprising insight: For a glimpse of your kid's
future, look at his past.
</P>
<P>
   As I helped my son, Joaquin, illustrate his family tree for a
lesson, I enjoyed pointing to different branches of that tree
occupied by the ancestors for whom he is named. The youngest of our
children, he was blessed with three given names, although he
sometimes claims it is a burden.
</P>
<P>
   His first name is Neff, for his Uncle Neff and paternal
grandfather Pat Neff Walker, who in turn was named for the late
Texas governor and Baylor University president. My father-in-law
Pat, a poor East Texas boy who had to borrow his brother's boots to
travel to the Army enlistment post, worked his way through college
and then law school after serving in World War II. His second name,
Joaquin, after his maternal great-grandfather who came to Texas and
dreamed of an education for my mom and her sisters then died before
he
</P>
<P>
   could provide it. His third name is Eusebio, after his maternal
grandfather, my dad, who fulfilled those dreams, albeit a
generation later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to illustrating his family tree, Joaquin had been
asked to write down family stories or anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   So I recounted how Joaquin's paternal great-great-grandfather,
Moses Jepson, sailed from Denmark to the United States with his two
brothers and wound up in Chicago in 1871, right at the time of the
Great Chicago Fire. In the terror and confusion of that disaster,
the trio, frightened and unable to speak much English, became
separated, and Moses never saw his brothers again.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime East Texans might remember his son, H.O. Jepson, who
operated the Leverett's Chapel grocery store for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin's maternal great grandfather, A.B. Pecina, was among the
myriad laborers who helped build Carswell Air Force Base in Fort
Worth. As a young man, he traveled throughout Central and South
America and many years later, entertained his young granddaughter
with stories of his travels, spiced with descriptions of exotic
jungle snakes and the mermaids who dwelt in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   I recounted much more family lore during that homework lesson
about those who labored so their children could go to school, built
successful businesses and struggled for the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as I reviewed the session, I realized I probably came
away with more than I dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   Moms spend a lot of time worrying about the world's dangers that
await their children. Each day, those dangers seem to become more
numerous and more severe. But after contemplating my son's
heritage, the good folks from which he comes, I realized he is
naturally well-armed to face whatever comes his way. His
inheritance includes determination, courage, a sense of civic
responsibility, the will to survive and the will to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing.
</P>
<P>
   Family values. Not in the political sense in which that phrase
has been cheapened and bandied about, but in the sense of valuing
family.

 &HT;    Hot-rod kings cruise the sweet and low road
 &HT;    By Don McLeese

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the ``Hot Rod Gang of Austin, Texas,'' the
question is such a no-brainer it answers itself. Why would a grown
man drive a custom car? Just look at one of these rolling, revving
sculptures on wheels, these open-highway declarations of
independence, these emblems of the teen-age exhilaration of rock
'n' roll, with the sensuous curves that conjure the lusts of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Take a spin riding shotgun in Jimmie Vaughan's seductively
lavender '51 Chevy Fleetline _ the car that was built the same year
he was born _ so lovingly restored and remade, its chrome gleaming
and its interior immaculate. Or put yourself behind the low-riding
wheel of Mike Young's award-winning '60 Impala ``Exotica,''
designed by Jimmie and customized by Gary Howard, a car of such
classic lines and retro beauty that it might as well be the Mona
Lisa of the car-show circuit. Or for a real ride on the wild side,
hop into Steve Wertheimer's 1930 Model A roadster, where the door
has ``The Continental Kid'' emblazoned in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Then just look at the way everyone else is looking at you. But
take it in stride. Exhibitionism is not the point. Style is. Cool
is. It wouldn't be cool to need to be the center of attention, but
style recognizes that such stares come with the territory. It's a
little like being in love with a woman whose beauty invariably
attracts attention; if you act as if you don't deserve to be seen
with her, you don't.
</P>
<P>
   After an afternoon on the road with the Hot Rod Gang, when you
slink back to your anonymously functional, economy-minded compact
box _ maybe a Mazda or a Honda or a Ford, maybe forest green or
sandy beige, as if there's really any difference _ you are no
longer asking yourself why a grown man drives a custom car.
</P>
<P>
   You are asking yourself why anyone drives anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about having a dream and doing it,'' said Vaughan, who is
as renowned in car circles for the exquisite taste of his custom
designs as he is in music circles for the understated flash of his
bluesy guitar. ``To me, it all goes together, it's just the whole
thing about being American. Young's car over there could be an old
Willie Nelson song or a Thelonious Monk tune. It's art. When I'm
driving, everything else just goes away, problems don't seem to
matter so much. Same with playing music.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing the all-American connection between cars and guitars
is Rhino Records' new box-set release of the four-disc ``Hot Rods &AMP;
Custom Classics: Cruisin' Songs &AMP; Highway Hits.'' The 88-song
selection extends from Chuck Berry's ``Maybellene'' to Golden
Earring's ``Radar Love,'' from Dave Dudley's ``Six Days on the
Road'' to Duane Eddy's ``Forty Miles of Bad Road'' to Robert
Mitchum's ``Ballad of Thunder Road.''
</P>
<P>
   It features an invitation from TV's Dinah Shore to ``See the
U.S.A. in your Chevrolet'' and a warning from James Dean about the
dangers of drag racing. Packaged to resemble a model-car kit, the
set comes complete with fuzzy dice for the rear-view mirror, a
decal sheet and a 64-page booklet explaining and celebrating
hot-rod culture. And it has the stamp of Austin all over it, from
its cover illustration of Young's ``Exotica'' to its dedication to
Vaughan, Wertheimer and Young, dubbed the Hot Rod Gang of Austin,
Texas, for keeping the classic custom spirit alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are my inspiration,'' said James Austin, the Los
Angeles-based custom nut and Rhino executive who produced and
compiled the ``Hot Rods'' package. ``Because of Jimmie, I got a
whole new awareness of what really makes a car beautiful. Mike
Young's `Exotica' is absolutely the most beautiful car that has
ever hit the ground, and Jimmie designed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to him for design advice, and he would say, `James, I
go for traditional, traditional, traditional. Keep it simple, you
can't go wrong.' Same with his music. Each note is played with such
feeling. With his cars, his designs may seem simple on the surface,
but look closely and there's a whole lot going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is plenty of overlap between hot rods and custom
cars, and the terms are occasionally used interchangeably, the
emphasis of the hot rod is on the go, where the custom is more
concerned with show. In each case, the vehicle in question is a
vintage automobile that typically rides lower, looks sharper,
sounds louder and goes faster than your standard street-issue car.
Customizing takes the essence of cool from the past and makes it
even cooler. Or hotter.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the release of Rhino's box set, Wertheimer's
Continental Club hosted an informal hot-rod show (cars outside,
music inside) last week. That evening, Vaughan marked his 48th
birthday with his South by Southwest midnight showcase at the
Austin Music Hall. Though Vaughan had never attempted to turn his
hobby into his musical image, the whole spirit of car culture is as
integral to his artistry as it is to the hubcap, tailfin and Elvis
decor of Young's Chuy's restaurants (he also owns Shady Grove and
the Hula Hut) or the timewarped allure of Wertheimer's Continental
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was born 20 years too late,'' said the
40-year-old Wertheimer. ``I missed that whole period and I won't
let go of it. It's plainly very present here in the club and the
kind of music we book here and the people that hang out here, and
the cars kind of go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of one to 10, I'd say my obsession is probably an
11,'' he continued. ``It's definitely my biggest passion, and it's
the reason I work so hard at the club, so I can do the car deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater love hath no man than these three for their cars. The
obsession begins in boyhood, when most car fanatics start designing
their dream cars on paper. From there, they progress to models, to
slot cars, to magazines devoted to the hot-rod world. Getting their
own rod is the ultimate emancipation from parental control, the
rite of gearhead passage. Some guys _ let's face it, this is a
testosterone-driven obsession, though attracting female attention
is invariably an early impetus _ pour as much as a quarter of a
million dollars into a single vehicle, though the average
investment isn't appreciably more than one might spend on a new
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like guys who have a boat, a bottomless pit, but you can
do it less expensively,'' said Vaughan. ``It is less expensive to
do what I do with some of my cars than it is to buy a new Lexus.
Any four-door sedan that looks just like the rest of them costs 30
or 40 grand, and you can have a really nice car for less than 10
grand if you watch what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a money thing; it's making that car look cool,'' said
Young. ``I've got a nice BMW. I park that downtown, and it's a car.
I park my '60 Caddy down there, and there's a crowd of people
around it. When Jimmie or Steve drive one of their cars, people
freak out over them. If you can get a car that's this cool for the
same money, why would anybody buy a used Toyota? You can buy a
Ferrari for $150,000 or whatever, and people will say it's a nice
car, but nobody's going to go nuts over it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time one arrives at the middle age of this particular
generation of Austin hot-rodders, cruising for chicks takes a back
seat to male bonding. Before Vaughan convinced Young to customize
his Impala into the ``Exotica,'' the two were casual acquaintances.
Now they frequently hit the road together, along with Wertheimer,
hiring a trailer to haul their cars to California for an annual
excursion of cruising up the coast and hitting the car shows, like
last month's Grand National Roadster Show at San Francisco's Cow
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always admired hot rods and custom cars, but I never
thought I could do that,'' said Young, whose ``Exotica'' was the
rage of the Grand National when he debuted it there in 1995. ``And
Jimmie, in his way, he's the smoothest cat in town, said, `You
know, you could make that car look really cool. All you have to do
is lower that thing a little bit, and nose it and deck it and paint
it, and you'd have a really cool car. And I'd have somebody to
drive around with.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmie just has such an eye for design, it's amazing,''
continued Young, who saw Vaughan's designs take metal-and-chrome
shape in the custom shop of Gary Howard in Weir. To hear Young tell
it, Howard is the Michelangelo of the retro roadster: ``You look at
Gary and the way he thinks and the way he works with a car, he's as
much an artist as any sculptor in the world. He has the temperament
of an artist, and the taste and the skill and the eye, and the
obsession to make the car perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is just being creative,'' said Vaughan. ``You take
a car and you change it, make it more pleasing, smoother, lower.
The fun part is driving down the street, preferably with a couple
of other guys driving 'em too. You're looking out the window and
putting on a show for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the deal with lowering the cars so their chassis are
closer to the ground?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looks so much longer and nastier,'' said Young. ``When
you look at a car that has been lowered just right, it looks so
sleek and efficient, like a cat in the wild, stalking prey, ready
to pounce.''
</P>
<P>
   And louder?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tastefully loud, a really nice, throaty sound,'' said
Wertheimer. ``When we customize most of these cars, the first thing
we do is get a new exhaust system put on, to get 'em as loud as we
possibly can. I remember one night I got pulled over in the
warehouse district, and the officer said, `I'm thinking of giving
you a ticket for exhibitionist speed.' I explained that maybe it
sounded like it was going faster than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive a custom is to live a fantasy, to inhabit a world that
has not been homogenized into strip malls and sports utility
vehicles. On most Saturday nights at the Whataburger off Interstate
35 in Round Rock, it becomes a mass fantasy, as hundreds of
hot-rodders and muscle-car connoisseurs converge in the parking lot
from as far away as Waco and San Marcos. Except for such oases, the
hot-rodder is a driver for whom the time is out of joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I get into one of those cars and close my eyes,
it's 1955,'' says Wertheimer. ``I have no idea what I look like
when I'm going down the street, but I feel like I'm 17 years old. I
keep wishing there were more drive-ins here in town where we could
cruise and do what they used to do, and that every night when you
pulled up to the (Continental) club, all you'd see would be hot
cars. Because you know that's how South Congress used to look. The
Whataburger in Round Rock isn't exactly what I'm looking for, but
that's all there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the car will spark a fantasy flare-up when
it's least expected. Take Young's experience when he was recently
cruising in his Caddy, and found himself at a stoplight next to a
woman in her 70s driving a Buick.
</P>
<P>
   She looked over and said, ``Nice car.'' He said, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Does it go fast?'' He said, ``Pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   When the light turned green, she floored it, leaving Young in
the dust, laughing in her rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``She smoked me!'' said Young, still incredulous days later.
``In a Buick! Seventy years old, and she still remembered how it
was.''

   ATLANTA _ A new, easy-to-use device that jump-starts a stopped
heart could save up to 100,000 lives a year, if it goes into
widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   The device is an Automated External Defibrillator, a simplified
version of the defibrillators used by medical professionals on
people suffering cardiac arrest. The device delivers a powerful
electric shock to the heart, forcing it to resume beating.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is recruiting companies across the nation
to buy defibrillators and train employees in their use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the workplace that many of these (cardiac arrest)
incidents happen,'' Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   The device literally talks users through the steps of restarting
a person's stopped heart. ``Apply pads,'' the device says. ``Plug
in connector.'' It checks for a heartbeat; if none is detected, the
device tells the user to shock the victim by pressing a flashing
button.
</P>
<P>
   The defibrillator, which was developed by Heartstream, a
division of Hewlett Packard, costs about $3,500 per unit, said
David Todd of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross eventually will expand its program to include
shopping malls and stadiums, where emergency response tends to be
slower because of difficult access, Bullock said
</P>
<P>
   Self-assessment tests on Internet helpful but limited
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ever felt younger _ or older _ than your actual age in
years? The Internet offers a quick and simple way to find out
whether you may be right: Online self-tests assess everything from
your medical history to how fast you drive, then determine your
overall health outlook and compute the age you resemble, compared
to the average American.
</P>
<P>
   These health risk assessments provide users with a good general
overview of their health status, as well as an indication of how it
could be improved.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Internet as a whole, these self-tests shouldn't be
taken as gospel. Most health assessment Web sites have a disclaimer
reminding users that the questionnaires aren't diagnostic tools,
and that people should seek a doctor's advice for medical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, (health assessment tests) are helpful in making
people aware of possible problems they may have,'' said Dr. Kelleen
Fitzgerald, an internist and clinical instructor at Emory
University . ``They should almost always be followed up with a talk
with your physician, so the physician can help the patient put it
in context.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald pointed out that most risk factors are broad
generalizations based on statistics from large medical studies, and
may not be applicable to each individual. Some health risk tests
deliberately err on the side of caution, to avoid mistakenly
inspiring confidence. The risk assessment tests offered by the
American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association,
for example, each have fewer than 10 questions _ but they're enough
to send up a red flag if the answers merit it. Some sites include:

 &HT;    The Dogs of War: Heroes, Best Friends, Sacrifices
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Thirty years past the blood and the
battles, middle-aged Vietnam veterans can talk about their war in a
calm, resigned voice. They're matter-of-fact even when showing you
faded photos of buddies who didn't come home.
</P>
<P>
   But ask them about the war dogs that saved their lives and you
see the hard emotion that time can't wear away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we did was nothing,'' says retired Army Maj. Paul
Morgan. ``What the dogs did was everything. The dogs had such
unconditional love. Suzie saved my butt several times. I can't
believe how totally devoted she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzie. Duchess. Jet. Crypto. Many were family pets, German
shepherds and Labrador retrievers, sent to war by patriotic owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saved lives and they gave us great confidence and
boldness,'' says Morgan, who lives in Jupiter, Fla. and has written
a book, K-9 Soldiers _ Vietnam and After, due out in April.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who served two Vietnam tours, estimates that the
58,000-plus U.S. soldiers killed would have been ``well over 75,000
without the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   There were about 10,000 dog handlers and more than 4,000 dogs
used in Vietnam from 1966 to '75. Dogs have been used by the
military since the Civil War. But the animals proved invaluable in
Vietnam because it was a guerrilla jungle war. The enemy, capable
of living and fighting from underground, had a huge home-field
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   German shepherds were used as sentries and to scout ahead of
U.S. troops. Labs proved exceptional for tracking, even able to
warn of enemy soldiers underwater, breathing through hollow bamboo
poles.
</P>
<P>
   Both breeds could take the heat and humidity and, unlike
bloodhounds, could be taught not to bark. The dogs used human scent
to warn of danger and could even hear wind pass over a booby trap
trip wire as thin as a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I pulled point as much as I did without a dog, I wouldn't
be here talking about it,'' says Bob Azzaro. ``I never walked into
an ambush. I always had enough warning because of Duchess.''
</P>
<P>
   Azzaro, a West Palm Beach auto mechanic, was one of the first 28
dog handlers trained and sent to Vietnam. He arrived in 1966 with
his German shepherd scout dog, Duchess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scout dogs were a pre-warning device,'' says Morris Huggins,
``and you knocked on wood every time you went on a mission that
everything worked out right. The dog worked, you worked, the
training worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, 51, owns a Delray Beach construction business. As a
sergeant, his five-man tracking unit always had a scout or tracking
dog walking point about 50 yards ahead of the unit to warn of
ambush or booby traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Booby traps are meant to maim and injure because for every one
man injured it takes five to six men to take care of him,''
explains Huggins. ``And the psychology of a booby trap is to
demoralize you. One minute you're walking along and you're fine,
and the next minute half your body's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scout dogs served a purpose psychologically, especially
with the dog handler,'' he continues. ``The dog gives you an
advantage only to the extent that if he picks up on something, he
can give you that split second as a handler to do whatever you've
got to do to cover your ass and get down, get cover, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   War dogs suffered infections and combat fatigue just like the
men they protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have dogs go bad mentally,'' says Huggins. ``He'd become
a biter, he'd lose his cool. You'd either turn him into a blood
donor for other dogs or you'd destroy him. Those are the only two
choices you had.''
</P>
<P>
   Azzaro saw a change in Duchess after the team graduated from 12
weeks of training at Fort Benning, Ga., in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we arrived in-country she was docile,'' he recalls, ``but
her personality changed. She got into it. When she saw me going for
that harness, for her, it was a game. They're in it for the praise.
She picked up on life or death real fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The war dogs were so effective that the Viet Cong offered a kill
reward. ``The bounty was that either they came back with (the
dog's) tattooed ear or came back with one of our (dog handler's)
insignia patches,'' Huggins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could take out a dog and handler,'' says Morgan,
``they could bring the unit to a stop for days.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan and Huggins belong to the 1,000-member Vietnam Dog
Handlers Association started in 1994. The group was instrumental in
the making of War Dogs, America's Forgotten Heroes, a documentary
film that aired on the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The film couldn't have been made without the former dog
handlers, says Jeffrey Bennett, a dog breeder and founder and CEO
of Nature's Recipe pet food.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Bennett took up the war-dog cause after he saw
a four-minute clip of Vietnam handlers talking about their dogs.
But the U.S. military kept no war-dogs records before 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam Dog Handlers Association, based in San Diego, filled
in the blanks, Bennett says.
</P>
<P>
   After making the $1.5 million film with GRB Entertainment,
Bennett planned two national war-dog memorials. The first will be
dedicated on President's Day 2000 at Riverside National Cemetery
near Los Angeles. The second will be in Washington, D.C., by the
end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-minute documentary uncovered a shocking fact. When the
U.S. pulled out of Vietnam in April 1975, the dogs were left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without being gross or mortifying to people, they were treated
as surplus equipment,'' Bennett says.``We showed them (in the film)
pushing the helicopters off the aircraft carriers. The dogs were
the same thing, surplus equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing to me,'' continues Bennett, ``is that the
government can push out $10 million tanks, $10 million helicopters
like they're a dime a dozen, and then they take these living,
breathing creatures and give them to the South Vietnamese, who ate
them or euthanized them because it was too inconvenient to bring
them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``And any one of those handlers would have done just about
anything to bring them home,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Azzaro, 53, says a lot of post-traumatic stress syndrome
suffered by combat dog handlers comes because of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can't get over leaving that dog behind,'' he says of
Duchess.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan, 62, who started a K-9 private security service when
he left the military, says that the U.S. abandoned more than dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea about the dogs,'' says Morgan, wounded and sent
home from Vietnam in 1970. ``But there were South Vietnamese people
that we said we'd never leave. We abandoned those people, our
allies. A black page in our history. The dogs were the last thing
we thought about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We soldiers are memorialized, we get parades, citations,''
says Morgan. ``But the dogs never got anything because they were
all dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, the war dogs are being remembered. By the
men whose lives they saved, and many more.
</P>
<P>
   Video copies of War Dogs, America's Forgotten Heroes, are
available at PetsMart stores with the purchase of Nature's Recipe
dog food.

 &HT;    Transfer to Roth IRAs comes with big tax bite
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of diligent retirement savers are suffering from sticker
shock.
</P>
<P>
   They converted a traditional individual retirement account to a
Roth IRA last year, and it's just now soaking in that they have to
pay income tax on the money they transferred.
</P>
<P>
   The tax obligation was never a secret, and responsible advisers
always pointed it out. But for a lot of people, it was an
abstraction last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's concrete. ``People always knew there was going to be a
tax impact,'' said Roger W. Lusby III, a certified public
accountant with Frazier &AMP; Deeter in Atlanta. ``But now that they
have prepared their return and they're looking at line 68, with the
large amount due, they are in real shock.''
</P>
<P>
   An example will show how deep the tax bite can be. Suppose a
middle-income taxpayer, who will always be in the 28 percent income
tax bracket, transfers $50,000 to a Roth IRA in 1998. The tax bill
will be $14,000, although a one-time tax break allows the taxpayer
to recognize the income in four equal, annual installments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roth IRAs are tremendously attractive. There are two
primary reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ Once you put your $2,000 a year into a Roth IRA, that seed
money and the money it earns will be free of income taxes when it
is properly withdrawn. With a traditional IRA, you will have to pay
taxes on your earnings, at ordinary income rates, when you retire
and start taking the money out.
</P>
<P>
   _ With a Roth IRA, you are not required to start taking the
money out after you turn 70 1/2. That can make the Roth IRA an
outstanding tool for estate planning. Lusby explained why: ``When
money in a traditional IRA passes along to your beneficiaries, it
is still subject to income tax. This is not the case with the Roth
IRA. Here, there might be estate taxes, but you and your kids would
never have to pay income taxes on the Roth IRA.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trade-off with the Roth IRA is the current tax
obligation. If you put $2,000 into a Roth IRA, you still have to
pay income taxes on it.
</P>
<P>
   If you transfer money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you
have to pay income taxes on the full amount you transfer. In our
hypothetical example of a $50,000 transfer, you decide to pay
$14,000 in income taxes now because you expect to reap a lot more
in investment and tax gains later.
</P>
<P>
   The deal usually makes economic sense only if you pay the tax
with dollars from some other resource, not with a portion of the
money you transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The sticker shock has arrived for those who took the goodies
months ago but didn't earmark some money to pay the tax obligation
now.
</P>
<P>
   What options do they have?
</P>
<P>
   One is to ``reconvert,'' meaning you can switch the money back
to a traditional IRA. You can direct your broker or mutual fund
company to make the switch. ``You'll still have to report the
conversion,'' Lusby said. ``But now it won't be taxable.''
</P>
<P>
   The other option is to stick with the Roth IRA and hunt down
some source to pay the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lusby emphasized the impact of the one-time break on this tax
obligation. For transfers made in 1998 _ but not in 1999 or later _
the amount of the transfer can be reported over four years.
</P>
<P>
   For the $50,000 transfer, that means you report only $12,500 in
1998. The tax due right now is $3,500. You report the same income
amount for 1999 and the following two years. The tax would remain
the same unless your tax bracket changed. Use Form 8606 to report
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most situations, if people can afford to pay the tax
liability with other assets, then it probably is to their advantage
to leave the conversion alone and take advantage of the four-year
spread,'' Lusby advised.
</P>

 &HT;    Time to Spring for new clothes
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Choices, choices, choices.
</P>
<P>
   A cornucopia of colors and clothing combinations is cropping up
this spring, delighting fashion finders with new options and fresh
looks for work and play.
</P>
<P>
   This spring calls for a dressy-casual look _ outfits that, with
the right accessories and shoes, can serve for dressy functions
like weddings or a dinner but can also be dressed down for a casual
luncheon or shower.
</P>
<P>
   Bright pinks, racy purples, ocean blues and sunny yellows have
found their way back to the clothing aisles, replacing the dull
grays and muddy browns of winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people get so tired of the drab from winter. By
spring, they're ready for an uplift _ something that gives them
some feel-good and color to their wardrobe,'' said Rene Masiongale,
store manager of Leon's Cinderella. ``The bright colors make you
feel that much more feminine and gives you a little lift.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Masiongale said build on the basics. If you're a
pants person, white, black or even navy linen pants are always a
staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like having sugar or coffee in your cupboard, it's
something everyone should have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Keep a cute black, white or navy jacket in your closet _ whether
it be a short jacket, a vest, a longer tunic type.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really encourage people to stick to the whites, blacks,
navies, off whites _ whatever color they feel comfortable with _
and then just work around that _ add to it, layer to it,'' she
said. ``You can add any type of little shell, sweater underneath or
a bright color.''
</P>
<P>
   She also suggests keeping some type of casual-wear, a patterned
or solid-colored, lightweight pair of pants or a long skirt for an
afternoon tea, shopping or to the movies. Look for tops that match
a skirt and pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good, especially if people travel a lot and don't
want to pack a lot, you can take a top and mix and match it with
several bottoms and make it look completely different,'' Masiongale
said.
</P>
<P>
   Look for jackets you can wear by themselves during the day and
throw a shell or blouse underneath to dress up.
</P>
<P>
   Long sundresses for summer are great because they're lightweight
and fun to wear. Many come with a little jacket or sweater you can
wear if you're self-conscious about bare arms or chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Layering is an excellent idea,'' Masiongale said. ``If you're
cold inside, then you can walk outside and pull off a layer. It
also adds to the appearance of the outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hats are a good accessory to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ladies think they can't wear hats, but they can,''
Masiongale said. ``Hats come in all different shapes and sizes. If
people are going on cruises or to an afternoon wedding, we really
encourage them to put on a hat. Have some fun. Don't make life any
more serious than it already is.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't overlook the importance of accessories _ a sleek handbag,
stylish jewelry and fashionable footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone can take a basic beige pants or suit they think is so
ugly, and throw a pretty scarf with it, a shell, jewelry, a hat,
anything like that and make all the difference in the world,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the blockbuster movie Titanic inspired loose-fitting,
flowing dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's more fitted and constructed,'' said shop owner J.J.
Simpson. ``Darts are coming in, and we haven't had darts in for a
while. Built-in bras are in, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Embroidery, crochet and beading are spicing things up a bit this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, everything was real plain and kind of loose,''
she said. ``But now it's more fitted and very detailed.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheath dress with a long jacket is really popular, said
boutique owner Linda Vela.
</P>
<P>
   Sundresses coupled with silk cardigans are great for church, or
pair some sandals with them for dinner or a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a lot of different things, depending on what you
put with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are tons of fun looks this spring, including the
traditional skirt and suit jacket, which is perpetually popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really strong look and in a lot of lines this spring,''
she said. ``That way, you can take the jacket off and put pearls
with it to dress it up. Or wear it to work. You can dress it up or
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides pink, which is reportedly the color of the season, Vela
said she's seeing every shade of solid brights and pretty pastels,
like wedgewood blue, mint green and buttery yellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say really this year, more than I've seen in a long
time, there's colors for everyone. It's not just limited to pastels
because there are a lot of brights.''
</P>
<P>
   Even black is a popular color choice this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put black with a whimsical print, pastel colors and
light fabric, then it's perfect,'' Vela said.

WHEN BABY COMES HOME
</HEADLINE>
  By SUZANNE B. GLEASON 
 c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember changing our first baby's diaper on our last day in
the hospital. Or, I should say, attempting to change it. Every time
Bettina squirmed, I'd freeze, convinced I was doing something
terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A passing baby nurse came to my side and said, ``You've got to
show that baby who's boss. If she cries a little, she cries. That's
what babies do.'' I grasped Bettina's ankles with a firm, loving
touch and tried again, this time successfully.
</P>
<P>
   That little episode boosted my self-confidence and taught me a
lesson that helped me through the first month_that trying but
rewarding time when you get to know your baby. Like me, you'll be
an old pro in no time. Until then, here's a guide to your baby's
basic needs in the first month of life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sleeping: Don't Follow the Clock &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Your newborn will probably spend most of her first month in the
Land of Nod. If you're like many parents, you probably left the
hospital with instructions to wake the baby every two to three
hours during the day to feed.
</P>
<P>
   But is it really necessary to rouse a sleeping newborn to eat?
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) urges parents to watch for
hunger signals (crying, nuzzling against the breast, making sucking
motions) rather than watching the clock. The AAP advises waking a
healthy baby only during the first two weeks, every three to four
hours, in order to set the baby's feeding pattern and, if you're
breastieeding, to establish your milk supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should consider yourself lucky if your baby can sleep four
or more hours between feedings,'' says Dr. Richard Molteni, medical
director at Children's Hospital in Seattle. ``Long periods of sleep
are a sign of trouble only if the infant doesn't awaken vigorously
hungry and eager to feed or if the baby has these long stretches
back to back,'' because all that sleep means she's not eating
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``One stretch of five or even six hours in a 24-hour period is
perfectly OK,'' Molteni observes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Burping: Coax, Don't Force &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I remember being obsessed with getting a loud belch out of my
babies after every meal, rubbing and tapping their tiny backs
maniacally for up to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely overkill,'' says Molteni, who suggests
gently coaxing a burp out for a minute or two at the most.
``Neurologically, babies are perfectly wired not to inhale milk
from their food pipe into their lungs, so it's not dangerous when
you can't get a burp.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the main reason to burp a baby is to keep her
comfortable_and to avoid a mess. Her tiny stomach can contain only
so much food, and any air gulped in can form an uncomfortable
bubble that she'll eventually bring up herself_together with milk
or formula.
</P>
<P>
   Use your baby as a guide to gauge when to burp: ``If you get
messy, wet burps during every feeding, then you've got a baby who
needs to be burped more often during each feeding,'' says Molteni.
``Try every two to four minutes, or when you see her abdomen
getting rounded, and certainly when the baby seems uncomfortable.''
If she tolerates an entire feeding without discomfort, try burping
her before switching breasts or midway through the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Diapering: Watch the Bottom Line &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Expect the unexpected when it comes to your newborn's bowel
movements. ``A baby's bowel movements can change in consistency,
color, texture and smell from one diaper to the next,'' says
Molteni. Nevertheless, you can assume that your baby's output will
start out tar colored and creamy, gradually taking on a color and
texture much like pureed spinach and eventually evolving into a
mustard-yellow color and a seedy consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers, needless to say, should be changed after every bowel
movement and whenever they seem full (cloth diapers feel wet;
disposable ones feel heavy and squishy). Since most very young
babies have a bowel movement each time they eat, change the baby
after every feeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to check a sleeping baby's diaper unless
there's evidence of diaper rash,'' says Molteni. Because a rash can
become painful (and can worsen) when exposed to urine or stool, you
should change your baby frequently when he has diaper rash, wiping
with a wet washcloth, patting dry, then applying a thick layer of
ointment. Baring your baby's bottom_without ointment_also speeds
the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nails: Nibble Them Off &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Babies are often born with long, paper-thin nails with which
they can scratch their face. Even worse, the nails seem to grow
back within seconds of being clipped off. Surprisingly, one of the
easiest nail-control methods is nibbling them off yourself, a
technique Molteni suggests to his patients. Don't worry about
bacteria. ``Kissing has the same bacterial exposure,'' he notes.
Carefully wielded manicure scissors do a good job, but they're best
left to intrepid (and experienced) moms and dads. Baby clippers can
be hard to control on such tiny nails, and many a parent (myself
included) has been reduced to tears after snipping off a tad too
much.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Skin Care: Less Is More &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Newborn skin requires little special treatment. In fact, using
products like baby lotion is best put off for a few months, advises
Dr. Molteni. ``The very delicate skin a baby is born with still
lacks the protective top layer, so it's more susceptible to
irritation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some babies will develop small, pimply, red or white bumps on
their faces from blocked immature sweat glands_a condition that
usually goes away before 3 months of age. If your child has this,
you can use a mild soap once a day, being careful to rinse well.
</P>
<P>
   Another common skin condition is cradle cap_patches of waxy,
scaly crust on the baby's scalp. Gently rub mineral oil on the
scalp to loosen flakes, brush off with a dry wash cloth, and then
shampoo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve, the energetic, wide-eyed host of ``Blue's Clues,'' speaks
to his young viewers as if they are in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see the next clue?'' he'll ask, bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``BEHIND YOU,'' a chorus of off-camera preschoolers will yell,
as if answering him from their couches at home.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the hottest new TV programs aimed at the 2- to
5-year-old crowd, the show (9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. on
Nickelodeon) is a trendsetter in interactive programming.
</P>
<P>
   Steve, and the show's animated dog Blue, guide children through
story lines that ask questions ranging from object recognition to
sentence construction.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence ``The __ threw a __,'' appears on the screen, with
the picture of a ball in the first space, and a girl in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball threw a girl,'' Steve says. ``Is this right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' say 16 preschoolers in near unison as they watch the
show at the La Petite Academy in Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make sense!'' says Tabitha Abercrombie, 4. ``A
ball doesn't have arms!''
</P>
<P>
   Many educators, psychologists and media watchers generally
applaud the approach of ``Blue's Clues'' and similar children's
shows, including the purple, preschool icon ``Barney,'' the
toddler-friendly ``Teletubbies'' and the groundbreaking ``Sesame
Street,'' which celebrates 30 years this season.
</P>
<P>
   But most warn that television for young viewers should be doled
out sparingly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless what you're watching is enhancing your life, it's
taking away from your life,'' says Carole Lieberman, a Los Angeles
psychiatrist who specializes in media and was among the first to
testify for Congress in favor of ratings for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the programs that are on television for children are
much too violent or have no education value,'' says Lieberman, also
former chairwoman of the National Coalition on TV Violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents, such as Cheryl Joe, assistant principal at
Florida's North Lakeland Elementary School and the mother of
5-year-old Errin, say some of the flashier shows are too fast for
small children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent this summer watching 'Blue's Clues,' because it has a
slow pace, and they talk so little ones can understand it,'' Joe
says. ``Little ones ... need time to absorb the language and the
information, and that's what attracts them to those types of shows,
like 'Barney.'''
</P>
<P>
   The worst shows, says Lieberman, include the aggressive ``Power
Rangers'' and other violence-oriented children's programming. ``And
at best, most of the others are simply mind-candy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, a children's media consultant who founded Action
for Children's Television, says a little candy is not such a bad
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Programs such as ``Blue's Clues,'' ``Barney'' and ``Sesame
Street'' represent the good side of what is popular, Charren says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's the other side, junk that they want to see
anyway,'' she says. ``And I think that's OK. A little junk is OK,
particularly if you talk about it with kids. There's benign junk
and there's horrible junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Charren, after all, remembers reading her share of comic books
as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Now a visiting scholar at Harvard University's Graduate School
of Education, she is a member of the Gore Commission that authored
recommendations on what broadcasters must do in exchange for
receiving more airwaves for digital TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be careful ... children learn from everything
they see on television,'' she says. ``And that is what's the matter
with the junk: they learn from that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   SOME DISAGREEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Experts disagree on the value of Nickelodeon's ``Rugrats,'' in
which animated babies such as Tommy Pickles and pals Chuckie, Phil
and Lil roll along through a series of misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't all that thrilled with 'Rugrats,''' Lieberman says.
``The old 'Muppet Babies' was very sweet, funny and clever. But
'Rugrats' took the concept of 'Muppet Babies' and made it more
sinister.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Joyce Brothers, the nationally known psychologist who
offers advice on a variety of family and social topics, says
``Rugrats'' offers ``nothing really unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch 'Rugrats' with your children and talk about how
people deal with them in real life, that's useful,'' Brothers says.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the tactic that Beverly Hartley, who works in the
Polk County, Fla., school district office of community relations,
takes with her sons, Trevor and John.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 and 11 years old, respectively, her sons have outgrown the
target age of ``Barney'' and ``Blue's Clues.'' But they fall
directly in the age range that prefers the more adventurous Tommy
Pickles and pals. But, Hartley says, no matter what happens on the
program, good usually prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it at first,'' she says. ``Because the kids on
there are kind of ugly. It's not like a cute cartoon, which is
probably what appeals to my boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they usually have some kind of morals, some kind of moral
story at the end. It's kid's sibling stuff, from the kid's point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   KIDS' SEINFELD
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mitchell, management supervisor with Small Talk, a
children's marketing consultancy in Cincinnati, says ``Rugrats''
has become the kid's version of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It works on any age level,'' says Mitchell, whose company
helps such clients as Motorola, Proctor &AMP; Gambel, JVC, Smuckers and
Sylvan Learning Centers understand children's viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a story line that kids can relate to, like fighting
with an older sister,'' Mitchell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw 'Teletubbies' and saw it repeat a
segment, I thought 'That's boring,''' he says. ``But for a
2-year-old, that's exactly what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Teletubbies,'' which like ``Sesame Street'' and ``Barney''
is produced by PBS, the lead characters are animated and lovable,
with names like Po, Tinky-Wink, Dipsy and Laa-Laa.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell says younger children usually find ``rounded''
characters more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that Disney learned years ago; that
characters with soft, round edges like Blue and Barney are very
appealing to young children.''
</P>
<P>
   WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   Stevanne Auerbach, director of the Institute for Childhood
Resources in San Francisco, says parents should carefully view
children's programs before deciding which shows are suitable for
their own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to watch the show, you have to see what the show is
all about,'' says Auerbach, who, at the U.S. Department of
Education in 1969, approved the first government grant for ``Sesame
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like if you're going to go to a day care center,''
she says. ``You've got to check it out. You're not going to put
your kid in just any day care center.

 Includes a color slide of Roberto Benigni with Giorgio Cantarini in
a scene from ``Life Is Beautiful.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The comedian is telling a story, and nobody's laughing.
 &HT;    ``Two years in a Nazi concentration camp,'' Roberto Benigni's
father would begin his stories, and his young son and daughter
would shudder with fear in their Tuscan villa.
 &HT;    The senior Benigni, an Italian farmer of Albanian descent,
fought for Italy in World War II. He was captured by the Nazis
after Italy changed sides in 1943, and spent the next two years in
a concentration camp in northern Germany.
 &HT;    By day, he was forced to build weapons for the Nazi army.
 &HT;    ``At night, he would watch his friends die,'' Benigni says.
``You see, the conditions were the same as a concentration camp for
Jews, except there was no gas chamber.''
 &HT;    The story always ended the same way, with the children's father
muttering about ``the 35 skeletons in the bunks near me. All my
friends, they die.''
 &HT;    Naturally, the children had nightmares, until one day their
mother put her foot down. She told her husband that he could no
longer speak of the war years unless he could do it with humor.
 &HT;    ``That night, my father started telling a different story,''
Benigni recalls. ``One with levity, about the captain in the camp
and the time he falls down. I know it sounds impossible, but the
stories were funny.
 &HT;    ``We started to laugh, and the nightmares ended.''
 &HT;    The young boy grew up to be Italy's favorite comedian, and those
stories sowed the seeds of what is being hailed as his greatest
film, ``La Vita E Bella,'' a.k.a. ``Life Is Beautiful.'' The film,
which on March 21 won him the 1998 Oscar for Best Actor,
 &HT;    is as much one man's creation as any film can be: Benigni wrote
it, directed it and stars in it, with his real-life wife playing
his on-screen wife.
 &HT;    It's the tale of Guido, an Italian Jew who has grand dreams of
owning his own bookstore until the Nazis take over. Only three
months before the war's end, he and his 5-year-old son are deported
to a German concentration camp. In order to save his son's life,
Guido uses his bold imagination and physical comedy to convince the
boy that they are just there to play a game.
 &HT;    It may sound unlikely, but it's hardly unlikable: ``Life is
Beautiful'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1988 Cannes Film
Festival, and is being touted as a candidate for multiple Oscars.
 &HT;    It represents a new level of fame for the 45-year-old Benigni,
previously best known outside of Italy for Jim Jarmusch's cult
classic ``Down by Law'' (1986) and Blake Edwards' ``Son of the Pink
Panther'' (1993).
 &HT;    But according to Benigni, as he sits down to talk about his film
at a Toronto hotel, he's already won the biggest prize he could
ask.
 &HT;    ``I screen the movie for my father in Florence,'' he says,
laughing. ``At the end, he screamed, `Son, you finally did good
movie! First time! Good movie!'''
 &HT;    Italians generally think Benigni has made good movies before,
but not movies like this.
 &HT;    ``In Italy, I'm so well known as a popular comedian. I am like
Donald Duck,'' he says. ``So Donald Duck making a movie about
Holocaust was hard for people to understand.''
 &HT;    The idea for the film came to him, Benigni says, when he came
across a line attributed to the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky.
Trapped in a bunker, waiting for Stalin's assassins to kill him _
as they ultimately did _ the Russian supposedly nevertheless wrote,
``Life is beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``The message to me is that, no matter what happens, there is
beauty in this life,'' the comedian says. ``You can find the
goodness.''
 &HT;    At core, he adds, ``Life is Beautiful'' isn't about the
Holocaust at all _ it's a love story between father and son.
 &HT;    ``What is more simple than a father protecting his son?'' he
asks. ``That is true love, with a real purity and innocence.''
 &HT;    Casting the role of the young boy was a challenge. Even when
Giorgio Cantarini won the part, problems continued.
 &HT;    ``I test hundreds of boys. When he entered, I stopped with
everything,'' Benigni recalls. ``This boy looks like me _ big nose!
His face is not right for TV!''
 &HT;    But young Cantarini couldn't read at the time.
 &HT;    ``He had to learn his lines by sheer memorization, which seemed
impossible,'' the director says. ``But he did it.''
 &HT;    Benigni filmed in Tuscany, where he was born and raised, and
where he could work closely with Milan's Center for Contemporary
Jewish Documentation. Camp survivors reviewed the script and gave
advice, but Benigni admits that he approached test screenings with
trepidation.
 &HT;    ``I was afraid I could hurt or offend someone because I am a
comedian,'' he admits. ``I didn't want to offend, because I respect
these survivors so much.''
 &HT;    To his delight, Milanese Jewish groups welcomed the film.
 &HT;    ``They loved the movie very much,'' he says, relief still
evident in his voice. ``There is no problem. Some survivors did
talk to me about it and said, `This not right. This could not have
happened this way.' I told them I am an artist. I needed to take
some license. I must be free.
 &HT;    ``Then I asked, `Are you offended or hurt by the script?' They
told me the script was wonderful.''
 &HT;    Even so, he admits that he found the screenings disconcerting.
 &HT;    ``As a comedian, I'm used to hearing people laugh,'' he says.
``In this movie, everybody was crying. I was confused, but happy.''
 &HT;    The film was already big before Miramax Films picked it up. Now
Benigni hears rumors of Oscars, not only for Best Foreign Film but
possibly also for Best Actor, Best Director, even Best Picture.
 &HT;    Not that he's short on prizes, mind you.
 &HT;    ``In Italy, they give me hundred prizes for this movie,'' he
says. ``In each town, Jewish community give me prizes. Now people
stop me on the street and say, `Hey, Benigni, here is a prize. Do
you want this?'
 &HT;    ``Every week, I have something new for the mantel. It's nice.''
 &HT;    It's a nice change for a comedian who has often talked his way
into trouble. Some jokes about Pope John Paul earned him a one-year
suspended prison sentence, while his sarcastic mockery of former
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have been credited with
contributing to the politician's downfall.
 &HT;    Even with the occasional controversy, Benigni says, he loves
being a comedian.
 &HT;    ``All men in Italy like to talk so much,'' he says, laughing.
``Every bum in Italy is a comedian except for our serious actors.
People like good laughter there, which always made me happy.''
 &HT;    Making movies is just an extension of his comedy act, he adds.
 &HT;    ``When I make movies, the crew becomes my audience,'' Benigni
says. ``I don't imagine that in six months people will be watching
in the theater. To be alive as an actor, you must act for someone.
You need someone to look at you in that moment.''
 &HT;    Comedy has its spiritual side, the comedian adds, which is part
of the appeal of ``Life Is Beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``When you laugh at something bad, it gives you a strange
power,'' he says. ``I think if you have the power to laugh, you
have the power to say, `I will not die.'
 &HT;    ``When we laugh, we are naked _ we are vulnerable,'' Benigni
says. ``But I think sometimes the biggest act of resistance is a
smile. If you turn your cry to a laugh, it is a triumph of the
human spirit.''

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine that you're a film director so uniquely successful that
not one, not two, but four of your films were included on the
American Film Institute's recently released honor role of the 100
best American films ever.
 &HT;    Would you high-five your cameraman? Slam-dunk your director's
chair? Declare yourself king of the world?
 &HT;    Steven Spielberg tried to give two of them back.
 &HT;    It seems that a couple of his favorites _ a Preston Sturges
comedy and a Marx Brothers romp _ had been omitted.
 &HT;    ``I was honored to be on the list,'' he says, ``but I
immediately called the AFI and volunteered two of my films back in
exchange for two others. I told them they could have `Jaws' (1975)
and `Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981) back in exchange for
`Sullivan's Travels' (1941) and `A Night at the Opera' (1935).''
 &HT;    Well, he'd still have ``ET'' (1980) and ``Schindler's List''
(1993) _ not a bad double play in anyone's book.
 &HT;    Best of all, and unlike such AFI peers as Alfred Hitchcock,
Frank Capra and John Ford, Spielberg isn't even dead. At 51, in
fact, he's at the peak of his career, wrapping up a period of
remarkable productivity that has produced three movies back to
back, including ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (1997),
``Amistad'' (1997) and ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the World War II
epic that won him the 1998 Best Director Oscar on March 21.
 &HT;    Oh, and he has his own movie studio, Dreamworks SKG.
 &HT;    All this, and it's still a hobby. As a father of seven, he's
bound by the terms of a longstanding deal with Kate Capshaw, the
lovely actress who is his wife,
 &HT;    ``My job is that I do carpool and I make breakfast every
morning,'' he says. ``You know, those two things are my real
careers. Then I go to work.''
 &HT;    Currently, work brings him to Los Angeles' Ritz Carlton Hotel,
where he's doing a rare round of interviews to promote ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    He doesn't look much like a Hollywood powerhouse, however, in
his jeans, black-and-white tennis shoes and a tattered
brown-leather jacket. In fact, with wire-rimmed glasses framing a
warm, kind face, he looks rather like a college professor.
 &HT;    The topic of today's seminar is World War II, the setting for
``Private Ryan'' as well as several other Spielberg films,
including the disastrous ``1941'' (1979), the epic ``Empire of the
Sun'' (1987) and, of course, the Oscar-winning ``Schindler's
List.''
 &HT;    Oh, and one more: ``Fighter Squadron,'' a low-budget affair he
directed at age 15.
 &HT;    ``That was my first air-to-air-combat film,'' Spielberg says,
laughing. ``The budget was about a hundred dollars. I remember for
the bomb explosions, I got firecrackers. My mother wanted to kill
me.''
 &HT;    He acknowledges that maybe it was strange for a young boy
growing up in Phoenix to be so obsessed with war, even if his
father, Arnold Spielberg, was a veteran who had fought on Guam as a
sharpshooter.
 &HT;    ``My Dad is 82 now, and he fought in World War II,'' the
director says. ``I didn't know who to believe _ my Dad and his
friends, or the war movies Hollywood was making? I chose to believe
the war movies. My Dad's stories were so outrageously harsh to me.
 &HT;    ``He would tell me about the freezing cold and just the
suffering and how they had to endure watching their friends die,''
Spielberg recalls. ``War always fascinated me because, I think, at
the core of every war is this question of how far we can be pushed
and how deep you can reach down in your soul to walk those extra 10
miles in the morning. It still amazes me how the human spirit is
endless.''
 &HT;    This isn't the prettified war of 1940s films, in short. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was reportedly involved in a ratings controversy,
rare in that it was about extreme violence, not sex or nudity.
Ultimately the film received an R rating, though some observers
whispered that a less influential director would have drawn the
commercially hazardous NC-17.
 &HT;    ``That whole thing is not true,'' Spielberg says heatedly. ``I
didn't get any special favors. We got the R rating. We were never
going to get an NC-17.''
 &HT;    The director freely admits that the film is very violent.
 &HT;    ``It's a war movie,'' he says with a patient sigh. ``I really
wanted to give the audience a physical experience.''
 &HT;    So important was it to him, he insists, that if he'd been hit
with an NC-17 rating, he'd have still refused to make cuts.
 &HT;    ``I would have taken the NC-17,'' he says. ``I would have taken
the rating without protest.''
 &HT;    This isn't the kind of movie that the young Spielberg grew up
watching. Lonely as the only boy among four children, he was drawn
to movies from an early age.
 &HT;    As a child, he recalls, he would stage his own horror movies by
pulling off the heads of his sisters' dolls, carefully placing them
on a dish and garnishing them with lettuce and tomato. Bigger
budgets _ and an indulgent mother _ led him to ``Fighter Squadron''
and, seemingly inevitably, to ``Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    His own children _ 13-year-old Max, his son with ex-wife Amy
Irving, Capshaw's 21-year-old Jessica and the couple's own five
children, 9-year-old Theo, 8-year-old Sasha, 6-year-old Sawyer,
2-year-old Mikaela and 1-year-old Destry _ don't seem to share his
interest in moviemaking, despite gifts of video cameras and such.
 &HT;    ``None of them cares about it, and I have seven kids,''
Spielberg laments.
 &HT;    Then he brightens.
 &HT;    ``The two babies don't know about it yet,'' he says hopefully.
 &HT;    Spielberg's passion for movies has led him to be one of the most
productive filmmakers of his generation, and he has a long list of
projects in mind, from a Tom Cruise film to a fourth Indiana Jones
picture. But the repercussions of fame have led him to plan a
couple of years off in the not-too-distant future.
 &HT;    ``I've heard I'm part of a government conspiracy to make America
and the rest of the world conducive to accepting an alien
neighbor,'' Spielberg says, laughing, ``and that's why I really
made `ET' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977).
 &HT;    ``I love it, but the answer is no.''
 &HT;    More seriously, he recently was forced to testify in court
against a stalker who had threatened his family.
 &HT;    ``I don't really want to talk about it,'' the director says,
``except to say that I'm glad it's over.''
 &HT;    Spielberg has long been noted for his childlike imagination, a
sense of wonder which has fueled many of his most successful films.
But when he turned 50 last year, with ``Schindler's List'' and
``Amistad'' behind him and ``Private Ryan'' underway, many wondered
if their more serious tone meant that Hollywood's wunderkind was at
last feeling his age.
 &HT;    ``Turning 40 was really hard for me,'' he recalls. ``I had all
my midlife concerns. It was a terrible, terrible birthday where you
start to feel like you're getting old.
 &HT;    ``You know what? Fifty sucked, too.''
 &HT;    In retrospect, he says, he finds himself facing the question
that Private Ryan himself grapples with: Have I been a good man?
 &HT;    ``I think everybody asks that question at one time or another:
Have I been a good person?'' he says. ``It's a question we should
ask ourselves, not when we're really old and standing in the
cemetery. It's the kind of question we need to ask ourselves every
day of our life.''

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Joseph Fiennes in a scene from
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ralph Fiennes may do Shakespeare, but Joseph Fiennes is
Shakespeare.
 &HT;    Well, at least in his current movie. Playing the immortal bard
in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' voted the Best Picture Oscar for 1998,
the younger Fiennes once and for all escapes his brother's shadow,
proving his own merit as a master of light comedy and passionate
romance alike _ and, oh yes, as a Hollywood hunk to boot.
 &HT;    After all, the man currently sitting down for an interview at
Manhattan's Parker Meridian Hotel, flashing long, seductive
eyelashes and a boy's mischievous smile, can be seen romping au
naturel with Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow in his first two
films, both currently playing.
 &HT;    That would include the critically acclaimed period drama
``Elizabeth,'' in which Fiennes as the lustful Earl of Leicester
engages in some anything-but-chaste revels with the so-called
``virgin queen,'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a romantic comedy in
which Fiennes plays a lovesick bard struggling with writer's block
as he tries to pen a new play, ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter.''
 &HT;    And romping around with a naked Paltrow, which is a heck of a
way to start a big-screen career.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it's not as glamorous as one might think,'' Fiennes
insists. ``I'm so shy that these scenes were torture for me. Give
me a sword fight any day.''
 &HT;    Believe it or not, he's serious.
 &HT;    ``Let's start with the fact that Gwyneth's boyfriend, Ben
Affleck, is in this movie,'' the actor says. ``And he's a big guy.
You don't want to get on the wrong side of Ben and say, `Guess
what? I will be spending the duration of the day in a bed with your
girlfriend.'
 &HT;    ``Thankfully, our director, John Madden, placed the love scenes
in the middle of shooting,'' he adds, ``and Gwyneth and I already
got on like a house on fire. Still, we had a bit of a laugh when we
had to get into bed. It was so surreal. But then we just got on
with it.''
 &HT;    Actually, Fiennes says, he didn't expect to wind up anywhere
near that bed.
 &HT;    ``I blew the audition for this movie,'' he recalls. ``I gave a
horrendous reading of the script when I first read for John. About
a month later he called, saying he managed to squeeze some
potential out of it.''
 &HT;    A screen test with Paltrow followed, and he was suddenly faced
with the challenge of being Shakespeare.
 &HT;    ``In one sense, he's sacred ground to so many people like
academics and theater-goers,'' Fiennes says. ``On the other hand,
from the little research that I did, William Shakespeare is a blank
sheet _ no one really knows anything about him as a man. So it was
a bit of a can of worms.
 &HT;    ``You can profile him from the sonnets and from the plays, but
his faith, his politics, his sexuality and his take on life is a
mystery,'' the actor says. ``From my sense, that's great. No one
can say that I did it right or wrong.''
 &HT;    For insight on a writer's mind, Fiennes turned to his novelist
mother.
 &HT;    ``My mother told me that writing was one of the most isolating
ways to spend a life,'' he says. ``She felt that the huge amount of
solitude put a shadow on a person, which is what I thought of when
I played William Shakespeare.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, it was a case of working from the script.
 &HT;    ``I figured Shakespeare was a genius who didn't quite know it,''
Fiennes says. ``He knew he was a pretty damn good writer, but he
was also a man who had to pay the rent. He's got writer's block.
All of this indicated to me someone who was knocking out his plays
to pay the rent. He was a survivor.''
 &HT;    The same applies to the actor, who comes from a family of
survivors. The youngest of six children _ his fraternal twin Jacob,
now a gamekeeper, is minutes older _ he grew up in a family
constantly on the go, as a child moving a dozen times to various
spots in both Ireland and England. His father was a sculptor, while
his mother was a writer.
 &HT;    ``Being the youngest makes you long for more of a voice,'' he
says. ``You find that voice early in theatrics of the kitchen. I
was the one screaming, `Hey, where is my food?'''
 &HT;    Given their genes, it's perhaps not surprising that the six
children include three actors and a director among them.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it is that made us all find careers of
expression,'' Fiennes says. ``Maybe it has something to do with my
mother and father having careers that were creative. There was
never a lack of stimulus in terms of literature or painting and
drawing.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``I know I'm making it sound so romantic and bohemian,'' he
says. ``It wasn't. It was chaotic, dirty and noisy. I couldn't wait
to get out. I guess that was the stimulus.''
 &HT;    For this Fiennes, the path to independence started with his
theatrical debut, in a third-grade production of ``Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
 &HT;    ``The only bad thing is my teacher didn't want me to sing,'' he
recalls. ``She told me to mime it. It hurt my feelings.''
 &HT;    But by age 9 he was on his way, performing in youth theater at
the Young Vic. Two years later he was studying at the Guild Hall of
Music and Drama in London, where he spent three years training for
the stage.
 &HT;    After a year off in Italy, where he worked on the reconstruction
of a 12th-century villa, Fiennes returned to England and the
theater.
 &HT;    ``Ever since I've been battling for parts,'' he says.
 &HT;    Ironically, his rise to stardom may have been slowed by his
brother's own ascent. Seeing the public spotlight that has followed
Ralph Fiennes since ``Schindler's List'' (1993) left his shyer
brother feeling awkward.
 &HT;    ``I keep thinking about what that costs in terms of your persona
and how much you would like to keep your persona under wraps,'' he
says. ``Unfortunately, to a certain degree you've got to let a
little bit of it go. That's rough for me, because deep down I am
shy.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe. His brother also once claimed to be shy, only to
turn up on the cover of Vanity Fair shirtless and wild-haired in
leather pants.
 &HT;    ``That was just too many vodkas,'' Joseph Fiennes says,
laughing.
 &HT;    His two Elizabethan adventures just might make Fiennes the most
popular member of the family. But the actor, who is single and
lives in London, isn't making any such plans.
 &HT;    ``I don't know where I'm going,'' he says, not apparently overly
concerned about it. ``Any job I've ever taken has not been about
pursuing fame. The only thing I can do is respond to certain
material. If that leads to a career, then so be it.''

 Includes a color slide of Roberto Benigni with Giorgio Cantarini in
a scene from ``Life Is Beautiful.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The comedian is telling a story, and nobody's laughing.
 &HT;    ``Two years in a Nazi concentration camp,'' Roberto Benigni's
father would begin his stories, and his young son and daughter
would shudder with fear in their Tuscan villa.
 &HT;    The senior Benigni, an Italian farmer of Albanian descent,
fought for Italy in World War II. He was captured by the Nazis
after Italy changed sides in 1943, and spent the next two years in
a concentration camp in northern Germany.
 &HT;    By day, he was forced to build weapons for the Nazi army.
 &HT;    ``At night, he would watch his friends die,'' Benigni says.
``You see, the conditions were the same as a concentration camp for
Jews, except there was no gas chamber.''
 &HT;    The story always ended the same way, with the children's father
muttering about ``the 35 skeletons in the bunks near me. All my
friends, they die.''
 &HT;    Naturally, the children had nightmares, until one day their
mother put her foot down. She told her husband that he could no
longer speak of the war years unless he could do it with humor.
 &HT;    ``That night, my father started telling a different story,''
Benigni recalls. ``One with levity, about the captain in the camp
and the time he falls down. I know it sounds impossible, but the
stories were funny.
 &HT;    ``We started to laugh, and the nightmares ended.''
 &HT;    The young boy grew up to be Italy's favorite comedian, and those
stories sowed the seeds of what is being hailed as his greatest
film, ``La Vita E Bella,'' a.k.a. ``Life Is Beautiful.'' The film,
which on March 21 won him the 1998 Oscar for Best Actor,
 &HT;    is as much one man's creation as any film can be: Benigni wrote
it, directed it and stars in it, with his real-life wife playing
his on-screen wife.
 &HT;    It's the tale of Guido, an Italian Jew who has grand dreams of
owning his own bookstore until the Nazis take over. Only three
months before the war's end, he and his 5-year-old son are deported
to a German concentration camp. In order to save his son's life,
Guido uses his bold imagination and physical comedy to convince the
boy that they are just there to play a game.
 &HT;    It may sound unlikely, but it's hardly unlikable: ``Life is
Beautiful'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1988 Cannes Film
Festival, and is being touted as a candidate for multiple Oscars.
 &HT;    It represents a new level of fame for the 45-year-old Benigni,
previously best known outside of Italy for Jim Jarmusch's cult
classic ``Down by Law'' (1986) and Blake Edwards' ``Son of the Pink
Panther'' (1993).
 &HT;    But according to Benigni, as he sits down to talk about his film
at a Toronto hotel, he's already won the biggest prize he could
ask.
 &HT;    ``I screen the movie for my father in Florence,'' he says,
laughing. ``At the end, he screamed, `Son, you finally did good
movie! First time! Good movie!'''
 &HT;    Italians generally think Benigni has made good movies before,
but not movies like this.
 &HT;    ``In Italy, I'm so well known as a popular comedian. I am like
Donald Duck,'' he says. ``So Donald Duck making a movie about
Holocaust was hard for people to understand.''
 &HT;    The idea for the film came to him, Benigni says, when he came
across a line attributed to the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky.
Trapped in a bunker, waiting for Stalin's assassins to kill him _
as they ultimately did _ the Russian supposedly nevertheless wrote,
``Life is beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``The message to me is that, no matter what happens, there is
beauty in this life,'' the comedian says. ``You can find the
goodness.''
 &HT;    At core, he adds, ``Life is Beautiful'' isn't about the
Holocaust at all _ it's a love story between father and son.
 &HT;    ``What is more simple than a father protecting his son?'' he
asks. ``That is true love, with a real purity and innocence.''
 &HT;    Casting the role of the young boy was a challenge. Even when
Giorgio Cantarini won the part, problems continued.
 &HT;    ``I test hundreds of boys. When he entered, I stopped with
everything,'' Benigni recalls. ``This boy looks like me _ big nose!
His face is not right for TV!''
 &HT;    But young Cantarini couldn't read at the time.
 &HT;    ``He had to learn his lines by sheer memorization, which seemed
impossible,'' the director says. ``But he did it.''
 &HT;    Benigni filmed in Tuscany, where he was born and raised, and
where he could work closely with Milan's Center for Contemporary
Jewish Documentation. Camp survivors reviewed the script and gave
advice, but Benigni admits that he approached test screenings with
trepidation.
 &HT;    ``I was afraid I could hurt or offend someone because I am a
comedian,'' he admits. ``I didn't want to offend, because I respect
these survivors so much.''
 &HT;    To his delight, Milanese Jewish groups welcomed the film.
 &HT;    ``They loved the movie very much,'' he says, relief still
evident in his voice. ``There is no problem. Some survivors did
talk to me about it and said, `This not right. This could not have
happened this way.' I told them I am an artist. I needed to take
some license. I must be free.
 &HT;    ``Then I asked, `Are you offended or hurt by the script?' They
told me the script was wonderful.''
 &HT;    Even so, he admits that he found the screenings disconcerting.
 &HT;    ``As a comedian, I'm used to hearing people laugh,'' he says.
``In this movie, everybody was crying. I was confused, but happy.''
 &HT;    The film was already big before Miramax Films picked it up. Now
Benigni hears rumors of Oscars, not only for Best Foreign Film but
possibly also for Best Actor, Best Director, even Best Picture.
 &HT;    Not that he's short on prizes, mind you.
 &HT;    ``In Italy, they give me hundred prizes for this movie,'' he
says. ``In each town, Jewish community give me prizes. Now people
stop me on the street and say, `Hey, Benigni, here is a prize. Do
you want this?'
 &HT;    ``Every week, I have something new for the mantel. It's nice.''
 &HT;    It's a nice change for a comedian who has often talked his way
into trouble. Some jokes about Pope John Paul earned him a one-year
suspended prison sentence, while his sarcastic mockery of former
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have been credited with
contributing to the politician's downfall.
 &HT;    Even with the occasional controversy, Benigni says, he loves
being a comedian.
 &HT;    ``All men in Italy like to talk so much,'' he says, laughing.
``Every bum in Italy is a comedian except for our serious actors.
People like good laughter there, which always made me happy.''
 &HT;    Making movies is just an extension of his comedy act, he adds.
 &HT;    ``When I make movies, the crew becomes my audience,'' Benigni
says. ``I don't imagine that in six months people will be watching
in the theater. To be alive as an actor, you must act for someone.
You need someone to look at you in that moment.''
 &HT;    Comedy has its spiritual side, the comedian adds, which is part
of the appeal of ``Life Is Beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``When you laugh at something bad, it gives you a strange
power,'' he says. ``I think if you have the power to laugh, you
have the power to say, `I will not die.'
 &HT;    ``When we laugh, we are naked _ we are vulnerable,'' Benigni
says. ``But I think sometimes the biggest act of resistance is a
smile. If you turn your cry to a laugh, it is a triumph of the
human spirit.''

 Includes a color slide of Steven Spielberg directing a scene from
``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine that you're a film director so uniquely successful that
not one, not two, but four of your films were included on the
American Film Institute's recently released honor role of the 100
best American films ever.
 &HT;    Would you high-five your cameraman? Slam-dunk your director's
chair? Declare yourself king of the world?
 &HT;    Steven Spielberg tried to give two of them back.
 &HT;    It seems that a couple of his favorites _ a Preston Sturges
comedy and a Marx Brothers romp _ had been omitted.
 &HT;    ``I was honored to be on the list,'' he says, ``but I
immediately called the AFI and volunteered two of my films back in
exchange for two others. I told them they could have `Jaws' (1975)
and `Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981) back in exchange for
`Sullivan's Travels' (1941) and `A Night at the Opera' (1935).''
 &HT;    Well, he'd still have ``ET'' (1980) and ``Schindler's List''
(1993) _ not a bad double play in anyone's book.
 &HT;    Best of all, and unlike such AFI peers as Alfred Hitchcock,
Frank Capra and John Ford, Spielberg isn't even dead. At 51, in
fact, he's at the peak of his career, wrapping up a period of
remarkable productivity that has produced three movies back to
back, including ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (1997),
``Amistad'' (1997) and ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the World War II
epic that won him the 1998 Best Director Oscar on March 21.
 &HT;    Oh, and he has his own movie studio, Dreamworks SKG.
 &HT;    All this, and it's still a hobby. As a father of seven, he's
bound by the terms of a longstanding deal with Kate Capshaw, the
lovely actress who is his wife,
 &HT;    ``My job is that I do carpool and I make breakfast every
morning,'' he says. ``You know, those two things are my real
careers. Then I go to work.''
 &HT;    Currently, work brings him to Los Angeles' Ritz Carlton Hotel,
where he's doing a rare round of interviews to promote ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    He doesn't look much like a Hollywood powerhouse, however, in
his jeans, black-and-white tennis shoes and a tattered
brown-leather jacket. In fact, with wire-rimmed glasses framing a
warm, kind face, he looks rather like a college professor.
 &HT;    The topic of today's seminar is World War II, the setting for
``Private Ryan'' as well as several other Spielberg films,
including the disastrous ``1941'' (1979), the epic ``Empire of the
Sun'' (1987) and, of course, the Oscar-winning ``Schindler's
List.''
 &HT;    Oh, and one more: ``Fighter Squadron,'' a low-budget affair he
directed at age 15.
 &HT;    ``That was my first air-to-air-combat film,'' Spielberg says,
laughing. ``The budget was about a hundred dollars. I remember for
the bomb explosions, I got firecrackers. My mother wanted to kill
me.''
 &HT;    He acknowledges that maybe it was strange for a young boy
growing up in Phoenix to be so obsessed with war, even if his
father, Arnold Spielberg, was a veteran who had fought on Guam as a
sharpshooter.
 &HT;    ``My Dad is 82 now, and he fought in World War II,'' the
director says. ``I didn't know who to believe _ my Dad and his
friends, or the war movies Hollywood was making? I chose to believe
the war movies. My Dad's stories were so outrageously harsh to me.
 &HT;    ``He would tell me about the freezing cold and just the
suffering and how they had to endure watching their friends die,''
Spielberg recalls. ``War always fascinated me because, I think, at
the core of every war is this question of how far we can be pushed
and how deep you can reach down in your soul to walk those extra 10
miles in the morning. It still amazes me how the human spirit is
endless.''
 &HT;    This isn't the prettified war of 1940s films, in short. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was reportedly involved in a ratings controversy,
rare in that it was about extreme violence, not sex or nudity.
Ultimately the film received an R rating, though some observers
whispered that a less influential director would have drawn the
commercially hazardous NC-17.
 &HT;    ``That whole thing is not true,'' Spielberg says heatedly. ``I
didn't get any special favors. We got the R rating. We were never
going to get an NC-17.''
 &HT;    The director freely admits that the film is very violent.
 &HT;    ``It's a war movie,'' he says with a patient sigh. ``I really
wanted to give the audience a physical experience.''
 &HT;    So important was it to him, he insists, that if he'd been hit
with an NC-17 rating, he'd have still refused to make cuts.
 &HT;    ``I would have taken the NC-17,'' he says. ``I would have taken
the rating without protest.''
 &HT;    This isn't the kind of movie that the young Spielberg grew up
watching. Lonely as the only boy among four children, he was drawn
to movies from an early age.
 &HT;    As a child, he recalls, he would stage his own horror movies by
pulling off the heads of his sisters' dolls, carefully placing them
on a dish and garnishing them with lettuce and tomato. Bigger
budgets _ and an indulgent mother _ led him to ``Fighter Squadron''
and, seemingly inevitably, to ``Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    His own children _ 13-year-old Max, his son with ex-wife Amy
Irving, Capshaw's 21-year-old Jessica and the couple's own five
children, 9-year-old Theo, 8-year-old Sasha, 6-year-old Sawyer,
2-year-old Mikaela and 1-year-old Destry _ don't seem to share his
interest in moviemaking, despite gifts of video cameras and such.
 &HT;    ``None of them cares about it, and I have seven kids,''
Spielberg laments.
 &HT;    Then he brightens.
 &HT;    ``The two babies don't know about it yet,'' he says hopefully.
 &HT;    Spielberg's passion for movies has led him to be one of the most
productive filmmakers of his generation, and he has a long list of
projects in mind, from a Tom Cruise film to a fourth Indiana Jones
picture. But the repercussions of fame have led him to plan a
couple of years off in the not-too-distant future.
 &HT;    ``I've heard I'm part of a government conspiracy to make America
and the rest of the world conducive to accepting an alien
neighbor,'' Spielberg says, laughing, ``and that's why I really
made `ET' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977).
 &HT;    ``I love it, but the answer is no.''
 &HT;    More seriously, he recently was forced to testify in court
against a stalker who had threatened his family.
 &HT;    ``I don't really want to talk about it,'' the director says,
``except to say that I'm glad it's over.''
 &HT;    Spielberg has long been noted for his childlike imagination, a
sense of wonder which has fueled many of his most successful films.
But when he turned 50 last year, with ``Schindler's List'' and
``Amistad'' behind him and ``Private Ryan'' underway, many wondered
if their more serious tone meant that Hollywood's wunderkind was at
last feeling his age.
 &HT;    ``Turning 40 was really hard for me,'' he recalls. ``I had all
my midlife concerns. It was a terrible, terrible birthday where you
start to feel like you're getting old.
 &HT;    ``You know what? Fifty sucked, too.''
 &HT;    In retrospect, he says, he finds himself facing the question
that Private Ryan himself grapples with: Have I been a good man?
 &HT;    ``I think everybody asks that question at one time or another:
Have I been a good person?'' he says. ``It's a question we should
ask ourselves, not when we're really old and standing in the
cemetery. It's the kind of question we need to ask ourselves every
day of our life.''

 Includes a color slide of Joseph Fiennes in a scene from
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ralph Fiennes may do Shakespeare, but Joseph Fiennes is
Shakespeare.
 &HT;    Well, at least in his current movie. Playing the immortal bard
in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' voted the Best Picture Oscar for 1998,
the younger Fiennes once and for all escapes his brother's shadow,
proving his own merit as a master of light comedy and passionate
romance alike _ and, oh yes, as a Hollywood hunk to boot.
 &HT;    After all, the man currently sitting down for an interview at
Manhattan's Parker Meridian Hotel, flashing long, seductive
eyelashes and a boy's mischievous smile, can be seen romping au
naturel with Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow in his first two
films, both currently playing.
 &HT;    That would include the critically acclaimed period drama
``Elizabeth,'' in which Fiennes as the lustful Earl of Leicester
engages in some anything-but-chaste revels with the so-called
``virgin queen,'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a romantic comedy in
which Fiennes plays a lovesick bard struggling with writer's block
as he tries to pen a new play, ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter.''
 &HT;    And romping around with a naked Paltrow, which is a heck of a
way to start a big-screen career.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it's not as glamorous as one might think,'' Fiennes
insists. ``I'm so shy that these scenes were torture for me. Give
me a sword fight any day.''
 &HT;    Believe it or not, he's serious.
 &HT;    ``Let's start with the fact that Gwyneth's boyfriend, Ben
Affleck, is in this movie,'' the actor says. ``And he's a big guy.
You don't want to get on the wrong side of Ben and say, `Guess
what? I will be spending the duration of the day in a bed with your
girlfriend.'
 &HT;    ``Thankfully, our director, John Madden, placed the love scenes
in the middle of shooting,'' he adds, ``and Gwyneth and I already
got on like a house on fire. Still, we had a bit of a laugh when we
had to get into bed. It was so surreal. But then we just got on
with it.''
 &HT;    Actually, Fiennes says, he didn't expect to wind up anywhere
near that bed.
 &HT;    ``I blew the audition for this movie,'' he recalls. ``I gave a
horrendous reading of the script when I first read for John. About
a month later he called, saying he managed to squeeze some
potential out of it.''
 &HT;    A screen test with Paltrow followed, and he was suddenly faced
with the challenge of being Shakespeare.
 &HT;    ``In one sense, he's sacred ground to so many people like
academics and theater-goers,'' Fiennes says. ``On the other hand,
from the little research that I did, William Shakespeare is a blank
sheet _ no one really knows anything about him as a man. So it was
a bit of a can of worms.
 &HT;    ``You can profile him from the sonnets and from the plays, but
his faith, his politics, his sexuality and his take on life is a
mystery,'' the actor says. ``From my sense, that's great. No one
can say that I did it right or wrong.''
 &HT;    For insight on a writer's mind, Fiennes turned to his novelist
mother.
 &HT;    ``My mother told me that writing was one of the most isolating
ways to spend a life,'' he says. ``She felt that the huge amount of
solitude put a shadow on a person, which is what I thought of when
I played William Shakespeare.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, it was a case of working from the script.
 &HT;    ``I figured Shakespeare was a genius who didn't quite know it,''
Fiennes says. ``He knew he was a pretty damn good writer, but he
was also a man who had to pay the rent. He's got writer's block.
All of this indicated to me someone who was knocking out his plays
to pay the rent. He was a survivor.''
 &HT;    The same applies to the actor, who comes from a family of
survivors. The youngest of six children _ his fraternal twin Jacob,
now a gamekeeper, is minutes older _ he grew up in a family
constantly on the go, as a child moving a dozen times to various
spots in both Ireland and England. His father was a sculptor, while
his mother was a writer.
 &HT;    ``Being the youngest makes you long for more of a voice,'' he
says. ``You find that voice early in theatrics of the kitchen. I
was the one screaming, `Hey, where is my food?'''
 &HT;    Given their genes, it's perhaps not surprising that the six
children include three actors and a director among them.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it is that made us all find careers of
expression,'' Fiennes says. ``Maybe it has something to do with my
mother and father having careers that were creative. There was
never a lack of stimulus in terms of literature or painting and
drawing.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``I know I'm making it sound so romantic and bohemian,'' he
says. ``It wasn't. It was chaotic, dirty and noisy. I couldn't wait
to get out. I guess that was the stimulus.''
 &HT;    For this Fiennes, the path to independence started with his
theatrical debut, in a third-grade production of ``Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
 &HT;    ``The only bad thing is my teacher didn't want me to sing,'' he
recalls. ``She told me to mime it. It hurt my feelings.''
 &HT;    But by age 9 he was on his way, performing in youth theater at
the Young Vic. Two years later he was studying at the Guild Hall of
Music and Drama in London, where he spent three years training for
the stage.
 &HT;    After a year off in Italy, where he worked on the reconstruction
of a 12th-century villa, Fiennes returned to England and the
theater.
 &HT;    ``Ever since I've been battling for parts,'' he says.
 &HT;    Ironically, his rise to stardom may have been slowed by his
brother's own ascent. Seeing the public spotlight that has followed
Ralph Fiennes since ``Schindler's List'' (1993) left his shyer
brother feeling awkward.
 &HT;    ``I keep thinking about what that costs in terms of your persona
and how much you would like to keep your persona under wraps,'' he
says. ``Unfortunately, to a certain degree you've got to let a
little bit of it go. That's rough for me, because deep down I am
shy.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe. His brother also once claimed to be shy, only to
turn up on the cover of Vanity Fair shirtless and wild-haired in
leather pants.
 &HT;    ``That was just too many vodkas,'' Joseph Fiennes says,
laughing.
 &HT;    His two Elizabethan adventures just might make Fiennes the most
popular member of the family. But the actor, who is single and
lives in London, isn't making any such plans.
 &HT;    ``I don't know where I'm going,'' he says, not apparently overly
concerned about it. ``Any job I've ever taken has not been about
pursuing fame. The only thing I can do is respond to certain
material. If that leads to a career, then so be it.''

 &UR; ALL TOO HUMAN &QL; 
 &UR; George Stephanopoulos (Little, Brown, $27.95)
</P>
<P>
   One morning in 1996, Stephanopoulos was in a coffee shop near
his home when he was approached by a woman with a familiar face. He
didn't know her well _ he remembered her only as ``a pretty, busty,
flirty intern'' he'd passed in the halls of the White House. They
made small talk, and then she suddenly asked, ``Does your president
tell the truth?'' ``I thought her phrasing was peculiar,''
Stephanopoulos writes, ``but people stopped me on the street to say
strange things all the time. After mumbling some answer like `He
does his best,' I bought my coffee and didn't think about it
again.'' It's Monica Lewinsky's first notable appearance in this
memoir, and it doesn't occur until Page 433 _ good news for those
of us who run for cover at the mention of her name. But the specter
of things to come is everywhere in Stephanopoulos' account of his
years as adviser to Bill Clinton. His book is a fascinating,
ruthless and often humorous insider's view of politics, power and a
gifted, charismatic president with serious personal flaws. Among
Stephanopoulos' duties was damage control during a succession of
``bimbo eruptions.'' At first, he thought that ``doing the dirty
work was not only necessary but noble, a landmark on the road to
greater good.'' Four years later, burnt out and on antidepressants,
he quit, ``grateful for the privilege of serving a president,
relieved to be leaving in one piece.'' Now, he's making money
telling tales on the Clintons, Dick Morris (``the dark buddha whose
belly Clinton rubbed in desperate times''), James Carville, Al Gore
and others in the cold-blooded arena of Washington politics. New &AMP;

   Albert Einstein's brain, coveted by scientists everywhere, ended
up in pieces in Princeton, Philadelphia and Japan. ``It was exactly
what he didn't want to happen,'' Einstein biographer Denis Brian
says. Amelia Earhart was very pretty, but she had thick ankles.
``She hated them,'' biographer Susan Butler says. ``She was
obsessed even when she was famous with her ankles, which is one of
the reasons why she always wore pants _ because they showed off the
best of her figure and hid the worst.'' C-SPAN's ``Booknotes'' will
observe its 10th birthday next month, and Lamb celebrates with this
new collection of essays based on interviews with ``Booknotes''
authors. As with 1997's ``Booknotes: America's Finest Authors on
Reading, Writing, and the Power of Ideas,'' the writers speak in
their own words _ Lamb's questions are omitted _ and although the
transcripts have been edited, they have a conversational tone.
Among the biographers included: Ron Chernow (who is in Flagstaff

<P>
   ``At first I was puzzled over having missed a cog somewhere,''
Ezra Pound told Donald Hall years later. ``I expected to turn
myself in and to be asked about what I learned. I did and I
wasn't.'' He spoke of the spring of 1945, when American troops
arrived in Rapallo, Italy, and Pound, who had passed the war there,
presented himself and asked to be taken to the United States ``to
give information to the State Department.'' He was determined to
help Harry Truman negotiate peace with the Japanese. This was, he
told the Americans, ``a serious matter and not just eccentricity.''
Instead, he was indicted for treason because of fascist radio
broadcasts he had made during the war, and held for months in an
army detention camp outside Pisa. He was 60, and for the first
three weeks lived in an open-air, wire cage with blankets on a
concrete floor and a tin can for a toilet. Only when he suffered a
breakdown was he moved to a tent in the medical compound (described
in ``The Pisan Cantos'' _ ``Only shadows enter my tent/ as men pass
between me and the sunset''). This is a collection of previously
unpublished letters written by Pound and his wife, Dorothy, while
he was held in Italy and later at a mental institution in
Washington, D.C. They show less of the disintegration of the poet
than the allegiance of his wife, who kept up a steady flow of news
even after Pound was confined to St. Elizabeths Hospital for the
Insane. The editors include copious notes on the letters, as well
as FBI documents and photographs. Omar Pound is Ezra Pound's son. &QL;

   Ierley traces the evolution of the American house since the
beginning of European settlement. He focuses on a chronological
sequence of houses that are now museums open to the public,
beginning with the home that English settler Jonathan Fairbanks
built for his family in Dedham, Mass., in 1637. (Ierley does
include a brief acknowledgment of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico, which
is believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in
the country, built a full 700 years before Fairbanks was born).
Other houses here include the Harriet Beecher Stowe House in
Hartford, Conn.; Frank Lloyd Wright's Pope-Leighey House in Falls
Church, Va.; and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. Ierley addresses
issues of heat, light and indoor plumbing and constructs a timeline
of technological developments that includes 100 houses across the
country. &QL;

SENOR GORE: HABLA USTED ESPANOL? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUGLAS MACKINNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ A friend of Vice President Al Gore told me of
growing concerns about the Democratic candidate's campaign in
California for the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
   His worry manifests itself in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First: ``The Republicans, for the first time in history, may
make a real attempt to bring minorities into their party.''
</P>
<P>
   And second, and more importantly: ``Those Bush brothers!''
</P>
<P>
   As a Republican long disgusted with the lip service my party
pays to minorities, I discussed with the vice president's friend
(and a friend of mine) the power of the Latino vote in California.
</P>
<P>
   He was not shy. It is his hope to ``Pete Wilsonize'' every
Republican presidential candidate who visits the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   That is, paint every GOP candidate as one who is out of touch
with Latinos, their needs and their growing power.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps him awake at night now, he said, is the specter of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
crisscrossing the state speaking fluent Spanish to Hispanic
television and radio stations and to Latino audiences.
</P>
<P>
   As my friend made clear, ``Vice President Gore knows about 15
words of Spanish and is really going to come up short against a
governor (Jeb Bush) who speaks perfect Spanish and whose wife is
from Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a deep concern for the Democratic Party because,
according to conventional wisdom, the Republican candidate can lose
in California and still win the election, while the Democratic
candidate has almost no chance should he lose in the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   As each successive Republican candidate has announced his or her
intentions for the upcoming campaign, I have been heartened to hear
most of them speak of the need to reach out to blacks, Hispanics
and minorities in a substantive way. Like the wife of Jeb Bush, my
wife is Hispanic (she is from Venezuela). One day we hope to have
children, and I want those children to have every opportunity in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when dinosaurs walked the Earth, and there was
a time when dinosaurs ruled the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few kicking around in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   And those dinosaurs have told me that reaching out to minorities
will ``alienate our base.''
</P>
<P>
   To that I have always said, `If those kinds of people represent
our base, then we have to drive them from the party as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   We are starting to do that, and my Democratic friend now has a
right to be worried about California.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the new generation of Republican leaders now
rising to the top look at the people of the United States in a much
more diverse and inclusive way. Many of them not only want
minorities in the GOP, they believe we need minorities in the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, I would have bet against the Republican
candidate winning California. As of now, my optimism grows with
each word of Spanish we speak.

STATISTICS SEND TREMORS THROUGH WOMEN'S SHELTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VERONICA FLORES  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ ``Sometimes it's easier to live with the abuse
than to live with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The quotation, first spoken by a battered woman more than 11
years ago, resounds in Joyce Coleman's mind and drives her frenetic
pace to save women from family violence.
</P>
<P>
   So it's with understandable frustration that Coleman, executive
director of the Battered Women's Shelter in San Antonio, views the
results of a study funded by the National Consortium on Violence
Research that examines the impact of the campaign against domestic
violence. The study of the 29 largest U.S. cities suggests that the
increased availability of services and outreach to family violence
victims has saved thousands of lives _ the lives of men.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, the number of men killed by their girlfriends has
dropped by more than two thirds, but the number of women slain by
their ``significant others'' has remained high, according to a
report in the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity appears to stem from the fact that
domestic-violence resources are aimed at getting women to change
their behavior, to leave an abusive relationship before they use
deadly force to protect themselves. Men who kill, on the other
hand, more often act out of rage or a sense of control and thus may
be angered rather than calmed by programs that split up abusive
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, female deaths have declined as have homicide rates
in other categories, the Post reports, but in 1997, domestic
violence nationwide led to the deaths of 1,174 women.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, more than 150 women were killed by their partners in
1997, the most recent data available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think that if I worked long enough and hard enough,
if we provided enough services, we would save more women,'' Coleman
said last week. ``I had hoped to work myself out of a job
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who also heads the Family Violence Prevention Services,
doesn't begrudge batterers their lives. ``Any life we save is
important,'' she says. ``but I just wish we could save more women's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman has done plenty to that end. Under her direction and
with community help, women in the San Antonio area have access to
services beyond the shelter. The safe house was all Coleman could
offer women in October 1987, when she became the shelter's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The haven now boasts the state's largest intervention program
for batterers _ last year 2,000 men were ordered to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Transitional housing for family violence victims now is
available as are drug and alcohol programs, a juvenile violence
intervention program, counseling for the homeless and various forms
of outreach to families at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman estimates that shelter staffers touch the lives of
9,500-10,000 clients every year.
</P>
<P>
   But even as she recites the impressive gains, Coleman is
intensely focused on the lapse that glares at her from the
statistics about women killed by their partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel we've made a difference, but when you look at
these numbers nationally, I guess I feel a little frustrated
because I don't know what more we need to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I not doing right?''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman and her colleagues around the country have done plenty
right. And, incrementally, so do lawmakers and others in a position
to help victims.
</P>
<P>
   But the scourge of family violence isn't so easily erased.
``We've made giant strides,'' Coleman says. ``but as a community,
we have to look at how to keep women from dying.''

CALLING ALL CHAIRS, CALLING ALL CHAIRS: SIT UP STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Police work has always had its inherent dangers, but
the Seattle Police Department's Identification Unit has apparently
become a particularly perilous place.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, two employees slipped off their rolling desk
chairs and landed on the linoleum floor.
</P>
<P>
   In response, all the unit's civilian employees have been ordered
to undergo a training session on how to safely sit in a chair,
rolling and non-rolling alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Take hold of the arms and get control of the chair before
sitting down,'' advised a recent supervisor's memo to the unit's
fingerprint and photo lab specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, workers have been falling out of their chairs laughing:
``It's so ridiculous,'' said one employee. ``We've been joking that
this is for the sitting-impaired.''
</P>
<P>
   About 26 employees were expected to attend Tuesday's half-hour
session, including two supervisors on overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The class will cover the fine art of chair-sitting,
chair-rolling and chair-placement,'' joked an employee.
</P>
<P>
   For department safety officer Patrick Sweeney, however, the
recent ``chair-related injuries,'' though rare, are no laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the cases, the chair rolled out from underneath the
employee. In a third case, an employee hurt her back when the seat
height fell abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything that results in injury to an employee
of the Seattle Police Department is funny,'' he said. He said one
worker's injuries kept her out of work.
</P>
<P>
   After the accidents, employees suddenly found their chairs
replaced with awkward, non-wheeled ones. They complained about
headaches and backaches. Then, some of the rolling chairs
reappeared. The unit's acting manager, Marty Sullivan, was
unavailable to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Safety officer Sweeney said that ``some people know how to sit
in a chair,'' while others need a little education. He said his
session will also cover ``common hazards associated with working in
an office space,'' including open cabinets and drawers.

HILLARY CLINTON PREPARES FOR A WALK IN THE PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hillary Clinton has been warned repeatedly that a
U.S. Senate run in New York would be no walk in the park. That's
why, I suppose, the first lady has been calling Democratic Party
leaders around the state.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she supposedly has talked to roughly 200 of them. She
has been asking about New York parks, presumably so she can take a
walk in one. Recently, she got hold of an upstate party boss I
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the boss told her, ``we have many parks in New York.
There's Washington Park, for example. That's in Albany, a few
blocks west of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where, precisely, is Central Park?'' Mrs. Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's in Schenectady,'' said the upstate boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? I thought it was somewhere in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have one there, too, actually. It's east of Riverside
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a river in Manhattan?` Hillary Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several. There's the Hudson River to the west, just east of
New Jersey. Then there's the East River _ to the east of Manhattan,
naturally. The Harlem River is on the north, and New York Harbor is
to the south.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Manhattan is an island? I thought Staten Island was the
island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both islands, Mrs. Clinton. Each is a borough of the
City of New York. The city has three other boroughs as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that. There's Brooklyn, Queens and Bronxville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, actually, it's Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.
Bronxville is a community in Westchester. That's located just north
of the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? And is there an Eastchester located south of the
Bronx? Or a Southchester to the west? Or a Northchester to the
east?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Bronxville is part of Westchester?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that's confusing, the City of Rensselaer is in
Rensselaer County, but Rensselaerville is in Albany County, just
west of the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute. You just told me that the Hudson is west of
Manhattan, and that New Jersey is west of the Hudson. How can the
Hudson be just west of Rensselaer County and just east of Albany
County? What happened to New Jersey?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it, Mrs. Clinton.You won't be campaigning
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not? I thought that's where the Giants and the Bills
play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's the Giants and the Jets who play there. The Bills
play in Rich Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And where's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I repeat, where's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's near Ohio, Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Ohio? I don't want to campaign there. I'd rather campaign in
New Jersey. Everything seems simpler there. For example, they named
their high point High Point. What's New York's high point?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, Mount Marcy, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``See what I mean? New York makes my head hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have that effect on outsiders, Mrs. Clinton. But you'll
love it here. Wait until you see how pretty Columbia County is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that Columbia was a university.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a county, too, Mrs. Clinton. It's east of the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that Manhattan and Rensselaer County were east of
the Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's quite a long river, Mrs. Clinton.''

SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO SIDESTEP THE ABORTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A few weeks ago, after attending a state
convention in which the Republican Party seemed more like the
Donner party, I said the GOP has no chance of winning the
presidency in 2000 because of its rigid stand against women's right
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   It was a political insight of the ``Duh'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   But this time even the Republicans seem to get it. The
Republicans' great, white, Spanish-speaking hope, George W. Bush,
is trying to downplay abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have the least chance of being elected president in
the general election _ Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Pat Buchanan _
have made the loudest pro-life noises in hopes of winning the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a conservative activist who bears a startling
resemblance to a fetus, constantly speechifies about how abortion
must be fought by ``the party of Lincoln and Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how many abortions Lincoln was responsible for, but
according to the California Department of Public Health, 609,209
abortions were performed in California while Reagan was governor _
and he signed the act legalizing them.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican friend forwards a press release dated June 13,
1967, and signed by then-Gov. Reagan's press secretary Lyn
Nofziger. It began, ``Governor Ronald Reagan announced today that
he will sign a bill liberalizing California's abortion laws . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was quoted as saying. ``I am fully sympathetic with
attempts to liberalize the outdated abortion law now on the law
books of California.'' He described the goals of the liberalized
law as ``humanitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan later changed his position on abortion, but for Bauer or
others in the Republican Party to cite Reagan in arguments against
abortion is disingenuous, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   If they truly believe their own rhetoric, then Reagan killed
609,209 babies.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Reagan was such a towering figure he could
contradict himself coming and going.
</P>
<P>
   Not many fiscal conservatives can get away with putting a
country into massive debt, and few pro-lifers have a record of
legalizing abortion. Yet few presidents have been as popular.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was so popular no one could ever attack him for having
been soft on abortion, or anything else. It was another story with
his successor, George Bush the elder, who was forced to kowtow
before the radical right.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1980, Bush supported Planned Parenthood and abortion
rights. He came out against abortion when he became Reagan's
running mate. Because he once backed Planned Parenthood, the right
wing of the Republican Party always distrusted and sniped at him.
</P>
<P>
   None of the right-wingers ever brought up the fact that Reagan
legalized abortion in California and then changed his mind. No one
ever talked about the 609,209 fetuses that never became California
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   What this shows is that abortion is not the absolute moral issue
that the Republican platform makes it out to be. It is a political
issue, and a politician with the stature of Reagan could make his
history on it a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Bush the younger, and he is getting easier treatment
from some important Republicans trying to shed the image of being
American women's medical and moral dictators.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been downplaying abortion, instead talking about
encouraging adoption, requiring parental consent for minors seeking
abortions and promoting sexual abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   These are part of his ``reverence for life'' agenda, a reverence
that doesn't extend to death row in Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes and Bauer plan on attacking Bush for not continuing to
target fights like so-called ``partial birth'' abortion. But Pat
Robertson and David O'Steen, head of the National Right to Life
Committee, are defending Bush. O'Steen called for an end to
more-pro-life-than-thou fights between candidates.
</P>
<P>
   What do you know? There may be some closet pragmatists on the
right, people who actually want to win in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Young Bush has been playing it cagey, not taking any position on
whether he'd demand that his judicial appointees oppose abortion, a
key litmus test of the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   He says he supports abortion in the case of rape, incest or when
the life of the mother is endangered. He's vague on the Republican
platform demand for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elizabeth Dole announced that she was forming an
``exploratory committee'' on running for president, which means
she's prospecting for money. However, exploring reporters couldn't
get her to express any position on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is stuck with a losing issue, and enough
people know it that they want to hide it. But they can't hide the
fact that they're stuck with pee-wee candidates.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Reagan who can get away with any kind of
inconsistency. There are few remaining moderates like John Chafee
of Rhode Island, who announced he is retiring as of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The party of Lincoln and Reagan only has Bush the younger and
the Dole who doesn't do Viagra ads. The Republican party definitely
needs a reverence-for-life agenda _ it's own life.

DUKE BLUE DEVILS ARE BEATABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In theory, the Duke Blue Devils are only
human. They have demons that can get the best of them. They have
deficiencies that can be the death of their desires.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils are beatable. Of course they are. They've been
beaten before, so they can be beaten again. The NCAA Tournament is
full of kids who are still trying to become men. And kids can do
the craziest, most unexplainable things at the most unthinkable or
inappropriate times.
</P>
<P>
   Houston in 1983 happens. Georgetown in 1985 happens. Nevada-Las
Vegas in 1991 happens. Kansas in 1997 happens.
</P>
<P>
   The Temple Owls embraced a good many of those theories _ plus
whatever else coach John Chaney could cram into their heads on one
day's notice _ when they took the court for the East Regional
final. But no theory could prepare them for the reality of a Final
Four-stakes game with a vintage Mike Krzyzewski team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Owls played with passion, purpose and poise for the
better part of Sunday afternoon at Continental Airlines Arena. The
result? An 85-64 thrashing by a top-seeded, top-ranked team that is
on anything but a top-secret mission.``Whoever plans to beat 'em,''
Chaney said, ``I hope they believe in the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 19,557 saw firsthand what those from less privileged
vantage points might miss. From a distance, it's easy enough to get
deluded into shrinking down the Blue Devils to life size. Through
the lying eyes of a television camera, some of the beauty marks
could get mistaken for warts.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that the shortest distance between two points is right
under the baskets, the Owls surrounded the Blue Devils' incredible
bulk, sophomore All-America Elton Brand. The Owls did this so
diligently, Brand didn't score a single point in the first 12 and a
half minutes. When Brand got his first basket, Duke led by nine.
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Trajan Langdon began shooting holes in the Owls'
revered matchup zone defense barely five minutes into the game.
Langdon scored 11 of his 23 points during a 2:17 binge, putting the
Blue Devils ahead for good. His aim was so sharp from so far, he
opened up all sorts of avenues to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   After the Owls went to all that trouble to corral Brand, he
still wound up with 21 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that somebody is going to start hitting baskets from
the outside,'' Chaney said. ``But you just don't know how well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls had a 9-5 lead when Langdon hit a runner off the
fast-break at 14:38. Fifty-seven seconds later, he squeezed off a
3-pointer from the right corner. Swish. Fifty-four seconds after
that, Langdon squeezed off another 3 from the right side. An entire
86 seconds elapsed before Langdon dropped a bomb from the left
side.
</P>
<P>
   The senior had shown the way to a 16-11 lead that grew to 43-31
by halftime. Langdon scored 47 points in the two regional games at
the Meadowlands. He needed only 21 shots to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little nervous at the beginning of the game,''
Krzyzewski said. ``Trajan wasn't, but I sensed they were ... not
afraid. They were young. How Trajan went into that spree was bigger
than the points, because it really settled everybody down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Devils wound up shooting a free-and-easy 60 percent
from the field. They slashed to the basket and they passed, getting
19 of their 27 field goals off assists. The Owls, on the other
hand, generated just about all of their offense on solo efforts (25
baskets, only 10 assists). Temple forward Mark Karchner missed 18
of 25 shots. The entire Duke team missed 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is equipped to play at the highest level of
basketball right now,'' Chaney said. ``Not just physically, but
their will and their skill. Believe me, there's something up here
... they've got wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the Blue Devils can be beaten. Somebody has, and that
somebody was Cincinnati, which didn't make it past the first
weekend of the NCAAs. The defeat came 32 games ago. By two points.
In November.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the cast of players is as talented as any
Steven Spielberg ever assembled. The coach is college basketball's
answer to Spielberg, an artistic success who doesn't waste his time
with unworthy projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got better athletes than any other team that we ever
played,'' Temple guard Rasheed Brokenborough said.
</P>
<P>
   The most sublime moment of Duke prowess came in the final
seconds of the first half, when freshman forward Corey Maggette set
his sights on a missed 3-point attempt by William Avery. The
6-foot-6 Maggette soared over 6-10 Lamont Barnes, slammed the ball
into the basket and did a chinup while everybody scurried for
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the first telltale sign of Temple trouble came when
Langdon flew off a screen from Chris Burgess to shoot his first
3-pointer. Barnes fought through the screen just in time to take a
good close look at Langdon making the first of five `3's'. At the
time, Chaney scolded his player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had practiced very hard to try and get them to understand
that (Langdon) only needed to look through a hole in the needle to
see the basket,'' Chaney said. ``There's no way I could describe
it, no way I could explain it, no way I could demonstrate it in
practice to get it across. The only thing I wanted to do was to get
into Lamont's head to maybe give it an extra amount of effort. And
even if he had done that, I still would have given him hell, and
Langdon still would have made the shot.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ A hot fire and short cooking time are the secrets to success
in grilling fajitas. Beef should be no more than 3/4 inch thick and
should be quickly seared over very hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flank steak, boneless sirloin, tenderized round steak, or
boneless chicken breast strips or chunks may be substituted for
skirt steak. Rub with fajita seasonings; marinate meat several
hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   _ For marinade, use bottled fajita marinade or seasoning,
bottled barbecue sauce or lime juice. A typical marinade includes
lime juice, garlic, a little oil, and often beer and chopped
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accompany with Pico de Gallo or Salsa Cruda (fresh tomato,
onion, lime juice and cilantro relish); Salsa Roja (a hotter red
sauce) or picante sauce; Salsa Verde (a mild green chili salsa);
guacamole; sour cream; shredded cheese (such as Cheddar, Monterey
Jack or Mexican blend); beans and rice.

FAJITAS: TEX-MEX FAVORITE HAS MANY VARIATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Fajitas have earned their stripes as a favorite
Tex-Mex food _ as common as tacos and enchiladas.
</P>
<P>
   Like other legendary dishes, such as chili, fajitas have an
obscure origin. In the early 1970s, they were just a glimmer on the
culinary horizon in Houston restaurants. The forerunner of fajitas,
Tacos al Carbon, were introduced to the world on the menu at the
original Ninfa's Restaurant on the edge of downtown Houston in July
1973.
</P>
<P>
   They were created at the suggestion of a customer, Glenn Smith.
On his return from a trip to Mexico City, he asked the Ninfa's
staff to slice the carne asada (steak) so he could make his own
tacos. They added some accompaniments _ cilantro, onion, tomatoes,
serrano chilies, sour cream and cheese _ and it became a favorite,
says Froilan ``Froggie'' Hernandez, who was general manager of
Ninfa's at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Ninfa's created a variation of tacos al carbon with
grilled meat strips, condiments and flour tortillas. Owner Ninfa
Laurenzo approved, and they were added to the menu as Fajitas for
One, Fajitas for Two, etc. Later that year, chicken and pork
fajitas were added,
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, people stumbled over the pronunciation.
(``No, sir, that's pronounced fah-HEE-tas, not fah-GEE-tas.'')
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the dish grew even more, John Mariani writes
in ``The Dictionary of American Food and Drink'' (Hearst Books,
$19.95) after the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Austin, Texas, featured
them as fajitas. By 1982, the hotel was selling 13,000 orders a
month. The first reference in the Houston Chronicle Food section
files _ ``flajitas'' _ was in 1977. They were described as ``a
Tex-Mex beef and tortilla sandwich,'' and the recipe called for
boneless sirloin instead of the characteristic skirt steak or
``faja,'' which gives the dish its name. ``Faja'' derives from the
Spanish word for girdle or belt; the meat is the supportive organ
covering the diaphragm of the steer.
</P>
<P>
   Like brisket, skirt steak has a layer of fat that should be
trimmed. It's also important to trim off any membrane covering the
meat, or it may be somewhat chewy.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 interview, Gilbert Cuellar, founder of El Chico Corp.,
says fajitas were seldom heard of before 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Mexican-Americans grew up eating a similar dish called
carne asada, a term meaning roasted meat,'' Cuellar says.
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar says the tradition of marinating thinly pounded skirt
steak, whatever it is called, to tenderize it and then grilling it
began with Mexican ranch workers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican immigrants in the 1940s often worked in ranches in
West Texas near the Mexican border. When a steer was butchered, the
workers were given the least desirable parts _ the head, intestines
and skirt steak. Skirt steak, of course, was a delicacy compared to
the head and intestines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workers would pound out the meat and marinate it, usually
in lime juice, to tenderize it. Then they would cook it over an
open fire and serve it with condiments rolled in a flour tortilla
...''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, restaurants (and meat markets) could hardly give
skirt steak away, says Larry Forehand, founder and vice-chairman of
Casa Ole Restaurants, which opened in 1973 and added fajitas to the
menu in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, fajitas cost 20 cents a pound. Now, fajitas
are more $2 per pound,'' Forehand says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fajita really isn't a tender cut of meat. It's the
tenderizer and the marinade that make it taste great.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, only beef has a fajita, but the term has evolved to
cover meats, including chicken, seafood (even lobster) and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can wrap it in a tortilla, it's a fajita,'' says
Forehand.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: A 1970 newspaper article from the National Tattler says that
John Wayne received Oscar nominations for ``True Grit,'' ``Sands of
Iwo Jima'' and ``Blue Bonnett.'' Do you have any information about
this third film?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.S., Whitehall, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Internet Movie Database turns up only one film close to
that title: ``The Blue Bonnet.'' This silent movie was released in
1919, seven years before Wayne made his acting debut in ``Brown of
Harvard'' as ``Yale football player No. 35.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, winning for
``True Grit'' in 1970 and being nominated for ``Sands of Iwo Jima''
in 1950. Broderick Crawford won for ``All the King's Men'' that
year.
</P>
<P>
   A 1961 Best Picture nomination went to ``The Alamo,'' a film
that Wayne directed, produced and starred in.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Movie Database is published on the World Wide Web
at www.imdb.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're huge fans of ``Dukes of Hazzard,'' especially my son.

<P>
   Q: Why is David Letterman credited as Earl Hofert in the movie
``Cabin Boy''?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Earl Hofert is the name of David's maternal grandfather, and
there's also an uncle named Earl Hofert Jr. Letterman has used that
name occasionally since ``Late Night With David Letterman,'' where
he would sometimes call himself Earl Hofert in skits.

   Letterman also was credited as Hofert in ``Beavis and Butt-Head

``Motley Crue Roadie No. 1.''

CONFESSIONS OF AN ALTOIDS ADDICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I didn't plan for this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   When I started popping an occasional Altoid a few years back, I
never thought it would become an addiction. Heck, I've always
claimed to be immune to addiction. OK, there is that little ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'' problem _ but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   But now, here I am at my first AA _ Altoids Anonymous _ meeting.
We have one thing in common: lethally minty-fresh breath.
</P>
<P>
   There are all types of people here: corporate suits, homemakers,
blue-collar workers, grandmothers. There's even a teen-age girl
with barrette-laden hair donning a Korn concert T-shirt. She's
shaking, totally jonesin' for her little metal tin of Curiously
Strong Peppermints.
</P>
<P>
   One guy stands up to offer salvation: not-so-curiously-strong
mints from Certs, Starbucks and even some in an expensive and
trendy little tin by Neiman Marcus. He's quickly removed. After
all, we're here to bond with other Altoidsholics.
</P>
<P>
   I stand up to tell my story:
</P>
<P>
   I was a Tic Tacs person. You can gulp about 10 of those at one
time, and the container is easier to carry. You can buy those packs
of 10 for a couple of bucks. A few years ago, a friend was carrying
an Altoids tin around with him. He was without vehicle, and I was
his primary means of transportation. One day, he left a nearly full
tin in my glove compartment. I popped one.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. The sensation from the minty fumes as they infiltrated the
nasal passage and the gullet. It was a brief rush that I can only
compare with ... well, the time I accidentally caught a whiff from
a bottle of video-head cleaner. The tin was emptied in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now I buy Altoids in two-packs, about one package every three
weeks or so. Curiously, one Altoid is no longer strong enough _ I
must throw back four or five at a time, and do this several times a
day. I think the epidermal layer on the roof of my mouth is slowly
disintegrating. I had a friend calculate my increasing immunity to
their power; he estimates that, by July, I'll need to pop 19 at a
time to achieve my desired level of breath freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, lately I've been doing the wintergreen flavor, which is
a little less potent than the original. Still, it does its job.
</P>
<P>
   If _ heaven forbid _ I run out at work, I bum from my
co-workers. It's OK, because they bum off me, too. (Of course, they
only take one. I grab three or four, five or six.)
</P>
<P>
   I carry the tin in my back left pocket. One pair of jeans is
starting to show a faded outline of a rectangle with rounded
corners, just like the circle that cowboys get on their Wranglers
from the can of chewing tobacco. This means I may need to buy new
jeans as often as I do Altoids tins. Now that's addiction.

ABC'S TWO NEW SERIES ARE IN DIRE NEED OF PATIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it too early for a ``Seinfeld'' imitator? Can the acerbic and
weird Norm Macdonald carry a show all by himself?
</P>
<P>
   Those are the questions ABC is no doubt fretting over as it
launches two new series on Wednesday. It wasn't that long ago that
ABC was struggling so badly it didn't want to keep any of its new
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Now, flush from a great development season, the network's newest
problem is its irritating tendency to kill shows too quickly _
hello ``Cupid.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not bode well for the network's latest offerings,
``It's Like, You Know ... '' and ``The Norm Show,'' both in dire
need of patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Like, You Know ... '' _ yet another poorly named ABC
series _ comes from Peter Mehlman, who wrote for ``Seinfeld'' for
six seasons. The knee-jerk reaction to this show is to say it's
``Seinfeld West,'' and in many ways that's true. Mehlman's voice is
so Seinfeldian that when these new characters open their mouths and
ask whether the letter Q comes too early in the alphabet, a
Jerry-rigged bell in your head goes off.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is giving ``It's Like, You Know ... '' a six-week run, and
rumors are already flying that the network doesn't know how to
promote it _ true _ or really believe in it. We'll see soon enough.
But those seeking something a little different need to give this
show a chance. All the elements are in place.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is simple enough. A die-hard New Yorker named Arthur
(Chris Eigeman) goes to Los Angeles to write a book about how
people can stomach living in the entertainment _ and smog _ capital
of the world, even though he's never been there himself.
</P>
<P>
   He's staying with a friend, Robbie (Steven Echholdt), who got
rich by turning the Jewish High Holy Days into a ``Pay-Per-Jew'' TV
event so no one needs to leave home.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Robbie's good friend Shrug (Evan Handler) is a trust
funder with a lot of rootless stress. Both do nothing but drink a
lot of water and celebrity-spot in L.A. _ which is perfect because
their next-door neighbor is Jennifer ``Dirty Dancing'' Grey, who
plays herself in this series to marvelous effect.
</P>
<P>
   She's had a nose job, see, and now no one recognizes her.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Seinfeld'' were a show about nothing _ not true, but go
with it _ then ``It's Like, You Know ... '' is a show about doing
nothing in Los Angeles, a city filled with peculiar ticks found
nowhere else. In one episode, the entire 22 minutes is spent with
the gang watching a high-speed freeway chase, a wonderful send-up
of how that city really does shut down for this bizarre modern-day
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Eigeman is wonderful as the fish-out-of-water who can't fathom
why people are so caught up in health food, bottled water, what
cars celebs are driving, tanning, etc. But you know from the pilot
that he'll slowly succumb to the sunny wonderland he despises in
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Mehlman has created a show that is searing and seething but also
hilarious and knowing _ giving L.A.-haters all they can handle
while revealing truths people throughout the country can relate to.
The first three episodes are funny if not fall-down hilarious like
``Seinfeld,'' but at least they hint at what can come from shining
a spotlight back on Tinseltown. Whether ABC let's it build an
audience remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the network seems more committed to ``The
Norm Show,'' which is odd in that if you don't like Macdonald,
you're never going to watch. Macdonald, most famous for his
``Weekend Update'' gig on ``Saturday Night Live'' before getting
fired because an NBC honcho didn't think he was funny, is the kind
of comedian you love or hate.
</P>
<P>
   And while he's likely to hold the post-``Drew Carey Show''
audience, he may not attract new fans. Which is a shame because
``The Norm Show'' is tremendously, well, Norm. He's a brilliant
stand-up in that he can make dumb into funny without slapstick
antics and he never leaves you thinking that it's all third-grade
name calling and finger pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald's humor can also seem mean-spirited (although if
someone on ``Frasier'' said it, we'd call it highbrow fun). But TV
needs that kind of attitude. Here's hoping he can shoulder the
burden of a show built around him.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald plays Norm Henderson, an ex-hockey player who bet on
his own games then got busted for tax-evasion. Instead of spending
five years in jail, he's forced to become a social worker. Of
course, being a social misfit, he's lousy at his job but clings to
freedom mostly thanks to co-worker Laurie (Laurie Metcalf).
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot he tells one kid, ``You stole a comb? Run along.
Come back when you've stabbed someone.'' He also works to get a
prostitute a job because, without that, ``look, you're a huge
whore.''
</P>
<P>
   And after Norm takes a man's abused dog, the owner shows up at
his house demanding it back and saying, ``You can't take my dog!''
Norm: ``What do you mean, pal? We're social workers. We can take
children.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out later whether those people who never warmed to
Macdonald's sarcastic ``Weekend Update'' will give him another
chance. And we may learn even sooner whether ABC will live up to
its reputation for having an itchy trigger finger.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: AsiaSF Spices Ahi Burger to Perfection  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Spicy, vibrant and delicious food is what you'll
find at AsiaSF, and the ahi burger is one example.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matthew Metcalf pairs the ground ahi with a teriyaki glaze and
fresh horseradish-Chinese cabbage slaw on a scallion focaccia roll.
Other dishes at the restaurant include duck quesadillas, spicy
minced chicken in lettuce cups and a trio of baby ice cream cones
for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The good-humored chef is fighting an uphill battle for
recognition, however. He's competing with a sexy room where two of
the walls glow and slowly change from red to pink to gold. And the
central bar, covered in red vinyl, also doubles as a stage for the
entertainers, who also double as waiters. They're ``gender
illusionists,'' meaning they're guys who dress up and perform in a
variety of outfits from outrageous to sexy. However, it's
sophisticated and all-around fun.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the end, Metcalf's food really does upstage the
``girls.''

<P>

<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons peeled and chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   6 sesame rolls
</P>
<P>
   Peanut oil as needed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Slaw &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1 head napa cabbage
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peeled and finely grated fresh horseradish
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teriyaki Glaze &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peeled and chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Instructions: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the tuna:  &LR; Carefully remove all the skin and the
deep red meat that runs down the side of the fish. Cut the fish
into 3/4-inch cubes and place in a food processor. Pulse quickly 2
or 3 times. Scrape down the sides of the work bowl and pulse again
once or twice. This is very important in order not to over-process
the fish. The fish should still be in little chunks, but should
hold together when formed into a patty. Transfer to a bowl. Add
scallions, garlic, ginger and Worcestershire sauce; mix gently by
hand until incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   Form the meat into 6 patties, place on a plate, cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the slaw:  &LR; Remove the darker green leaves from the
cabbage, then cut the head in half lengthwise. Remove the core.
Place a cabbage half cut-side down on a cutting board. Starting at
the end opposite the base, slice the cabbage into thin ribbons.
Place in a large mixing bowl. Repeat with the other half.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the carrots and using a mandoline, cut into julienne
strips, or grate on the large holes of a box grater. Add to the
cabbage, along with the horseradish, vinegar, salt and sugar; mix
well. Let stand for 1 hour. Check for seasoning and adjust as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the glaze:  &LR; Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, oil,
garlic, ginger, sherry and vinegar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil
over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, then slowly add the
cornstarch/water mixture, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil;
remove from heat. The glaze will thicken as it cools. (It should be
the consistency of ketchup. If it is not thick enough, simply
repeat the process, adding a little more cornstarch/water mixture.)
</P>
<P>
   Yields 2 cups glaze. Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for
up to 3 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the burgers:  &LR; Warm the rolls in a preheated 350-degree
oven.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a nonstick saute pan over high heat. Add enough peanut oil
to just coat the bottom of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Season the ahi patties with salt and pepper and place in the
pan, but do not crowd. Fry for about 45 seconds on each side for
medium-rare.
</P>
<P>
   For each burger, place an ahi patty on the bottom half of a
roll, spoon on 1 tablespoon of the teriyaki glaze and a half-inch
layer of slaw. Replace the top half of the roll. Insert 4 small
sandwich picks in the top of the roll, centering one in each
quadrant. Cut the sandwich into quarters and arrange on a plate,
cut sides facing out. Garnish with the extra slaw.

ELEANOR'S EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Clinton may chat with the ghost of Eleanor
Roosevelt in the White House corridors, but Elizabeth Dole also has
much in common with Franklin Roosevelt's intelligent,
independent-minded wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelts are endlessly fascinating. No matter how many
books are written and television shows aired about them, we are
always captivated by some surprising and unexplored facet of their
extraordinary lives. In ``Eleanor: An American Love Story,'' a
charming new musical that premiered last week at Ford's Theater in
Washington, we are treated to yet another nostalgic look at how
they got to the White House and stayed there until his death.
</P>
<P>
   The musical traces Eleanor's evolution from shy young idealist
to pragmatic political companion and prominent crusader for social
justice. Her transformation into a national figure in her own right
came slowly, as she learned to speak effectively in public forums
and to ignore the social and family pressures that initially
inhibited her.
</P>
<P>
   She did not fully emerge until FDR moved into the political
limelight as New York's governor, disabled by being confined to a
wheelchair after his bout with polio. She became essential to his
aspirations, traveling around the country and carrying his message
where his legs would not let him go.
</P>
<P>
   At first she said, ``My husband thinks ... '' Then, as she grew
bolder, she said, ``My husband and I think ... '' By the time the
couple reached the White House, she was saying, ``I think.''
</P>
<P>
   In this gradual transformation, Eleanor is more like Elizabeth
Dole than Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Hillary Rodham graduated from law school and
married Bill Clinton, she has had no hesitation about speaking her
mind in public. She has been blessed with the self-confidence and
courage that did not come naturally to the repressed Eleanor.
</P>
<P>
   As a working mother with her own professional credentials,
Hillary Clinton has never played the customary wifely role as
silent helpmate. We have always known where she stands. She
campaigned as Bill Clinton's intellectual equal and tackled
controversial public policy issues from the minute she had access
to the political forum afforded the wife of the Arkansas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, however, has followed a more traditional path to
prominence. Although, like Hillary, she is a lawyer who has never
been a stay-at-home housewife, she has frequently put her own
career on hold in order to help her husband. And she has seldom
expressed her own views, preferring to hide behind his.
</P>
<P>
   She left her job at the Federal Trade Commission to campaign for
Bob Dole's losing 1980 presidential campaign. As secretary of
transportation, she resigned from the Cabinet to campaign again for
him when he ran for president in 1988. And she took a leave of
absence from the American Red Cross to campaign with him after he
finally won the Republican presidential nomination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As Eleanor Roosevelt did, she often campaigned alone, extending
her husband's message to groups and towns that he could not visit
himself. But she did not express her own thoughts; she quoted her
husband's. When she spoke at the 1996 GOP convention, the opinions
she ventured were in praise of his qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's popularity, in fact, has been based in part on
the fact that although she has had a distinguished career as a
high-ranking political appointee, she is not perceived as a threat,
as Hillary Clinton has sometimes seemed to be.
</P>
<P>
   She has stood beside her man rather than behind him, but she has
regularly deferred to him. Until now, she has been content to be
the junior partner.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, as Elizabeth Dole moves toward a presidential race of
her own, will she be forced to take that final step toward
independent leadership that Eleanor Roosevelt made so long ago. She
is going to have to say, ``I think ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Does Elizabeth disagree with Bob on any of the major issues at
stake in the 2000 campaign? We do not know. But she will never be
elected president if she merely parrots her husband's thinking. The
voters, remember, rejected his views when he sought the presidency
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Eleanor disagreed sometimes with Franklin, pushing
him toward humane domestic policies, better opportunities for women
and vigorous internationalism. We know that Hillary and Bill
sometimes disagree, too, and that he has bowed to her political
judgment numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   We do not know whether Elizabeth has exerted much influence over
Bob because they have always put up a united front. Finally,
however, she will have to speak for herself. It should be good
listening. Eleanor would be pleased.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Muffin Maker's Pita Flattens Other Breads  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Pita bread has an array of uses: it can be the
bread for sandwiches, a dipper for hummus or baba ghanoush, or a
kind of chip that's crisply toasted and lightly seasoned. So who
makes the best?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted seven different white pita breads. One came
out as the overwhelming favorite. And it happens to be the same
brand the panel rated as tops in whole-wheat pita bread several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas' Sahara &LR;  (12 ounces for $1.69 at many supermarkets) far
outscored all of the competitors. All panelists agreed it would be
especially good for sandwiches. Some liked the sweet flavor; others
found it too pronounced. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Western Sierra &LR;  (12 ounces for $1.89 at
Whole Foods). Two panelists complained about the doughy taste; one
thought perhaps the bread had not been baked long enough. But
another panelist described it as a ``good, all-purpose pita
bread.'' One would buy it, two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cedarlane &LR;  (12 ounces for $1.19 at Whole Foods) _ which is kept
in the refrigerator section _ came in third. Three panelists
compared the texture to a biscuit; another called it ``cracker
bread.'' Some panelists thought it fell apart too easily. Three
might buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped significantly after Cedarlane, but fourth place
went to  &UR; Middle East Baking Co. Original Recipe  &LR; (12 ounces for
$1.29 at many supermarkets). Three panelists noted a bland taste
with a bitter finish. Some panelists also thought the bread was too
dry. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions varied on  &UR; Mediterranean &LR;  (12 ounces $1.15-$1.69 at
many supermarkets), which came in fifth. One thought it was
exceedingly dry; another commented on its fresh taste, saying it
would be good for pita toast though it wasn't firm enough to make a
sandwich. One would buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Middle East Baking Co. Organic and International Mr. Pita scored
too low to rate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna
Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland
Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

SEEKING AN ANTIDOTE FOR JUNK FOOD AFFLICTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The love of a parent knows no boundaries. A parent will beg the
court for mercy on behalf of their unrepentant, ruthless son. A
father will work three jobs to pay for his daughter's college
education. A mother will dart in front of a moving vehicle to
shield her baby from harm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some animals actually eat their young. I
don't condone this behavior, but I do understand it. Therefore, I
will limit this discussion to human parents and their infinite
love.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I am determined to help my son kick his very
destructive habit no matter what it costs me. We'll do a 12-step
program, participate in group therapy, or even send him to military
school if that is what it takes. We will find a cure for him, and
we won't give up until we do.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, my boy is a junk food junkie. If it has sugar in
it, he'll eat it and he'll eat it until it is all gone. It's gotten
so bad that we have to lock up the Ho-Hos. One night we found him
in the kitchen eating the crumbs out of the cookie jar with his
eyes closed. He was sleepwalking! The next day he didn't remember a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to reason with Junior about his bad habit. ``Son,
it's not healthy to eat sweets all the time,'' I say. ``Eventually
you'll ruin your health and your teeth. Because of all this junk
food, you don't have an appetite for nutritious food and you're
gaining weight. This has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help it,'' he replies. ``I've tried to stop but my
friends keep giving me candy. And plus, there's the voice!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What voice?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cookie man. He lives in the cookie jar and every time I
walk by he calls me, `Junior! Junior! Please have a cookie. It's
too crowded in here. I can't breathe. You've got to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, I thought I told you to stop bouncing that soccer ball on
your head. Besides, that doesn't explain why you always eat the
last two or three cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I eat those because the cookie man says that they're
lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times in the life of a parent when you just shake your
head and walk away. This was one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   So we just started hiding the cookies, foregoing the ice cream,
drinking more water and basically doing whatever we could to starve
that monkey off his back. Consequently, everyone suffered but it
was well worth it, especially when I found only one candy wrapper
in his wastebasket at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior, I'm proud of you. You've cut down on the candy.
Normally, your trash can is half full of wrappers. I only found one
in there this week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah. I didn't mean to put that in there. I've been
stuffing them in my back pack and throwing them away at school.
That's a good idea, huh? Then there's less trash to take out. So
can I have a Ho-Ho from the safe?''
</P>
<P>
   There are times in the life of a parent when you just shake your
head and walk away.

 COOKS' KITCHENS: PlumpJack Chef Mixes Tradition With Innovation  
   
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 NAPA VALLEY, Calif.  _ It's fitting that there is a baby rocking in
a cradle in Maria Helm's kitchen. It's equally fitting that little
Emma Louise Sinskey's cradle is mechanized.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That mixture of tradition and innovation is what characterizes
the kitchen and home of the executive chef of PlumpJack
cafes/Balboa Cafe and her husband, winery owner Robert Sinskey,
crafted on the site of an old barn in the Carneros district of Napa
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Sinskey built the rustic house while he was still
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why there was only one bedroom,'' albeit a large one,
Helm says, laughing and guiding guests up the open stairs from the
ground floor. That ground floor is essentially one large room, with
areas for cooking, dining and lounging.
</P>
<P>
   More upstairs rooms are under construction, as is a spacious
pantry behind the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a work in progress,'' Helm says. The kitchen,
however, is finished. And this is the room that defines Helm's home
and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Helm, the exacting chef, has made sure her home kitchen
equipment is as good as what she's used in top-flight restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new 60-inch Viking stove with six burners, griddle and
grill, all of which ``are in use all the time,'' she says. There is
the no-nonsense Euroflair Frigidaire refrigerator, backed up in the
pantry by a General Electric refrigerator wide enough to
accommodate sheet pans. There are three sinks, one equipped with a
large professional sprayer, and there is an eight-foot work island.
The kitchen is no longer all cement, as had been originally, but
has country pine cabinetry, with two enormous drawers ``which I
still have to organize,'' she confides.
</P>
<P>
   The island has been raised to 37 inches _ from the standard 34 _
because Helm and Sinskey are tall and because the height of the
cement floor has in effect been raised by the sturdy professional
rubber mats that soften its harsh impact on cooks' backs and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Radiant heat also provides comfort, and a stain finish makes the
flooring less industrial looking. The cement work counters are
stained, too, not with a commercial finish but as a result of their
everyday use for food preparation.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Helm, whose idea of a home kitchen is decidedly
not of the slick shelter magazine genre. State-of-the-art
appliances are integrated with old objects and materials _ genuine
antique and just plain recycled.
</P>
<P>
   There's a commodious old Irish cupboard, for example, with its
mottled green paint unretouched. The same goes for an Irish dairy
cabinet with grooves that once held milk pans; an English pine
baker's table and, in the living area, a large counter from a
butcher shop in France.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinskey winery on the Silverado Trail, just the other side
of the Napa Valley, has also yielded material for the owners' home,
like the large teak doors found a new life as cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Helm spends a fair amount of time at the winery, overseeing
cooking classes, special dinners and the menu offered in the
tasting room. ``Robert,'' she says of her husband, ``feels that
wine needs food'' _ specifically, his wife's kind of food.
</P>
<P>
   It's no quirk that Helm, a top-flight chef (she won national
acclaim at Sherman House in Pacific Heights before joining the
PlumpJack operation with its venues in San Francisco and Squaw
Valley), feels at home in the country. Her cooking reflects her
family's part-German heritage (``I love braised dishes'') and her
love of Italian and French peasant food.
</P>
<P>
   What Helm generally cooks at home is rustic, regional and
seasonal. It's the kind of food on which she plans to raise her
children _ she'd like future siblings for Emma Louise, ``a real
family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Helm has a good start on that part of her life's ambition. Emma
Louise _ who travels with Mom to work in the city, in the Sierras
and at the winery _ is such a laid-back baby that a couple of
future brothers or sisters isn't intimidating. And the Helm-Sinskey
home boasts the kind of kitchen that can well accommodate that
family.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE GOOD AND THE BAD OF THE NEW KITCHEN &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; P ut together the culinary sensitivities of a chef and the
trained eye of a photographer, and there isn't much chance that
their joint kitchen design would go awry.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that Maria Helm, executive chef of the
Plumpjack/Balboa cafes, and her husband, Robert Sinskey, winery
owner and professional photographer, find little _ if anything _
they would change in the kitchen of their home in Napa's Carneros
region.
</P>
<P>
   Sinskey ``framed'' every window in the house he built on the
site of an old barn behind a small farmhouse, which the couple use
as a guest house. So views from the kitchen _ and the rest of the
home _ make the most of the surrounding vineyards, trees and gently
rolling hills. They set the rural mood the couple aimed for in
their home.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights that Helm loves in her kitchen include:
</P>
<P>
   Lots of space _ ``much more than at PlumpJack in the city'' _
organized for maximum efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Her six-burner Viking stove with griddle and grill.
</P>
<P>
   A pantry refrigerator wide enough to accommodate sheet pans.
</P>
<P>
   A chain-hung rack over the work counter for drying herbs in
large bunches.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of wood _ much of it old _ in built-in cabinets and in
antiques such as an Irish kitchen cupboard and a French butcher's
counter.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling racks that can hold ingredients and finished dishes and
can also be rolled to the dining area as instant buffets.
</P>
<P>
   What she would change if she had to do it all over again:
</P>
<P>
   A bigger refrigerator near the stove and work counter.
</P>
<P>
   Even more storage space.
</P>
<P>
   The final word on kitchen design, she says: Your lifestyle and
cooking style, rather than current design trends, should determine
the look and feel of your kitchen.

RED WINE-BRAISED OXTAILS
</P>
<P>
   Helm serves this with homemade spaetzle. A commercial
small-shape pasta would also complement this saucy dish.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds meaty oxtails
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 stalks celery, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 large shallots, peeled and cut in medium dice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound small crimini mushrooms, stems cut even with tops
</P>
<P>
   2 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped, or 3/4 cup chopped
canned tomatoes such as Pomi brand
</P>
<P>
   4 cups dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf (fresh if available)
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs fresh thyme, or 2 teaspoons dried
</P>
<P>
   Chopped Italian parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan. Season the oxtails with salt
and pepper; add to the pan and brown on all sides. Add the carrots,
celery, shallots and mushrooms; cook over high heat until the
vegetables are golden.
</P>
<P>
   Add the tomatoes and wine, bring to a boil and cook over high
heat until liquids are reduced by three quarters. Add the bay leaf
and thyme and enough water to cover well. Bring to boil, then
reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 4 hours, checking
several times and adding more water if the meat is not covered by
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Check the meat for doneness. Adjust seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Serve over spaetzle or other noodles. Garnish with chopped
parsley.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, let the oxtails cool, then remove and discard
bones; return the meat to the broth.
</P>
<P>
   This dish reheats extremely well, and cooling also allows you to
remove excess fat from the broth.
</P>
<P>
   Served 4 to 6.

SPAETZLE
</P>
<P>
   Cookware shops carry spaetzle makers, but Helm says with a
little practice, you can make this German noodle in the simple,
old-fashioned way without special utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   13/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   Pinch nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten with 3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, salt, baking powder and nutmeg in a bowl.
Make a well in the center and add the beaten eggs, mixing well.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 20 minutes. The
batter should be elastic and thick.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large, shallow pot of salted water to a boil. Tilt the
dough bowl until the batter reaches the edge. Dip a small knife
into the boiling water and scrape off small pieces of dough,
sliding the knife along the edge of the bowl to ease dough pieces
into the water. The dough pieces will rise to the surface when they
are cooked; remove them with a slotted spoon and place in a warm
bowl. Or place them in ice-water, then drain and reserve for
reheating later by briefly sliding back into boiling water. Drain
well before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Variation:  &LR; 1/4 cup chopped fine herbs or chopped truffle peel
may be added to the batter; the finished spaetzle may be drizzled
with truffle oil.

ESCAROLE &AMP; ENDIVE SALAD WITH BOSC PEARS
</P>
<P>
   For a heartier version, blue cheese may be crumbled over the
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 small head escarole
</P>
<P>
   2 heads Belgian endive
</P>

   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Wash the greens and drain well. Tear the escarole into
bite-sized pieces and place in a salad bowl. Cut the endive in half
and remove the core. Slice crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Add to
the salad bowl, along with the pears and walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle with walnut oil and toss. Season with salt, pepper and
sugar; toss again. Add the vinegar and toss once more. Adjust
seasonings to taste.

ALSATIAN APPLE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   This cake has a crumbly texture and rich taste. It's
particularly good served with warm caramel sauce and French vanilla
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 Fuji or other firm apples (about 31/2 pounds), peeled,
cored and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces butter
</P>
<P>
   2 cups panko or other dry breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Grease (or coat with cooking
spray) an 8-inch springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the apples, sugar, water, lemon juice and cinnamon stick
in a saucepan. Cover and cook until the apples are soft but not
mushy. Uncover the pan during the last few minutes of cooking until
the liquid evaporates. Discard the cinnamon stick. Stir in the
vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the crumbs, stirring until
well mixed. Add the ground cinnamon and brown sugar; heat,
stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle a third of crumb mixture over the bottom of the
springform pan. Top with half of the apples, then sprinkle with
half of the remaining crumbs. Make a final layer of apples and top
with the remaining crumbs. Pat smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 45 minutes, until the crumbs are golden.
</P>
<P>
   Cool on a rack, then loosen the edges of the pan and remove the
rim. Cut the cake into wedges (it will be crumbly) and serve with
caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream, if desired.

OSCARS: PLENTY OF BOMBS WERE DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Never badmouth the Academy Awards. Never call
them stuffy, or predictable, or dull. Never say they honor
big-wallet, safe-vanilla moviemaking over little-wallet films with
big ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Never say the Academy doesn't have a sense of humor, can't
muster the courage to give best picture to a comedy and won't give
a best actor award to a guy with jubilantly bad English.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say those things. At least, not today.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you like in any other year (particularly 1991, the age
of the ``Dances with Wolves'' debacle), but the 1999 version of the
venerable awards show was surprising to the point of post-traumatic
shock.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the '98 broadcast, a politely bloated coronation
ceremony for ``Titanic'' and its self-dubbed ``King of the World,''
James Cameron, Sunday's affair looked like a riot. No one threw any
Molotov cocktails, but plenty of bombs were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of them was dropped by ``Shakespeare in Love,''
which became the first comedy to win best picture since ``Annie
Hall'' _ released in 1977, as in the Jimmy Carter administration,
as in 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden's literate, passionate flight of fancy triumphed
over the logical favorite, Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' a towering war saga that earned boodles at the box office
and critical raves to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Why did ``Shakespeare'' win? Was it ``Ryan's'' gore?
``Shakespeare's'' romance? The doublets? The dog? Miramax's
megabucks Oscar campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say, but it was probably the words. There's a mad beauty
to Tom Stoppard's screenplay that recalls, if not mimics,
Shakespeare's barmiest dialogue. It's brainy, goofy and crisp, a
``Dumb and Dumber'' for frustrated English majors.
</P>
<P>
   And, like ``Annie Hall'' before it, ``Shakespeare in Love'' is a
comedy with a meaty dramatic core; it's about something. It's deep.
Academy members could vote for it without feeling lightweight or
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   So they did. And ``Shakespeare in Love'' beat ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' And, lo, the people were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy performed a few other stunning maneuvers Sunday
night. For one thing, it gave directing honors to a filmmaker
(Spielberg) whose movie lost in the best picture category _ a feat
that last occurred in 1990 (technically, the 1989 awards), when
``Driving Miss Daisy'' won best picture, but Oliver Stone won best
director for ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Such splits occur when voters admire a director's work but don't
quite enjoy it enough to give it best picture. Or maybe they occur
when voters are feeling indecisive and squishy. Nothing happened as
planned Sunday night. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone think Roberto Benigni had a microscopic smudge of a
chance to win best actor? No. And did he? Yes. Benigni had two
major strikes against him: One, he's a comedian. Two, his film,
``Life is Beautiful,'' is in subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this is not to say that the Academy has any obvious bias
against Italian funnymen, but face it: The best actor award has
never gone to a man in a foreign-language film. Never. Sophia Loren
won the 1961 best actress award, for her performance in Vittorio De
Sica's ``Two Women,'' but no male counterpart had ever before
managed the same trick. And Loren's wasn't a comic role.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are, on a closer look, a few extraordinary
similarities _ beyond the fact that they're both Italian.
(Coincidentally, Loren presented Benigni's foreign-film Oscar.)
``Two Women'' is set during World War II; ``Life is Beautiful'' is
set during World War II. ``Two Women'' follows a mother (Loren) as
she attempts to shield her daughter from the horrors of wartime;
``Life is Beautiful'' follows a father (Benigni) as he attempts to
shield his son from the horrors of wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni's film is indeed a comedy, and his performance is
unquestionably funny, but that's not all it is. Set against the
Holocaust, the movie is a deftly gentle commentary on parental
love; it is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious, worthy of
comparison with Chaplin's silent work.
</P>
<P>
   It defies categorizing. So does ``Shakespeare in Love.'' So does
Spielberg's directing award. And so, for once, does Oscar.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Buyers Flock to Berkeley Poultry Shop  
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 BERKELEY, Calif. _  Once upon a time, Oakland was dotted with
family-owned poultry markets where a customer could walk in, cast a
critical eye upon the pecking chickens, choose the one that met his
or her standards and have it butchered out back. Today, markets
that butcher on site are as scarce as hens' teeth, but one shop in
Berkeley, Magnani Poultry, is an offshoot of what was typical in
the early part of this century.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Magnani Poultry, which purveyed additive-free poultry and
meats before it was politically correct, there is still the sense
of catering to the customer's needs. You can buy 100 pounds of
beef, 100 roasted chickens _ or just one egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bone anything at no extra charge,'' says Sharon Magnani
McCormick, ``give free chicken bones for soup and, except for
during Thanksgiving week, will roast any bird to order.''
</P>
<P>
   Some customers buy chicken feet for soup and ask for the
toenails trimmed. ``We do it,'' she says, laughing. ``Magnani is
known for customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magnani name has been trusted in the East Bay for poultry
and meat since 1917, when McCormick's grandfather, Alberto Magnani,
and his four brothers opened Magnani Bros. at a public market in
Oakland. The business wholesaled and retailed fresh-killed chicken,
turkey and duck.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick's father, Atilio (``Babe''), rejoined the family
business after World War II and then worked at Hayward Poultry in
Oakland, his mother-in-law's market. ``Both sides of my family had
chicken shops even before they came here from Lucca, Italy,''
McCormick says.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, Atilio opened his own wholesale-retail shop,
Magnani Poultry, on College Avenue in Oakland, where he built a
fiercely loyal clientele and attracted more family to the business
_ his grandsons, Tim and Terry McCormick, who ran the shop after
Atilio retired in 1984. Terry died in 1990, and Sharon McCormick, a
former reporter for The Chronicle, her husband and their two
daughters joined the business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to what McCormick calls ``a great staff,'' there is
usually at least one family member helping customers in the small,
narrow, no-frills storefront in Berkeley that is nearly taken up by
meat counter on one side and dry-goods shelves on the opposite.
Red-framed family photos hang on the wall behind the counter, and
brightly colored wood roosters and hens perch here and there.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick's sons opened the Berkeley shop in 1985 because they
saw an opportunity in the area. They closed the College Avenue shop
last year after the 1991 Oakland Hills fire contributed to a steady
loss of business, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were angry when we closed in Oakland,'' McCormick says,
smiling. ``They saw it as their place. And we are more than a shop.
Our customers are like friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends who are hungry to buy. Magnani sells 2,500 fresh turkeys
the week of Thanksgiving. Regulars know that means a line out the
door, a greeting before you step inside and an organized plan for
picking up orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, one customer told me she had a book with her and
was all prepared for the wait,'' McCormick says.
</P>
<P>
   Easter and Passover are another busy season for Magnani, with
roasters and lamb big sellers for Passover, and ham and lamb for
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round strong sellers are the chicken sausages made by Tim
(10 varieties) and the house rotisserie chickens seasoned three
ways. (Top seller: ``original barbecue'' with Italian herbs.) The
turkeys and chickens come from Fulton Valley in Sonoma County;
organic chicken comes from Hoffman Game Birds in Manteca.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the family added meats to the selling roster,
including Harris Ranch beef, pork from Iowa and lamb from a Sonoma
County producer.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick foresees the family's presence in Magnani's future.
Her children are the fourth generation to be involved, and her
teen-age grandson _ the fifth generation _ pitches in during
holidays. McCormick forsees an increase in prepared items for
takeout, such as stuffed flank steak and kebabs _ ``value-added''
items that are ready for busy customers to cook at home.

 CHRON   Would You Like a Side of Flies With That?  
 Celebrity Bug Chef Will Buzz Into Museum  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  On Friday night, David George Gordon will point
his car north from Santa Cruz, where he'll have put a positive spin
on cockroaches for a museum group, and head to the Exploratorium in
San Francisco for one of the insect activities he likes best:
cooking them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; st  &LR;  Then he'll eat them. And he'll invite anyone who cares to
to join him this weekend in the museum's makeshift Green Frog Cafe,
created for the event, ``Eat Your Own Frog Food.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a naturalist and free-lance writer in Port Townsend,
Wash., used to be a vegetarian but expanded his culinary horizons
while working at an aquarium in Tacoma. The showcase creatures
weren't the fish, which were mostly drab brown, but the undersea
invertebrates. By extension Gordon became interested in the
invertebrates' insect cousins.
</P>
<P>
   As he learned about bugs, he discovered that they're not just
frog food _ they're people food throughout much of the world
because they're plentiful and nutritious. But in Europe and much of
North America, they're viewed as pests and crop destroyers, not
food. However, there are some U.S. entomophagists _ bug eaters _
and they gather to indulge. In mid-June, they dine at a museum
event in New Orleans; in August, at a natural-science museum in
Raleigh, N.C. Many network through ``Food Insect News,'' published
by Montana State University. And many have found new ways to serve
bugs in Gordon's 33-recipe ``The Eat-a-Bug Cookbook'' (Ten Speed
Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has become a celebrity bug chef, cooking recently for
Regis Philbin and Kathy Lee Gifford and feeding grasshoppers to
actor George Hamilton, whom he called ``an adventurous eater
because he's been around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Because arthropod entrees are light and served in small
portions, Gordon recommends accompanying them with several salads
and side dishes, with and without bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Wash them down with wine, he says: Pinot Gris with delicately
flavored dragonflies, fruity Sauvignon Blanc with woodsy-tasting
crickets. Broiled centipedes call for Zinfandel or an Australian
Shiraz, but heavier wines, such as Merlot, tend to overwhelm a bug
meal.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Gordon at home, where he writes science
articles about sea life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How do you deal with bugs' ickiness factor? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some people are genuinely enthusiastic about eating bugs. But an
incredible number of people on our planet have bug phobias.
</P>
<P>
   I love it, though, when someone tastes something I've cooked and
says, ``Not bad.'' The thing about bugs for most people who don't
like them is the crunch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What's tastiest? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My favorites are wax worms. They're considered a pest by
beekeepers, because they eat the wax in honeycombs. Wax worms out
of the box are great, sort of sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Crickets have a very mild shrimplike flavor. They're a good bug
for starting out because they're available all year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How do you develop recipes? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recipes come from indigenous cultures. Some of the
other ones I pretty much made up on the spot. But some basics about
bugs are universal, like using a wok and not overcooking them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Do bugs have nutritional value? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dried grasshoppers have something like six times more protein
than beef ounce for ounce. Crickets are rich in calcium, so they
might benefit people who have osteoporosis. Termites are rich in
iron.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Do you catch your own ingredients? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some things, I do _ dragonflies, for example. But I try to steer
people away from collecing their own bugs to eat. There are
endangered insects. And I tell people who do collect insects to do
it away from civilization, because you don't know about bug sprays.
Even if you're an organic gardener, your neighbor might use bug
sprays, and then the bugs crawl into your yard.
</P>
<P>
   I mail-order bugs that are raised for consumption. My favorite
supplier is in North Carolina (Carolina Biological Supply Co., 2700
York Road, Burlington, NC 27215; 800-334-5551). You can get about
3,000 crickets shipped to your home for about $30. You can specify
the growth stage; I like them about 5 weeks old, before they have
wings. About 250 crickets make up a cup for a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Is there anyone who shouldn't eat bugs? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you know you're allergic to shellfish, it's probably not a
good idea to eat bugs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What's up for the Exploratorium visit? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I'll talk a little about insect-eating in other cultures but
mostly about food frogs would eat. Then I'll make Scorpion
Scaloppine, and we'll have Orthopteran Orzo (made with young
crickets) and Wax Worm and White Chocolate Cookies. Not everyone
will get to try the scaloppine, but there should be enough orzo and
cookies for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
GO BITE A BUG
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Dine like frogs do at ``Eat Your Own Frog Food,'' at 1 p.m. and at
3:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday ( &LR; 3-27, 3-28 &LR; ) at the Exploratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Naturalist David George Gordon, author of ``The Eat-a-Bug
Cookbook'' (Ten Speed Press, 1998), will explain what frogs and
toads enjoy eating, then will give attendees the opportunity to
sample Scorpion Scaloppine, Orthopteran Orzo, and Waxworm and White
Chocolate Cookies. All the critters are commercially raised for
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is part of the museum's exhibit ``Frogs,''
running through September 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Exploratorium is inside the Palace of Fine Arts at 3601 Lyon
St., San Francisco. Admission to the cooking demonstration is free
with regular museum admission. For information, call (415)
561-0360.

 CHRON   Crusty Banh Mi Sandwiches Nourish a Nation  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ The food that fuels much of daily life in Vietnam
is a very cheap, very French sandwich.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Schoolkids, taxi drivers, bureaucrats and budget-minded tourists
alike share an affinity for banh mi, the casual name for a short,
yeasty baguette packed with vegetables and meat.
</P>
<P>
   Banh mi translates literally to French bread, but the phrase has
evolved to describe a particular sort of baguette sandwich sold
from carts and shops in almost every Vietnamese community. Vendors
set up early to catch the breakfast trade, and they sell into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Usually three-quarters wrapped in plain white paper so buyers
can see the variety of fillings, the sandwiches sell quickly. And
why not? They generally cost less than a U.S. quarter and offer a
quick, portable opportunity to sample the blend of French and Asian
styles that comprise modern Vietnamese cooking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vietnam War forced many Vietnamese to emigrate in the
1970s, they brought their bahn mi with them to the United States.
Now the French-Vietnamese hybrid is a common snack in urban centers
with strong Vietnamese communities, including San Francisco, San
Jose and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Bread is the key, says Tony Ton, who works at a Vietnamese
seafood restaurant on Larkin Street, the epicenter of San
Francisco's banh mi shops. Ton's restaurant doesn't serve the
sandwiches, so at least once a week he ventures to one of a handful
of places nearby that specialize in them.
</P>
<P>
   He likes his baguette soft and not warmed, but he is in the
minority. Most banh mi shops will heat the rolls in little toaster
ovens, before or after the meat is layered. A bit of unsalted
butter or, more likely, thick mayonnaise is spread on one side.
Some places will add a sweet mixture that falls somewhere between
hoisin and ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Often, some of the soft inner bread is pulled out, leaving more
room for the heart of the sandwich _ the meat. Traditional
Vietnamese have a taste for a soft, lightly spiced pork liver
pat &LR; e &LR; , which might be spread on one side of the bread as part of
the standard package.
</P>
<P>
   Most places offer a choice of meats. The mark of a good sandwich
shop, connoisseurs say, is one that roasts its own chicken or pork
and makes its own pate.
</P>
<P>
   Common picks include dense pork meatballs (xiu mai), roast pork
(mi thit), barbecued chicken (mi ga), liver pat &LR; e &LR;  (pate gan) or
cha lua, a dish often translated to ``special pork'' or ``fancy
pork'' _ a sort of processed pork loaf whose flavor might be a
stretch for Western tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables are the final flourish. Sandwiches feature shredded
carrot, raw or barely blanched. Sometimes the carrot is mixed with
thinly sliced white onion or shredded daikon. A handful of cilantro
is stuffed in, along with thin slices of fresh jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the international amalgam, shake some Maggi sauce over
the whole thing. The Swiss condiment _ sort of a European soy sauce
_ was another culinary transplant brought by the French to Vietnam
and, finally, to America by the Vietnamese.

N.Y. BANKS SAY THEY ARE READY FOR THE NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.199 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The biggest threat of the year 2000 on banks is
not a computer breakdown or a power outage, experts say. Instead,
it's the possibility of bank runs and public panic at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nine months before Y2K, one of the biggest concerns
is scam artists getting hold of customers' account numbers by
preying on their fears of Y2K, witnesses told a state legislative
panel Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While some Y2K doomsayers think the nation's banks will not
survive past New Year's Eve, experts said 97 percent of banks in
the country have made great progress toward preparing their
computers for the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry appears well on its way to Y2K compliance,''
Michael Smith, president of the New York Bankers Association, told
the state Senate Committee on Banks and the Senate Committee on
Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K refers to the problem many computers have accepting 2000 in
programs. Some, instead, will assume the new date is 1900, causing
computers to crash or come up with faulty data. It is expected that
fixing computers in both government and industry will cost hundreds
of billions of dollars, including $9 billion for banks.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is a problem the banking industry has been working on since
the mid-1990s, said John F. Carter, deputy regional director of the
New York office of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Of 16,000 banks in the U.S. he said, only two-tenths of 1
percent are considered to have unacceptable Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has lost a penny in an FDIC deposit in our 66-year
history,'' he said. ``Y2K will not change this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But some bank customers have lost thousands of dollars in a
recent Y2K scam, said Elizabeth McCaul, acting superintendent of
banks at the state Banking Department.
</P>
<P>
   McCaul declined to say where the scams took place. But now,
banks all over the state are starting to warn their customers about
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Someone calls a customer, purporting to
work for the customer's bank. The caller tells the customer the
bank is not able to get its accounts Y2K-compliant by the end of
the year and wants to get permission to transfer the customer's
funds to a special Y2K-safe bond account. To do that, the caller
needs the customer's account number.
</P>
<P>
   With the account number, of course, it's a simple matter for the
caller to empty customers' savings before they catch on.
</P>
<P>
   McCaul said customers should be wary of discussing finances with
any stranger. But they should continue to have faith in the banking
system, even small banks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before anyone heard of Y2K, all banks, large and small, have
had contingency plans in place for natural disasters like fires,
floods, tornadoes and earthquakes,'' she said. ``Just think back to
the ice storm in the North Country last winter. Small banks were
among the first to open.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks are letting their customers know about their progress by
distributing handouts with monthly statements. Some banks are also
making contingency plans like buying generators and cellular phones
in case power goes out for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Robinson, president and CEO of Cohoes Savings Bank, said
his bank is in the midst of planning for its worst-case Y2K
scenario. No bank employees will be allowed to take days off during
the last week of 1999 and the first week of 2000. In addition, one
branch office will soon practice a day of banking without
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like they used to do it,'' he said after the hearing. ``This
bank survived for 140 years without computers. We think we can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While banks are encouraging customers not to take out more money
than they would need for a long weekend, the Federal Reserve will
release to local banks an extra $50 billion in cash, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the FDIC has 1,400 examiners in the process of auditing
banks to determine how ready they are for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said most banks will be finished testing their computer
programs by the end of March and will be ready for the last stage
of Y2K compliance _ coming up with contingency plans and making
sure the computers can interface with the rest of the world.

THE END OF PAPER IRS TAX RETURNS MAY BE COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The days of slaving over tax returns with pencil
and paper appear to be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internal Revenue Service and Congress have their way, all
of the nation's 200 million tax returns will be filed
electronically _ via computer or telephone _ within a decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS started its electronic filing system, or e-filing, in
the early 1990s with successful pilot programs. Now it has spread
nationwide, with millions of people signing on each year.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 25 million people filed electronically for 1997, paying
$1.6 trillion in taxes to Uncle Sam and getting $52 billion in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   In the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act last year, Congress
mandated that 80 percent of all tax returns must be filed
electronically by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   To help reach that goal, the IRS has launched a national ad
campaign in all media. Its slogan: ``Click. Zip. Fast Round Trip.''
</P>
<P>
   One poster reads: ``Hey, you'd have your refund at home by
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most taxpayers who e-file do so through one of 73,000 ``e-file
providers,'' which are accounting firms and other tax preparers
authorized by the IRS. Consumers also can e-file via personal
computer with tax software such as TurboTax, MacInTax or SecureTax.
Still others file their returns by touch-tone telephone _ if they
have incomes under $50,000 and no dependents.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of pluses to e-filing, according to the IRS and
the growing number of CPAs, enrolled agents and other tax preparers
who love the system.
</P>
<P>
   For the IRS, it cuts down on mountains of paperwork. Tax
officials say it's more expensive now to process electronic returns
than paper returns, but the costs will shrink drastically once
everyone starts e-filing.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, e-filing eases the pain of tax preparation.
</P>
<P>
   If Uncle Sam owes you a refund, it comes quickly, within two to
three weeks. In contrast, paper tax returns take six to nine weeks
to process before a refund check is mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers who owe the government money can pay electronically
from their checking or savings account, by credit or debit card
(MasterCard, American Express or Discover) or by check or money
order.
</P>
<P>
   People who e-file also make fewer mistakes. Since they often use
tax preparation software, their error rate of 1 percent is much
lower than the 20 percent rate for paper filings. That means less
contact with the dreaded tax man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wins here,'' said Larry Wright, an IRS spokesman in
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While the IRS hails e-filing as the wave of the future, there's
still debate in the tax and accounting field over its merits.
</P>
<P>
   Some tax pros praise e-filing, saying it streamlines their work
and makes clients happy. One accountant said his clientele has
grown 20 percent a year since he began filing their returns by
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marvelous thing that eliminates so much unnecessary
inputting and processing,'' said John Stoller, head of John D.
Stoller CPA Inc. in Encino, Calif., and a big cheerleader for
e-filing who speaks often on the topic at seminars. ``My clients
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are leery of e-filing at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tax preparers who wish to sign up with the IRS as authorized
e-file providers must go through a credit check, fingerprinting and
a criminal background check. Intended or not, this process has a
chilling effect, according to Mary Kay Foss at Marzluft, Giles,
Tulis &AMP; Foss CPAs Inc. in Danville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It's also costly for some older accounting firms, which must
upgrade their technology by buying new computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants who use special tax preparation software for IRS
e-filing also must pay the software firms a fee ranging from $2 to
$9 per return.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle for tax preparers and their corporate clients:
While 2 million businesses e-filed last year through the Electronic
Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), many more have shied away from
it.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons? Not all complex business returns can be filed
electronically with the IRS at this point. Corporate bureaucracies
and their technology systems have been slow to deal with the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Many also fear that electronic filing may make them easier
targets for IRS audits because their financial data are fed
instantly to the IRS. By contrast, it takes several long weeks for
thousands of workers to enter millions of paper tax returns into
IRS databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appear to be a lot of barriers to acceptance among
CPAs,'' said Curt Olsen, a spokesman for the California Society of
CPAs in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the IRS is happy to let the popularity of e-filing grow
each year through its splashy marketing campaign and positive
word-of-mouth among tax professionals and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has no plans yet to use a big hammer _ tax
penalties and sanctions of some sort _ to compel people to file
electronically, IRS official Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of technology is the biggest bugaboo for the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing studies show that most taxpayers still are wary of
using computers for personal finance. The IRS's goal is to develop
services so cheap, simple and secure that people will prefer
e-filing to snail mail.

ADOPTIVE PARENTS SURMOUNT ROADBLOCKS TO A NEW FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERFORD, N.Y. _ A month ago they were in a Siberian orphanage,
their most valued possessions the photo albums the three sisters
each slept with. The duplicate collections depicted the home and
faces of a New York couple seeking to become their adopted parents.
</P>
<P>
   This week the girls were sprawled wide-eyed on the carpeted
floor of the living room in the home of Don and Cathy Dessureau,
giggling repeatedly as they pushed a miniature white-gowned doll on
a plastic replica of Cinderella's castle.
</P>
<P>
   Blue lights from the castle towers shone on the radiant faces of
Lena, 11, Katrina, 9, and Genia, 7. The sounds of ``Here Comes The
Bride'' poured from the toy's interior.
</P>
<P>
   For the three sisters, as well as the Dessureaus, this was
indeed a fairy tale come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally we have our lives back again,'' said Don Dessureau,
his eyes welling with tears. ``Once again, we have a family.''
</P>
<P>
   For the girls, who speak almost no English, the need for a bit
of magic is obvious. They had been transported from one of the
harshest places on Earth, where many people have no running water
or electricity and many live in log cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Now they were in the magical kingdom of America, a yellow ranch
house filled with the comfortable trappings of the unpretentious.
The childrens' rooms are overpopulated with Barbie dolls, Teddy
bears and other cuddly wonders. At the orphanage their only toys
were those they made themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, as judged by the various agencies in the United
States and Russia, it's a place where the girls have finally found
the most precious gift of all _ a mother and father who love them.
</P>
<P>
   The Dessureaus, who live in Waterford, a town north of Albany,
had been living in a world of desolation and deprivation not as
immediately apparent. They were looking to adopt to fill a void
created a year ago Easter when they lost their only son David, 13,
in an accident in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had to do something with our lives, and do it
fast,'' said Cathy, a homemaker, ``because if we didn't we were
going to die.'' They ended up at Children at Heart in
Mechanicville, whose proprietors, Janice and Mark Bergeron, have
now adopted five children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The price of adoption can be high. Janice Bergeron, an attorney,
said the cost for adopting a young child from Russia, the country
in which they specialize, is roughly $23,000. It can be
significantly less for older children. Both the agency and
Dessureaus declined to discuss how much was spent in this case.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, while thumbing through one of the countless
photo albums they had seen at numerous agencies, Cathy Dessureau
saw a picture of the three girls. She called her husband at work
and he came to look at the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked in their eyes,'' said Don, who is safety manager for
a trucking company, ``and I had a feeling inside of me that those
children needed us as much as we needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   They had originally intended to adopt two children. But the
three girls had requested they be adopted only as a group or not at
all. And that was consistent with both the regulations in Russia
and with the Dessureaus' sense of what was right.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a time of paperwork and waiting and stress
that Cathy Dessureau describes as reminiscent of the pain of
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already felt love for these girls, and to think maybe we
wouldn't get them was very painful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news came in late January, and on Feb. 18 the
Dessureaus left for their two-day, 19-hour series of flights to
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   At the orphanage, a clean, well-run brick building, the whole
staff was at the door to meet them. And after taking the couple on
a tour, they were seated in the office and the girls were brought
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were holding each other's hands, looking up at us, and
then looking down. We stared at each other for about 20 minutes,''
Don Dessureau said. ``And then we hugged and I said to myself, `Now
the dream is coming true.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a few days getting acquainted, they were approved to come
home to America. But first, the new parents took their three
daughters out for ice cream _ the first time ever for the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week they were attending the nearby Waterford-Halfmoon
school where they are in the first, third and fourth grades,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   They communicate mostly with sign language, but are quickly
amassing a vocabulary that includes ``drink,'' ``thank you'' and
``Papa.'' But the orphanage had provided them with a solid
educational background, and, Cathy beams proudly, ``they are
already getting A's in math.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And on a recent evening, the sound of their laughter and the
padding of their feet as they ran shoeless from the living room to
a downstairs family room filled the Dessureau household.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooking the scene is a picture of the couple's late son, and
in a nearby shelf, an urn with his ashes.
</P>
<P>
   David had begged his parents to take him to Russia since the
time he attended school in nearby Maplewood with its large
Ukrainian community.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents think he has had a hand in what followed. They note
that Katrina's birthday is the same as David's but a different
year. Genia's birthday is the day David died. The passports on
which the girls came to America were stamped with the same day that
David was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've been guided in all this,'' said Cathy softly,
``both by David and from up above.''

S.F. PANHANDLERS MAY GET HAND-HELD ATM MACHINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS +
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A proposal to give panhandlers hand-held
machines that accept ATM or credit cards is getting a mixed
reaction from both Mayor Willie Brown and his homelessness
coordinator, Terry Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, called the Benevolending Box Program, is the
brainchild of Karen Gatter, president of Solutions 2000, a company
she founded to address social issues. She hopes to find investors
and form a public-private partnership that will raise money for
shelters and aid the individuals who raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   Gatter would provide the ATM- credit card machines to homeless
people, who would keep 20 percent of the donations they received
and give 80 percent to shelters and other community homeless
programs. A share of the homeless person's 20 percent would help
pay the costs of that person's stay at a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Gatter said she believes the concept will work because ``a lot
of people want to donate to homelessness but don't feel there's a
way to do it without causing harm to the person. This way the money
goes directly to the shelter, and the homeless person gets a
percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a Band-Aid solution,'' Gatter said. ``What
we're looking at is creating a means for homeless people to sustain
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatter's idea sits on the drawing board as she searches for
support from officials, nonprofit agencies and potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the city's leading homeless advocates calls the idea
bizarre and says the positive response from the mayor is a slap at
those working for genuine, permanent solutions to homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, meanwhile, says he likes the concept of an ATM-type
machine that would accept donations aiding the homeless, but
questions putting the machines in the hands of panhandlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supportive with conditions,'' Hill said. ``We don't want
to endorse any program that pushes panhandling. . . . We like the
machines with merchants on counters so people can make
contributions (to homeless programs) with purchases. But creating
portable ATMs for homeless people to solicit money needs some
thinking through.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 28 letter, the mayor stopped short of endorsing the
part of the plan that would have homeless people soliciting
donations on the streets. He said that particular idea ``requires a
broader policy discussion, which we are eagerly prepared to enter
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said one of the problems city officials have with the
proposal is security regarding the use of a debit card.
</P>
<P>
   But Gatter said technology and fingerprinting might eliminate
those fears. Plus, ``the people soliciting funds will be high-level
individuals who have already passed security system checks. This is
an incentive for people to get toward the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   The program would reward people as they raised money and offer
incentives _ such as their own bank account _ to raise more.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares Gatter's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think there's a couple of levels where it's just
bizarre,'' said Paul Boden of the Coalition on Homelessness, who
noted that some supervisors are searching for ways to get
panhandlers off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Boden said the proposal is a slap in the face to advocates and
service providers who are trying to come up with permanent
solutions to homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you get some business person that calls Terry Hill,
sends a memo and dangles money in front of the mayor's office to
have homeless people solicit with debit cards and graduate them in
a class system of shelter programs,'' Boden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (idea) seems to bring in more panhandlers to raise more
money to open more shelters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Brown said he supports the concept, adding, ``We
are committed to help in the development of this unique homeless
mentoring and shelter fund-raising program during the appropriate
phase.''

GAY RIGHTS ADVOCATES TARGET STATES FOR ACTION, AVOID WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Adopting the ``all politics is local''
philosophy, gay rights activists say they are increasingly turning
to state legislatures over Washington power brokers in pushing
their civil rights agendas.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the national weeklong ``Equality Begins at Home''
rally that began Monday, activists plan to converge upon the
capitals of all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   In Bismarck, N.D., the return to local politicking showed up in
the formation of a new gay and lesbian lobbying group. In Hartford,
Conn., it was a rainbowed flag _ symbolizing tolerance for people
of all stripes and colors _ flying over the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   And in Albany, it was 150 activists from across New York pepping
themselves up to talk to their local lawmakers about several
legislative priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we want?'' state Sen. Tom Duane, D, asked the crowd
gathered in the Empire State Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equality!'' they boomed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When do we want it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now!'' they cried.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan battles in the nation's capital have fueled a growing
frustration with federal lawmakers by gay activists who believe
they have a better chance of being heard closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing much more on state legislatures _ it's totally
where the action is,'' said Urvashi Vaid, policy institute director
of the Manhattan-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
``Washington is important, but frankly it'll be our state capitals
where we'll win our civil rights. Washington will not lead.
Congress will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year in Albany, two of the three state government
power brokers have moved on a top gay-rights legislative priority _
a bias-crime bill that would heighten penalties for crimes
committed against people specifically because of their race,
religion, gender, sexuality or other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Democratic-led Assembly and Republican Gov. George
Pataki have proposed to enact a hate-crime bill; the GOP-led Senate
is the last missing link.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R, has repeatedly opposed
hate crime legislation, expressing concern over targeting the
motive behind a crime rather than the offense. Recently, however,
Bruno has seemed more open to allowing the legislation to go to a
vote in his chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bruno will be able to convince some of his chamber's
conservative members to support a bias-crime bill, however, is
another story.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Frank Padavan, for example, is ``opposed to the
bill the gay pride agenda is backing,'' said his spokesman, Ed
DeCosmo. Padavan ``agrees with Senator Bruno in that the penalty
should fit the crime _ not the motive.''

CAMPUS COURTS ON TRIAL FOR RELENTLESS JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In these courtrooms, defendants neither have the
right to face their accusers nor have an attorney present.
Furthermore, the proceedings are secret, but the verdicts are not.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the conditions under which university student conduct
courts are allowed to mete out justice on campuses, dealing with
matters ranging from cheating to accusations of major felonies.
</P>
<P>
   College judicial courts go where civilian law enforcement fears
to tread, their critics say, handling often convoluted, politically
charged cases on issues like date rape and sexual harassment behind
close doors and without legal training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are kangaroo courts everywhere, on every campus,'' said
Ashwani Prabhakar, president of the Student Association at the
State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most controversial use of student courts is in the
area of date rape, where youth and the preponderance of binge
drinking make the issue all the more complicated on a college
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Critics span the ideological spectrum. Women's groups and rape
prevention centers have alleged that female students are pressured
by administrators into using the in-house courts to keep damaging
publicity out of the public eye. Conservatives and civil
libertarians say the courts trample on the rights of the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Pavela, an administrator at the University of Maryland and
a scholar of student conduct courts, said the federal government
encourages universities to investigate rape cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks are asking us to do what the larger society has not done
well, which is to prosecute cases of acquaintance rape where
drinking is involved,'' Pavela said. Prosecutors ``won't touch
these cases. So it's left to colleges to resolve these very
convoluted situations.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case challenging these campus courts, the Rensselaer
Society of Engineers has filed suit in New York state court against
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The society is suing because, it
claims, it didn't receive justice from the campus tribunal that
suspended the fraternity two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though the case, which involves a strip show at a house ``rush''
event, is less weighty than many of the cases critics point to, the
RPI lawsuit opens a window on the secret world of campus justice.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Rensselaer group invited strippers to its 1997
rush, the 132-year-old fraternity was already in hot water with the
RPI administration.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity had been put on probation in 1995 after strippers
played topless volleyball outside the house. The probation was
twice extended _ once for loud partying, and another time when an
underage student was given alcohol at a party.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1997 rush event, which 100 freshman attended, the
fraternity contracted with an exotic dance company. The fraternity
did not allow alcohol at the event. After the main performance was
over, three dancers invited students to join them on stage.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the university alleges the
strippers simulated sex acts with one another; one student, not a
fraternity member, paid $40 to join them onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, a female student overheard two men talking
about the event and reported it to the dean of students.
</P>
<P>
   The case was heard before the Greek-Student Judicial board and
appealed to the Review Board _ which includes faculty, staff and
students _ and finally to RPI's then-President R. Byron Pipes, also
a defendant in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity was put on suspension for 18 months, but now may
not be able to function on campus until 2003. The fraternity said
the university tried to make an example of it at a time when many
universities are closing or scaling back their Greek programs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the university said the fraternity violated the state
penal code, no criminal charges were sought in the case. And in
court papers filed in Albany, the fraternity said actions at their
party did not reach the level of a violation of student conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators disagreed. A lawyer for RPI, Jeffrey Armstrong,
said the ``sordid behavior'' added to a ``pattern of misconduct''
that was indeed disruptive to the campus' educational mission.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to reverse the suspension and to overturn two
other measures suggested by the university: one that would force
the fraternity to get a live-in adviser and another requiring the
fraternity to apply for national status.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling favorable to the fraternity, state Supreme Court
Justice George B. Ceresia said in September that the Rensselaer
Society of Engineers raised ``a question of whether there is
substantial evidence to support the determination of the
university.'' He then sent the case to the Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court.

<P>
   Critics like Alan Kors and Harvey Silverglate, authors of ``The
Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses,''
believe universities, through the unchecked use of such tribunals
and the discipline they impose, have introduced a new right not
accepted in the courts: the right not to be offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claim is not that they did something to a female student
on campus,'' said Silverglate, a Boston attorney and self-described
liberal.
</P>
<P>
   University administrators say that critics are confusing its
internal justice system with criminal courts, and say that the
tribunals function more like arbitrations in a private corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an administrative process,'' RPI spokesman Eddie
Knowles said. ``It allows us to operate in a way that is
educational rather than punitive.''

FBI AGENTS IDENTIFY ONE VICTIM IN CALIFORNIA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and VICKIE HADDOCK +
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BARN, Calif. _ Authorities have identified one of two
charred bodies found in the trunk of a burned-out car in this
mountain hamlet as that of missing sightseer Carole Sund but are
still searching for the missing third person.
</P>
<P>
   Sund's body, burned beyond recognition, was identified through
dental charts, according to Tuolumne County Sheriff Dick Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   A second body found in the trunk was not identified. Officials
said that they may have to use DNA testing to complete the
identification, and that it could take at least several days.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news of the whereabouts of a third member of the
sightseeing trio, who have been missing since Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sund's parents, Francis and Carole Carrington, spoke briefly
Monday after their daughter was identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like a nightmare that you never wake up from,''
said Carole Carrington, dry-eyed but clearly stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, of Eureka, Calif., along with her daughter,
Julie, 15, and Silvina Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend from
Argentina, were last traced by investigators to Cedar Lodge in El
Portal, where they had been staying during a visit to Yosemite
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Their car was found Thursday near here in a wooded area off
Highway 108 and investigators expect that the other body may be
either Julie Sund or Silvina Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could take some time but we feel confident we will get
identification on the second victim,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators said they were shifting the focus of
the investigation to Sonora, Calif., the central location for the
combined task force of federal and local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Monday, the FBI released seven photos,
developed from film found among the evidence near the car, that
show the trio in the days just before they disappeared. The
pictures, taken in Yosemite National Park, show them smiling and
happy as they ice skated, posed in front of a waterfall and hiked
along the Merced River.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent James Maddock, head of the FBI's Sacramento
office, said the time-stamped photographs were from an undeveloped
roll of film found among evidence near the car, but he would not
reveal the exact location. He said investigators decided to keep
other pictures in the roll.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the decision to release the photographs to the
public was made by the families, who hope the pictures may generate
useful clues about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone out there knows something, knows what happened,''
Rogers said. ``We need that person to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sund's badly burned body was identified by the FBI crime lab in
Quantico, Va., using dental charts.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff confirmed that an autopsy had been performed, but he
declined to disclose the cause of her death. Nor would he say when
Sund died or whether the two victims in the trunk were still alive
when the car was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The trio's disappearance prompted a massive search in this
mining country just outside Yosemite National Park. The car was
discovered late last week about three hours north of the park in a
remote wooded area just off Highway 108.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know how they got here,'' Maddock said. ``We
still don't know where the crime occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents are talking again with witnesses who said they saw
the trio shopping and buying gas the next day along Highway 108
near where the car was found.
</P>
<P>
   They were reported missing Feb. 17 _ a day after they failed to
meet Carole Sund's husband, Jens, at San Francisco International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and tourism officials in Sonora, Twain Harte and
Sierra Village have reported seeing the trio in the area on Feb. 16
and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Maddock said authorities have been inundated with
tips about sightings, but that not all can be correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't necessarily believe one eyewitness sighting and not
another,'' Maddock said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which said weeks ago that the three were victims of a
violent crime, has been working on the theory that they were
kidnapped or carjacked outside El Portal late Feb. 15 or early Feb.
16. The FBI requires documentation or corroboration before it
confirms a sighting in a missing persons case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have a confirmed sighting beyond the Cedar
Lodge,'' Maddock said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, authorities moved the car to a hangar at
nearby Columbia Airport, where arson experts from the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were looking for telltale
chemical residues in the vehicle's burned-out shell.
</P>
<P>
   Using relatively new technology, they are looking for
case-breaking clues _ even fingerprints _ from the car, outside
experts told The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The experts believe investigators already know much more than
they are admitting about the crime, including, some say, the
identity of the victim found burned in the trunk with Carole Sund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think they knew the IDs on both days ago,'' said one San
Francisco-based investigator who's handled similar cases. ``My
hunch is they have a good idea who did this and they're trying to
`roll' one of the guys'' by trapping him into revealing
unpublicized details of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   While criminals can destroy a lot of valuable evidence with a
fire, ``there are a lot of guys sitting in jail now because they
made the mistake of thinking they were covering themselves,'' said
Jean Daly, a San Francisco assistant district attorney who
specializes in crimes involving arson.
</P>
<P>
   She and other experts tick off an inventory of evidence that
could be retrieved from a torched car:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fingerprints. While blackening a metal surface often erases
fingerprints, new chemicals make them recoverable in some cases.
Specialists also would check for any areas of the car not damaged
by flames, including the exterior windows, the undersides and
insides of the glove compartment, the inside pages of things like
maps, checkbooks and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Physical evidence like hair, pollen and fibers. Again,
specialists are likely to zero in on pockets not demolished by
flames. Because fires tend to burn upward, floorboards sometimes
still contain clues. And if the fire-starter neglected to leave the
windows down to allow oxygen to feed the fire, flames might have
extinguished themselves in areas like the trunk or even the
interior compartment before they had a chance to do much damage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cause of death. While the FBI is not revealing anything about
the cause of death of either victim, forensic experts may be able
to determine if they were shot or strangled before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   _ How the fire started. Tests for chemicals along a spectrum
will indicate whether the accelerant of the fire was gasoline,
butane or some other fuel.

   TAKE-BOS  
 PALM BEACH, Fla.: ... venue on earth.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The overused word ``palatial'' really does apply to The
Breakers. The grand lobby and and other public spaces with their
antique tapestries, gilded ceilings, and ornate furniture resemble
the reception rooms of the Doge's Palace in Venice. A world unto
itself, the Breakers has its own ocean beach and two swimming
pools, two 18-hole golf courses (one of them more than 100 years
old, practically Jurassic by Florida standards), 14 tennis courts,
a luxurious new health and fitness spa, seven restaurants and four
bars, and a shopping arcade that is a mini-Worth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, all this doesn't come cheap. In the high
season, rooms at the Breakers start at $360 a night and end at
$2,200 for the Imperial Suite.
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz Carlton (561-533-6000) in Palm Beach opened only in
1991, but the decor is classic Ritz, the same sort of subdued,
old-fashioned elegance that you find in much older sister hotels in
London, Paris, New York, and Boston. (The bathtubs are marble, of
course.) However, instead of a busy city street, this 200-room
hotel looks out on a sandy beach and a lot of ocean. And the guests
in the formal lobby are more apt to be wearing shorts and sandals
than business suits. Room rates in high season are $350-$1,095.
</P>
<P>
   Another distinctive Palm Beach hotel is the Chesterfield
(800-243-7871), a 55-room-and-suites boutique hostelry on Cocoanut
Row, just off Worth Avenue. Owned by a London-based company, the
Chesterfield has a decor and ambience that are a cross between an
English country house and an Edwardian men's club.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rooms off the Chesterfield's paneled lobby is a
library with a marble fireplace, leather upholstered armchairs, and
shelves of books that reflect current best-seller lists. Across the
hall is the smoking room with more armchairs and also humidors
filled with fine cigars. Needless to say, afternoon tea is served.
The Leopard Room, the hotel's combination lounge, restaurant, and
supper club, is a popular local hangout. Rates are from $229 to
$1099.
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach is just a short drive down the dune- and
beach-rimmed coast from Palm Beach but a very different place:
Vacationers are younger and less formal, it's a bit arty, and a lot
cheaper. Delray was founded by Japanese immigrants in 1904 as an
agricultural settlement, which was abandoned in the 1920s. One of
Delray's popular attractions is the Morikami Museum and Japanese
Gardens founded by George Morikami, a settler who remained in the
area and eventually prospered as farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, a pagoda-like building, has exhibits on the history
of the settlement, a collection of typical Japanese household
artifacts and children's toys along with changing displays,
demonstrations, and audiovisual presentations on different aspects
of Japanese culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Morikami also has an excellent Japanese restaurant (not easy
to find in Florida) that looks out on the gardens and is a great
place to have lunch. The 200-acre garden park is beautiful, with
nature trails, waterfalls, formal and bonsai gardens, and an
ornamental pond filled with carp.
</P>
<P>
   Delray's mile-long main shopping street, appropriately named
Atlantic Avenue, ends at a broad ocean beach. It, too, has had a
makeover recently _ it's now lined with palm trees and brick
sidewalks _ but is neither as upscale as Worth Avenue nor as
entertainment-oriented as Clematis. Pleasant but unpretentious,
Atlantic is a mix of utilitarian mom-and-pop stores, art galleries,
craft shops, and cafes. A notable Delray pub is the Blue Anchor on
East Atlantic, run by expatriate Englishmen, which has the
preserved facade of a demolished historic pub that once stood in
London's Chancery Lane.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlantic Avenue anchor and landmark is the Colony Hotel and
Cabana Club (800-552-2363). The Colony is a proudly old-fashioned
1920s Florida ``Gold Coast'' resort hotel _wicker funiture, ceiling
fans, and all. Room rates are $139 to $189 in the high season,
substantially less at other times.
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton, just south of Delray, isn't the Social Register
bastion that Palm Beach is, but it's pretty posh. Among other
recreational amenities, for instance, it boasts two polo clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Influential in Palm Beach, architect Addison Mizner was the key
figure in the development of Boca Raton, and most buildings in town
are in the pink stucco, arcaded Mediterranean Revival style he
popularized. The centerpiece of Mizner's planned resort community,
built in 1926, was the Cloister Inn, which is now the Boca Raton
Resort (561-395-3000).
</P>
<P>
   Elegant and impressive (lots of antique tapestries, furniture,
and Italianate touches) but not as intimidatingly grand as The
Breakers, the main building of the Boca Raton Resort is Mizner's
masterpiece. The 350-acre grounds are lushly landscaped with
tropical trees and flower, and in the evening the air is scented
with night-blooming jasmine. There are nearly a dozen restaurants,
a full range of sports activities, and a marina generally filled
with enormous yachts.
</P>
<P>
   A high-rise tower has been added to the orginal hotel, and the
resort has nearly a thousand rooms. In-season room rates are
$240-$485.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Boca Raton created a sort of instant downtown
called Mizner Park, a shopping development built around a
Mediterranean-style square. Along its arcaded walkways are upscale
boutiques, art galleries, restaurants, outdoor cafes, a large
bookstore, a movie theater, and something that even Worth Avenue
can't claim _ guaranteed laughs.
</P>
<P>
   There are also chuckles, chortles, and guffaws to be had at
Mizner Park's International Museum of Cartoon Art, the only one of
its kind in the country. Devoted to the collection, preservation,
and study of cartoon art, the museum _ housed in a handsome new
building _ displays hundreds of comic books, editorial cartoons,
caricatures, cartoon strips, movie cartoons, graphic novels, and
the latest thing in computer-generated cartooning. Best of all,
it's filled with familiar and very funny faces, from Betty Boop,
Little Orphan Annie, and Li'l Abner to Charlie Brown, Michael
Doonesbury, and Dilbert.

PALM BEACH COUNTY IS RICH IN MUCH MORE THAN JUST MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Only the width of the Intracoastal Waterway,
here called Lake Worth, separates West Palm Beach from Palm Beach.
It takes just a minute or so to cross the bridge connecting the
two, but in many important ways (such as per-capita income) they
are far apart.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach is the largest city of Palm Beach County, a
2,000-square-mile subtropical enclave an hour's drive north of
Miami with a 47-mile-long coastline that is practically all white,
sandy beach. An attractive and mostly middle-class community, West
Palm is the county seat.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach, on the other hand, is casually elegant,
architecturally baronial, and has long been the winter resort of
choice for some of the wealthiest people in the country. We're
talking immense fortunes and very old money, as in Vanderbilts,
Rockefellers, Mellons, et al.
</P>
<P>
   It's a town of wide avenues lined with rows of royal palm trees
and enormous homes discreetly tucked away behind ivy-covered walls
and high, artfully sculptured hedges. The most impressive Palm
Beach mansion of all (which is saying something) is Mar-a-Lago,
built for cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, which boasts
58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, and three fallout shelters, one
presumably for the servants. Once the winter home of Donald Trump,
Mar-a-Lago is now a private club.
</P>
<P>
   The main shopping streets of the two communities speak volumes
about their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach's Worth Avenue is Florida's equivalent of Beverly
Hills' Rodeo Drive: in other words, shamelessly high-priced and
upmarket. Gucci, Pucci, Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley, Louis Vuitton,
and Tiffany's are all represented, along with many one-of-a-kind
boutiques, specialty shops, and galleries. Designed by architect
Addison Mizener, who in the 1920s created a distinctive South
Florida version of the Mediterranean style, Worth Avenue is noted
for its ``vias,'' _ narrow passageways leading to charming inner
courtyards, usually occupied by art galleries, restaurants, and
cafes and often with a fountain in the center.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach's Clematis Street offers an eclectic and
affordable shopping and dining mix (there are more than 30
restaurants and cafes) along with a lot of free entertainment for
the hoi polloi. Downtown West Palm has had a civic spiffing up in
recent years, and Clematis Street, with its restored storefronts,
brightly painted metal sculptures, and colorful banners and cafe
umbrellas, showcases this renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Centennial Fountain, actually a plaza dotted with shooting
geysers, is the focal point of Clematis and the scene of frequent
concerts, performances, and art exhibitions. ``Brown Bag in the
City,'' a Friday afternoon lunchtime concert series, and ``Clematis
by Night,'' a Thursday evening entertainment series, are among the
regular events that enliven downtown West Palm. The last weekend in
April, the city stages SunFest, an outdoor festival featuring
musical events of all sorts, along with food stalls and crafts
booths.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach is also home of the splendid Norton Museum of
Art, generally acknowledged to be Florida's finest. The museum,
which recently underwent a $19 million expansion that tripled its
size, has particularly strong collections of French Impressionists
and post-Impressionists as well as 20th-century American paintings.
The museum also has an outstanding Oriental collection, consisting
of archaic Chinese bronzes, jades, ceramics, and Buddhist
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is currently hosting a virtual heavenly host: ``The
Invisible Made Visible: Angels of the Vatican,'' a blockbuster
exhibition of some of the world's best works of art portraying
angels. Drawn from Vatican collections, the show includes paintings
by Raphael, Fra Angelico, Salvador Dali, and nearly 100 other
artists, along with sculptures, ceramics, liturgical vessels, and
vestments representing Assyrian, Etruscan, and pagan Greek and
Roman as well as Christian traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The man who founded both Palm Beach and West Palm Beach was
Henry Morrison Flagler, an industrialist and railroad baron who
almost singlehandedly transformed South Florida from swampy
backwater to winter vacation destination. In the 1890s, he began
extending his Florida East Coast Railroad south from St. Augustine
to open up what had been a remote and sparsely settled region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1893, Flagler acquired land on both shores of Lake Worth. On
the eastern shore _ the long sand spit of an island that is now
Palm Beach _ he built the 1,100-room Royal Poinciana, a vast wooden
building that was the largest hotel in the world at the time. Next
to it, he later built a smaller hotel that after various
incarnations (it burned down and was rebuilt twice) became the
Breakers. The Royal Poinciana is long gone, but the Breakers is
very much the grande dame of Palm Beach hotels.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach was initially developed to provide Flagler's
workers and the servants of the socialites he attracted to his
resort a place to build modest homes well removed from the lavish
digs of their employers. This rigid social division between the
communities no longer exists (although not many wage slaves can
afford to live in Palm Beach), but it hasn't been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Flagler died in 1913, but his memory and that of the Gilded Age
he epitomized live on in Whitehall. This is the 55-room Beaux
Arts-style neoclassical mansion he built beside Lake Worth in 1902
as a wedding present for his third wife, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler.
Now the Flagler Museum, the mansion is preserved much as it was
when the couple grandly held court there. Think vast marble-floored
and high-ceilinged rooms, thick Oriental rugs, silk tapestries,
massive pieces of furniture, and lots of crystal chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Breakers (561-655-6611) is also an enduring and impressive
piece of Flagler's legacy. Still in the family (the present owners
are related to his wife), the 572-room hotel, built in 1926, is
Palm Beach's signature building _ its twin towers, illuminated at
night, are visible all over town and well out to sea _ and also its
traditional social center. More money has been raised for charity
in the Breakers ballroom, it is claimed, than in any other venue on
earth.

ROPE SPRUCES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ If age determines rank among European cities, and it
does, Rome looks down its nose on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Paris? Yawn. Most of the Paris we know today was created in the
middle of the last century by Baron Georges Eugene Haussmann, who
razed the old warrens of that city to build his grand boulevards
about the time that Boston was filling in the Back Bay. Beacon Hill
is older than much of Paris, for God's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Rome was already the center of the universe when its legions
were civilizing brutish tribes in England and western Europe.
Athens may be older, but it is hors de combat because it has the
ambience of an exhaust pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Like all true aristocrats, Rome has never cared a whit about
appearances. It is the noble who, secure in his bloodlines, serves
claret in the odd peanut butter jar at dinner parties. Where Paris
prides itself on its cleanliness and amenities, Rome luxuriates in
decay. No one does decay better than Rome. That's why Americans
love the place. We don't have any.
</P>
<P>
   But the visitor to Rome today will find that the city is in the
midst of doing something very un-Roman: It is cleaning up its act.
</P>
<P>
   today, Rome resembles a woman in curlers getting ready for a big
night out. Scores of its architectural gems like St. Peter and the
Palazzo Farnese are obscured by netting and scaffolding in
preparation for ``il Giubileo,'' the Jubilee celebrating the
millennium. Workmen are scouring the exteriors of these buildings
to uncover shades of stone unseen by any living Roman.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 700 projects underway. The municipal
government concedes in a huge sign on the Palazzo Venezia, where
Mussolini used to uncork his endless speeches, that these
restorations may be a tad inconvenient but they will make for a
swell future: ``Oggi i disagi, domani una citta migliore.''
(``today inconveniences, tomorrow a better city.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government is also giving tax breaks to private
landlords who improve their buildings. Suddenly, owners who have
not fixed a faucet since Garibaldi rode with his redshirts are hard
at work sprucing up their palazzi. The streets are also being torn
up with brio. Thoroughfares that went in one direction for
centuries no longer do so. This makes for hallucinogenic driving.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's pride is on the line now as never before. The Vatican
expects 30 million people to visit the city and holy sites next
year. Still, there is something unsettling about all of this
estimable work. Rome has always been a respite from order. People
can always visit Frankfurt or Minneapolis for that. We flock to the
Eternal City for its chaos and decline. We love Rome precisely
because it has never seriously entertained the notion of urban
renewal. If they restore these buildings, what's next? Will they
have the gall to go after the pollution and the noise?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone buys the Roman act. The Milanese, among
the most sophisticated Europeans, dismiss Rome as ``the Cairo of
the South.'' (Indeed, a technician who computerized the foreign
bureaus of an international magazine in the late '80s declared that
the task was easier in Cairo than in Rome.)
</P>
<P>
   Milan is the center of Italian finance, design, and fashion.
They make money there. They produce things, too. Rome, by contrast,
spends money and produces nothing. Where the Milanese embrace a
proud work ethic, the Romans follow a blend of ``dolce far niente''
(``it is sweet to do nothing'') and ``chi se ne frega'' (``who
gives a damn''). The charm of this approach, it must be said, is
limited for anyone who actually has to do something.
</P>
<P>
   Milan is a true European city. It looks north toward Brussels
rather than south toward Calabria. Rome, in contrast, looks inward
when it bothers to look anywhere at all. It is ironic that the
treaty establishing the European Economic Community in 1957 was
signed in Rome, a city that has maintained a solipsistic view of
the world since its days of empire. Europe, shmeurope.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate its ego is a workout. Rome is considered a walking
city for tourists only because there is no alternative. Rome wipes
out people who attempt to walk from hotels near the Via Veneto to
Trastevere, the Gianicolo, the Aventino, and the Forum. Don't even
think about the Appian Way. Rome is huge. We're not talking
Florence, which, like Boston, has the right scale for bipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to even contemplate driving a car in Rome is lunacy. A
motor scooter makes the most sense, but not for the uninitiated,
who would end up on the police blotter. The city has a subway
system, but almost no one takes it. The buses are good and, if you
want to cheat, free, since they work on the honor system. Barring
the rare appearances by inspectors who check for freeloaders, no
one cares if a passenger has a ticket or not. The odds are with
you.
</P>
<P>
   So visitors should take a chance. Rome is best played without a
net. No guidebooks. Read voluminously before you arrive and then
wing it. Get lost in the dark alleys between Piazza Navona and the
Tiber. Wander from the Borgo around St. Peter's into Trastevere,
past Regina Coeli, unexpectedly sporting the flag of the European
Union over its entrance. Check out the ghetto, the ancient Jewish
quarter whose gates were locked each night by the Romans until well
into the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Do not miss the Aventino, one of the loveliest of Rome's seven
hills. Affluent and tranquil, it boasts the Giardine delle Arancie
(Garden of the Oranges), a sublime spot full of orange trees, with
a great view of the city. Another jewel on the Aventino is the
sight through the keyhole in the door of the Sovereign Military
Order of Malta. If you peer through it, you see the dome of St.
Peter's perfectly framed by an alley of trees. For my money, it is
the most magic scene in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Rome overflows with fountains. They speak to the sensuality of
the Italians that is so utterly lacking in Americans. (Why else are
there so few fountains in our cities?) There is something for every
taste. I favor the small ones, and none more than the Fontana delle
Tartarughe in the Piazza Mattei, a seductive little square in old
Rome near the ghetto. The fountain, modest by Roman standards, is
an exquisite affair with four youths, each of whom holds a dolphin
spouting water into a shell, while supporting a turtle climbing
into the bowl above. You don't need a guidebook to appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   The vast Borghese gardens remain one of Rome's primo walking
areas. Enter at the top of the Via Veneto and wander past the
grandiose statue of Umberto I, into the pines, and on to the Piazza
di Siena, where dressage competitions are held in the spring and
summer. (No one loves horse flesh more than the Italians.) Nearby
is the lago, a pond where folks can rent rowboats for 20 minutes at
a stretch and paddle aimlessly into one another. A delightful spot
for a proposal or a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Borghese gardens abut Pincio, yet another oasis of
tranquillity, overlooks the Piazza del Popolo. Well-heeled mothers
and their Filipino au pairs play with children near the famous
water clock there. On a recent morning, a multicolored hot-air
balloon was tethered a few feet above the main plaza in Pincio. It
was a stunning sight. In the balloon basket were a handful of city
gas workers mounting a three-hour protest over pay and working
conditions. A colleague guarding the hawsers cheerfully conceded
that the workers, like the balloon, were going nowhere, but the
balloon certainly was pretty. Now that is a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Rome has never been the same since the arrival of the cell
phone. With the possible exception of the Israelis, no other people
on earth have taken to these devices like the Italians. You wonder
how they survived all those centuries without them. Their odious
sounds now punctuate meals at trattorias, bus rides, and shopping
sprees. The throngs of teenagers who descend on the Spanish Steps
like crows all have cell phones. They call each other incessantly
and chain-moke. (Italians do not appear to have made the link yet
between smoking and cancer.)

   Predictably, Romans have refined the cell phone to accommodate
their need to talk with both hands. One well-dressed man was
spotted recently walking up the Via Veneto sporting a Madonna-like
headset connected to the phone in his coat pocket. He was carrying
on a spirited conversation with someone while gesticulating with
both hands. He was observed with envy.
</P>
<P>
   Jogging has also finally caught on. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   Rome will survive cell phones and joggers just as it did the
Brazilian transvestites on the Via Veneto during the '80s and the
McDonald's in the Piazza del Pantheon today. It will make it
through the millennium and its attendant restoration projects as
well because it adheres to a different credo than the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tutto e relativo,'' explains Adrian Rodriguez, an artisan who
lives in Trastevere. Indeed, everything in Rome is relative. This
is an exotic concept to Americans. It is also the reason so many of
us favor it over countless other vacation spots around the globe:
For deep in our hearts, we admit that the Roman outlook on life
trumps our silly American rigidity.

   TAKE-BOS  
 ST. PETERSBURG: ... desperately hungry.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A two-minute stroll from the Grand is the Russian State Museum,
originally a grand duke's palace but converted into a showcase for
Russian art in 1898. In the midst of current economic chaos that
has left museum guards unpaid months at a time, the Russian State
Museum is celebrating its centennial this year.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the museum is the Pushkin Park, with its statue of
Russia's most revered poet. In the West, you're taught that Russia
has many great writers: Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, and others. In
Russia, you're told there's a hierarchy, with Pushkin at the
pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest foreign-visitor day at the Russian State Museum is
Monday _ the day when the Hermitage is closed. I went on a Sunday,
and still had the place pretty much to myself. Make sure you buy
the $6 guidebook at the entrance, not only for the helpful
information you won't get from the minimal labels, only some of
which are in English, but also for gems of the translator's art,
like the description of the demise of the medieval Prince Vladimir:
``Intestine strife broke out following his death.'' An epidemic of
diarrhea?
</P>
<P>
   Even the overgilded ceilings can't mute the impact of the
museum's 12th- and 13th-century icons. The slender saints in these
paintings are, in their own way, as dour as the museum's hefty
female guards. These icons are among the museum's greatest
treasures, their attenuated figures often bowed as if under the
weight of faith. After the icon era, Russian art lost its fervor
and authenticity, and settled for imitating Europe. By the end of
the 19th century, though, Russia had regained her oomph. By the
early 20th century, radicals like Kandinsky and Malevich were
turning out some of the most exciting art anywhere, and Russia's
great designers were creating stage sets so forceful they ranked as
great art in their own right. The exhibitions in the Russian State
Museum track that epic development.
</P>
<P>
   At least they do now. In the bad old days, the Maleviches were
hidden away in storage, lest the party authorities discover these
objectionable abstractions. Curators told party officials that
they'd destroyed the avant-garde works. ``The only way to preserve
the work,'' says Karlov, ``was to lie.'' At least Stalin didn't
sell off Russian art, as he sold off Rembrandts and Raphaels from
the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the party paid for, and controlled, the museum.
Now, the government still gives the museum money, but the museum
must raise funds, too. Among other things, this means a museum
shop, renting the place out for a film of ``Anna Karenina,'' and
seeking corporate sponsorship. On the walls above the museum's
huge, echoing, ornate staircase are inscribed the names of its
corporate sponsors: Finnair, Coca-Cola, the Grand Hotel. Welcome to
late-20th-century fund-raising for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage occupies a string of pastel palaces along the Neva
River. You're first conscious of its amazing scale, of the reality
that merely walking around the outside of the building would be a
half-hour hike. The complex even has its own theater, which was for
the czar's personal use; nowadays, ballet companies and musicians
perform tourist-oriented shows there. One I attended had an
English-only program and the silliest curtain calls ever: The live
orchestra left and a recorded medley of jazzed-up Tchaikovsky
accompanied the strutting dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer sumptuousness of the Hermitage is numbing, all those
acres of gilt and malachite, all those masterpieces. The conditions
in which these world-famous paintings live are sometimes appalling,
though: Major Post-Impressionist works exist next to open windows,
under fluorescent lights that make a buzzing sound. The labels in
some of these 20th-century galleries are equally appalling. They
freely acknowledge that a dazzling array of paintings by van Gogh,
Matisse, Cezanne, and Monet are from the collections of two
prominent and prescient families, the Shchukin and Morosov clans.
Their art was nationalized during the Revolution, and the state
hasn't moved to give it back, although the families' heirs have
asked for restitution. There's also an exhibition of ``Hidden
Treasures'' confiscated from Germany by Soviet troops at the end of
World War II and ``preserved'' by the Hermitage, which hasn't seen
fit to return them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether to give things back is a small problem,'' insists
Hermitage director Mikhail Piotrovsky. ``We have big problems.''
The biggest is money. At the time I spoke to him, Piotrovsky hadn't
been able to pay his fire brigade for two months. But he talked,
like the eternal optimist, about ``increasing the Hermitage's role
as a humanistic center for the city.'' His plans include luring a
foreign developer to build a museum of decorative arts, creating an
education center where children can dress up in period costumes or
replicas of armor, and opening cafes where you can eat off copies
of the czar's porcelain services you've seen in the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to expand the Hermitage until it is once again the
world's biggest museum, a title it lost to the Louvre after the
Paris museum's recent enlargement. I think the Hermitage is already
quite big enough, and that some funds ought to be put toward
Louvre-level loos: The Hermitage bathrooms are filthy, few, and
free of toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   But the paintings are jaw-dropping. While my Russian guide says,
``If we returned everything that people want back, there wouldn't
be anything left in the museum,'' this isn't quite the case.
Catherine the Great's purchases aren't in dispute, and she bought
by the cartload, including already-formed collections from
down-and-out Western European aristocrats, hundreds of paintings at
a pop. She and other royals stashed so much art in the Hermitage
that it is said that if you looked at each object for one minute,
it would take you a year to get through the place.

GRAND EXHIBITS AT US MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington has John Singer Sargent, Monterey is going for the
mysteries of the deep, Denver offers a colossal fossil vacation,
and great toys from our childhood are on view in Pittsfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is a grand time to visit a museum. The ground outside may
be a bit muddy, but inside, America's museums offer some great
shows and great reasons for hitting the road.
</P>
<P>
   In the art world, the first major retrospective since 1926 of
the work of John Singer Sargent is on view through May 31 at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington. The exhibit includes 113
paintings and watercolors. ``An astute portraitist, Sargent painted
many of the leading personalities of the age in works of great
elegance and panache,'' said Earl A. Pwell III, director of the
gallery. The exhibit will be at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts June
23-Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kid Stuff: Great Toys from Out Childhood'' is on view at the
Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield through May 30. This highly
imaginative show takes you back to your childhood and the games and
gadgets of the past. ``Kid stuff is about live ant farms, Colorform
activities, Easy-Bake Ovens, and running Lionel Trains,'' said
Sharon Blume, museum director. So, enjoy the show and check out the
View-Master, the Twister, Play-Doh, and more. For information, call
413-443-7171.
</P>
<P>
   At the Colossal Fossil Vacation at the Denver Museum of Natural
History, through July 5, you can go on a ``dig,'' touch fossil
specimens like a mammoth tooth, or even climb into a giant dinosaur
nest. Want more? Call 303-322-7009.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of the Deep'' is designed to introduce visitors to
the earth's largest habitat _ the dark, cold ocean waters that make
up 80 percent of the available living space on the planet. The
``Mysteries'' at California's Monterey Bay Aquarium continue
through Jan. 6 and include more than 40 species collected from
waters as deep as 3,000 feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Among other museum shows is the ``Pilgrim's Progress,'' one of
only a handful of surviving 19th-century ``moving panoramas.''
Presented in theaters and elsewhere, the enormous canvas was wound
onto a giant wooden spool and unrolled across a stage, scene by
scene. ``Pilgrim's Progress,'' a nearly 400-foot-long section from
this work, is on view at the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey
through May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Just opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City
is ``The Treasury of Saint Francis of Assisi.'' The exhibit is in
conjunction with the massive restoration efforts following the 1997
earthquakes in Assisi, and includes 70 masterpieces of medieval and
Renaissance panel paintings, textiles, and manuscript
illuminations.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the entire Whitney Museum in New York for nine months
will be ``The American Century: Art and Culture 1900-2000.'' The
exhibit, to be presented in two parts _ the first from April
22-Aug. 30 and the second from October through February _ is
designed to enhance the ways in which museum visitors experience
and learn about works of art. For information, call 877-WHITNEY,
toll-free.
</P>
<P>
   One of many good reasons to visit Montreal this summer is the
opening of ``Cosmos: From Romanticism to the Avant-garde'' June
17-Oct. 17 at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The exhibit takes
viewers from the myth of the New Frontier from the 19th-century
explorations of America to contemporary explorations of the solar
system. There will be works from 20 countries. For information,
call 514-285-1600.

   Women's history
</P>
<P>
   Throughout March, Colonial Williamsburg is celebrating National
Women's History Month with programs that explore the intricacies of
relationships and connections between 18th-century African,
British, and Native American women, free and enslaved. Particular
emphasis is given to the mistress and slave relationships that were
forged for sheer survival on the eve of the American Revolution.

   Massachusetts isn't the only place that celebrates Patriots
Weekend in April. Maine, once part of the commonwealth, also marks
the holiday, especially in Ogunquit, where the ninth annual
Patriots Weekend Celebration runs April 16 through 18. Many events
will be staged under the big top on Ogunquit Beach. Also planned is
a public supper Friday evening; the famous fireman's cookout; a
beach bazaar throughout the weekend; and a taste-of-the-town
Saturday, with each taste from area restaurants just 75 cents.
Saturday is casino night on the beach, and on Sunday, Elvis (or a
reasonable facsimile) will be there to sing ``On the Beach.''
Ogunquit is just over an hour from Boston and is one of Maine's
most picturesque villages. For information, call the Chamber of
Commerce at 207-646-2939.

IT'S TIME TO APPOINT A COMMISSION?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a way out of the unpleasant confrontation building
between the Republicans and the Democrats over the GOP's proposal
to build a new runway at Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The way to begin to fix the airport is for the governor to
appoint a small blue-ribbon commission to study the matter
intensely for a year, then seek to build a consensus around its
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, which has a deep interest in a smoothly
functioning airport, should stop for a moment and consider both the
situation in the US Congress and the long history of the argument
over the plans for an additional east-west runway.
</P>
<P>
   When it was first proposed in 1973 by then Massport chief Edward
J. King, the 14/32 runway (so called after its compass heading) was
billed as the only way for Logan to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Eight million passengers passed through Logan annually then; the
figure is 27 million now. King defeated Michael Dukakis in the race
for governor in 1978, was defeated by Dukakis in 1982, and moved on
to other things. The passenger traffic at Logan is expected to rise
to 40 million or so in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives for handling additional traffic are pretty much
today what they were then:
</P>
<P>
   _Hope that bigger, quieter planes will be built;
</P>
<P>
   _Institute a system of peak pricing designed to cut down on
congestion through economic incentives;
</P>
<P>
   _Build the short runway, which would permit the airport to
continue to operate near full capacity when the wind is from the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent episode began when Massport hired a political
consultant and announced plans to go to court to ask a judge to
withdraw an injunction against building the runway that had been
entered in 1974 at the request of then Mayor Kevin White.
</P>
<P>
   Led by men appointed by former Governor William F. Weld _ board
chairman Mark Robinson and executive director Peter Blute _
Massport has its reasons for wanting the additional runway. Though
only the nation's 17th busiest airport, Logan ranks sixth in
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately there followed salvos from leading Democrats: first
US Representative Michael Capuano, whose 8th Congressional District
includes the towns around the airport; then Boston Mayor Thomas M.
Menino. Few neigborhood issues are more emotional than those that
arise from noise. ``We've got to make sure that injunction stays in
place,'' said Menino.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, who supports the new runway, so far has
avoided becoming deeply embroiled in the controversy, aside from a
few straightforward observations. ``With a new convention center
coming on line and the development in South Boston, we have to have
a first-class airport if Boston is to be a first-class city,''
Cellucci said the other day. He called the arguments for a new
runway ``overwhelming,'' and added: ``I believe the vast majority
of people in this state support it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Logan's congestion is the problem of little
planes. As a result of longstanding local custom, the airport sees
a far higher proportion of civil aviation at all hours of the day
than most urban airports.
</P>
<P>
   Congestion pricing would be one answer to the ubiquity of the
little planes, whose very presence forces big commercial jets to
keep greater distances, lest their jet wash blow little Cessnas and
Beechcraft into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The Dukakis administration instituted a form of peak pricing in
1989, and for a time congestion dropped dramatically as the small
fry stayed out of the queue. But the owners of little planes
successfully appealed the measure to Congress, threatening to play
rough with Massport's charter in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The real subtext of the runway controversy is the likelihood
that Congress finally will take action on an omnibus aviation bill
later this year. Federal purse strings finally will be unloosed
after years of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   This is no time for the state's leadership to be squabbling
among themselves. Cellucci should do what Governor Frank Sargent
did when he was confronted years ago with a similar problem with
state highways. He should appoint a commission in the firm
expectation that the problem will diminish with time.

   What better way to brighten your day than to tell you about
three travel-related Elvis Presley items? Here they are:
</P>
<P>
   --Almost anywhere you travel, you're likely to run into
reminders of Elvis. ``The Field Guide to Elvis Shrines''
(Renaissance Books, $15.95) makes it easy to find them. The guide,
for instance, can lead you to Joni Mabe's Traveling Panoramic
Encyclopedia of Everything Elvis, the Elvis Presley Auto Museum,
and the 24-hour Church of Elvis in Oregon. There are photos, maps,
and walking-driving tours. For more information, call 800-422-5589.
</P>
<P>
   --Beginning Oct. 1, Bremerhaven, Germany, will host four days of
events commemorating Presley's arrival there 40 years ago, marking
the first time he stepped on German soil. There will be an
American-style hamburger joint, nonstop Elvis films, a concert, and
a music museum. Even the King's military uniform will be on
display. For more information, write to the Bremerhaven Tourist
Office, Van-Ronzelen-Strasse 2, 27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; or
phone 011.49.471.9464610. (With thanks to William Buchanan of Lake
Mary, Fla., an authority on matters Germanic.)
</P>
<P>
   --Jukka Ammondt, a Finnish academic known for recording Elvis
Presley songs in Latin, is planning a new record _ this time in
ancient Sumerian. Ammondt told Reuters he intends to bring out a
Sumerian single soon and an album in the autumn. He has been
practicing with ``Blue Suede Shoes,'' translated into the cuneiform
language of Babylonia that died out around 2000 BC. And how is that
travel-related? Well, you'll obviously be making a trip to Finland
to snag one of the first copies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What is the largest island in the Mediterranean?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: The Doodlebug is the name of a remanufactured 1920s'
vehicle that takes 50 passengers on a tour of scenic Lake Dora,
Fla. And watch out: The Doodlebug hits speeds of 20 m.p.h.! &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Why buy good luggage? You only use it when you
travel.'' _ Casey Stengel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Freebie: You can walk through a glade surrounded by hundreds of
butterflies, including monarchs, swallowtails, and cabbage whites,
on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Wings Over Hawaii, the state's
only producer of butterflies for release at weddings and other
special occasions, has its visitors' area and gift shop at
Kilohana, a former sugar plantation near Lihue that also contains a
dozen stores and galleries, a restaurant, gardens, and carriage
rides pulled by Clydesdales. For more butterfly information, call
808-2458838 or 888-BUTTERFLI.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A queenly birthday: Britain's Queen Elizabeth will be celebrating
her 73d birthday April 21 in the small southeastern Korean city of
Andong. During the celebration, elderly village women will join the
queen, who has said she wants to mingle with residents. She has
also expressed interest in lessons on making Korean food, including
that powerfully pickled dish called kimchi. (For more information
about visiting Korea, call the Korea National Tourism Organization
at 800-868-7567 or visit www.knto.or.kr.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Glug: Americans drink about 310 Coca-Colas each every year. Britons
drink 100, Russians drink five and Chinese drink four. And,
according to the International Society of Worthless Information,
Iceland consumes more Coca-cola per capita than any other nation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Big Mac beat: At McDonald's in New Zealand, they serve apricot
pies instead of cherry ones. (With thanks to uselessfacts.net via

TOURISTS OFTEN MISS THE RUSSIAN STATE MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The standard tourist route for Western
visitors to this city includes a mandatory stop at the Hermitage
Museum, where they see Western art _ Rembrandt, Rubens, Matisse,
van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   The standard route does not necessarily include the Russian
State Museum, where they would see Russian art, medieval icons to
20th-century iconoclasts. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   My most recent visit to the city of Peter the Great coincided
with the famous White Nights in June, when the sun barely dips
below the horizon. It's the most tourist-heavy time of the Russian
year. You'd never know it from the Russian museum, though.
``Foreigners here go to the Hermitage,'' laments Russian State
Museum chief curator Ivan Ivanovitch Karlov. ``They are brought
there as part of package tours sold by travel agencies. Ninety-five
percent of tourists here are on package tours. Individual tourists
just don't come.'' They stay away because of justifiable fears
about the roller-coaster Russian economy, concerns for their
safety, and worries about logistics: This is a city where even
negotiating a cab ride can be daunting and exhausting. Almost every
taxi meter in St. Petersburg is ``broken.'' Almost every taxi
driver demands $10, whether to go across town or a few blocks.
Almost no taxi driver will accept Russian rubles. I like walking
long distances, and it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding Russian cabs is worth running the gantlet of beggars
and people selling newborn kittens on the street, and negotiating
the lines that form outside stores selling prized Western goods
like Nike shoes: Only a few people are allowed in at any one time,
because shopkeepers are so afraid of thefts. The Western newcomer
stores _ Gucci, etc. _ are the only ones with any on-street
presence; Soviet holdovers don't even have signs. But if you pay
close attention to windows, you'll notice some with goods that
beckon you inside. The consignment shops along the Nevsky Prospekt
are examples. Here you can pick up relics of Russia's stormy past _
mother-of-pearl opera glasses and malachite desk accessories from
Czarist times, dishes stamped with Lenin's face from a later era.
The Nikes will probably be next.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest shopping challenges in Russia is bottled
water. After spending $14 on water plucked from my hotel minibar
the first night of my first stay in St. Petersburg, so I could
brush my teeth without fear of intestinal reprisals, I learned to
comparison-shop. Avoid buying water outside tourist destinations
like palaces or museums; it's cheaper in the stores that cater to
Russians, although, like everything else here, it's cumbersome to
buy. In most stores, everything for sale is locked away under
glass, so you can't pinch it. You pick out what you want, hope you
can figure out the price, go to a cashier somewhere else in the
store, pay her (it's always a her), take the little receipt she
gives you back to the object of your desire, and hope there's a
clerk around who will get it out of the case and give it to you.
After all this, you will indeed need a drink, possibly of vodka
rather than mineral water. In Russia, vodka's often cheaper anyway.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the challenges of St. Petersburg worth the effort is
the glorious, if run-down, ambience, the astonishing architecture
reflected in still canals, the sculpture-lined bridges. And
churches _ once again open and fully operational _ including the
Kazan Cathedral, degraded during the communist era by being turned
into the Museum of Atheism. The 19th-century Church of the Holy
Blood _ built in Muscovite style, complete with gilded onion domes
_ boasts glorious, newly restored mosaics in a style that resembles
Byzantine crossed with Diego Rivera. There's a ``tourist'' entrance
fee of $16: Be prepared. Tourists also pay higher prices for
ballet, opera, and symphony performances. Tickets tend to be
available at the last minute, I've found. Pricewise, you're better
off going to the theater box office than buying them from a hotel
concierge.
</P>
<P>
   The bells of the Trinity Cathedral are being rung again, by
young men recently trained in the ancient art. Their sound is
mournful and distinctly Eastern, far from the more exuberant
tonalities of Western European church bells. The cathedral is part
of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, located at the eastern end of
Nevsky Prospekt, which is also where you'll find the overgrown
Tikhvin cemetery, burial place of notables including Dostoevsky and
Tchaikovsky. In the cathedral, you see people kneeling on hard
stone floors for long periods, as if making up for lost time. As
you turn to leave, you see a digital clock blinking over the
doorway of this otherwise mystical place, time marching on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I stayed at the Grand Hotel Europe in St. Petersburg, in a
top-floor room with a terrace. In a city that seems to be crumbling
before your eyes _ the great palaces all seem to be handyman's
specials _ the Grand Hotel is an oasis of perfect decor and calm,
although the service is somewhat unreliable. The hotel is partly
owned by the City of St. Petersburg, but it's managed by the
esteemed German-based Kempinski group. The sullen employees who
wish you would get your own food, and who helpfully point out that
you should leave them tips in American dollars, are the Russians.
The few Western Europeans are the ones who smile and ask if they
can help.
</P>
<P>
   The food in the Grand is St. Petersburg's best: It's all trucked
in from Germany because Russian supplies are unreliable. The Grand
has Chinese and Italian restaurants, a sports bar, an atrium cafe,
a caviar bar (the caviar is not trucked in), and a fancy restaurant
called the Europe, which offers the city's finest dining and boasts
stained glass by none other than Alexandre Benois, designer of
Ballets Russes landmarks like ``Petrouchka.'' Timid tourists who
don't want to venture beyond the walls of the Grand to eat can find
quite a bit of variety within them. For even more of a choice, the
city's two runner-up hotels, the Nevsky Palace and the Astoria,
also have good restaurants, although not on a par with the Grand's.
And you'll want to try independent restaurants, too, although
possibly not when you're desperately hungry.

GIANT SURPLUS TEMPTS GOP TO ABANDON CONSERVATIVE FISCAL POLICY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 bY THOMAS OLIPHANT 
C.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where are the conservatives when we need them?
</P>
<P>
   Emerging in Congress is a budget strategy that would probably
keep the national debt from being reduced in a time of
unprecedented surplus, lead to substantial deficits in the future,
and create a huge entitlement program for millions of Americans who
don't need it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason conservatives are not mobilizing to oppose such an
irresponsible future is that they are deeply implicated in it; this
is the budget being readied for consideration by Republicans in
both branches, not just the budget types like Pete Domenici and
John Kasich, but the Social Security privatizers lead by Bill
Archer in the House and Phil Gramm in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget remains extremely vulnerable to opposition
from moderates who are likely to find its Draconian cuts
unpalatable. However, it remains the party's vehicle in Congress
and is certain to heavily influence the nascent presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise in the products of Domenici's Senate Budget
Committee and Kasich's House counterpart is the extent to which
they do not do what Republicans claimed they would do more credibly
than President Clinton _ guarantee that budget surpluses would be
used to pay down the national debt held by the public, thus
lowering crunching government interest costs and freeing more
capital for productive investment in the country's amazingly strong
economy, as well as taking a huge step toward putting Social
Security in shape for the Baby Boom's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When Domenici and Kasich first went public with the
``framework'' for the budget, they promised to ``lock away every
penny of the Social Security trust fund surpluses for our nation's
elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have written their actual budget resolutions, it
turns out that what they mean by the elderly and Social Security
are two different things.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP resolutions are designed to fit with legislation by
Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan to create a ``lockbox'' for
those anticipated surpluses. In essence, this legislation
prescribes sharp reduction in the limit on debt held by the public
over the next decade, with two provisions for adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   One is responsible, up or down in the debt limit depending on
the actual fiscal results.
</P>
<P>
   The other is dangerous. It would permit increases in the debt
limit to the extent resources are needed to fund ``reform'' of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The reform is privatization, pure and simple, permitting the
creation of individual retirement funds with two percentage points
of the existing payroll tax in a scheme that (especially in the
House versions of it) is also designed to produce no reduction in
future Social Security benefits. The plan would cost trillions over
the next generation, and the funding mechanism would be the Social
Security surpluses that will continue to accumulate for about
another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   One place the Republican budgets most assuredly will not allow
to be a source of money would be any non-Social Security surpluses
that might appear in the future. This is where the gigantic
allowance for income tax cuts, military spending increases and
sharp cuts in the operating budget of the government all come into
play with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in return for partial privatization of Social
Security, the national debt could easily remain in the trillions
for our kids to choke on while the economic stimulus and other
domestic opportunities from its near-eradication would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. With backing from the center and progressive
wings of his party, the president's proposal would put 77 percent
of any government surplus into Social Security (62 percent) and
Medicare (15 percent), with another large chunk available to help
middle-class and working-poor Americans establish retirement
accounts outside Social Security. As now written, the Republicans
go in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there are ways that these contrasting visions
can be reconciled by imaginitive politicians interested in
solutions during this brief period of possibility before next
year's politics gradually takes over everything.
</P>
<P>
   If not, this is an issue easily capable of dwarfing all the
others.

MOTION BLINDNESS MAY BE CAUSE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISORIENTATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists say they have discovered why many Alzheimer's disease
patients get lost as they try to do what the rest of us take for
granted: navigate our way through the world.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with memory loss, as specialists have long
assumed. Rather, many Alzheimer's patients have ``motion
blindness,'' as Dr. Charles J. Duffy and Sheldon J. Tetewsky of the
University of Rochester term it in a study published Tuesday in the
journal Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they don't remember where they've been, but they
can't tell where they're going,'' Duffy said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes motion blindness occurs months before the memory or
language difficulties that characterize Alzheimer's. This
information may help doctors diagnose the disease earlier. Tests of
the sort the Rochester scientists used could also help doctors and
families determine when an Alzheimer's patient needs to stop
driving or move into a supervised living situation, or help monitor
the effect of Alzheimer's drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Motion blindness results from damage to cells in a part of the
brain that processes and interprets the complex flow of information
that the eyes take in when individuals move through the world. This
region is where the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes of the
brain meet. It is distinct from the nearby hippocampus, the
memory-processing center that is also affected by Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of motion blindness, Duffy said, is a perpetual
version of what most people experience momentarily when they cannot
locate their car after shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to the grocery store, park your car, and walk in,
you see this pattern of motion all around you that tells you what
your path was,'' Duffy said. ``When you walk out, you go back along
that path. We've all had the experience of forgetting that path,
but many Alzheimer's patients have this all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Motion blindness is not a cognitive or thinking disorder like
forgetting a conversation or the location of car keys, the
Rochester neuroscientist said. It is a disorder of perception and
perceptual processing.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy and Tetewsky unmasked the disorder by comparing 11
Alzheimer's patients with 12 healthy elders and six college
students in a battery of tests that simulate the visual experience
of motion. Their studies are reported in the journal Neurology
which is being published  &UR; today &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Duffy has also studied rhesus monkeys to determine which brain
structures are involved in perceiving and interpreting visual input
about motion.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments indicate that motion blindness is the product of
two separate deficits in the brain. One is perceptual; for
instance, Alzheimer's patients have difficulty discerning the
direction of motion in a pattern of moving dots.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Alzheimer's patients could tell the dots were moving
in a given direction, they could not use visual cues to judge if
they themselves were moving or standing still _ a disorder not of
visual perception but of interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, people use the apparent motion of objects in the
external world to determine if they are moving, in which direction,
and how fast. Momentary failure of this mechanism occurs when one
is sitting on a train that starts to move; it often takes a moment
before individuals can tell if the train is actually moving.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's patients with motion blindness have this confusion
about self-movement much or all the time, Duffy said. ``They're
unable to put together the visual cues that would allow them to
navigate,'' he said. ``They can become overwhelmed by information
they can't process.''
</P>
<P>
   If further studies confirm the results, Duffy said, the kind of
simple tests the Rochester team used may help doctors diagnose
Alzheimer's and monitor the disease's progress. The researchers
found that some apparently healthy elders with abnormal results on
the visual-motion tests subsequently went on to develop classic
signs of Alzheimer's, a sign that in some people, ``motion
blindness'' can develop before memory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy said that the loss of the ability to navigate can pose
more painful problems for Alzheimer's patients than memory loss.
``Patients are often not so much bothered by not being able to
remember a name,'' he said. ``What bothers them more is that they
can't get to the grocery store and get back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture the gleaming cruiser bearing down in the rear-view
mirror, the sudden pulse of alternating headlights, the officer
striding toward the driver's door.
</P>
<P>
   You're not exceeding the speed limit. Your license,
registration, and inspection sticker are up to date. Your car is in
perfect working order. But your apparent problem: Driving While
Black, an offense, obviously, with no easy remedy, and a plight to
which a white person can barely relate.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the orders come fast and furious. License and
registration, please. Or worse: Out of the car while we conduct a
brief search. Or worst of all: Get into the back of the cruiser;
we're bringing you to the station.
</P>
<P>
   For the length of the stop, the driver has been thrust into a
humiliating world of suspicion, where he is at the mercy of an
officer who regards him not as a husband, father, custodian, or
engineer, but as a possible criminal, based on nothing more than
the color of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Paul L.D.
Russell Jr., pulled over by two Reading police officers in November
for an expired license plate. The officers hauled Russell to the
station and detained him, despite the fact he was driving an
undercover car with blue lights and showed his badge and
credentials. His lawyer mused that if this happened to a black DEA
agent, who else was it happening to?
</P>
<P>
   Here's who: Damien Mahaffey, who works at Bentley College. He
moved to Waltham in July. From August to October, police in
neighboring Belmont pulled him over three times for no good reason,
not once issuing a ticket. His wife was pulled over twice more. It
got so bad that Mahaffey now tells his wife not to drive through
Belmont late at night and advises friends to avoid the town when
they're coming to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's isolated, you chalk it up to an ignorant person,''
says Mahaffey, who has also been helped by Belmont officers when
he's had car trouble. ``But if you have different people doing this
to you, then it's not isolated anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask any group of black men about their roadway predicaments, and
the tales will spill forth, no matter the story teller's physical
appearance, station in life, or history of abiding the law.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, the deputy attorney general of the United States,
said New Jersey troopers approached him at a turnpike rest stop 20
years ago and asked to search his car.
</P>
<P>
   At the Globe, city editor Joe Williams was once pulled over in
Richmond, Va., a block from his apartment, by a screaming police
officer who was about to yank his car door open. But a white woman,
an assault victim, came running up yelling that the officer had the
wrong man. Last year, Williams was followed by a Cambridge cruiser
while walking to an ATM machine, stopped, and questioned. He was
held until the officer radioed a dispatcher and cleared him.
</P>
<P>
   From New Jersey to Maryland to California, stories abound about
roadway injustices, about the subtle and not so subtle consequences
of race. And by every measure, the problem is a complex one.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that blacks, especially young blacks, commit
crimes in greater proportion than whites, many of them crimes
against other blacks. Police should be able to give voice to this
truth without being accused of racism or, as in the case of the
head of the New Jersey State Police, fired from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, law enforcement officials should not try
to translate statistical observations into social policy that casts
a shadow of blame over innocent people. In America, people are not
guilty by association, by gender, by profession, or by race. Thus,
racial profiling is an abomination, a gross violation of people's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of profiling is difficult to quantify. To understand
it, you have to identify it, and police invariably deny that it
exists. Police chiefs and commissioners in Boston, Belmont, and
Brookline declined to return calls Monday. But the problem is
there, lurking around the corner from every black man driving home
from work in the dark of night.
</P>
<P>
   On Beacon Hill, Senator Dianne Wilkerson, a Roxbury Democrat,
has proposed a two-year study period during which police would be
required to track the race, gender, and age of motorists in routine
stops and report them to the state attorney general. ``There is
something going on on our highways,'' Wilkerson said. ``We have to
be big enough in Massachusetts to look into this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good, modest, constructive start to solving a confounding
problem. We should be able to speak truths, flattering or not.

APARTHEID'S VICTIMS FEAR THEY WON'T RECEIVE COMPENSATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRA, South Africa _ Mildred Theys has a song in her head.
She has heard it every day since the night 13 years ago when the
police came. They broke down her door and beat her, and hauled her
eldest son, Christopher, into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   She was left with only their voices, singing in Afrikaans,
``Tonight the birds are going to get food.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son's plight has placed Mildred Theys among thousands of
victms representing one side of South Africa's fragile search for
racial healing. As the country weighs the needs of those who
suffered human rights violations, it is also beginning to grant
amnesty to some of apartheid's most infamous perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   But to many South Africans, there is a sense that amnesty is
unjust, and that reconciliation is hollow, if those who suffered
most are not helped. The nation now finds itself battling over how
best to compensate them.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher survived, but the torture he faced over two long
periods of detention left him mentally enfeebled.
</P>
<P>
   Once a top student and a charismatic youth activist, Christopher
now cannot carry on simple conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Once his family's prospect as a breadwinner, now he is reduced
to sitting beside his mother while she sells candy outside the
gates of his old high school, for a meager income.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred told her son's story to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the panel charged with investigating apartheid human
rights abuses. After reviewing Christopher's case, the commission
declared him a victim. That entitles his family, and those of more
than 20,000 others found to have suffered at the hands of the
apartheid regime, to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The government now says it cannot afford reparations for
individual victims, and may decide instead to make symbolic
gestures, such as national monuments and community halls. The
reaction, among survivors such as Mildred, is closer to bitterness
than resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get mad to see those people get amnesty,'' Mildred said, a
tear streaking her cheek as she retold the story. ``How can they
forgive those people and they don't help my son? Thou shalt not
kill. This is not going to help the country. Seriously not.''
</P>
<P>
   Reparations and amnesty are the primary components of South
Africa's experiment in racial healing. The amnesty provision was a
key part of the agreement that led to democracy in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Whites, though, feared a witch hunt. Amnesty guaranteed that
those who made full disclosures about politically motivated human
rights abuses could avoid prosecution. The tradeoff, it was hoped,
would enable South Africa to learn as much as possible about the
apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
   But something was also needed to address the suffering of
victims and to balance the reconciliation equation. The amnesty
implied that victims would lose the right to legal redress. So when
Parliament passed legislation establishing the Truth Commission, it
included a provision for reparations, which could include a wide
range of possible measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without adequate reparation and rehabilitation measures, there
can be no healing or reconciliation,'' the commission concluded.
``Reparation is essential to counterbalance amnesty, which denies
victims the right to institute civil claims against perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commission concluded most of its work last October,
the amnesty and reparations processes are just beginning to reach
fruition. The Amnesty Committee still must hold public hearings on
roughly 600 cases, and has more than 400 others to decide in
chambers. In recent weeks, however, it has made rulings on a number
of high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
   It denied amnesty, for example, to the five police officers who
interrogated Stephen Biko, the charismatic young leader of the
Black Consciousness Movement, but it cleared a number of ranking
police officials whose names were associated with brutality.
</P>
<P>
   As amnesties go forward, however, reparations lag. The
commission's founding legislation left it to the commission to
recommend, and the Parliament later to enact, specific forms of
redress.
</P>
<P>
   In its final report, the panel argued strongly for financial
payments to individual victims: short-term interim payments of as
much as $1,000 to meet urgent needs and a six-year annual grant of
as much as $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament approved the interim payments, but checks take up to
18 months to reach victims.
</P>
<P>
   The form of final reparations, however, remains unsettled.
President Nelson Mandela's office is reviewing the commission's
proposals, but even the president has indicated that the idea of
individual cash grants probably won't fly.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Hofmeyr, a member of Parliament from the African National
Congress who has worked extensively on the reparations issue,
argues that the framers of the Truth Act never envisioned
significant financial redress for individual victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to balance what we do for individuals with what we do
for victims of apartheid generally,'' he said. The number of people
who testified or submitted statements about what they suffered is a
tiny fraction of the masses who felt apartheid's grip. ``How can we
say that the people who didn't speak out suffered less than those
who did?''
</P>
<P>
   Hofmeyr, reflecting the views of the ANC generally, has
advocated a wider range of reparations targeted toward communities
as well as individuals, including counseling and medical services,
community halls, and monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the amnesty process painless for those who did wrong.
``It doesn't let perpetrators off scot-free,'' Hofmeyr said. ``They
face a significant amount of public censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hlengiwe Mkhize, chairwoman of the commission's reparations
committee, disagrees. Symbolic reparations are important, she says,
but they do not redress individual suffering. Many people, and
their families, suffer from the long-term damage of human rights
abuses, such as interrupted education, homelessness, and
post-traumatic stress. While more suffered than spoke out, she
said, ``it is wrong to compromise those who were willing to take
the risk of revisiting past traumas.''
</P>
<P>
   A final policy is unlikely to take effect anytime soon.
Parliament closes this week, ahead of elections on June 2. Amnesty
decisions, meanwhile, continue to go public. Those victims, who
have lost the right to prosecution because their aggressors have
been granted amnesty, must now wait to hear if they will one day
receive state financial help to begin rebuilding their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The commission essentially said ``we will deny victims justice
because we will give them reparations,'' said Brandon Hamber, an
analyst at the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation
in Johannesburg. ``What gave birth to the TRC? Amnesty. From Day
One, victims were always going to come second. They are never going
to get what they really deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether South Africa can strike a balance
between perpetrator and victim, and whether reconciliation will
follow. In the meantime, Mildred Theys waits.
</P>
<P>
   She has no money to help her three younger children finish
school, no money to give Christopher proper medical and psychiatric
treatment to heal the wounds that began the night he was dragged
away.
</P>
<P>
   All she has is that song in her head.

INDIA'S FILM INDUSTRY DOUBLES HOLLYWOOD'S ANNUAL OUTPUT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY _ Fans of the world's largest film industry were unlikely
to tune in for the Academy Awards. After all, their favorite stars
carried off their trophies more than a week ago right here in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Bollywood, as Bombay is known to fans of Indian cinema, is the
capital of an industry that produces some 800 feature films a year
in several Indian languages. That's well over double the number
made in Hollywood, and almost one-fifth of the world's total.
Revenue from India's colorful song-and-dance extravaganzas and
melodramas surpasses $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film is not a pastime in India. It's a religion,'' said Ranjan
Bakshi, a vice president at Zee Network, a group of wildly popular
satellite TV channels whose bread-and-butter is Indian film and its
spinoff music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans have even heard of Bollywood. But that may soon
change.This year's Academy Awards marked the first time an
English-language movie directed by an Indian has captured the
attention of the Motion Picture Academy. Bombay's Shekhar Kapur
snagged seven Oscar nominations for ``Elizabeth,'' including that
for Best Picture, plus 12 nominations from the British Academy
awards.
</P>
<P>
   The accolades for Kapur's first venture into English-language
film, and the Hollywood offers that have poured in for him, have
movie executives here hopeful that America's film capital will sit
up and take notice of the huge reservoir of film talent in India.
That could mean opportunities for Indian directors, technicians and
actors to cross over into American films, or for joint ventures in
India between Bombay and Hollywood. It could also be an opportunity
for Hollywood to take a page from India's movie-making playbook by
holding down costs and appealing to a growing Third World audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hindi film, the most popular export among Indian language
movies, has a decades-old following among Arab, African, Asian,
Eastern European and Latin American audiences. Last week's Lux Zee
Cine Awards drew an estimated 200 million viewers in 80 countries,
rivaling Oscar and Super Bowl audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met Greek taxi drivers who know Hindi film music. Our
stars are mobbed when they go to Egypt. In all countries where
Indian films are popular _ and that includes China and Japan _ they
are a great affirmation of values people are afraid they are
losing,'' Kapur said from his Bombay office before leaving for the
Oscars. ``They are all about male bonding, about families coming
together, about husbands and wives or mothers and sons reuniting,
about reinforcing religious values.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the whole story. Hindi films have been
nicknamed ``masala movies,'' after the traditional Indian spice
mix, because of their wild blend of romance, action, suspense,
melodrama and music. They follow stock formulas tied to traditional
``family values'' _ with a male chauvinist bias and a requisite
dose of song, dance and violence. They are also full of
contradictions; a full-lip kiss is still considered poor taste,
while pelvic-thrusting dance scenes, wet saris, and rape subplots
are de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   The cliche storyline: boy meets girl, villain separates them,
villain tries to rape someone, fight breaks out, hero wins, boy and
girl get married. All of this is set to a rousing score, with the
stars lip-synching to soprano and tenor soundtracks while they
dance around trees, gyrate in clingy clothes, and sing about love _
all with the help of a huge troupe of extras.
</P>
<P>
   This makes them seem schlocky to American viewers, but they have
huge appeal at home for the fantasy they create _ and with 14
million Indians overseas, for their portrayal of traditional and
modern values in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are more familiar with subtitled art house releases,
such as Kapur's ``The Bandit Queen,'' a true-life biopic about a
low-caste woman who fought back after being gang-raped and rose to
popular goddess status before being elected to Parliament. The late
director Satyajit Ray is revered in cinema circles worldwide.
Bombay native Ismail Merchant has produced acclaimed English films
with director James Ivory. And Harvard graduate Mira Nair got a
Foreign Film Oscar nomination for her story of slum life, ``Salaam
Bombay!''
</P>
<P>
   But in India, with its huge poor and illiterate population,
people aren't looking for cinema verite. Movies have been the main
escapist entertainment venue since the advent of Indian film in
1913. The more fantastic, the better.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 cents for stall seats in small towns, to $2.40 for
balcony seats in fancy theaters in Bombay, cinema-goers can trade
crowded, squalid lives for air-conditioned comfort and be
transported to a world of wealth and glamour.
</P>
<P>
   In large city theaters, the experience is reminiscent of
Shakespeare's day, with the wealthy comfortably ensconced in
balconies while the poor, noisy rabble hoot at love scenes and
shout at villains from the stalls below. The majority of
movie-goers here are young, working-class males, and for them,
Hindi blockbusters portray an India that doesn't exist _ one where
everyone is handsome, wears expensive clothes, and lives in a
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Karan Johar, the 26-year-old first-time director of India's new
smash hit, ``Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'' (``Something, Something
Happens''), is unapologetic about making a bubble-gum romance in
which clean-cut students sport American designer clothes and live
by traditional Indian values.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes you away for three hours to a dream world that is not
India, and you come out feeling good,'' Johar said.
</P>
<P>
   Big-budget pictures often weave in foreign locations with no
explanation or relationship to plot; they are merely a chance for
audiences to visit places they might like to see. Another new film,
the most expensive movie ever made here, at a cost of $8 million _
peanuts by Hollywood standards _ included a song with sequences
shot at each of the Seven Wonders of the World.
</P>
<P>
   Not every film is pure escapism. Many promote tolerance by
showing friendship among different religions, and some reflect
disenchantment with politics, crime or societal inequality.
</P>
<P>
   In this cinema-obsessed nation, many film stars have been
elected to office and a few have risen to god-status, with fans
setting up shrines to pray to them. A former prime minister, P. V.
Narasimha Rao, wrote a screenplay. The nation's most revered
painter, M. F. Husain, became so fixated on a starlet that he saw
her movie over 50 times on the big screen and began painting her
obsessively. Now he's producing her next film.
</P>
<P>
   But as moviegoers here become more discerning, in part through
their exposure to satellite television and Western programs, they
are rejecting the silliest stock conventions of Indian film and
demanding higher quality and better plots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian cinema is becoming more quality-conscious. . .
Illogical, routine formulas are now failing at the box office. The
audience is growing up,'' Johar said.
</P>
<P>
   Changing tastes at home could revolutionize the industry by
making Indian films appeal more to Western viewers. Foreign
countries already account for more than one-fourth of revenues for
some Hindi hits. But more sophisticated fare could make way for a
cross-fertilization between Indian and Western movies.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are already India's biggest cultural export, reaching
millions of overseas Indians and Pakistanis who pack cinemas from
London to Arlington, Mass. ``Kuch Kuch'' out-grossed ``Titanic'' in
South African cities with large Indian populations and hit the top
10 in the United Kingdom on the strength of Hindi-speaking
audiences alone.
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood, poaching Indian film talent and learning from
Bollywood's efficient, low-cost production techniques may become an
economic necessity, as American movie-making costs soar. Here,
high-gloss hits cost just a few million dollars _ as cheap as
shoestring-budget independent films in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budgets are out of hand and the American box office take is
not rising fast enough to keep pace,'' Kapur said, adding that many
Hollywood pictures already depend on overseas markets for as much
as 60 percent of their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``America increasingly needs to make films that succeed on the
international circuit, and that means you have to make your actors
and subjects appealing to an international audience,'' Kapur said.
``Hollywood has no choice.''

AN `EASY' WAY TO ENLARGE A SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you add 203 staterooms, a second swimming pool, and a
second dining room to an existing cruise ship? Just cut it in half
and insert a new midsection. It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what Norwegian Cruise Line has done to Boston's
popular Norwegian Majesty. When the ship returns to its
Boston-Bermuda weekly schedule on April 11, travelers will see not
only a larger ship but also one with added renovations throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Lengthening a ship by cutting it in half is not a new technique.
The cruise line has already done it before on its Norwegian Wind
and Norwegian Dream.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish the lengthening, Norwegian in January sent the
Majesty to Bremerhaven, Germany, where the ship was cut in half.
Then the fore and aft sections were floated apart and the new
prefab midsection inserted. Finally, the three sections were welded
together and internally joined with wiring and plumbing. The prefab
section was begun some nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the ship's length this way has economic benefits, as
well as minimizing the time the ship is out of service. ``The fact
that this lengthening can be accomplished at two-thirds the price,
per berth, of a new ship building while actually lowering the
operating costs per guest is an added bonus to our efforts to
improve both our product and our bottom line at the same time,''
said Art Sbarsky, NCL's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Majesty has increased its passenger capacity by 40
percent, from 1,056 to 1,462 passengers. In addition to adding
staterooms and other facilities, the Palace Theater has been
enhanced with improved seating, the Royal Observatory now doubles
as a sports bar with sports memorabilia and television monitors,
staterooms have new colors and comforts, two additional elevators
have been added, and even crew accommodations have been increased
from 438 to 570.
</P>
<P>
   The new 274-seat Four Seasons Dining Room will offer panoramic
sea views through floor-to-ceiling windows; a new 58-seat Le Bistro
restaurant is next door featuring alternative dining, and the
existing 574-seat Seven Seas Dining Room, formerly known as the
Epicurean Restaurant, is being updated with new chairs and
carpeting. The Majesty will also offer more room for sunning with
the addition of a Sky Deck. There's also a new casino, coffee bar,
and other features.
</P>
<P>
   Sbarsky says the lengthening offers the Majesty a more sleek and
hydrodynamic profile, allowing the ship to maintain its 20-knot
speed with the same power plant despite the ship's added size and
amenities. The Majesty is growing from 568 feet to 680 feet and
increasing in tonnage from 32,400 tons to 38,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Majesty will offer 30 weekly cruises from Boston's
Black Falcon Cruise Terminal to Bermuda, followed by a 10-day
voyage from Boston to San Juan on Oct. 24. Beginning Nov. 3, the
Majesty will feature a series of 10- and 11-day Panama Canal
cruises between San Juan and Acapulco.

   Orient Lines is featuring cruise-tour vacations of the Greek
isles and Mediterranean from April through October. The five- to
seven-day cruises depart from Rome, Athens, Barcelona, and Istanbul
and are coupled with included stays in some of Europe's finest
hotels before and after the voyage, along with sightseeing,
transfers, and more. Complete vacations from 12 to 18 days begin at
$1,550 and air fare is available beginning at $595 round trip from
New York.

</P>
<P>
   Cunard is offering a special Mother's Day one-day, one-night
cruise from New York on May 9. The special sailing allows mothers
and families to enjoy dining, a garden-party tea, entertainment,
and dancing lessons. The cruise sampler ranges from $199 to $1,699
a person.

</P>
<P>
   A collection of three cruises showcasing some of the country's

Baltimore May 28 and 30. The weekend cruises depart Fridays at 3
p.m., returning Sunday at 9 p.m. On Sept. 28, the ship will offer a
weeklong cruise calling on Newport, R.I.; Portland, Maine; and
Halifax, Nova Scotia.

For food lovers
</P>
<P>
   Menus faithfully culled from dynastic history will be featured
during the Three Emperors' Dinner on a 10-night cruise from
Edinburgh to Stockholm beginning July 4. The cruise aboard Radisson
Seven Seas' 180- passenger Song of Flower will include a
reenactment of the lavish feast enjoyed by Kaiser Wilhelm I of
Germany, Tsar Alexander II of Russia, and Alexander III at a Paris
restaurant on June 7, 1867.

chartered bus that meets the boat at docks to take travelers to
historical and scenic spots, then brings them to a variety of inns
and hotels where their luggage will be waiting. The cruises are
planned for June 13-20, Sept. 12-19. Sept. 26-Oct. 3, and Oct.
10-17. The all-inclusive cost is $1,890. For information, call Karl

GOVERNOR SHOULD BUILD BRIDGES TO UNIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knowing that organized labor almost made Scott Harshbarger a
winner in a close gubernatorial election last fall, Governor Paul
Cellucci ought to consider building _ not burning _ bridges between
his administration and the many unions that campaigned against him.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, as was expected, Cellucci is rewarding some of the
unions that endorsed his candidacy. Teamsters Local 25 received
$125,000 from the governor's budget for a truck-driving program.
The money reportedly was shifted from the state AFL-CIO's training
programs to the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts,
which endorsed Cellucci early in his campaign, received, among
other rewards, a generous increase in a $1 million fire education
program that pays overtime to firefighters who teach prevention in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign last year, Cellucci received the support of
the carmen's union, which received a generous collective bargaining
agreement with the Cellucci administration as well as a kept
promise to abandon the privatization program, which was once a core
of the Weld-Cellucci administration.
</P>
<P>
   While it is expected that Cellucci will reward unions who helped
him get into the governor's chair, it may not be so prudent to
punish the unions that backed Harshbarger. That apparently is what
the Cellucci administration is doing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the administration recently removed a union
representative of IBEW Local 103, which backed Harshbarger, from
the state Electricians Licensing Board and replaced him with a
non-union contractor who is a member of Associated Builders and
Contractors.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Cellucci may have further alienated the IBEW
(International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) and other unions
by appointing a non-union member to the licensing board.
</P>
<P>
   And shifting state funds from the state AFL-CIO's training
program to the Teamsters Local 25 truck-driving training program
will serve only to enhance the possibility of an even stronger
AFL-CIO campaign against him in the 2002 election, especially if
the Democrat is a more widely accepted prolabor candidate than was
Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's apparent decision to punish the unions who backed
Harshbarger may backfire, almost assuring that the state AFL-CIO,
which represents most of the larger unions in Massachusetts, will
endorse the next Democratic gubernatorial candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And ``endorse'' is the key word Cellucci might carefully review.
Under the state AFL-CIO's guidelines, a gubernatorial candidate
must receive two-thirds of the voting members of the AFL-CIO board
to be endorsed by the labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   If he reversed himself by working with, and not against, the
unions that endorsed his Democratic challenger, though he might not
be endorsed by the AFL-CIO, but he might prevent his next
Democratic opponent from receiving the necessary two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   As Cellucci well knows, it was the AFL-CIO's resources, along
with a few other unions, that nearly snatched victory from the
governor in the last hours of the election. If Cellucci continues
to alienate the unions that voted for Harshbarger's endorsement, as
well as adding a few more to the list, the governor is virtually
assured an even stronger campaign against him from organized labor
in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Cellucci believes he can win again without union support
in 2002. But he might consider that if Harshbarger had been more
appealing to rank-and-file union members, Harshbarger would be
governor  &UR; today &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In essence, by building rather than burning bridges with the
AFL-CIO and its affiliated unions, Cellucci would be working toward
another successful campaign, rather than going down in flames.

BOOK GROUPS AND OPRAH MAKE FOR UNLIKELY BEST SELLER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Reader,'' a sparely written but morally complex,
erotically charged novel by an obscure German writer, begins with a
startling image: an adolescent boy throwing up in public.
</P>
<P>
   Unromantic as it is, the incident leads to a passionate affair
with a mysterious woman more than twice his age, a former SS guard
at Auschwitz suspected of responsibility in the deaths of hundreds
of female concentration camp inmates. Only she knows the full
extent of her guilt, but that's not her most closely guarded
secret.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely candidate for bestsellerdom, one might think. But,
think again. After a slow start _ it's been in print in this
country for nearly two years _ ``The Reader'' by Bernhard Schlink
(Pantheon/Vintage) is suddenly heading for big sales and the top of
best-seller lists. Thanks to the enthusiasm of reading groups
around the country _ and especially to Oprah Winfrey, who picked
``The Reader'' as her book club's March selection _ Schlink is
about to become a literary household name in America.
</P>
<P>
   A German state court judge, Schlink also teaches law at Humboldt
University in Berlin and will appear on Oprah's show next Tuesday.
He will be questioned about ``The Reader'' both by Winfrey and
members of her book club. ``I think it's going to be great,'' he
said on the phone from his home in Bonn. ``I understand that she is
very smart and well-read and I look forward to an interesting
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   One question the 55-year-old Schlink is likely to be asked but
seems reluctant to answer directly is whether the ``The Reader,''
set in post-war Germany, is autobiographical. ``This is a book
about my generation and there are things in it from my life, but
it's a novel and that's not the same as an autobiography,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it can be read as a parable of German guilt, atonement,
and yearning for absolution, ``The Reader'' is also a love story
and a tale of crime, punishment, and perhaps redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The reader of the title and narrator of the novel is Michael
Berg, who at its start is 15 and suffering from hepatitis. When he
gets sick in the street on the way to school one morning, Hanna
Schmitz, a 36-year-old street-car conductor, takes him into her
apartment and cleans him up. At his mother's suggestion, Michael
brings Hanna flowers as a gesture of thanks and they begin an
affair that is both intensely erotic and strangely ritualized.
After lovemaking they take turns bathing each other and then, at
her insistence, Michael reads to Hanna from one of the classics he
is studying in school.
</P>
<P>
   The affair ends when Hanna abruptly disappears, leaving Michael
feeling both guilty and betrayed. Did he do something wrong? Or was
something done to him?
</P>
<P>
   They meet again when Michael is a 21-year-old law student
attending a war crimes trail at which Hanna is a defendant. He
realizes then what her real secret is, one so shameful to her that
rather than reveal it, she admits to something she didn't do.
Filled with revulsion at her crimes, Michael can't bring himself to
intervene and Hanna is given a long jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, after a failed marriage and a retreat into legal
scholarship, Michael begins to read his favorite books into a
recorder and sending the tapes to Hanna. After a time, she starts
writing him notes commenting on the books he reads and they develop
a new kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   When Hanna has completed her sentence and is to be released from
prison, the now middle-aged Michael must directly confront feelings
about her, the generation she represents, and his own future. The
result is poignant and tragic but also hopeful, suggesting that for
Michael, and Germany, it's now possible to address the past without
being dominated by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a book about the Holocaust; we have had many books
in German about that,'' Schlink says. ``But it's one of the first
books about my generation dealing with the generation from the war.
Many people feel that our generation is finally finding its voice.
We have had a hard time freeing ourselves from a fixation on the
generation before and you can't understand us unless you understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His own father, Schlink says, was a professor of theology who
lost his teaching position when the Nazis came to power. A Lutheran
minister, he did not serve in the military in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Published in Switzerland in 1995, ``The Reader'' was an
immediate critical and popular success in Germany. It has since
been translated from German into more than a dozen languages.
Americans at first showed little interest in the book, and a
promotional tour by Schlink in 1997 attracted almost no attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a real word-of-mouth book and a book-group
book,'' says Katie Barrett, publicity director of Vintage Books.
Random House, which own Pantheon and Vintage, does not release
sales figures but Barrett reports that, although the book was well
received by critics, it sold only modestly in the hardcover
Pantheon edition. Since it came out in paperback early last autumn,
however, sales have ``increased substantially'' every month with
multiple sales to reading groups given much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Selection by Oprah has been known to increase a book's sales by
half a million copies or more, and ``The Reader'' is reportedly now
selling briskly on line and in bookstores around the country,
largely in the $11 Vintage trade paperback edition. And the book is
near the top of Amazon .com's ``Hot 100'' list _ at No. 5, it is
outpacing even ``Monica's Story,'' which is at No. 18. On Sunday,
``The Reader'' was No. 1 on the New York Times paperback fiction
bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   As much as readability, discussability is what makes for a good
reading-group book. Besides food for thought, ``The Reader''
provides topics almost guaranteed to produce lively exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I enjoyed the discussions about it even better than
the book itself. There were six of us and we all had different
opinions,'' says Paula Hartstein, member of a Newton book group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy read but grows increasingly demanding as it goes
on and raises uncomfortable moral issues,'' notes Virginia Inglis
of Needham, a member of the same group. ``I was challenged and
stunned by some of the things I got out of it.'
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, ``The Reader'' belongs to a recognized literary
genre with the formidable name of Vergangenheitsbewaltigung, which
means ``coming to terms with the past.'' For American readers,
however, the novel fits into no such neat category.
</P>
<P>
   Some see it as a story of obsessive love. To others, it's about
the sexual abuse of a child, the punishment of a war criminal, the
destructive effect of secrets on relationships, the banality of
evil, and the healing power of literature. Still others see it as
an apology for the Holocaust and an indictment of the
self-righteousness and self-absorption of Germany's post-war
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion in reading groups is about the character
and motives of Hanna, who is central to the novel but sketchily
described by Schlink. He gives her little to say, for instance,
doesn't describe her in detail, and gives few clues about her
motives.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many of the adults who loomed large in the early
lives of his generation, says Schlink, much about her is mysterious
_ especially her past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanna was a mystery to Michael, and I have mixed feelings
about her,'' he acknowledges. ``She had a brutal side and was
brutal during the Third Reich and to Michael afterward. But in a
way she was also a lost soul. It would be easier for us if these
people were all just monsters, but that's not the way it was.'

A RANDOM WALK DOWN STAT STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Users of the Club, proclaims the radio ad, ``are 400 percent
less likely to have their cars stolen.'' United Parcel Service's
retirement compensation, the Globe reports, is ``213 percent less
than United Airlines.'' A forecaster says there's a 50 percent
chance of rain on Saturday and a 50 percent chance on Sunday, hence
a 100 percent likelihood of weekend showers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 100 percent less of any amount is zero, the Club is
absolutely guaranteeing your car won't be stolen, and then some.
Those poor UPS pensioners must be paying their former employers,
rather than collecting retirement checks. And the weatherperson
shouldn't need a calculator to figure out that in this case, 50
plus 50 does not equal 100; experience alone should make that clear
enough.
</P>
<P>
   These goofs are examples of innumeracy, as the counterpart of
illiteracy has been called since the word was coined around
midcentury. (In his 1993 book ``200 percent of Nothing,'' A. K.
Dewdney credits the coinage to Douglas Hofstadter, the cognitive
scientist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author. But the Oxford English
Dictionary's first citation comes from a British report on
education, dated 1959, when Hofstadter was just 14. He could have
come up with the term independently _ he's a smart guy _ but it
seems unlikely that an American child's coinage would burrow so
rapidly into British educational lingo.)
</P>
<P>
   John Allen Paulos, who recounts the forecaster's blunder in his
1988 book ``Innumeracy,'' thinks word people should be doing less
verbal nit-picking and more calculating. ``I remember once
listening to someone at a party drone on about the difference
between continually and continuously,'' he writes. Yet later that
 &UR; evening &LR; , the forecaster's blooper ``went right by the self-styled
grammarian.''
</P>
<P>
   The sporting world, for some reason, attracts people at once
devoted to numbers and wildly indifferent to probability. The same
people who calculate free-throw percentages and earned run averages
with ease will talk about ``hot bats'' and ``streaks'' to describe
series of events that are not, statistically speaking, unexpected.
As we discovered last spring, in an early foray into the subject,
even sportswriters differ on how many wins (or losses) it takes to
make a streak.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, it looks as if this year it's got a new
name. Last year's losing streak is this year's on the schneid, an
old term for a cold spell that's having a hot season among sports
commentators. Richard Roeper, a Chicago Sun-Times columnist, was
moved to protest last week that the buzz of the schneid was already
deafening: ``I used to think the most grating and overused term in
sports was `He goes yard,' which has nearly replaced `He hits a
home run' in the vernacular of some sportscasters,' writes Roeper.
``But `go yard' is pure baseball, whereas `off the schneid'' is
much more versatile and thus ubiquitously annoying. . . . Soon
we'll be hearing that if Susan Lucci ever wins an Emmy, she'll
finally be `off the schneid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As Paul Dickson explains in The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary,
a 1999 update of the 10-year-old compendium, schneid is derived
from schneider, a term denoting a major loss in various card games.
(Schneider, in turn, comes from the German for ``cutter,'' or
tailor.) When you get off the schneid, you've put the losing streak
(real or perceived) behind you. Already, as Roeper notes, the word
is being extended to mean ``jinx,'' as in ``put the schneid on
Kerry Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   How schneid got from the tailor's shop to the card table to the
baseball diamond remains unclear, says Dickson, but it's not a
question that's generated much speculation. The mysterious fungo,
on the other hand, generates many paragraphs of competing theories
with their roots in fun/go, fungible, and fungus, among others. And
the debate over Chinese home run _ racial slur or corruption of
``Chaney's home run'' in a turn-of-the-century game in Salem? _ is
equally entertaining, if equally inconclusive. If someone's put the
schneid on the Sox this season, Dickson's dictionary may provide
fans an alternative baseball fix.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a word to the wise sports reporter: Whatever's going on
with Garciaparra's arm, it's his biceps we're talking about. Ain't
no such thing as a bicep: Singular or plural, it's biceps, from the
Latin for ``two-headed.'' Drop that final s, and the language gods
just might put the schneid on you.
</P>

the new memoir by President Clinton's former adviser, George

 (Undated): ... ``different environment''
<TEXT>
<P>
   And it is an environment that some prominent scholars say is
necessary. Harvey Cox, professor at Harvard Divinity School, who
calls Daly a prophet, says that women talk differently about things
when men are not present, ``and that's simply a fact of life. So
while it's important to have inclusive education, I am still aware
of the fact we haven't moved beyond patriarchy. If and when we ever
do, all education, without exception, could be coed. But we aren't
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College would like to differ. Administrators at the
Jesuit school insist that barring men from the classroom is a form
of sexual discrimination prohibited by both Title IX and school
policy. What's more, they say, they've been telling Daly that for
25 years. Jack Dunn, a college spokesman, says that Daly has been
reprimanded several times in connection with eight male students
who have objected to being excluded over the years. In one 1979
case, a university official escorted the student into her class for
several weeks until he dropped out. In the other cases, the male
students dropped the matter, or Daly took one of many leaves of
absence. This time, however, BC says Daly must agree to teach men
in her class. Or she's out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was avoided in previous years. It will not be avoided
now,'' says Dunn. ``We will not back down. It is a legal issue. It
is a fairness issue. It is a justice issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, some wonder, is it an issue that Mary Daly is fighting at
70? Why, after all these years of wrangling with BC, hasn't she
just gone somewhere else? Partly because the market for feminist
separatists is not exactly roaring. But equally because, as Daly
sees it, ``patriarchy is universal,'' so what would it matter?
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that one day last fall senior Duane Naquin showed
up in her classroom. Naquin, 22, wanted to take her course on
feminist ethics. But when he sat down on the first day of class,
Daly took him out to the hall and, according to Naquin, ``she said,
`I do not allow men in my class.' She added, `It's nothing
personal, it's just because you're a man.' I found that very
offensive, completely irrelevant of who I was. I was literally
awestruck.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Daly offered to teach Naquin individually, Naquin said
he wasn't interested and went to school officials. He also got a
lawyer at the the Center for Individual Rights, a conservative
Washington, D.C., law firm that has successfully challenged
race-based admissions in Texas, and says it has 30 lawsuits
pending. In a fund-raising letter, the group identifies one of its
priorities as ``the increasingly urgent task of confronting radical
feminist doctrines and ideology.'' In October, BC received a letter
from the firm threatening to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and her lawyer argue that she was only reprimanded once in
1989 and that otherwise BC never objected to her practice of
teaching men privately. That they are doing so now, she contends,
is because they know it's a hard time for all ``deviants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing something ethically wrong,'' Daly declares.
``And all this stuff about legalism, this is nerdy-turdy little
legalism, legalist fundamentalism. It's just like religious
fundamentalism. Deadly. Nonintellectual. Stifling. It's not about
fairness. It's just evil.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``I am calling upon Boston College and other
universities not to succumb to right-wing pressure. To realize this
is not about discrimination. It is about dumbing down and creating
a white male monoculture.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the first time she has called for action. In a way,
she's been doing that throughout her career, ever since BC denied
her tenure in 1969 and then, astoundingly, reversed itself after
1,500 students _ all men, as women were not admitted at the time _
marched in protest. In 1971, when Daly became the first woman to
preach at Harvard University's Memorial Church, she led a walkout
of a third of the congregation in protest of patriarchy. Three
years later, Daly was denied full professorship at BC and she
remains an associate professor.
</P>
<P>
   That fact is seen by some as a measure of her unrelenting
commitment to her cause. ``I regard Mary Daly as a prophet,''
declares Jim Carroll, a writer and former Catholic priest. ``She is
right, and religious establishments of almost all kinds are wrong.
Just by staying at BC all these years, by refusing to allow herself
to be changed, she has helped keep alive a broader hope that even
those of us who are not radical on the subject can cling to. If
there were no Mary Daly, all of us would be impoverished.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, however, admits that he stopped reading Daly's books
long ago, finding them too ``exclusivist.'' And there are those who
find Daly's provocative, sometimes self-righteous manner
alienating. During an interview, for example, Daly responded to
several questions by reading aloud from one of her books, once
exclaiming, ``This is very well written.'' Asked about the
difficulty of writing during her legal battle, she warned a
reporter not to portray her as a victim. ``The last thing I am is a
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's legendary and ribald humor _ nowhere more evident than in
her 1987 book, ``Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the
English Language,'' a collection of post-patriarchial definitions _
seems at low ebb these days. She later telephoned the reporter to
say that she had been tired during the interview and could not
recall much of what she had said as she was taking antibiotics
``the size of horse pills'' because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Coakley, a professor at Harvard Divinity School, recalls
when Daly was invited to speak at the school three years ago during
Women's History Month. Daly was nearly an hour late. When she
finally arrived, she said she had forgotten something and then
walked into an adjacent library, according to Coakley, passing
through an emergency doorway and tripping the alarm. When at last
she began to speak, she did not give an original address, but read
from one of her published books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, on the one hand she's the grand old lady of feminist
theology, so she was applauded, but other people were fed up with
the laziness of the whole thing,'' says Coakley. ``I have great
admiration for her, but I don't want to get too near her, frankly.
I find her absolutely infuriating.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, suggests Coakley, do many younger women who recoil at
the notion of feminism, much less separatism. ``Mary Daly looks
like a bag lady who has been rejected by society and does not
represent the glamour and consumer success which by and large they
want. She may be a historic figure, but she is not for them a
desirable model. They precisely do not want to be like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Heyward, a theology professor at Episcopal Divinity
School and a lesbian feminist who briefly taught men and women
separately in the early 1980s, finds Daly's focus on gender at once
inspirational and annoying. ``Mary Daly has the guts a lot of us
don't,'' says Heyward, 53, who is also an Episcopal priest. ``But
it is more complicated than she often says it is.''
</P>
<P>
   On the BC campus, curiously, Daly has had a less polarizing
impact. While faculty members have keen opinions about her
writings, many have never met or even seen her, given that Daly has
spent 14 of her 33 years at BC on leave. A conservative student
newspaper once ran a piece titled ``Can You Spot Mary Daly?'' Daly,
according to other faculty members, does not attend faculty
meetings or collaborate with her colleagues, and her campus
presence is limited to her occasional classes. So it is with
decidedly mixed emotions that the campus community now reads of her
in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has definitely been underappreciated as a scholar at BC,''
says theology professor Lisa Sowle Cahill. ``But her refusal to
allow men into her class I do not find defensible. If we as a
university are committed to inclusion in the classroom, then to
exclude men or women is not defensible.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a prevailing perception of Daly as man-hater, a
few say it is flat-out wrong. John McDargh, an associate theology
professor at BC for 18 years, says that Daly has gone out of her
way to work with some male students. He told of one
African-American student who had been beaten by white students and
was about to drop out when Daly took him under her wing and taught
him how to survive in a hostile environment. Now, McDargh thinks
Daly has become a target for antifeminist backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real sorrow at the way in which this woman whose
scholarly contributions, whatever you think about them, have been
unquestionably transformative of the way in which we think about
religion and gender, is coming to the end of her career in a way
that feels demeaning and insulting,'' says McDargh. ``I think she
is genuinely afraid of her future, of unemployment and no income.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she would say so. Daly bristles at pedestrian questions
about money, rolls her eyes on the subject of health insurance. She
is a stolid combatant, publicly at least, and words are her
weapons, not emotion. If, at times in the past, Daly has
contemplated retirement, if she has gazed out her window at the
shimmering waters of Crystal Lake and thought of a different kind
of life, if she has simply felt tired of it all, now she cannot.
The ax is still aloft.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, maybe that is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no defeating this woman at this point,'' says
Carroll. ``She has made her point very powerfully. She has forced
BC to deal with her right from the beginning, and to BC's credit
they have. So she changed BC, surely. She changed us all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Daly is a world-recognized theologian and radical feminist
philosopher. She has written seven books and exults in the
possibility of language. Some hail her as a prophet. Even those who
do not nod to her linguistic inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But do not for a minute think that Daly, 70, who has six
graduate degrees and has taught at Boston College for more than
three decades, lets all that education get in the way of her point.
</P>
<P>
   On men: ``They have nothing to offer but
</P>
<P>
   doodoo.''
</P>
<P>
   On herself: ``I'm a positively revolting hag.''
</P>
<P>
   On BC: ``My employer is stupid. It's the same old thing they've
been doing all along, oppressing women.''
</P>
<P>
   On federal law that may bar her from excluding men from her
classes: ``Nerdy-turdy little legalism.''
</P>
<P>
   On that last one, Daly's future now teeters precariously. After
a quarter-century of wary wrangling over Daly's insistence on a
women-only classroom _ she teaches privately the few men who
persist _ BC told her earlier this year that she must admit men or
retire. But if school administrators thought now might be an
opportune time to rid themselves of the sizzling tongue that has
lashed them all these years, if they thought the old radical would
slip quietly into the dark of a conservative night, or that Daly
might even want to spend her eighth decade reflecting in her small
Newton apartment overlooking Crystal Lake, they were very, very
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Daly has spent a lifetime aiming her slingshot as high as
she could see, and then pointed it a little higher. She is not
ready to lay it down. She took her first shot at the Catholic
Church, universal oppressor of women. Then there was God the
Father, dismissed as the manifestation of global patriarchy. And
the young men who wanted to get into her class on feminist ethics.
And then the women who fault her separatism as simplistic, who
criticize her for ignoring the issues of race and class. All of
which leaves the federal government and its Title IX, which
prohibits sexual discrimination at schools that receive federal
funds, looking like a knock-kneed 100-pounder clinging to the
ropes. Or so she might hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Title IX was meant to give equality to women. To reverse it
into this caricature now, to try and give equality to men in a
white male-dominated society, is absurd,'' fumes Daly. ``It's
irrelevant to the discussion. . . . And no one even sees that it's
funny. That's the worst part. They don't even laugh. What? Mary
Daly and Title IX! It's too bizarre for comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, however, is not exactly laughing. Mary Daly may have been
a vaunted heroine of the 1970s with the double ax of the amazon
gripped in her hand, her in-your-face lesbianism, and her book
``Gyn/Ecology,'' in which she describes atrocities committed by men
against women and prescribes a pure state of female being. She may
thump the couch arm and insist that feminism is strong as ever. She
may be lionized by those who admire her sheer intellectual force
and originality, if not her authoritarian manner.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed and Daly's separatism is as repugnant to
some young women as it is to the men who are its target. The
lawyers in her fight with BC are just beginning to battle in
earnest, but Daly's practice of excluding men, variably tolerated
as a benign eccentricity or lauded as fair redress, may now be
found illegal.
</P>
<P>
   It is a battle of principle, a fitting finale to a career that
has sought no less than to alter the course of world civilization.
For just as BC has drawn its line in the sand, so Daly refuses to
surrender on a point that goes to the heart of her philosophy and
life's work. On leave _ the university says it is unpaid, but
Daly's lawyer says she is receiving her salary _ since this latest
go-round over her policy erupted after a male student objected to
exclusion, Daly has rejected a retirement package and is uncertain
what to do next. But on one thing she is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to be myself,'' exclaims Daly. ``I'm Mary Daly. I'm
tough. I'm strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is not polite. On a blustery winter afternoon recently,
Daly is fresh back from an out-of-town speaking engagement the
night before. A reporter arrives at the door of her second-floor
apartment for an interview three minutes early. Daly opens the door
and stares. The reporter apologizes for being early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do early,'' Daly says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter offers to leave, or sit quietly in a corner until
Daly is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still feel your vibes,'' says Daly, shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   When the reporter returns 15 minutes later, Daly is welcoming,
but not much happier. Although she has agreed to talk about her
dispute with BC, questions about Title IX are ``boring,'' she
grumbles, her employer ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   What she wants to talk about are her books, which are tucked in
the stacks that line the walls of her four-room apartment, about
her philosophy, and about her post-Christian feminism that she
first articulated in her internationally acclaimed book, ``Beyond
God the Father,'' in 1973. She wants to talk about her work as a
``Pirate, Righteously Plundering and Smuggling back to women the
gems which have been stolen from us by the patriarchal thieves,''
as she wrote in her 1992 intellectual autobiography, ``Outercourse:
The Be-Dazzling Voyage.'' She wants to talk about the four spiral
galaxies that compose the theological voyage that took her from her
birth in the year Oh!, as she calls it, and away not just from the
Catholic Church but Christianity and the ``necrophilia of
patriarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for the intrusion of the BC affair, she would, in
fact, be sitting at the cluttered desk in the middle of her living
room, right there beneath the posters from her speaking engagements
and the pictures of spider webs and dragons, cat toys strewn about
her feet, writing a sequel to her last book, ``Quintessence . . .
Realizing the Archaic Future: A Radical Elemental Feminist
Manifesto,'' about the sixth dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this daughter of Schenectady, N. Y., only child of a
traveling salesman and a telephone operator, product of 26 years of
Catholic schooling, is sitting in her baggy blue pants and black
sneakers in an apartment she has rented for 10 years talking about
lawyers. Her amiable gray cat, F. Cat Draiochta O'Dalaigh _ F. is
for Fearless, Draiochta means ```of magic''' in Irish, and
O'Dalaigh is a Daly ancestor _ is rubbing determinedly against her
thigh. She is running her hands through her short-cropped gray hair
and explaining why it so important that her female students have a
classroom of their own, a space removed from the omnipresent
patriarchy, so that they are not inhibited by men or slowed by the
men's inability to understand woman's experience. So they are able,
in short, ``to forge ahead. To soar!'' Even the small candle
burning on the bookshelf cannot leaven her grim approach to all
this explaining. Yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a man were in the class he would be very likely to say,
`Oh, no. I am oppressed too.' . . . He would say, `I can't cry. I'm
not allowed to express myself, wah, wah,' '' Daly explains,
feigning tears. ``OK. Let them go talk among themselves and
complain. Not everything is about you, you, you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not being mean,'' adds Daly. ``I'm trying to be good to my
female students and give them what they are longing for and they
cannot find in the whole big monstrous institution.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of people agree with her. Daly, who joined BC in 1966,
taught only men until women were admitted in 1970 and began
teaching men and women separately in 1974. Since then, Daly has
offered to teach males privately and has done so, she says, in
about a dozen cases. And that's just the way some female students
like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her class was the most engaging, amazing personal experience I
have had at this school,'' says BC senior Kelly Matthews, one of 14
students who sent a letter to college administrators last month
supporting Daly. ``I generally do not feel uncomfortable voicing my
opinion when men are in a class, but I absolutely prefer all-woman
space to discuss women's topics. It is a vastly different
environment.''

TERRENCE MURRAY PLAYS `BOSTON CARD' AND WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When Terrence Murray, Fleet Financial Group Inc.'s
chief executive, launched his latest attempt to persuade BankBoston
Corp.'s Charles Gifford to merge, he used more than charts and
spreadsheets to pitch a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to Gifford's strong attachment to the proud,
215-year-old BankBoston, Murray also played to his rival's loyalty
to the city of Boston. By teaming up, he argued, the two companies
could ward off bidders from outside the region, ensuring the
survival of a large hometown bank in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic theme Terry developed was, `Together, we can have a
Boston-based, world-class, sophisticated institution,'' said a
BankBoston executive involved in the transaction. ``The region and
the economy will benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   That Fleet, which descends from a Providence institution founded
in 1791, never talks about its own historic roots suggests how
little Murray cares for tradition. So it is not surprising that as
Murray pitched his merger idea, he masterfully transformed
Gifford's image of Boston past into a vision of Boston future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry,'' the source said, ``played the Boston card.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the feisty Fleet chief dealt himself a winner. Last
week, after clinching a blockbuster deal to buy BankBoston for $16
billion, Murray _ the son of a factory worker from blue-collar
Woonsocket R.I. _ firmly established himself as king of the hill in
New England banking. Although Fleet had long ago surpassed
BankBoston as the region's biggest bank, Murray's takeover of
America's oldest bank marked the ultimate victory for the
59-year-old businessman. Once seen as an interloper, Murray had
finally taken hold of the crown, in effect dethroning his rival,
the epitome of Brahmin Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray is now more than just the head of the nation's
eighth-largest bank. The new company, Fleet Boston Corp., has a
combined $178 billion in assets and has overnight emerged as a
superregional bank that analysts expect to become a strong national
and international competitor. In coming years, Murray is likely to
mold the new company in his trademark aggressive style, lending
Boston an image that is perhaps more entrepreneurial and less
buttoned-down.
</P>
<P>
   More straight-talking, hard-nosed businessman than polite,
pin-striped Yankee, and full of burlap speech that contrasts with
Gifford's gossamer rhetoric, Murray is likeable and full of
home-spun stories.
</P>
<P>
   He is also brusque and private _ qualities that lead many
observers to view him as the antithesis of the socially active
Gifford, a man dubbed ``Mr. Boston'' for his community work.
</P>
<P>
   While Murray is widely admired around town for his business
sense and corporate charity, he doesn't appear to care much about
what people think of him. By contrast, civic-minded Gifford, 56, is
protective _ and promotive _ of BankBoston's public image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry probably sees making the bank strong and competitive as
his major contribution to the city, as opposed to being more
social,'' said John Cullinane, a Boston-based investor who has
known Murray for three decades. ``I honestly don't think he'll be
as high profile and social as Chad.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to what he calls the ``core values'' of Fleet Boston,
Murray spoke in an interview last week of ``a determined sense of
responsibility to our region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about the arts, humanities, the community,'' said
the red-haired Murray, a prodigious reader of biographies and an
avid collector of American 19th and 20th century landscapes. He
recently bought his first nude.
</P>
<P>
   How generous a corporate donor Fleet Boston will be remains to
be seen. In any case, Murray likes to keep much of Fleet's
corporate giving private. (The company, bigger than its rival,
donated $13.5 million to various causes last year, compared with
BankBoston's $11.5 million).
</P>
<P>
   But already there are positive signs, including a pledge by the
new company to create a $100 million charitable foundation. Of
course, Gifford will take over Fleet Boston when Murray retires in
2001, under a carefully crafted succession plan laid out in the
merger pact. And Murray could not have done his deal without equal
cooperation from his old rival, with whom he says he has become
fast friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Murray's imprimateur on Boston promises to be
distinct.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as an outsider by many Bostonians despite his Irish
ancestry, even after he barged his way into town by acquiring the
failed Bank of New England eight years ago, Murray has always
scorned status. He is happiest at his residences in Providence and
Narragansett, R.I., shooting the breeze with old friends. (He also
maintains an art- and antique-filled apartment overlooking Boston
Public Garden).
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger agreement, Boston was in danger of becoming an
anomaly. In an era of rapid consolidation, in which both Fleet and
BankBoston became takeover prey for larger banks from outside the
region, the city might have continued to grow as the world's mutual
fund capital but without a major hometown bank. It could still end
up that way if a company outside the region sets its sights on the
new Fleet Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, Murray has ensured that Boston at least
in some ways is more like Zurich _ a city with giant banks, money
management firms, and insurers _ than Dallas, where once-large
banks have been sold to competitors outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has certainly had ample practice being the gobbler rather
than the gobbled. With the exception of BayBanks Inc., which
BankBoston bought in 1996, Murray has spent the past 10 years
cobbling together a regional empire by acquiring many of the most
attractive midsize franchises in the Northeast, including Norstar
Bancorp., Shawmut National Corp., and NatWest Bank. More recently,
he shaped Fleet into a diversified financial services company by
acquiring credit card, money management, and stock brokerage
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a company that could become national in scope but is
still rooted on Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some respects, Boston is very sophisticated,'' Murray mused
in his downtown Fleet office. He repeatedly looked at a telescope
perched on the sill of his 37th-floor window. ``In others, it's
very local. It takes decades for (traditional viewpoints) to break
down here, where it just takes years in other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has always stood somewhat aloof from Boston's social
whirlwind. When he chaired the city's American Ireland Fund gala in
November, he seemed to take a rare step into the public spotlight
more out of pride in his ethnic heritage than out of a desire to
schmooze with the movers and shakers of the Boston Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about Terry Murray is that he responded to the
distant drum of the ancestral echo,'' said Kingsley Aikins, the
fund's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's Horatio Alger past, long the stuff of legend in banking
circles, is a far cry from Gifford's more privileged upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   As the son of a textile mill laborer in rough-and-tumble
Woonsocket, the mischievous Murray was always in trouble. At an
Irish wake for a family friend, the youth burst into hysterical
laughter when his grandfather tripped and fell under the casket and
couldn't get up. At the age of 9, he got himself thrown out of
Catholic public school after slapping a nun who had whacked him for
disrupting catechism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stop laughing at things,'' said Murray, an avid
golfer who turned pink with laughter as he recounted the episodes.
``It wasn't mean stuff. It was just at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray's behavior was unruly enough for his father to yank
him out of high school for a year to work the night shift in a
local textile mill. He eventually entered Providence Country Day
School on a scholarship and went on to Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing Harvard in 1962 with an English degree and
mediocre grades, he applied to 26 stock brokerages for a job, but
was roundly rejected. That year, as a consolation prize, he joined
Industrial National Bank of Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Over more than three decades, he would slowly, methodically turn
the tiny, unknown bank in the smallest state into one of the
nation's 10 largest banks, doing dozens of deals that left his
competitors trampled or reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet overtook BankBoston in assets and deposits several years
ago. But it was not until the scrappy Murray sealed the deal to
acquire his rival last Sunday that he became the personification _
and survivor _ of Boston banking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest proof that he is one of banking's most
aggressive dealmakers, Murray is showing a softer side. While one
of his lieutenants calls him the ``Celtic Chieftain'' and others
crow that Fleet ``bagged'' BankBoston, Murray graciously refers to
the deal as a merger of equals _ even though Fleet's is the
surviving stock.
</P>
<P>
   He even says that he is no longer 100 percent focused on
business. ``I think I enjoy life a lot more,'' he said, referring
to his close-knit family, which includes his wife, Suzanne, their
five children, and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murray is far from finished with deal making.
</P>
<P>
   He recently paid a visit to TransAmerica Corp., the San
Francisco-based insurance giant recently acquired by giant Dutch
insurer Aegon, to see how large insurers do business. When asked if
he had his eyes on John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., as
rumored in Boston, he replied only that he was interested in
expanding in financial services.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that Boston's new king of the hill has
his eyes on a larger landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about the BankBoston transaction for years,'' he
said, looking out across the city and harbor. ``The idea of a large
global company based in our back yard is important to me.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By RABBI ELI HECHT &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the supermarket to buy kosher food for the holiday
of Passover and to my amazement there were no less than five brands
of kosher wines and matzoh.
</P>
<P>
   The wines were from Italy, France, Israel, California and
upstate New York. The matzoh display had boxes from Israel,
Cincinnati and New York.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up we would eat special hand-made matzohs for
Passover.
</P>
<P>
   The matzoh was made from only two ingredients, flour and water.
The flour and water must be mixed and kneaded by hand and when the
dough is formed, small lumps of dough are given to a baker who
hand-flattens the dough with small rolling pins.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a special metal roller, with dozens of pins, is rolled
over the flat dough. The dough is shaped and baked in an open, flat
baker's stove -- all within 18 minutes from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Let me describe my first visit to a matzoh bakery before
Passover. I was 8 years old and my Chasidic grandfather, called
Zaydee, called me and said ``Eli, Pesach is coming and we need
shmura matzoh, come bake matzoh.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me try to describe a visit to a strange place in a strange
land. The bakery was located in a dilapidated area of Williamsburg,
in New York. It was an old, red-brick factory with rusty grates on
the windows. It must have been built in the late 1880s. The steps
leading into the building had cracks in the cement from the many
years of use. The heavy iron doors had gigantic hinges.
</P>
<P>
   The place looked like it was from the Dark Ages. I was afraid to
go in. Zaydee, however, had no time for my hesitation. He just held
on to my hand and said ``Sonny boy, come in and perform the mitzvah
of baking matzoh for Pesach.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside I saw an incredible sight. There were men running
back and forth. Some were shouting at other men and women to roll
the rolling pins on the dough quicker. Others were singing songs
and the baker kept on yelling at the top of his voice, ``Le shaim
mitzvas matzoh -- for the sake of the deed of matzoh,'' meaning
that each matzoh was being baked for the express purpose of
fulfilling God's command of having unleavened bread -- matzoh. I
had never seen so many things happening at once.
</P>
<P>
   In one area stood an old man with a long beard and peyos (long
side locks). His only job was to be the water man. He wore a bright
white apron and every once in a while he would take a cup of water
from a 25-gallon jug prepared from the night before and pour it
into a new stainless steel basin.
</P>
<P>
   As he did that a second person would dump a huge cup of the
special flour into the basin while a third strong young man would
begin to mix the flour and water by hand. He would not stop moving
his hands until all the flour was mixed and had turned into dough.
</P>
<P>
   His hands twirled faster and faster like a tornado. It was magic
to me. Then another person would take the dough and make it into
little lumps and give it to workers at the kneading table. There
must have been five tables with eight workers to a table. All of
the workers were moving the rolling pins as fast as possible. The
heavier the person rolling the rolling pin, the flatter the dough
became and the matzohs were thinner.
</P>
<P>
   This answers the long unanswered question of why some hand-made
matzohs are thicker than others.
</P>
<P>
   Each matzoh was then carried to the oven on the rolling pin. The
baker put the matzoh into the oven and after a minute he removed
the baked matzoh. It was then placed on a table to be cooled by a
fan.
</P>
<P>
   The finished matzoh was then carried to the packer, who put
eight matzohs to a pound box.
</P>
<P>
   I remember seeing the people coming and going, the singing, and
the flour mixing with the water. The mixer had the largest muscular
hands I had ever seen. After kneading thousands of batches his
hands were like steel vises.
</P>
<P>
   The women of all ages were dressed, as prescribed by the Jewish
orthodox modesty code, with the hair on their heads completely
covered, their arms covered to the wrists and their dresses worn
over their knees.

USE OF PLACEBOS ON MENTAL PATIENTS QUESTIONED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last decade, at least 850 patients seriously ill with
schizophrenia were given dummy sugar pills instead of medications
known to work, as part of US-approved studies of experimental
anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 70 percent of the patients randomly assigned to receive a
placebo, as the dummy pill is called, experienced such a worsening
of symptoms that they had to withdraw from the trials, and at least
one patient committed suicide, according to a Globe review of the
experiment data.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you possibly put somebody on placebo when they could
commit suicide?'' said Karin B. Michels, an epidemiologist at
Harvard Medical School and a prominent critic of the use of
placebos in trials of new drugs, when effective medications for
diseases are already on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, mainly funded by pharmaceutical firms, have
primarily involved patients at state mental institutions and
Veterans Affairs hospitals from Massachusetts to California,
according to the Globe's review of both published studies and
unpublished data reported to the US Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, they're treating the mentally ill like lab rats. This is
absolutely outrageous,'' said Paul K. Ling, a Quincy psychologist
who is a leader in the Massachusetts-wide Consortium for
Psychotherapy, which advocates greater access to care for the
mentally ill. ``They are exploiting the most vulnerable segment of
the population.''
</P>
<P>
   In tests of drugs for many medical conditions, especially those
for which there is no good treatment, placebo controls are common.
But patients with cancer or fast-moving bacterial infections, for
instance, would never be put on sugar pills as part of studying
potentially new chemotherapy drugs or antibiotics. They would
instead be given medications already known to work to compare with
patients given the trial medication.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of using a so-called placebo control in testing
experimental anti-psychotics and certain other drugs, even when
there are already effective medications on the market, has long
been demanded by the FDA as a scientific ``gold standard'' to
measure drug efficacy, and pharmaceutical firms and researchers
have complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in good science. We believe in following FDA
regulations,'' said Dr. Bert Spilker, senior vice president of
scientific and regulatory affairs for Pharmaceutical Research
Manufacturers of America, commonly known as PhRMA, an industry
group. As a result, he said, ``Usually, good science and good
ethics prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a Globe series on psychiatric research that
highlighted drug-testing issues in November and amid growing
concerns by some ethicists and scientists, the FDA and the National
Institute of Mental Health now plan to review the use of placebos,
according to federal officials and others familiar with the
agencies' deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is sponsoring a symposium next month on placebo
experiments in general, not just for the mentally ill, and has
invited a prominent critic, Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen's
Health Research Group, along with others, to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe series focused on experiments in which mentally ill
patients were allowed to deteriorate after being deprived of drugs
that have worked for them or after having been given substances
that actually worsen their psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   The series has helped spur a debate on drug-testing practices,
particularly placebo use, by the American College of
Neuropsychopharmacology, an international psychiatric research
group, according to one scientist who has participated in the
heated discussion over the use of placebos.
</P>
<P>
   The series has also prompted the Massachusetts Department of
Mental Health to put on hold two studies involving placebos while
new research guidelines to protect patients are finalized in the
next month, said Dr. Paul Barreira, a DMH deputy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, appointed by the
president, has recommended that the US Department of Health and
Human Services retain the Institute of Medicine to review
placebo-controlled studies, along with research that induces
psychosis in people with mental illness, according to Eric M.
Meslin, the commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's new analysis looked at unpublished data submitted to
the FDA in the 1990s by pharmaceutical firms for three
antipsychotic drugs that have since been approved: Zyprexa
(olanzapine), Risperdal (risperidone), and Seroquel (quetiapine).
And it reviewed the published scientific literature for those
drugs, and a fourth _ Serlect (sertindole), which was withdrawn
from consideration after an FDA advisory committee questioned its
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the more than 850 patients given a placebo, 236 were in
studies of Zyprexa, 195 in studies of Risperdal, 206 in studies of
Seroquel, and at least 221 in studies of Serlect, according to the
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   According to the review of the published literature, the Globe
also found that researchers enrolled patients who were so severely
ill that their ability to understand the risk of being given a
sugar pill was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one 1996 study said patients assigned to a placebo
had met ``criteria for schizophrenia with acute exacerbation,'' and
yet were said to have given ``written informed consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 1996 study said patients on a placebo had been
experiencing ``acute exacerbation'' for an average of 91 days, and
had been hospitalized for almost three weeks on average, before
signing up for the research.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe review also found that psychiatric researchers even
anticipated a high dropout rate among patients on placebos as a
result of worsening symptoms. For example, a 1997 study stated that
``as expected, lack of efficacy was the primary reason for
withdrawal and was seen most often in the placebo groups,'' with 35
out of 51 patients on a placebo, or 69 percent, withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of the drug Zyprexa that ended in 1995, a 34-year-old
man committed suicide while on a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the more than 850 people placed on a placebo in studies
across the United States and Canada in the 1990s, a couple of dozen
of them were enrolled through the state's Massachusetts Mental
Health Center, under the auspices of a Harvard associate professor
of psychiatry, Dr. Alan I. Green. Based on the state's changing
research guidelines, those studies, completed several years ago,
would probably not be allowed at the DMH facility now.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Green said, ``I think you always want to ask
the question, `What's ethical?' The FDA has determined that the
only way to figure out whether a drug works or not, in certain
areas, certainly in this area, is to use a placebo control.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``The whole field, including the FDA, including
ethicists, is trying to decide the best way to conduct trials. I
think everybody is trying to do the same thing, which is to make
newer, better medications available. As better medications become
available, the way you think this through conceivably could
evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's new findings, along with the already rising concern
about the use of placebos, prompted scientists and ethicists to
sound an even louder alarm last week about the use of placebos in
certain studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most harmful ongoing research abuse in
North America,'' said Dr. Charles Weijer, bioethicist and assistant
professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Canada, who helped
devise new Canadian guidelines prohibiting placebo use in certain
studies, particularly those involving people with schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is appalling,'' said Adil Shamoo, a University of Maryland
bioethicist who co-founded Citizens for Responsible Care in
Psychiatry and Research with Vera Hassner Sharav.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a drug that has been demonstrated by convincing
evidence to be safe and effective for a life-threatening disease,
one should not go back after that point and use placebos in future
trials,'' said LeRoy Walters, director of the Kennedy Institute of
Ethics at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would categorize schizophrenia as a life-threatening
disorder,'' especially with the relatively high risk of suicide,
Walters said. ``There should not be a placebo group in my view.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials could not be reached for comment on Friday, but
have previously said they require a placebo for scientific rigor,
to make sure the drugs under study are efficacious.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth J. Rothman, a professor of epidemiology at Boston
University School of Public Health and editor of the journal
Epidemiology, disputed the FDA's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who think you can't do a study without a placebo _
they're wrong,'' said Rothman, who co-authored with Harvard's
Michels a widely cited article in the New England Journal of
Medicine criticizing the misuse of placebos.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman said, using a placebo for comparison in tests
of experimental drugs instead of medications known to be effective
may lead to the approval of drugs that are better than nothing, but
worse than the best that is already on the market.

PAIR RECAST STARS AND BARS IN HUES OF LIBERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ It's not yet in the same league as Nike's
swoosh, but a jazzed-up version of the Confederate battle flag is
creating a buzz as the logo for a new clothing line created by a
pair of minority entrepreneurs in the city where the Civil War
began.
</P>
<P>
   By overlaying the Stars and Bars with the red, green, and black
associated with the African-American liberation movement, Sherman
Evans and Angel Quintero believe they have found the perfect
trademark to represent the business they call NuSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to change history; we're making it,'' said
Quintero, a native of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Added Evans, a black man born in Columbus, Ohio: ``It's not
about being in your face, it's about coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out that NuSouth added vertical lines, like prison
bars, to the edges of the flag ``for closure'' to the old conflict
between North and South, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   The NuSouth gimmick ``does not bother me,'' said Republican
state Senator Glenn McConnell of Charleston, a leading figure in
the campaign to preserve Confederate honor. ``The true meaning of
that emblem is in the battlefields, the graveyards, and the hearts
of South Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag is used by different people for different purposes,''
McConnell said. ``If this helps get us closer to its real meaning,
then that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate battle flag is a controversial symbol in South
Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union. The banner
still flies atop the state capitol in Columbia, and various
attempts to remove it in recent years have failed, despite a clamor
by a growing number of blacks in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   David Beasley, a Republican governor, was defeated last year
after he became identified with the flag fight. First, he
antagonized his conservative constituency by proposing to move the
Confederate banner; when he failed to persuade the Legislature to
support his proposal, it was regarded as a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Evans says NuSouth is not interested in the ``political
rhetoric'' swirling around the battle flag. ``We're not concerned
about what's flying on top of the capitol as much as what's going
on inside the capitol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their pleasantly funky NuSouth shop in a fashionable corridor
of historic Charleston, Evans and Quintero talked about their
initiative the other day. Both men are 35 and wound up in
Charleston via separate routes a dozen years ago. Yet, as Evans
says, ``Everyone has Southern heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1990s, they became partners in a local record
company and came up with the flag idea for an album cover featuring
a rap band named Da Phlayva.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the middle of the rap wars between the East Coast
and the West Coast, and our record label was getting no
recognition,'' Quintero recalled. ``So we took the flag, which was
the biggest symbol for the South, and said, `Why don't we change
the colors?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Experimenting on a computer, they superimposed red, green, and
black on the flag. ``It was like a light coming on,'' said s Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The flag dominated the rap group's jacket cover. The words on
the front were, ``The future is Da Phlayva.'' The back side said,
``The past is the past.''
</P>
<P>
   No breakthrough resulted for Da Phlayva, but promotional
T-shirts bearing the retooled flag caused a stir in 1994 when a
black 10th-grader was suspended by her white principal for wearing
the shirt to school in Goose Creek, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the symbol was further encouraged, Evans and
Quintero say, when several people wore the shirts to the Million
Man March, a massive African-American demonstration in Washington
in 1995. ``People saw it there and liked it,'' Evans said.
``Everybody got the message and wanted one.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the pair began their NuSouth clothing line
on a few hundred dollars, they had the flag embroidered on their
first caps and T-shirts. The two men won't disclose revenue
figures, but they say sales took off, and now they're marketing
sweaters, jackets, and pullovers nationwide, with a catalog going
out this spring to a mailing list of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The slashing NuSouth logo is so startling that it nearly springs
off the page in ads in recent issues of GQ and Rolling Stone. The
ad's copy plays on words from Martin Luther King's ``I Have a
Dream'' speech: ``For the sons and daughters of former slaves. For
the sons and daughters of former slave owners. Threads that connect
us. Words that free us.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans says that 70 percent of NuSouth's sales are to white
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The line is already popular at House of Culture, a boutique in
Boston's Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some of their pieces, and they've done good,'' said
Patrick Petty, the store owner. ``It's teased people and whetted
their appetite. We're expecting the full line this spring, and
we're already getting calls from people who want to know when it
comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   NuSouth is opening its second store in downtown Atlanta in June.
Evans says he and his partner would also like to develop an apparel
line in a joint venture with the Atlanta Braves, because ``they are
the team of the New South.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, the Braves' owner and the New South's quintessential
business operator, has not returned NuSouth's calls, but that has
not discouraged the enterprising duo from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting where you don't expect us,'' said Evans.
``We're looking at the Republican national convention next year. .
. . We intend to take on Tommy Hilfiger and all those guys, so they
can't say we're just whistling Dixie.''

THERE ARE OPTIONS TO HYSTERECTOMIES TO SOLVE SEVERE MENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Elizabeth Hemstead didn't pay much attention to
her periods until they stretched beyond a week, then two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a nuisance more than anything else,'' said
Hemstead, a high school athletic director and coach. She attributed
her fatigue to a hectic schedule of teaching and coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I was going to give blood one day and they did that
little test, and sure enough, I was anemic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For an estimated 180,000 women each year, the solution to
dysfunctional uterine bleeding or severe menstrual periods has been
a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Caused by a hormonal imbalance, the problem strikes an estimated
20 percent of all women at some point in their lives, usually at
puberty or just before menopause as was the case with Hemstead, who
is 49.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, the bleeding is so severe that not even pads or
tampons can stanch the flow. Although not medically serious, such
excessive bleeding can lead to everything from anemia to personal
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Some women get relief from oral contraceptives to balance their
hormones. Others may temporarily improve their symptoms with
dilation and curettage, a procedure to scrape out the uterine
lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bleeding that takes over your life,'' said Dr. Eileen
Joyce, an obstetrician and gynecologist for Upstate Ob/Gyn
Associates and St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. ``You could bleed
enough to need a blood transfusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hemstead is no longer anemic and her menstrual flow is
light and regular, thanks to uterine balloon therapy, the latest in
a new wave of treatments to offer an alternative to the traditional
hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, she was one of the first few thousand women in the
United States to undergo the procedure, a 10-minute outpatient
surgical technique that permanently removes the endometrial lining
of the uterus, using heated fluid inside a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cauterizing the endometrial cells so they can't bleed
anymore,'' Joyce said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved the procedure, known as ThermaChoice, 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier method to stop bleeding, known as rollerball, is
similar in concept and uses a tiny roller to cauterize the inside
of the uterus. But that procedure, which requires a physician to
expand the uterus with fluid, has come under increased scrutiny
because of potentially fatal complications.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say that balloon therapy is safer and less risky
because the fluid is encased in a balloon. ``The balloon now gives
us a very simple cure, without significant side effects or
complications,'' said Dr. Kate O'Keeffe, a Glens Falls, N.Y.,
obstetrician and gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the temporary side-effects include cramping and
discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Not all women are eligible for balloon therapy. Physicians must
first rule out any other gynecologic problems, such as fibroids, an
abnormally shaped uterus, or a cancerous condition.
</P>
<P>
   And because balloon therapy destroys the endometrium, which is
necessary to support a pregnancy, it is only for women who don't
want children.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, balloon therapy doesn't work for everyone. Clinical
data shows that about 15 percent of patients see no change in their
bleeding, while 30 percent stop bleeding altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Yet O'Keeffe believes balloon therapy will eventually help cut
down the number of elective hysterectomies in the United States at
a savings to the health care system and women.
</P>
<P>
   While a hysterectomy is a major surgery requiring three days in
the hospital and six weeks recovery time, uterine balloon therapy
can be completed on an out-patient basis. Most women can resume all
activities, including sexual intercourse, a week to 10 days after
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much less invasive. It's also much less costly,'' said
Dianne Anderson, a registered nurse and vice president for patient
services at Glens Falls Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ThermaChoice costs about $2,500, compared with $8,000 to $10,000
for a hysterectomy and is generally covered by insurance. Hemstead
is just relieved that her periods are lighter and shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of my life has really improved,'' she said.
Although she knows many women who've had successful hysterectomies,
she's glad she had an alternative. ``This was certainly a much
better option.''

GIANT SURPLUS TEMPTS GOP TO ABANDON CONSERVATIVE FISCAL POLICY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 bY THOMAS OLIPHANT 
C.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where are the conservatives when we need them?
</P>
<P>
   Emerging in Congress is a budget strategy that would probably
keep the national debt from being reduced in a time of
unprecedented surplus, lead to substantial deficits in the future,
and create a huge entitlement program for millions of Americans who
don't need it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason conservatives are not mobilizing to oppose such an
irresponsible future is that they are deeply implicated in it; this
is the budget being readied for consideration by Republicans in
both branches, not just the budget types like Pete Domenici and
John Kasich, but the Social Security privatizers lead by Bill
Archer in the House and Phil Gramm in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget remains extremely vulnerable to opposition
from moderates who are likely to find its Draconian cuts
unpalatable. However, it remains the party's vehicle in Congress
and is certain to heavily influence the nascent presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise in the products of Domenici's Senate Budget
Committee and Kasich's House counterpart is the extent to which
they do not do what Republicans claimed they would do more credibly
than President Clinton _ guarantee that budget surpluses would be
used to pay down the national debt held by the public, thus
lowering crunching government interest costs and freeing more
capital for productive investment in the country's amazingly strong
economy, as well as taking a huge step toward putting Social
Security in shape for the Baby Boom's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When Domenici and Kasich first went public with the
``framework'' for the budget, they promised to ``lock away every
penny of the Social Security trust fund surpluses for our nation's
elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have written their actual budget resolutions, it
turns out that what they mean by the elderly and Social Security
are two different things.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP resolutions are designed to fit with legislation by
Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan to create a ``lockbox'' for
those anticipated surpluses. In essence, this legislation
prescribes sharp reduction in the limit on debt held by the public
over the next decade, with two provisions for adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   One is responsible, up or down in the debt limit depending on
the actual fiscal results.
</P>
<P>
   The other is dangerous. It would permit increases in the debt
limit to the extent resources are needed to fund ``reform'' of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The reform is privatization, pure and simple, permitting the
creation of individual retirement funds with two percentage points
of the existing payroll tax in a scheme that (especially in the
House versions of it) is also designed to produce no reduction in
future Social Security benefits. The plan would cost trillions over
the next generation, and the funding mechanism would be the Social
Security surpluses that will continue to accumulate for about
another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   One place the Republican budgets most assuredly will not allow
to be a source of money would be any non-Social Security surpluses
that might appear in the future. This is where the gigantic
allowance for income tax cuts, military spending increases and
sharp cuts in the operating budget of the government all come into
play with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in return for partial privatization of Social
Security, the national debt could easily remain in the trillions
for our kids to choke on while the economic stimulus and other
domestic opportunities from its near-eradication would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. With backing from the center and progressive
wings of his party, the president's proposal would put 77 percent
of any government surplus into Social Security (62 percent) and
Medicare (15 percent), with another large chunk available to help
middle-class and working-poor Americans establish retirement
accounts outside Social Security. As now written, the Republicans
go in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there are ways that these contrasting visions
can be reconciled by imaginitive politicians interested in
solutions during this brief period of possibility before next
year's politics gradually takes over everything.
</P>
<P>
   If not, this is an issue easily capable of dwarfing all the
others.

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS URGE CLINTON TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM HAITI
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI -- Influential congressional Republicans called on
President Clinton Tuesday to heed the advice of the top U.S.
military commander for Latin America and withdraw American
peackeeping troops from Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unrest and political instability mean that U.S. troops are
spending an increasing amount of their energy watching their backs,
rather than pursuing humanitarian projects,'' the Republicans said
in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   It was signed by six Republicans, including Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House International
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, who leads the U.S. Southern
Command, told the defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations
Committee that troops have been unable to create stability in
Haiti, and that he feared for their safety. He recommended an end
to the permanent U.S. troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' request follows a two-day series by Cox
Newspapers on Haiti. Cox Newspapers reported that $2.2 billion in
American taxpayer money had brought neither a working democracy nor
real progress to the poor Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti to
restore democracy. Today, about 500 troops remain to build schools,
repair roads, and perform other humanitarian tasks at a cost of
about $22 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the political situation in Haiti has become
increasingly unstable. Political assassinations are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Haitian President Rene Preval dissolved parliament,
essentially imposing one-man rule.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the Republicans said money and troops assets
must be freed up in light of a massive reconstruction effort in
Central America, which was devastated last year by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   According to Raul Duany, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, about 2,500 U.S. troops are participating in medical and
engineering projects in Central America.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS URGE CLINTON TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM HAITI
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI -- Influential congressional Republicans called on
President Clinton Tuesday to heed the advice of the top U.S.
military commander for Latin America and withdraw American
peackeeping troops from Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unrest and political instability mean that U.S. troops are
spending an increasing amount of their energy watching their backs,
rather than pursuing humanitarian projects,'' the Republicans said
in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   It was signed by six Republicans, including Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House International
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, who leads the U.S. Southern
Command, told the defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations
Committee that troops have been unable to create stability in
Haiti, and that he feared for their safety. He recommended an end
to the permanent U.S. troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' request follows a two-day series by Cox
Newspapers on Haiti. Cox Newspapers reported that $2.2 billion in
American taxpayer money had brought neither a working democracy nor
real progress to the poor Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti to
restore democracy. Today, about 500 troops remain to build schools,
repair roads, and perform other humanitarian tasks at a cost of
about $22 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the political situation in Haiti has become
increasingly unstable. Political assassinations are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Haitian President Rene Preval dissolved parliament,
essentially imposing one-man rule.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the Republicans said money and troops assets
must be freed up in light of a massive reconstruction effort in
Central America, which was devastated last year by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   According to Raul Duany, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, about 2,500 U.S. troops are participating in medical and
engineering projects in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said U.S. troops will remain in Haiti
into the near future, although their presence is being constantly
reviewed.

boom in mergers and acquisitions like the one now in full force.
Yet for all the talk about Europe's single market and single
currency, and despite the rise of hostile takeovers, something big
is missing. Very few cross-border deals have taken place, and those
that are in active discussions have run into problems. By Edmund L.

 &HT;    CONGRESS MOVES TO BAN INTERNET GAMBLING
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Congress gets its way, it may be tougher to bet
the house with a click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a billion dollars likely to be gambled over the
Internet this year, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., introduced a bill
Tuesday that would expand law enforcement's reach into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl's bill would update the Federal Wire Act of 1961, which
governs gambling over the telephone. It would ban both online
casino games and sports gambling, although online ``fantasy
baseball'' leagues and the like would remain exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of businesses that offer gambling over the Internet could
be fined an amount equal to the bets they have handled and be
jailed for up to four years. But Kyl dropped federal penalties for
individual bettors, which had been included in last year's version
of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation sailed through the Senate last year on a 90-10
vote, but eventually bogged down when the House Judiciary Committee
turned its attention to the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by Tuesday's hearing before Kyl's Judiciary
subcommittee, his current approach enjoys wide bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., testified that Kyl's bill is
needed because current laws are inadequate. She warned, however,
that any measure ``should not slow down the Internet'' or burden
online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery, a Republican, delivered
the endorsement of the National Association of State Attorneys
General, which usually seeks to curb federal inroads into state
laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a threat to the traditional independence of
state law enforcement,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that an Internet gambling ban ``will be difficult
to enforce,'' she added: ``The continued rapid growth of the
industry and the inability of states to enforce their varied laws
and policies is just one more reason that federal legislation
should be enacted quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl also said he had won the support of Internet service
providers, including giant America Online Inc., to cut off links to
gambling Web sites, many of which are licensed by cash-starved
Caribbean and Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
   But with Americans expected to wager a record $650 billion this
year, a blend of political pressure and technological problems
could stall a cyber-gambling ban.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Bell of the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning
Washington policy center: ``The architecture of the Internet makes
prohibition easy to evade and impossible to enforce. As an
international network, moreover, the Internet offers instant
detours around domestic bans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is also somewhat unhappy with Kyl's
effort, the senator noted in an interview. ``They are on the
razor's edge,'' he said. ``They are prosecuting some cases right
now under the (1961 Wire) Act, and they're fearful that defense
lawyers could cite my bill as evidence that the current law doesn't
apply to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not called to testify, but submitting written comments at the
Kyl hearing, was an association representing Internet gambling
operators called the Interactive Gaming Counsel. Sue Schneider, the
group's chairman, called for regulation of Internet gambling rather
than an outright ban.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- Born: Tulsa, Okla., Dec. 27, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Father, Dr. Jed Goldberg, is a retired gynecologist;
mother, Ethel, was a concert violist with the Oklahoma City
Philharmonic. Brothers Mike, 50, and Steve, 47. Sister Barbara, 44.
</P>
<P>
   -- Height/weight: 6-foot-4-inches, 285 pounds
</P>
<P>
   -- Football in the family: Both brothers played college
football. Dad played halfback at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   -- Career path: At age 17 he was a bouncer at a Tulsa bar.
</P>
<P>
   -- College: Received a scholarship to the University of Georgia,
where he majored in psychology and was twice an all-conference nose
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pro football: Drafted by the Los Angeles Rams but cut after
pulling a hamstring muscle in preseason. Played a year for the
Sacramento Surge of the World League of American Football. Played
for the Atlanta Falcons for three seasons ('92-'94). Career ended
with a stomach-muscle injury.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hobbies: Likes to fish. As a kid he flew gliders with his
brothers, and has raced sailboats in Key West, Fla. Rides a Harley,
and has a growing collection of vintage muscle cars.
</P>
<P>
   -- Favorite author: Hunter S. Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   -- Childhood idol: Late pro football madman John Matuszak.
</P>
<P>
   -- Favorite old pro wrestler: Bruiser Brody. (``Bruiser Brody
never really said anything. He just beat the hell out of
everybody.'')
</P>
<P>
   -- Wrestling move you seldom see: ``He can do a standing
backflip,'' says dad Jed. ``But he doesn't like to do it because it
hurts his knees.''
</P>
<P>
   -- How strong is he? Goldberg won't say how much he bench
presses. But at Gold's Gym in Cumming, he once broke a bench press
machine by putting too much weight on it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Is wrestling fake? He says it's entertainment, and there is a
story line that wrestlers follow. But the action? ``If somebody
walks up to me and asks if the business is fake,'' he once said,
``I ask if they want me to give them that tackle and then try to
get up in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   -- What about the championship? Goldberg lost the WCW
championship in December to Kevin Nash.
</P>
<P>
   -- Girlfriend: Lisa Shekter, a former ``Diamond Doll'' who used
to escort wrestler Diamond Dallas Page to and from the ring.
They've been together six years. ``She is my best friend, and has
had a tremendous impact on my career.''

 &HT;    Jackhammer-tough persona melts when Bill Goldberg's off the mat
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing in the doorway of wrestler Bill Goldberg's dressing
room at the Bi-Lo Center in Greenville, S.C., is a blockish piece
of human granite with what appears to be a bowling ball for a head
and tattoos for hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good friends,'' says Goldberg, motioning at his arch-foe
in pro wrestling, 6-foot-3-inch, 325-pound Bam Bam Bigelow.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow doesn't speak of friendship, however. Spotting a
reporter, he falls into character, and points at Goldberg: ``I'm
going to get you!'' he growls.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and twenty minutes later, Goldberg _ the biggest phenom
to hit professional wrestling since pay-per-view _ dispatches Bam
Bam in trademark fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He spears Bam Bam with his shaved head, then picks him up by his
legs and drives him headfirst into the mat with his signature
``finishing move,'' the ``Jackhammer.''
</P>
<P>
   The mutant is done for.
</P>
<P>
   Discarded like a tired can of Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen thousand wrestling fans, many of them waving Goldberg
placards (``Goldberg for President''), fill the arena with the
roaring incantation ``Goldbeeerrrrrrrg!'' ``Goldbeeerrrrrrrg!''
</P>
<P>
   This is Bill Goldberg's third-favorite way of making a living.
</P>
<P>
   A former all-conference nose tackle for the University of
Georgia and defensive lineman for the Atlanta Falcons, he would
rather be a football player. A stomach injury cut that career
short. He'd also rather be an actor.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond career choices, what he'd really rather be _ time
permitting _ is a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe my schedule,'' he says, sitting in his
dressing room and chatting in a low, soft voice that is the
anti-rant of his in-the-ring persona. ``It's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, his friendly greeting to the ``enemy,'' Bam Bam,
seems perfectly fitting. About the only thing remotely sinister
about the real Goldberg is that he dips snuff (a pinch of Skoal
between his cheek and gum).
</P>
<P>
   His Falcons cap is turned backward, and his massive, muscled
torso strains the seams of a black pull-over fleece shirt. But _
even with his fierece Van Dyke beard _ his aura is gentle. Menacing
as 291 pounds of petunias.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Goldberg is a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   A sweetheart. A funny guy, who donates hours to charitable
causes, including the Make -A -Wish Foundation and the Humane
Society. As the placards bobbing above the wild throngs of
wrestling fans occasionally read, Bill Goldberg is ``A Nice Jewish
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as it happens, he's also carrying the world of Ted Turner's
World Championship Wrestling on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' says WCW spokesman Alan Sharp.
``Bill Goldberg is the driving force of the WCW.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also toting around too much pop culture right now to do
that Atlas shrug thing _ just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg on the cover of TV Guide (''The Incredible Story of How
Wrestling Became TV's Biggest Sensation!'').
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg on the front page of USA Today (''How Bad Is Wrestling
For Your Kids?'').
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg schmoozing with Leno and guests Kevin Costner and
``Ally McBeal'' star Calista Flockhart on the ``Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, the grand marshal at the Cracker Barrel 500 stock-car
race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg in TV commercials for the Humane Society, Spree candy
and _ soon _ Miller Lite beer.
</P>
<P>
   All in addition to wrestling four or five nights a week and
getting top billing on TNT's ``Monday Nitro'' and ``Thursday
Thunder'' wrestling cablecasts.
</P>
<P>
   What Bill Goldberg needs is is a break. And not off the top
rope. He never intended to be wrestler. He never pursued fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just riding the wave,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to catch up with Goldberg for a chat or an autograph?
Good luck. Your best chance might be through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   His fame is such that a letter addressed ``Goldberg,
Dawsonville, Ga.,'' will get to his home. His schedule is such
that, some people around Dawsonville have been waiting months to
see Goldberg, including reporters at the local paper, the Dawson
News &AMP; Advertiser, which wants to interview him for a profile.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Barr, 50, a back-hoe operator, is a fan who happens to live
in the neighborhood. Barr has a Goldberg T-shirt he'd like to have
signed for his boys, 5 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done promised my kids I would get it autographed,'' he
says. ``But I ain't seen him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Local chamber of commerce President Cathy Edwards has been
trying to reach Goldberg to bounce an idea off him for a
economic-development ad campaign. The campaign would wed Goldberg's
fame with that of another local, stock-car racer Bill Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great if we could do something like
`Dawsonville: The Home of Two Favorite Bills,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of fame is such that Goldberg is everywhere _ and
nowhere _ at once.
</P>
<P>
   He's in your living room, but seldom in his own. ``I get home
about 5 or 6 days a month,'' he says, ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   He declined several requests to be interviewed at home _ ``I
really guard my privacy'' _ where he lives with former college
roommate Terry Shields, who helps with his business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   When time permits, he and girlfriend for six years, Lisa Shekter
(``She's everything but my live-in girlfriend'') likes to relax by
tooling around the mountains in one of his growing collection of
vintage muscle cars, especially his 1968 Chevy Malibu convertible.
He also likes to fish in the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he took the stage with country band Confederate
Railroad, singing the band's hit ``Trashy Woman.'' But there's
little danger of him diversifying into music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a terrible singer,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago all this was unthinkable. Goldberg was just
another ex-athlete _ albeit a gifted one, with a flair for the
outrageous _ but one with zip for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really lost,'' says dad Jed Goldberg, a retired
gynecologist living in Miami. ``He'd call all the time and ask me:
`What do you think I ought to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dad says he never would have foreseen Bill making a living
fighting. ``I don't remember him getting in a single fight as a
child,'' he says, then pauses. ``But, as big as he was, who was
going to mess with him?''
</P>
<P>
   Events conspired to get Goldberg into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestler Lex Luger and Sting, whom he met at their athletic
club, Main Event Fitness, encouraged him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward he met WCW President Eric Bischoff at an Atlanta
strip joint, The Gold Club, and Bischoff convinced him to take the
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   For six months he trained at WCW's Atlanta wrestling school, the
Power Plant, developing his act. Then he and Bischoff debated a
name.
</P>
<P>
   They considered and discarded a host of them _ ``The Hybrid,''
``Junkyard Dog,'' ``The Warlord,'' ``Massad'' _ then settled on the
most unlikely: his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Bischoff wasn't too excited about it,'' says Goldberg.
``But he grew to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after his TV debut on ``Monday Nitro'' _ he beat Hugh
Morrus; remember him? _ Goldberg learned that he was ``the
project.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, according to script, he beat Hulk Hogan in a
Monday match at the Georgia Dome and was crowned heavyweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way what happened couldn't have been scripted even by
the most cunning plot twisters in the WCW stable of melodramatists.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Goldberg became a Jewish hero.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Jewish sports hero since pitcher Sandy Koufax, the
most powerful Jewish hero since baseball slugger Hank Greenburg.
Maybe the greatest Jewish wrestler since the Old Testament Jacob
wrestled the angel.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot to put on a 31-year-old guy who doesn't attend
temple regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's how Rabbi Irwin Kula, president of the New York-based
Center for Learning and Leadership, characterized Goldberg in an
interview in the New Yorker magazine in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Jewish paper in the country has written an article about
Bill,'' says Kula, a Goldberg family friend who's attended several
matches and watches ``Monday Nitro'' religiously with his
6-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``His impact on the Jewish community has been tremendous. He
challenges us to widen the markers of our community, and begin to
break stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg acknowledges that. He refused to wrestle on Rosh
Hashanah, ``out of respect for my Jewish fans.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's reluctant to shoulder the load of Jewish role model:
``I don't look at myself as a Jewish sports hero,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, his career is on a trajectory where there are too many
hero roles to fill, already.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he turned down an appearance on ``E.R.'' _ too busy.
Instead, he's looking to movies.
</P>
<P>
   His first film, a Jean-Claude Van Damme actioner tentatively
titled ``Universal Soldier, the Sequel,'' wrapped in February and
is scheduled to open in August.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he played a ``likeable'' bad guy named Romeo, whom
Goldberg hopes will be remembered for his Arnold
Schwarzenegger-like line, ``You think that's going to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this after I had been shot, stabbed, and kicked out of
a sixth-story window,'' he says. ``It takes a lot to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's Los Angeles agent, Barry Bloom, says the Dawsonville
wrestler is ``hot.'' Scripts are being sent to him almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading two right now,'' says Goldberg. ``One's called
`Uncivil Procedure,' the other's a wrestling movie.'' In the former
he'd play the lead romantic role.
</P>
<P>
   Likely later this month, says Bloom, Goldberg will commit to his
second film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk in Hollywood,'' says Bloom, ``is that he's got the
potential of another Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal Soldier'' director Mic Rogers, a former stunt man,
says Goldberg has huge box office potential: ``He's a good actor, a
great athlete, and the camera loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers didn't discover Goldberg watching wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him in an episode of `Love Boat,' and I liked the way he
looked. He has kid in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of ``Universal Soldier'' was rewritten in a way that, if
there is yet another sequel, Goldberg can appear in it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg won't divulge details of his deal with WCW. But his
contract is long-term, say WCW executives. He reportedly earns
about $2 million a year in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, he is house-hunting in San Diego to be closer
to film studios. ``The movies are what I really want to do,'' he
says. ``I don't see myself wrestling to age 40.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where he lives, at the moment, the world is at his
door. And it all seems to want a piece of the hottest wrestler
Spandex shorts ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   After filming wrapped on the set of ``Universal Soldier'' in
February in Dallas, the crew was horsing around with Goldberg, and
the assistant director _ weight, about 130 _ asked Goldberg to
press him over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg picked the guy up, and pumped him up and down several
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then everybody in the crew gathered around and were asking
Goldberg to pick them up too,'' recalls director Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did. He kept giving people rides. They all wanted to ride
Goldberg.''

 &HT;    Jackhammer-tough persona melts when Goldbers's off the mat
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Standing in the doorway of wrestler Bill Goldberg's
dressing room at the Bi-Lo Center in Greenville, S.C., is a
blockish piece of human granite with what appears to be a bowling
ball for a head and tattoos for hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good friends,'' says Goldberg, motioning at his arch-foe
in pro wrestling, 6-foot-3-inch, 325-pound Bam Bam Bigelow.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow doesn't speak of friendship, however. Spotting a
reporter, he falls into character, and points at Goldberg: ``I'm
going to get you!'' he growls.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and twenty minutes later, Goldberg _ the biggest phenom
to hit professional wrestling since pay-per-view _ dispatches Bam
Bam in trademark fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He spears Bam Bam with his shaved head, then picks him up by his
legs and drives him headfirst into the mat with his signature
``finishing move,'' the ``Jackhammer.''
</P>
<P>
   The mutant is done for.
</P>
<P>
   Discarded like a tired can of Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen thousand wrestling fans, many of them waving Goldberg
placards (``Goldberg for President''), fill the arena with the
roaring incantation ``Goldbeeerrrrrrrg!'' ``Goldbeeerrrrrrrg!''
</P>
<P>
   This is Bill Goldberg's third-favorite way of making a living.
</P>
<P>
   A former all-conference nose tackle for the
</P>
<P>
   University of Georgia and defensive lineman for the Atlanta
Falcons, he would rather be a football player. A stomach injury cut
that career short. He'd also rather be an actor.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond career choices, what he'd really rather be _ time
permitting _ is a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe my schedule,'' he says, sitting in his
dressing room and chatting in a low, soft voice that is the
anti-rant of his in-the-ring persona. ``It's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, his friendly greeting to the ``enemy,'' Bam Bam,
seems perfectly fitting. About the only thing remotely sinister
about the real Goldberg is that he dips snuff (a pinch of Skoal
between his cheek and gum).
</P>
<P>
   His Falcons cap is turned backward, and his massive, muscled
torso strains the seams of a black pull-over fleece shirt. But _
even with his fierece Van Dyke beard _ his aura is gentle. Menacing
as 291 pounds of petunias.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Goldberg is a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   A sweetheart. A funny guy, who donates hours to charitable
causes, including the Make -A -Wish Foundation and the Humane
Society. As the placards bobbing above the wild throngs of
wrestling fans occasionally read, Bill Goldberg is ``A Nice Jewish
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as it happens, he's also carrying the world of Ted Turner's
World Championship Wrestling on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' says WCW spokesman Alan Sharp.
``Bill Goldberg is the driving force of the WCW.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also toting around too much pop culture right now to do
that Atlas shrug thing _ just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg on the cover of TV Guide (''The Incredible Story of How
Wrestling Became TV's Biggest Sensation!'').
</P>
<P>

For Your Kids?'').
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg schmoozing with Leno and guests Kevin Costner and
``Ally McBeal'' star Calista Flockhart on the ``Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, the grand marshal at the Cracker Barrel 500 stock-car
race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg in TV commercials for the Humane Society, Spree candy
and _ soon _ Miller Lite beer.
</P>
<P>
   All in addition to wrestling four or five nights a week and
getting top billing on TNT's ``Monday Nitro'' and ``Thursday
Thunder'' wrestling cablecasts.
</P>
<P>
   What Bill Goldberg needs is a break. And not off the top rope.
He never intended to be a wrestler. He never pursued fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just riding the wave,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to catch up with Goldberg for a chat or an autograph?
Good luck. Your best chance might be through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   His fame is such that a letter addressed ``Goldberg,
Dawsonville, Ga.,'' will get to his home. His schedule is such
that, some people around Dawsonville have been waiting months to
see Goldberg, including reporters at the local paper, the Dawson
News &AMP; Advertiser, which wants to interview him for a profile.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Barr, 50, a back-hoe operator, is a fan who happens to live
in the neighborhood. Barr has a Goldberg T-shirt he'd like to have
signed for his boys, 5 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done promised my kids I would get it autographed,'' he
says. ``But I ain't seen him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Local chamber of commerce President Cathy Edwards has been
trying to reach Goldberg to bounce an idea off him for a
economic-development ad campaign. The campaign would wed Goldberg's
fame with that of another local, stock-car racer Bill Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great if we could do something like
`Dawsonville: The Home of Two Favorite Bills,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of fame is such that Goldberg is everywhere _ and
nowhere _ at once.
</P>
<P>
   He's in your living room, but seldom in his own. ``I get home
about 5 or 6 days a month,'' he says, ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   He declined several requests to be interviewed at home _ ``I
really guard my privacy'' _ where he lives with former college
roommate Terry Shields, who helps with his business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   When time permits, he and girlfriend for six years, Lisa Shekter
(``She's everything but my live-in girlfriend'') like to tool
around the mountains in one of his vintage muscle cars, especially
his 1968 Chevy Malibu convertible. He also likes to fish in the
Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago all this was unthinkable. Goldberg was just
another ex-athlete _ albeit a gifted one, with a flair for the
outrageous _ but one with zip for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really lost,'' says dad Jed Goldberg, a retired
gynecologist living in Miami. ``He'd call all the time and ask me:
`What do you think I ought to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dad says he never would have foreseen Bill making a living
fighting. ``I don't remember him getting in a single fight as a
child,'' he says, then pauses. ``But, as big as he was, who was
going to mess with him?''
</P>
<P>
   Events conspired to get Goldberg into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestler Lex Luger and Sting, whom he met at their Doraville
(Ga.) athletic club, Main Event Fitness, encouraged him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward he met WCW President Eric Bischoff at an Atlanta
strip joint, The Gold Club, and Bischoff convinced him to take the
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   For six months he trained at WCW's Atlanta wrestling school, the
Power Plant, developing his act. Then he and Bischoff debated a
name.
</P>
<P>
   They considered and discarded a host of them _ ``The Hybrid,''
``Junkyard Dog,'' ``The Warlord,'' ``Massad'' _ then settled on the
most unlikely: his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Bischoff wasn't too excited about it,'' says Goldberg.
``But he grew to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after his TV debut on ``Monday Nitro'', Goldberg learned
that he was ``the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, according to script, he beat Hulk Hogan in a
Monday match at the Georgia Dome and was crowned heavyweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way what happened couldn't have been scripted even by
the most cunning plot twisters in the WCW stable of melodramatists.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Goldberg became a Jewish hero.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Jewish sports hero since pitcher Sandy Koufax, the
most powerful Jewish hero since baseball slugger Hank Greenburg.
Maybe the greatest Jewish wrestler since the Old Testament Jacob
wrestled the angel.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot to put on a 31-year-old guy who doesn't attend
temple regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's how Rabbi Irwin Kula, president of the New York-based
Center for Learning and Leadership, characterized Goldberg in an
interview in the New Yorker magazine in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Jewish paper in the country has written an article about
Bill,'' says Kula, a Goldberg family friend who's attended several
matches and watches ``Monday Nitro'' religiously with his
6-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``His impact on the Jewish community has been tremendous. He
challenges us to widen the markers of our community, and begin to
break stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg acknowledges that. He refused to wrestle on Rosh
Hashanah, ``out of respect for my Jewish fans.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's reluctant to shoulder the load of Jewish role model:
``I don't look at myself as a Jewish sports hero,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, his career is on a trajectory where there are too many
hero roles to fill, already.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he turned down an appearance on ``E.R.'' _ too busy.
Instead, he's looking to movies.
</P>
<P>
   His first film, a Jean-Claude Van Damme actioner tentatively
titled ``Universal Soldier, the Sequel,'' wrapped in February and
is scheduled to open in August.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he played a ``likeable'' bad guy named Romeo, whom
Goldberg hopes will be remembered for his Arnold
Schwarzenegger-like line, ``You think that's going to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this after I had been shot, stabbed, and kicked out of
a sixth-story window,'' he says. ``It takes a lot to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's Los Angeles agent, Barry Bloom, says the Dawsonville
wrestler is ``hot.'' Scripts are being sent to him almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading two right now,'' says Goldberg. ``One's called
`Uncivil Procedure,' the other's a wrestling movie.'' In the former
he'd play the lead romantic role.
</P>
<P>
   Likely later this month, says Bloom, Goldberg will commit to his
second film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk in Hollywood,'' says Bloom, ``is that he's got the
potential of another Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal Soldier'' director Mic Rogers, a former stunt man,
says Goldberg has huge box office potential: ``He's a good actor, a
great athlete, and the camera loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers didn't discover Goldberg watching wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him in an episode of `Love Boat,' and I liked the way he
looked. He has kid in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of ``Universal Soldier'' was rewritten in a way that, if
there is yet another sequel, Goldberg can appear in it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg won't divulge details of his deal with WCW. But his

there is yet another sequel, Goldberg can appear in it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg won't divulge details of his deal with WCW. But his
contract is long-term, say WCW executives. He reportedly earns
about $2 million a year in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, he is house-hunting in San Diego to be closer
to film studios. ``The movies are what I really want to do,'' he
says. ``I don't see myself wrestling to age 40.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where he lives, at the moment, the world is at his
door. And it all seems to want a piece of the hottest wrestler
Spandex shorts ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   After filming wrapped on the set of ``Universal Soldier'' in
February in Dallas, the crew was horsing around with Goldberg, and
the assistant director _ weight, about 130 _ asked Goldberg to
press him over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg picked the guy up, and pumped him up and down several
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then everybody in the crew gathered around and were asking
Goldberg to pick them up too,'' recalls director Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did. He kept giving people rides. They all wanted to ride
Goldberg.''

   HUMANA-THEATER-FESTIVAL (Louisville, Ky.) - Though the play
``Y2K'' was an inexhaustible subject of conversation at the 23rd

   GELMAN-ART-COLLECTION (Paris) _ When Jacques Gelman died in
1986, he and his wife had two quite separate collections: one of
works by modern masters like Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Balthus,
which was kept in New York, the other of paintings and drawings by
this century's most prominent Mexican artists, which was on display
in their home in Cuernavaca, Mexico. When Mrs. Gelman died last
May, she bequeathed the modern masters collection, comprising 85
works worth over $300 million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York. But the final home of the Mexican collection is still in
doubt. By Alan Riding.

NEW IDEA FOR FISH ECHOES SEDERS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The menu for a Passover seder, the dinner that starts the
eight-day observance of the holiday, is largely determined by
ritual and tradition. Certain ceremonial foods, like matzohs,
bitter herbs and wine, must be served. The rest of the meal is
often dictated by family expectations, which can often seem just as
immutable.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping tradition in mind, there is always some room for
culinary variations at Passover, which this year starts on March
31.
</P>
<P>
   For example, instead of making the usual gefilte fish, which is
typically made from a freshwater fish like pike or whitefish, I
prepare delicate quenelle-like gefilte fish using fresh and smoked
salmon, and serve it with horseradish mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Another variation was suggested to me by a dish at Le Bernardin,
the French fish restaurant in Manhattan. Though Le Bernardin,
unlike some restaurants in New York, will not be serving a special
Passover menu, Eric Ripert, the chef and one of the owners, has
come up with an appropriate dish: steamed halibut in borscht with
warm chive-horseradish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicious and visually stunning dish that hits the
correct flavor notes for the holiday menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something with beets,'' Ripert said. ``I looked
up borscht in some cookbooks and adapted it for a fish dish.''
</P>
<P>
   For families with roots in Russia or Poland, the beets and
horseradish _ familiar ingredients in those countries _ may evoke
memories of Grandmother's seders years ago. One could chill the
sauce and, instead of the halibut, substitute ovals of gefilte
fish, which is often served with beet horseradish.
</P>
<P>
   To conform to kosher dietary laws, mayonnaise can be used
instead of creme fraiche for a meal that contains meat. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   STEAMED HALIBUT IN BORSCHT WITH WARM CHIVE-HORSERADISH SAUCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Eric Ripert, Le Bernardin &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil or corn oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, julienned
</P>
<P>
   1 cup julienned fennel
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sliced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped savoy cabbage, plus 3 of the darker outer leaves,
finely julienned
</P>
<P>
   1 quart well-seasoned chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   4 cups peeled and julienned fresh beets (about 1{ bunches)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup creme fraiche, sour cream or mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   \ cup prepared white horseradish
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced chives
</P>
<P>
   8 halibut steaks or fillets, each 4 to 6 ounces, or 8 portions
chilled gefilte fish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat oil in a heavy 3-quart saucepan. Add onions and fennel
and cook slowly about 5 minutes, until softened. Tie garlic, thyme,
parsley and chopped cabbage in a double thickness of cheesecloth
and add it to saucepan along with stock and beets. Simmer 15
minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
Discard cheesecloth and its contents. To serve the dish chilled,
refrigerate beet mixture at least 4 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add
julienned cabbage leaves, cook just until bright green, then drain.
Set leaves aside, covered, to keep warm; for a cold dish,
refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mix creme fraiche, sour cream or mayonnaise with horseradish,
sugar and chives. If using mayonnaise, thin it beforehand with 2
tablespoons water. This sauce can be gently warmed in a small
saucepan or chilled to serve cold.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, steam halibut until fully cooked outside and just
warm inside, 6 to 8 minutes. Keep warm. Reheat beet mixture, spoon
into warmed shallow soup plates, sprinkle with julienned cabbage
and top with fish. Or spoon chilled beet mixture into shallow soup
plates, add cabbage, and top with gefilte fish. Serve horseradish
sauce, warm or chilled, on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.

   PLANT CITY, Fla. _ Consider the strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most perfect of fruits: alluringly red, subtly
perfumed, shaped like a heart, sweet as a smile. It is an emblem of
summer, the most fulfilling of seasons. The English essayist
William Butler got it right 400 years ago when he wrote,
``Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God
never did.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the most frustrating of fruits: difficult to grow,
vulnerable to disease, costly to harvest, dauntingly perishable.
Until the development of railroads in the middle of the 19th
century, strawberries had to be eaten where grown, as soon as they
were picked. Their fleeting season was a season of celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the strawberry socials that flourished long ago in small
town America, often in churchyards picturesquely decked with
Japanese lanterns. Hence Zola's Nana, a city girl, ecstatic at her
first sight of strawberry fields, squatting in the mud and plucking
the ripe, juicy fruit as the rain pelted down.
</P>
<P>
   Escoffier thought strawberries a sufficiently royal delicacy to
name a dessert he invented _ strawberries macerated in orange juice
and curacao, served in a crystal bowl with creme chantilly _ after
the Russian royal family, the Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   In England, brimming bowls of strawberries during the Wimbledon
tennis matches still epitomize the summer social season.
</P>
<P>
   But today winter strawberries are taken for granted by consumers
in New York and Philadelphia and Chicago, who have no idea how much
ingenuity, technique and labor have been lavished on the project of
growing them out of season and getting them to market.
</P>
<P>
   They are never quite as satisfying as the ones snatched from the
garden in June and drenched in cream, any more than trucked-in
sweet corn ever quite matches the succulence of home-grown. But
they are more than reasonable facsimiles, and miraculous, if you
think about them, sitting perkily there on the market shelf while
arctic air swirls outside.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the strawberries consumed in the eastern half of the
country during the winter come from farms within a 50-mile radius
of Plant City, a little Florida town with lots of strawberry-red
signs, just east of the urban sprawl of Tampa. This is the Winter
Strawberry Capital of the World, the local chamber of commerce
says, and it seems never to have occurred to anyone to challenge
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Why here? The local soil is sandy, which is good, but other
places have sandy soil. More important, Plant City is about as far
north (and therefore as close to the winter-bound urban markets) as
practical, given the berries' susceptibility to frost damage.
</P>
<P>
   It also got an early start, in the 1880s, when Henry B. Plant
brought the railroad across the peninsula from Jacksonville to
Tampa, with a stop here. Many modern growers are great-grandsons of
the strawberry pioneers, who named their town for the railroad man.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the berries travel by refrigerated truck. Picked by
hand at 8 in the morning, deposited by the picker directly into a
pint basket sitting with 11 others on a cardboard flat, that flat
sitting with 111 others on a pallet, a ripe strawberry goes
straight from the field to a broker's chiller, a boxcar-size room
that takes the fruit down to about 36 degrees, and from there
directly into a refrigerated truck.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., the truck will be out on Interstate 4, headed north,
and 48 hours after that, with any luck, the berry will be on sale
in a supermarket somewhere in the snow belt.
</P>
<P>
   By then _ and here is the problem, for all the hybridization and
advances in cultivation and transport methods in recent years _ the
berry will already be halfway through its useful life, even if
harvested at the optimum moment and handled with care.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries cannot be picked green, like bananas, and ripened
artificially; they must be picked when they are fully ripe, and
they remain at peak flavor for only four or five days after that.
If they are mishandled _ if, for example, they are washed or their
green caps are removed too soon, and not just before they are eaten
_ they will deteriorate much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The berries' shelf life can be increased slightly by wrapping
whole pallet loads in stout plastic bags and replacing the air
inside with carbon dioxide, which retards spoilage. But that
increases the price.
</P>
<P>
   Other things being equal, strawberries picked toward the end of
the season tend to be sweeter. Other things being equal, those that
have ripened during moderate weather tend to be sweeter than those
that have been subjected to too much heat or too much cold. But
other things are not always equal, as Erin Best of the Florida
Strawberry Growers Association readily concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get to the retailer, who knows how long they sit in
the warehouse?'' she asked. ``Are they kept in coolers until they
go on sale? Are they displayed in refrigerated cases or not? All
that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Best's tips: choose berries with bright green caps; brownish
caps mean old fruit. Look for uniformity of size and color; if the
bottom layer differs from the top, that's a sign that the picker is
cutting corners. And if you are not going to eat the berries almost
as soon as you get them home, spread them out on a cookie sheet and
put them into the refrigerator that way.
</P>
<P>
   This is a high-investment, hard-labor, drive-you-crazy
business,'' said Billy Simmons, 46, a fourth-generation strawberry
farmer, who tried working in an office but gave up the security of
a regular paycheck for the precarious pleasures of tilling the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Each year, he said, brings some new trial. A couple of years
ago, the growers spent weeks watching temperature gauges and
listening for alarms each night, talking nervously with their
neighbors on a radio-telephone network, ready to spray their fields
with water to coat the strawberry plants with protective shields of
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there was no frost. But 10 days of rain left many
berries unappetizingly soggy. This year, robins are the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, lovable old robin redbreasts, in their thousands. As
Simmons stood alongside one of his fields, explaining cultivation
methods to me, his son Shad, 18, raced from one corner of the
property to another, hopping out of his truck to fire his 12-gauge
shotgun into the air and scatter the birds.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what he or others in the nearby fields fired,
whether blanks that banged impressively or shells that whistled
noisily, the robins flew just a few yards before alighting on
another tempting row of strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like World War III,'' Simmons said. ``I've got two guys
blasting away, 12 hours a day, for all the good it does. It's the
worst case of robins we've had in 10 years, 500-600 in one field.
You have to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Why not cover the plants with nets? asked the visiting weekend
gardener. Money, Simmons answered; covering a few rows of
strawberries in a family plot is simple, but protecting Plant
City's crop would take 253 million square feet of netting.
</P>
<P>
   Comically primitive as the gunfire may seem, it holds the losses
down. But it is the only thing primitive about growing strawberries
in winter, which is in all other respects a prime example of
modern, capital-intensive, technology-assisted agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are grown in raised beds _ long hillocks of mounded
earth, two feet wide, formed and compacted by a shaping device
towed through the fields by a tractor. The shaper is then unhooked
and another device hitched up. It buries plastic tubing in the
hillocks and covers the rows with black plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
   The tubing carries water and fertilizer directly to the plants'
roots; the sheeting retains heat and moisture and inhibits the
growth of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   When planting time comes in October, the plants are set by hand,
mostly by Hispanic workers, some of them migrants, through holes
punched in the plastic. Most of the plants come from Nova Scotia or
Quebec. Summers are cooler there, Simmons explained, which means
the tender seedlings are less subject to ``bugs and blights.'' The
last season he used Florida-grown plants, he said, he lost almost
two-thirds of them to one disease or another.
</P>
<P>
   That was no insignificant loss. Hybrid strawberry plants cost
$80 a thousand, and an acre holds about 20,000 plants. Since
Simmons farms more than 30 acres, about average for the 150 growers
in the area, he spends about $50,000 every fall on seedlings. It
takes 100 million plants to fill the fields that surround Plant
City, which produce close to 20 percent of the nation's
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   The first fruit appears on the plants after roughly 35 days, and
it keeps coming, so the berries must be picked manually and
individually, like grapes for a beerenauslese wine. At any given
moment, a plant contains tiny, immature, white berries, half-grown
green berries and big, mature red berries, so glossy they look
almost as if they had been coated with enamel.
</P>
<P>
   The pickers work the same row 30 to 50 times before the season
ends in April or May, when the weather gets too hot (and California
strawberries flood the market).
</P>
<P>
   Virginia strawberries grow wild in the Eastern United States;
the cooking writer Edna Lewis mentions picking them along streams
and fence rows in her Virginia childhood. For two centuries, they
were the world's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1712, a French engineer brought another species, the
Chilean strawberry, back from a voyage to South America; his name,
incredibly enough, was Frezier, pronounced like ``fraisier,'' which
means ``strawberry plant.'' A cross of the two New World varieties
on the Plougastel peninsula in Brittany produced the garden
strawberry now cultivated everywhere, in a wide number of
hybridized varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Simmons' strawberries are Sweet Charlies, and a
third are Camarosas. Camarosas are California-bred, but Sweet
Charlies are Florida natives, developed at the nation's only
research lab devoted to strawberries, the Research and Education
Station of the University of Florida, located near Dover, just a
few miles down the road from the Simmons properties.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, scientists there produce 100 to 150 experimental
genetic crosses. Seeds taken from them are germinated, and 10,000
to 15,000 plants are set out in trial beds each year. The
scientists consider themselves lucky if 1 in 10,000 shows promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This center has released two varieties in 10 years,'' said Dr.
David D. Dunigan, a plant virologist on the Dover staff. ``We have
a couple now that we're keeping a close watch on. This is no work
for people in a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry hybridization is a kind of balancing act. Obviously,
bad-tasting strawberries won't sell, so those are eliminated. The
goal is a juicy sweetness, balanced by a slight undertone of acid,
in a berry that is soft, with no hint of woodiness, but still firm
enough ``to make it to Montreal in the back of a semi,'' in
Dunigan's words.
</P>
<P>
   Looks and size do not affect taste, but they affect sales.
Everyone knows that perfectly symmetrical scarlet jumbos can taste
like polystyrene. The very best strawberries I ever tasted came
from the village of Dalat, in the mountains of Vietnam _
phenomenally sweet little things, bursting with juice, the essence
of strawberrydom. They were also mottled and misshaped, just the
kind of thing American consumers scorn.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to flavor, glamour and road-worthiness, Dunigan and
his colleagues look for good plant architecture. If the berries
develop underneath the leaves, they are hard to pick efficiently,
so the scientists choose varieties whose berries stand apart from
the foliage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet another attribute the breeders seek is disease resistance,
which is one of the reasons they are so partial to Sweet Charlie,
which was named for the late Dr. Charles Howard, the hybridizer who
came up with it. Sweet Charlie is naturally resistant to
Colletotrichum acutatum, a highly dangerous fungus that attacks
strawberry plants.
</P>
<P>
   No variety is perfect, of course. And even the best varieties
require the most finicky kind of care throughout the growing
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be out there in the fields with them every single
day,'' Dunigan said. ``It's nothing like planting corn and hanging
around, waiting for the harvest. Growing winter strawberries is the
most technical and the most intensely managed system of agriculture
that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to be expected, I suppose, when the result is another
out-of-season treat for the pampered shoppers of 20th-century
America. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   About { cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sour cream. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Into a large mixing bowl, sift
together flour, baking powder, \ cup sugar and salt. Add cream
cheese and chilled butter. Using a pastry blender or two knives,
cut the cream cheese and butter into the mixture until it resembles
coarse cornmeal.
</P>
<P>
   2. Break the egg into a measuring cup, and beat lightly with a
fork. Add enough milk to make } cup. Pour the egg mixture into the
flour mixture, and stir. Knead the dough inside the bowl just until
it is blended and cohesive, about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shape half of the dough into a flattened ball, and place in a
greased 8-inch round cake pan. Pat the dough flat to the edges of
the pan. Brush the top of the dough with the melted butter. Shape
the remaining dough into a flattened ball, and place in the pan on
the buttered dough, patting flat to the edges. Bake until golden
brown, 17 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place sliced strawberries in a mixing bowl, add sugar to
taste and mix well. Place sour cream in a small bowl, and add sugar
to taste, mixing well. To serve, remove cake from pan, and pry
layers apart with a knife; they should split where the dough was
buttered. Place the bottom layer on a serving plate: top with
strawberries. Place the second layer over the strawberries: top
with sour cream. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

   STRAWBERRY POTS DE CREME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Francis Coulson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus 6 hours' chilling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces strawberries (7 or 8 large berries), hulled
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons superfine sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons Cointreau. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. In the container of a blender,
combine strawberries, sugar and egg yolks. Process until pureed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Pass strawberry mixture
through a fine sieve into a bowl. Add 1 cup cream and Cointreau.
Mix well. Divide mixture evenly among four 1-cup ramekins. Place
ramekins in a baking dish, and add enough boiling water to come
halfway up the sides of ramekins.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place the baking dish in the oven, and bake until the custard
is just set and slightly wobbly in the center, about 1 hour. Remove
from the oven; place ramekins on a rack and cool. Cover with foil
or plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 6 hours. To serve, pour 1
or 2 tablespoons of cream on top of each custard, so that each time
a spoonful is eaten, cream fills the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unless strawberries are perfect, they may need a little help to
be called dessert. All but one of these treatments take 15 minutes
or less, using hulled berries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sprinkle sliced berries with sugar _ a tablespoon to a quarter
cup per pint _ and let sit 10 minutes until they have juiced up a
bit. Sprinkle them with orange liqueur or fresh orange juice cut
with a little lemon. Or turn them with a teaspoon or more of
balsamic vinegar and a little black pepper; garnish with fresh
mint.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fold sliced berries into a mixture of sour cream or yogurt and
lightly whipped cream, about one cup per pint. Add sugar to taste,
and let sit five minutes before serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place 2 cups sliced berries in a baking or gratin dish. Top
with a cup of heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks with a couple of
tablespoons of sugar. Broil until lightly and evenly browned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a granita: Puree 2 cups berries, then add sugar and lemon
juice to taste. Pour into a shallow glass or ceramic dish and
freeze about two hours, stirring to break up the crystals every 30
minutes. It should be slushy.

CREATIVE COOKS THINK `MODULAR'

   PHOENIX - Got a good recipe for a hamburger?
</P>
<P>
   A recipe? For a hamburger? Who uses a recipe for a burger? You
cannot live in America for more than six months and not know how to
make hamburgers without needing a recipe. It's too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for someone who cooks regularly, it is the same way for
most dishes. You don't need a recipe to fry chicken or to bake a
meatloaf. Besides, it isn't really a recipe at all, but a process.
</P>
<P>
   The hamburger, for instance. You can make them big or small,
from ground chuck or ground sirloin. You can douse them with
ketchup or mustard. Add Swiss cheese or Velveeta. Cover them in
slices of raw onion or smother them with caramelized, sauteed
onions. Plop them on a kaiser roll or an onion roll. You even can
smother them with bacon and bleu cheese. There are hundreds of
variations, yet each and every one is a hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who cooks regularly knows this: Cooking is not a rote
activity, but one that you feel in your fingertips. It is process,
not rules.
</P>
<P>
   And it is surprising how few processes there are. There is
boiling, frying, poaching, baking, braising, sauteing, grilling _ a
few more: saucemaking, egg separation, dough-kneading, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can fry a chicken breast, you can fry a breaded veal
cutlet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you master the few basic techniques, you can
interchange ingredients with complete abandon and come up with a
vast menu of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   I call it ``modular cooking,'' and it means you can build up
your own ``recipes'' from whatever you have in your larder.
</P>
<P>
   Let me take just one example: Linguine Nilsenesca.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fancy name for an ordinary dish. (In fact, one of the
great subsidiary pleasures of cooking up your own ideas is you can
name them whatever you want to.)
</P>
<P>
   Linguine Nilsenesca, for instance, is a basic Italian tomato
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   I start with hot olive oil in a deep frying pan. I add chopped
onions, garlic and peppers. Sometimes the peppers are jalapenos,
sometimes just blocky bell peppers.
</P>
<P>
   When the vegetables begin to soften, add a fistful of dried or
fresh basil. It's personal taste, but I don't think it's possible
to add too much basil.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really matter how much of any of this you use.
Different proportions merely vary the flavor. Any proportion will
work. If you like more garlic, double the amount. If you don't care
for peppers, leave them out.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing fills the kitchen and the nearby rooms with the
pungent aroma of great eating. Family members float into the
kitchen hooked by their noses.
</P>
<P>
   You cook this mess down until it looks really ugly. The ugliness
is important: The uglier your sauce looks at this stage, the better
it will taste.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you can add some browned chopmeat. If you don't
want meat in the sauce, leave it out. If chopmeat isn't enough, add
some cooked Italian sausage.
</P>
<P>
   When it is all hot and sputtering, douse the whole in a good
dose of red wine. It will sputter and fuss and deglaze the bottom
of the pan. I usually let the wine just barely cover the mess in
the pan. Less will do, so will more.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the wine down until you cannot imagine eating what you see
in your pot: a dark, purple, gummy conglomeration of ingredients,
sticking together like tar.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not ugly enough.
</P>
<P>
   When the wine is almost gone, add the contents of a small can of
tomato paste, stirring it in with a spoon so that everything is
covered with a thin layer of paste. Fry it down until just before
it begins to burn, stirring constantly.
</P>
<P>
   When you have reached this stage, it is as ugly as it's going to
get. Then you save your reputation by adding tomato sauce or canned
tomatoes. It doesn't matter exactly how much, but enough to make
the sauce come up red.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the time and inclination, you certainly can use
fresh tomatoes, peeled and dumped in, instead of canned.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever you use, stir it into the mess and smooth everything
out.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you will have cooked up a mess of linguine in a
separate pot. When the sauce is cooked, you simply ladle it over
the drained linguine and eat it, with or without Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best spaghetti sauce I have ever eaten. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meet the modules
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I call this cooking modular, because it is essentially built up
from six essential modules:
</P>
<P>
   - Fat
</P>
<P>
   - Vegetables
</P>
<P>
   - Meat
</P>
<P>
   - Seasoning
</P>
<P>
   - Sauce
</P>
<P>
   - Starch
</P>
<P>
   You now can change anything around: Substitute chicken for
chopmeat and you have Chicken cacciatore.
</P>
<P>
   Switch them all around and you can come up with:
</P>
<P>
   - Coq au vin
</P>
<P>
   - Beef stroganoff
</P>
<P>
   - Mock Hawaiian Chili
</P>
<P>
   - Chicken Motocross
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you make coq au vin, you begin with bacon fat
instead of olive oil. You brown your floured chicken pieces in the
hot fat and reserve them. Add a bunch of small onions and mushrooms
_ carrots and small potatoes, if you want 'em _ and brown them,
along with some garlic, thyme and tarragon.
</P>
<P>
   They don't need to get as ugly as the tomato sauce, but they
should turn a nice golden color. Add the chicken back to the pot,
and dump in a lot of red wine, enough to cover generously. You can
mix the wine half-and-half with chicken stock.
</P>
<P>
   Let the pot cook down for over an hour or so, depending on how
thick you like your sauce and how soft you like your chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the whole thing with baguettes of stiff French bread and
you're in business.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute beef for chicken and a coq au vin turns into a boeuf
bourguignon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lots of options &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For stroganoff, begin with butter, saute your stew beef and
mushrooms, add your paprika and sour cream, slowly, incorporating
it slowly to prevent curdling, and serve it over egg noodles.
</P>
<P>
   For the chili, you start much the way you do for the Linguine
Nilsenesca, but you make sure the peppers are hot ones and you use
a blander vegetable oil. If you want something less bland, use
lard. It has a distinct flavor, but few Americans retain the taste
for it that their ancestors had.
</P>
<P>
   And after you add your browned chopmeat, you dump in a dose of
cumin instead of the Italian seasoning, and you also add lots and
lots of beans. You can use canned beans, or you can use some dried
pintos you have cooked up. Canned tomatoes help make a sauce, along
with the bean juice.
</P>
<P>
   To make this variation, ``mock Hawaiian,'' we add some raisins
and diced pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it is served on a bed of rice.
</P>
<P>
   The process is always the same, get the fat hot and add the meat
and/or veggies, get them skizzied, add the spices or herbs, dump in
the sauce and cook till done, then ladle the stuff over your
starch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pantry search &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The simple process turns into hundreds of variants:
</P>
<P>
   - Possible fats: butter, peanut oil, olive oil, ghee, bacon fat,
fatback, lard.
</P>
<P>
   - Possible meats: stew beef, sausage, ground beef, lamb, pork,
chicken, tuna fish, veal.
</P>
<P>
   - Possible spices: coriander, thyme, basil, cumin, rosemary,
garlic, vanilla, chiles, more garlic, sage, tarragon, asafetida,
garam masala, parsley, etc.
</P>
<P>
   - Possible vegetables: potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, corn, peas,
beans, pintos, spinach, cabbage, etc.
</P>
<P>
   - Possible sauces: gravies, sauces, glazes, soups; made with
tomatoes, wines, milk products, bouillons, coffee, bechamels, etc.
</P>
<P>
   - Possible starches: pastas, potatoes, breads, rice, noodles,
zwieback, grits, etc.
</P>
<P>
   When you get the process down, you will enjoy the creative
challenges it presents. Like when you have nothing planned, or you
weren't able to get out to the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   You look through your pantry and see what is available. Then you
play mix and match, plugging what you have into the basic modular
process.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly how Chicken Motocross was invented. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chicken Motocross &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is low-rent food if ever there was. It is the basic,
stripped-down version of the process, and as fast to make as
anything:
</P>
<P>
   - Oil _ whatever you have.
</P>
<P>
   - Meat _ chicken. You even can use canned chicken.
</P>
<P>
   - Vegetables _ I like onions and diced carrots. Canned is fine.
</P>
<P>
   - Seasoning _ It doesn't take much beyond ground pepper,
although a small amount of thyme is good, too.
</P>
<P>
   - Sauce _ After the above ingredients are skizzied, add a can of
cream of mushroom soup and serve over:
</P>
<P>
   - Starch _ sliced, toasted bread.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly gourmet fare, but it is filling and fast. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No mistakes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have touched on only one modular process here. There are many
others, including lower-fat modules. There are salads to be
constructed, vegetable dishes, omelet processes. Even breadmaking
can be approached this way, once you learn what a basic dough
should feel like as you knead it.
</P>
<P>
   The process should free you. No longer are you tied to recipes
and no longer should you ever worry about failing in the kitchen. A
mistake is only a variation.
</P>
<P>
   After that, salt and pepper to taste. &QL;

 &HT;    SENATOR TO MOVE AGAINST INTERNET STOCK FRAUD
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In response to a flood of consumer complaints
charging securities fraud on the Internet, a key senator said
Tuesday she would soon sponsor bipartisan legislation that would
grant regulators more power to combat the swindles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on legislation to help them do a better policing
job,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in concluding two days of
hearings as chairman of the Senate permanent investigations
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard a litany of abuses cited by a host of witnesses,
including Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), which watches over U.S. financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the same scams, but just in a new medium,''
Walker said. He said they include phony stock offerings, pyramid
schemes that depend on an ever-expanding base of new investors,
attempts to manipulate the securities markets, and illegal touting
of stocks through online newsletters, bulletin boards, chat rooms,
and mass e-mailings.
</P>
<P>
   The Collins bill would give the SEC more power to base its
enforcement actions on the findings of state regulators. Under
current law, it must probe each individual charge separately,
rather than relying on relevant evidence previously gathered by
state investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Collins would expand the SEC's sanction power,
permitting the agency to ban anyone from becoming a stock promoter
if he or she had fallen under a prior SEC ban from working as a
broker or investment adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said both legislative steps would enhance the agency's
ability to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he noted, some people who had been barred from the
brokerage business build fresh careers as stock promoters, teaming
up with unscrupulous brokers who push targeted stocks on their
unsuspecting customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be able to bring faster cases based on how successfully
we have
</P>
<P>
   seen it work the other way,'' Walker also said. State securities
regulators currently utilize SEC-generated data for their own
enforcement actions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the panel's ranking Democrat, said
he would back both provisions. ``We need to shore up enforcement
mechanisms'' and review current penalties to dampen Internet
securities fraud, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Collins' two-pronged approach, Levin said he favors
requiring financial investment sites to provide links to Internet
sites of regulatory agencies such as the SEC or state consumer
protection units.
</P>
<P>
   Another subcommittee witness, G. Philip Rutledge, deputy chief
counsel of the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, said: ``One of
the most important actions which can be taken now to help protect
investors from securities fraud on the Internet is making the
information maintained in the central registration depository
operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
accessible to public investors via a Web site.''

TEN YEARS AFTER EXXON VALDEZ DISASTER, CHANGES ARE VISIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORDOVA, Alaska _ The day was clear and visibility on Prince
William Sound was unlimited, but two escort vessels hovered close
by the Chevron Mississippi earlier this month as the tanker swung
past Bligh Reef.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, 10 years ago today, that the unescorted Exxon
Valdez, which had moved out of shipping lanes to avoid icebergs
calved by the Columbia Glacier, ran aground and disgorged more than
11 million gallons of oil into one of America's premier sanctuaries
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson we learned from that oil spill is that we must pay
the price of prevention because we know the cost of complacency,''
said Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Cordova fisher Kara Bergquist put it: ``The idea of
`cleaning up' an oil spill is a joke. If you don't prevent it, you
aren't going to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has developed ``the world's safest transportation
system'' for oil, and put in place the world's greatest
concentration of spill cleanup equipment, Knowles said in an
interview earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   One weak link remains in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of 28 oil tankers plying Prince William Sound are
equipped with double hulls. The additional safety cushion would
have reduced the 11-million-gallon Exxon Valdez spill by as much as
60 percent, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And key architects of the Sound's enhanced emergency response
and tanker escort system _ the oil industry and the U.S. Coast
Guard _ have continued to resist similar measures in other
sensitive waterways, including the Strait of Juan de Fuca, that
ship and receive oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear was, if they built it for Alaska, they'd have to put
one in other places,'' said Knowles, alluding to the lack of tug
escorts elsewhere on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Along the route once traveled by the Exxon Valdez, tankers now
have plenty of company. Last month, the Alyeska Pipeline Co. took
delivery of a new, 10,192-horsepower tractor tug. Exceptionally
maneuverable, it can approach and nudge a tanker from any
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Alyeska has created a $60 million a year program called the Ship
Escort Response Vessel System, or SERVS, that is designed to
provide assistance instantly if a tanker loses power or steering,
or runs into any other difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Each oil-laden tanker leaving Prince William Sound has at least
two escort ships from the moment it leaves the pipeline terminus at
Valdez until it hits the open waters of the Gulf of Alaska. A
transponder on board allows ships' positions to be precisely
monitored at all times.
</P>
<P>
   An ocean-going tug stays within a quarter mile of the tanker for
its entire transit through the Sound. A tractor tug also is on hand
for passage through the confined waters of Valdez Narrows and past
Bligh Reef. When the tractor tug's job is done, a sentinel vessel
from Naked Island then joins the tanker for its journey through
open waters of the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Hinchinbrook, the Sound's entrance, a deep water rescue
tug appears to join the ocean-going tug that has been with the
tanker since Valdez. ``It stays on station until the tanker is 20
miles out in the Gulf of Alaska,'' said Greg Jones, SERVS assistant
manager for Alyeska.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate safety system did not come about without pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act in response to
public outcry after the Exxon Valdez spill. It substantially
increased polluters' liability for spills and established a
billion-dollar national cleanup fund.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation set up two Regional Citizens Advisory Committees
to monitor safety measures in Alaskan waters.
</P>
<P>
   One became a catalyst for safety measures in Prince William
Sound. It campaigned for more cleanup gear and more tug escorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil industry had this huge fear that what they did here,
they would have to do everywhere else,'' said Michelle O'Leary, a
Cordova fishewoman who served on the council until last November.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Prince William Sound, oil-laden tankers entering the
Strait of Juan de Fuca off the Washington coast receive no escort
for more than 70 miles until they pass Dungeness Spit east of Port
Angeles, Wash. A rescue tug has been stationed at Neah Bay, but
only as a 60-day experiment that expires in May.
</P>
<P>
   With the safety measures they have helped implement in Prince
William Sound, Alaskans have applied their expertise to other West
Coast tanker routes.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Stephens, veteran tour boat operator out of Valdez, praises
spill-prevention measures taken by the Coast Guard. The failure of
the Coast Guard to track the Exxon Valdez before the spill was a
major, albeit unreported, factor in the 1989 disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard has been a big part of prevention measures we
now have in place,'' Stephens said. ``For instance, they've put
transponders in tankers, so they can be tracked and followed every
moment they are in the Sound. It is something that should be done
all the way up and down the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rest of the world could get to where we're at _ and we
still have a ways to go _ transportation would be far safer,
particularly along our coastlines,'' Stephens added.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, however, the Coast Guard testified this
winter against legislation to require tug escorts for all oil
tankers as soon as they enter the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency has argued that it should be allowed to
complete a lengthy risk assessment study on such issues as whether
tug escorts would be a help or hindrance in congested waters off
Cape Flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Prince William Sound residents are unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well and good that they have a vessel traffic system down
there that can spot a tanker heading toward the rocks. What the
hell are they going to do about it if a tug is not there?'' asked
Dan Lawn of the Alaska Forum for Environmental Responsibility, a
conservation group oriented to marine safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before the Exxon Valdez disaster, Lawn represented
the state of Alaska's Department of Environmental Quality in
Valdez. He repeatedly reported Alyeska's inadequate spill response.
Nobody listened to him then.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries groups also tried to point out shortcomings in spill
response. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, delivered a sweeping safey
assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wernher von Braun, you know, the spaceman, assured me that all
of the technology of the space program will be put into the doggone
tankers and there will not be one drop of oil in Prince William
Sound,'' Stevens told fishermen during pipeline construction in the
1970s, referring to the famous German-American rocket scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody talks like that anymore. Alaskans are impressed by the
new tugs, the spill cleanup equipment stationed around Prince
William Sound, and the annual cleanup training given to the crews
of 350 fishing vessels under contract to Alyeska.
</P>
<P>
   Even such hard-nosed critics as Dan Lawn are also singing the
praises of Alyeska's new president, Bob Malone, who has signaled
aggressive commitment to excellence in safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have everything we need? No,'' said Lawn. ``But are we
getting closer to where we need to be? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Stephens chaired the advisory committee until recently. He
stood beside Knowles and Malone on the bridge of the tractor tug
last when Alyeska took delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've understood a number of things,'' said Stephens. ``The
Sound was injured (by the Exxon Valdez) in a way that it will be
many, many years before it comes back. Once a spill is out there,
you can't clean it up. We simply can't have another major spill.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyeska's Jones echoes the point. ``Prevention is our principal
focus,'' he said. ``We believe the challenge of a (potential) large
oil spill is that you don't want to have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyeska is not only buying equipment, but using it. ``We're
going to do a lot more drilling with the tug fleet so if the day
comes when they have to act, they will know instinctively what to
do,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens is worried on one count. Oil prices are down and
companies are making cutbacks in Alaska and elsewhere. He worries
about safety along the trans-Alaska pipeline and in the terminal
and tank farm at Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles argued, however, that spill prevention along the
pipeline and in Prince William Sound is ``a non-negotiable point.
It is not dependent on the price of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of double-hulled tankers _ chief worry of those who
predicted the Exxon Valdez disaster _ won't be remedied any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that the vast majority of tankers loading up
in Alaska _ and unloading oil on Puget Sound _ have shells that are
only an inch and a half thick.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave the oil shipping industry until 2015 to equip all
tankers in U.S. waters with double hulls.
</P>
<P>
   The one oil producer that has switched entirely to double-hulled
tankers _ CONOCO _ does not load up oil from Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The largest shipper of Alaskan oil, British Petroleum, has
chartered three double-hulled tankers for use in Prince William
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO Marine is building three large double-hull tankers. It will
start using the 125,000-ton, 895-foot-long state-of-the-art vessels
on the Valdez-to-Puget Sound run next year. The new tankers will
have two independent sets of rudders, propellers and engines. Bow
thrusters, combined with twin propellers, will greatly increase
maneuverability.
</P>
<P>
   While it has built double-hulled tankers for the international
trade, Chevron still uses a single-hull tanker to take on oil at
Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   And Exxon, whose tanker ran aground on Good Friday a decade ago?
</P>
<P>
   The company has argued that oil spills have dropped dramatically
in the last 10 years. Exxon says it supports the largest research
and development program in the oil industry, sharing with
competitors multiple advances in cleanup technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, SeaRiver Maritime, Exxon's shipping subsidiary, sees no
need to build double-hull tankers for operation on Alaska's Prince
William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The company has told the citizens' advisory committee that
production at Alaska's North Slope oil fields is declining, and
that it will end tanker shipments out out of Valdez long before the
federal requirement of double hulls takes effect.

 &HT;    SENATOR TO MOVE AGAINST INTERNET STOCK FRAUD
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In response to a flood of consumer complaints
charging securities fraud on the Internet, a key senator said
Tuesday she would soon sponsor bipartisan legislation that would
grant regulators more power to combat the swindles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on legislation to help them do a better policing
job,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in concluding two days of
hearings as chairman of the Senate permanent investigations
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard a litany of abuses cited by a host of witnesses,
including Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), which watches over U.S. financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the same scams, but just in a new medium,''
Walker said. He said they include phony stock offerings, pyramid
schemes that depend on an ever-expanding base of new investors,
attempts to manipulate the securities markets, and illegal touting
of stocks through online newsletters, bulletin boards, chat rooms,
and mass e-mailings.
</P>
<P>
   The Collins bill would give the SEC more power to base its
enforcement actions on the findings of state regulators. Under
current law, it must probe each individual charge separately,
rather than relying on relevant evidence previously gathered by
state investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Collins would expand the SEC's sanction power,
permitting the agency to ban anyone from becoming a stock promoter
if he or she had fallen under a prior SEC ban from working as a
broker or investment adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said both legislative steps would enhance the agency's
ability to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he noted, some people who had been barred from the
brokerage business build fresh careers as stock promoters, teaming
up with unscrupulous brokers who push targeted stocks on their
unsuspecting customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be able to bring faster cases based on how successfully
we have
</P>
<P>
   seen it work the other way,'' Walker also said. State securities
regulators currently utilize SEC-generated data for their own
enforcement actions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the panel's ranking Democrat, said
he would back both provisions. ``We need to shore up enforcement
mechanisms'' and review current penalties to dampen Internet
securities fraud, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Collins' two-pronged approach, Levin said he favors
requiring financial investment sites to provide links to Internet
sites of regulatory agencies such as the SEC or state consumer
protection units.
</P>
<P>
   Another subcommittee witness, G. Philip Rutledge, deputy chief
counsel of the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, said: ``One of
the most important actions which can be taken now to help protect
investors from securities fraud on the Internet is making the
information maintained in the central registration depository
operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
accessible to public investors via a Web site.''

NO STOPPING STAHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Television reporter Lesley Stahl has heard from only
one person since her memoir, ``Reporting Live,'' was published in
January.
</P>
<P>
   And the call came through a third party. Via that circuitous
route, former first lady Nancy Reagan let Stahl know that her
husband, former President Reagan, did not have Alzheimer's disease
while in office, as Stahl speculated in her book. End of message.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl well might have been flogged by other principal players
who appear in this account of her celestial career. Her words paint
many as rogues.
</P>
<P>
   Former colleague Daniel Schorr accused her of stealing documents
from his office that he actually had leaked to the ``Village
Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   President Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell, froze her out
of White House press conferences until she sparked a dust-up that
persuaded him to change his tune.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS cameraman once heaved his equipment into his truck in
disgust when he discovered that the blond female newcomer _ Stahl _
would be the anchor on his story.
</P>
<P>
   Newsman David Brinkley gave her the sage career advice, ``You're
a pretty blonde. You should stay in New York and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But only Nancy Reagan has called.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no news is good news. In writing the book, Stahl, in
fact, did go back and interview ``gobs of people'' she expected to
write about, ensuring that her memories matched theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporting Live'' is no ambush job. She does not pull a George
Stephanopoulos, blindsiding former friends with a titillating
tell-all.
</P>
<P>
   This is an engaging account of one woman's career born of the
affirmative-action movement that won her her first network job. It
ends with her appointment as ``60 Minutes'' correspondent and the
ascendancy of CNN, whose dominance in broadcast journalism has
dulled the glitter of all network jobs.
</P>
<P>
   During the golden age of network news, Stahl says, ``I was a
little princess.''
</P>
<P>
   Princess Lesley will appear Sunday at Arizona State University
as part of the ``Unique Lives &AMP; Experiences'' series of lectures by
celebrated women.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, she reports that on that night, one of her most
significant stories will be airing on ``60 Minutes,'' where she has
worked since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Stahl, by phone from New York, says it's not an interview
with a foreign power or an expose of horrific social conditions in
a Third World country _ areas in which Stahl has made her name.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of this rare two-part episode is famed director
George Lucas, whose fans are awaiting the ``Star Wars'' prequel
this May. In Part 1, Stahl treats viewers to a preview of ``Episode
I: The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   In Part 2, she gives the moviemaker the same treatment she would
the king of some oil-producing nation _ in-depth profile, scrutiny
of his private life and visits to his famed Skywalker Ranch and
Industrial Light &AMP; Magic studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty nifty,'' Stahl says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps landing Lucas takes the sting out of losing that
ratings-busting Monica Lewinsky interview to rival Barbara Walters.
Yes, Stahl would have liked grilling Lewinsky. Yes, she tried _ and
failed _ to land the big fish.
</P>
<P>
   How would her interview have been different?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been different just because it would have been
me doing the interview,'' she says. ``Barbara asked (begin ital)
all (end ital) the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl left her White House assignment before Bill Clinton moved
into the Oval Office, so she has not followed his presidency in the
way she did his three predecessors. Her big interview with Clinton
came while he was governor of Arkansas and a rising Democratic
star.
</P>
<P>
   Did the reputed womanizer flirt with her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all!'' she laughs. ``What's wrong with me?''
</P>
<P>
   Gender often has intruded on _ and sometimes aided _ Stahl's
career. For many female newscasters, success comes down to The
Hair.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl's was conventionally blond, which in the early 1970s
threatened to taint her as a less-than-serious journalist. But she
freely admits that the '70s were also a time when news stations
were being pressured to put women and minorities on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The good old boys at CBS, then the shining star of network news,
reluctantly invited Stahl into their treehouse, and she hung on
like Tarzan despite frequent efforts to shake her loose.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she earned a reputation as one of the toughest
interviewers in town, labeled variously as ``a bulldog,'' ``poetry
in motion,'' ``stakeout queen,'' ``an honorary man'' and ``one
demanding bitch-monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting Live'' reveals a more vulnerable Stahl, constantly
calling her parents, Dolly and Lou, for a critique of her on-air
performances. Dolly bought Lesley's clothes until Lesley was 30 and
advised Lesley to get a face lift when Lesley was 39, Stahl says.
</P>
<P>
   Friends also call Stahl ``a softy'' when it comes to her family
_ husband Aaron Latham, a magazine journalist and screenwriter,
whose bouts of depression before seeking medical help scared the
living daylights out of his wife, and daughter Taylor, now a senior
in college.
</P>
<P>
   Over the telephone, as she munches on lunch, Stahl comes across
as a combination of all those things _ quick-witted, genial,
jubilant about what she calls ``the best job on television.''
</P>
<P>
   At ``60 Minutes,'' she has her pick of stories and works with
other legends of the small screen _ Mike Wallace, Morley Safer,
producer Don Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   As the next election approaches, Stahl doesn't miss slogging
along the campaign trail. The beauty of ``60 Minutes'' is that she
can interview any candidate she wants _ including a new Dole this
time around, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents and White House wannabes have been her stock in
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Once, on a flight while interviewing presidential candidate and
former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, Stahl began feeling the bumps of
turbulence and grabbed an airsickness bag. Babbitt, whom Stahl
assessed as too honest for his own good, kept on talking until his
wife, Hattie, stepped in and suggested the interview was over.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl angered Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado when she pressed him
about changing his last name from Hartpence and shaving a year off
his age. He stormed out after the interview.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush was ``playful . . . funny.''
</P>
<P>
   President Carter was ``distant.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was smitten with President Reagan, as was every other
reporter and member of Congress who knew him, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody liked Reagan because of the sweetness that is
pervasive about his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his term, however, Stahl began to notice that
Reagan seemed to suffer occasional lapses, where his eyes would
glaze and take him into another world _ Stahl calls them ``little
vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Reagan's Alzheimer's evident even then? Doctors will not
speculate, unable to diagnose by long-distance, Stahl says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Nancy Reagan dismisses such notions, insisting the
former leader of the free world suffers a post-presidential
affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Stahl to be moving on to another beat any time
soon. Her job at ``60 Minutes'' is the pinnacle of broadcast news,
she says, and the longevity of its correspondents is envied by
newspeople who get the bum's rush at maturity. Morley Safer is 67.
Mike Wallace is a ripe 80. Stahl is 57.
</P>
<P>
   For Stahl, there is no next job.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come here don't leave,'' Stahl says. ``It's a
wonderful job. I love the club. You don't think `What next?' when
you get to this level.'' &QL;

SALMON-MASTER-CHEF)  
 (HLW)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paula Katz, who lives on the Upper West Side, wanted
to buy a stove-top smoker for her mother-in-law. She went to
Zabar's, fully intending to make the purchase. But after one look
she came home empty-handed. ``What is it?'' she said, ``A roasting
pan, a rack and a lid?'' Her mother-in-law already had all that,
she said, and besides, it would be just something else to be
crammed into a closet.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame her? There is plenty of specialized kitchen
equipment out there _ bread machines, pasta makers, crockpots _
whose usefulness is disproportionate to the amount of space it
demands. A weighty price tag doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Some home cooks and chefs have rebelled. Rather than investing
in stove-top smokers, for instance, they rig up their own, using
equipment they already own. The home versions work, but do they
work as well as the specialized versions?
</P>
<P>
   I tested the Camerons Stove-Top Smoker Cooker _ the most widely
available brand in Manhattan _ against a homemade contraption to
see if the differences were great enough to justify paying $48 to
$69.99.
</P>
<P>
   The Camerons comes with little containers of wood ``dust'' _
oak, cherry, alder and hickory _ and is very easy to use. Following
the recipe by Rick Moonen of Oceana in this week's chef column, I
sprinkled a little dust in the base of the pan, placed the drip pan
on top, and turned on the heat. When the dust began to smoke, I
placed the salmon fillets on the rack, set it on top of the drip
pan and closed the lid. I shut off the heat and waited 10 minutes.
When I uncovered the pan, the fish was pink on the edges and cooked
about a millimeter into the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   For the improvised smoker, I used a 14-inch carbon-steel wok,
aluminum foil for a lid and a baking rack small enough to fit
inside. I poured in applewood chips and heated them until they
began to smoke. Then I placed the salmon fillets on the rack,
centered it in the wok and covered the whole thing tightly with
aluminum foil. Again, I let the ``smoker'' rest closed for 10
minutes off the heat. This salmon looked just like the other, only
a little less cooked on top.
</P>
<P>
   My kitchen has no exhaust system, so before smoking I opened all
my windows and disconnected my smoke detector. But neither smoker
did much damage, since the lids trapped all the smoke. Searing
steaks actually produces more smoke.
</P>
<P>
   After the smoking, I seasoned and browned both batches of salmon
in hot oil and finishing them in a 450-degree oven. Both turned out
beautifully, with crisp, brown skin and moist, smoky flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I also compared smokers by smoking the salmon fillets over
medium heat until they were fully cooked _ about 15 minutes a
pound. Again, both smokers worked equally well: they infused the
fish with a smoky scent while they cooked.
</P>
<P>
   But the wok, which cost me just $20 at Zabar's and was re-usable
_ as a wok _was just as convenient and saved me $28 and precious
inches of cabinet space. Besides, it fits better on a single
burner.
</P>
<P>
   So I vote with Ms. Katz.

POLITICAL TRIAL IN MALAYSIA ENDS SUDDENLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ With one last judicial twist and one last
cry of outrage from the defense, the politically charged
sex-and-corruption trial of Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, came to a sudden end on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Judge Anthony Paul refused to hear a demand by the defense
that he step down because of what they said was pro-prosecution
bias, Anwar's team of nine lawyers refused to deliver a closing
argument. The judge then charged all nine with contempt and banged
his gavel to close the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who sits as the trial's sole judge and juror, said he
would announce a verdict in two weeks on four sex-based corruption
charges. If convicted, Anwar faces a maximum of 14 years in prison
along with a five-year ban on political activity. In addition, he
is due to face a second trial on four charges of sexual misconduct
and one more charge of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unfortunate for the judicial system in this
country,'' Anwar said of the judge's actions on Tuesday. ``It is
tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trial, which opened with a display of Anwar's black eye,
received in a police beating, has damaged far more than the
reputation of Malaysia's judicial system. In a harsh display of
political feuding and judicial gamesmanship, it has shaken the calm
and confidence of one of the region's more stable and optimistic
societies.
</P>
<P>
   It has soiled the reputation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
72, and ruined the career of his former heir apparent, Anwar, 51.
It has brought into public the underside of Malaysian governance,
including political corruption and police abuses. It has aroused a
surge of dormant discontent around the country and boosted the
popularity of Malaysia's Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The conduct of the trial has left the judge open to Anwar's
complaints of bias.
</P>
<P>
   In a pivotal decision last month _ after allowing the
prosecution to present graphic accusations of sexual misconduct to
lay the groundwork for its corruption charges _ Paul ruled that the
sex was irrelevant and barred the defense from presenting testimony
to rebut the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to hear testimony from some of Anwar's chief accusers
that they had been coerced into saying he had sex with them. He
disallowed testimony about an audiotape that the defense maintained
would show that some charges were fabricated for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   And he barred as irrelevant Anwar's chief defense argument _
that the trial amounted to a political punishment by his former
mentor, Mahathir, for Anwar's opposition to his economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Anwar and his lawyers did not let those rulings stop them
from speaking out in the most concerted attack Mahathir has ever
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a police state,'' Anwar said at one point, in the kind
of public accusation rarely heard in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagreed and now I am out,'' he said at another point,
clearly referring to Mahathir. ``Yes, an ultimatum was given on
Sept. 2 saying that I either resign effective that day or charges
will be preferred against me in a number of related offenses
ranging from sexual misconduct to treason.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar refused to resign and was fired that day. He was arrested
18 days later after making a political tour of the country in which
he drew huge crowds to hear his demands for the reform of a system
that he had helped to lead for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   These events came at a time of heightened concern in Malaysia
over the regional economic slowdown, during which Anwar had become
increasingly public about his disagreements with Mahathir over
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Anwar _ or at least his supporters _ appeared to be
preparing an early challenge to the leadership of Mahathir, who had
seemed to be dallying over his plans to step down in the coming
years in favor of his deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's politically brutal move against his deputy
neutralized that challenge, at least in the short term. But the
prime minister overturned one of the more stable blueprints for
political succession in the region and removed one of the leading
standard-bearers of a younger generation of potentially more
liberal Southeast Asian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, however, still seems firmly in control of Malaysian
politics, with the nation still looking to him to set its policies
and once again, name a successor.

   NEW YORK _ On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate most wine dinners
that showcase only white wines at about 4, ranking in excitement
somewhere between arm wrestling and the novels of Judith Krantz.
But that didn't prevent me from hustling over to La Caravelle in
Manhattan recently to a dinner devoted to the wines _ all of them
white _ of the Domaine Trimbach, one of the best-known producers in
Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   La Caravelle holds such dinners now and then for anyone willing
to spend $225 to sample the wines of a certain producer, paired
with food from the restaurant. I wanted to see if the dinner would
rival my Trimbach meal of years ago at the family's home in
Ribeauville, France.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Trimbach, one of the owners, and I tasted some wines, one
an astonishing 1923 riesling, then tucked into what was a feast. I
still remember the main course, a baekenofe, an Alsatian meat and
vegetable stew.
</P>
<P>
   But why dwell in the past? The Caravelle meal, prepared by the
restaurant's chef, Cyril Renaud, was not hearty Alsatian fare but a
memorable dinner skillfully attuned to the Trimbach wines.
</P>
<P>
   It is not being dismissive of Renaud's achievements to note that
these remarkable wines made his job easier. Alsatian wines, the
Trimbachs' included, are deceptively big, powerful and complex,
unlike most white wines. Good rieslings, in particular, will
complement almost any dish.
</P>
<P>
   The Trimbachs, who have been making wine since 1626, own or
lease 60 acres of vineyards in Ribeauville and in neighboring
towns. They buy both wine and grapes to produce 60,000 cases a
year. Most is good affordable wine from traditional Alsatian
grapes: muscat, pinot blanc, pinot gris, riesling and
gewuerztraminer.
</P>
<P>
   They also produce very special wines, including a
gewuerztraminer called Seigneurs de Ribeaupierre, and two
rieslings, the Cuvee Frederic Emile and the extraordinary Clos Ste.
Hune, one of the finest dry rieslings in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fine German rieslings are made with a touch of sweetness, which
is brought into balance by the right amount of acidity. Alsatian
rieslings, however, are dry. That doesn't mean they lack intensity
or fruit. Like the best German rieslings, wines like the Cuvee
Frederic Emile, which sells for $25, and Clos Ste. Hune, $50, can
preserve their freshness for decades.
</P>
<P>
   That 1923 I had was more than 50 years old. But you can also buy
a 3-year-old Trimbach riesling for $12 that is fine for drinking
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Top-quality wines don't jump from the fermenting tanks ready to
drink. The Cuvee Frederic Emile needs three to five years in the
bottle to develop its complex flavors; the Clos Ste. Hune will
continue to improve in the bottle for a decade. Some of these wines
don't come into their own for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Grapes for the Frederic Emile come from a vineyard on the steep
slopes of the Osterberg, a mountain that drops conveniently to the
back door of the Trimbach cellars. The Clos Ste. Hune is from a
postage-stamp-size vineyard below the 14th-century church and
graveyard in the neighboring village of Hunawihr.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the versatility of Trimbach wines, Renaud paired
a young flowery muscat with a tartar of oysters and scallops, and a
fruity 1996 pinot blanc with a lobster and avocado salad. A lightly
smoked and grilled Atlantic salmon was matched with a full, rich
pinot gris _ a 1996 Reserve Personelle Hubert Trimbach, which had
the extra weight demanded by the salmon's richness.
</P>
<P>
   But those were just the starters. The main course, a confit of
foie gras and boned squab, was the elegant setting for the first of
the great rieslings, a 1993 Cuvee Frederic Emile. The intense
flavors of the dish would challenge many red wines, but not this
riesling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us considered the high point of the evening to be the
tasting of two vintages of Clos Ste. Hune, 1983 and 1993. At 16,
the 1983 was beginning to show its intense concentration and depth.
The 1993 showed an understated elegance that made it a delight to
drink. Against logic, I preferred the 1993, even if it will be
better 20 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come were a gewuerztraminer, a Seigneurs de
Ribeaupierre 1990, which was served with an Alsatian Muenster, and
a vendange tardive 1986 Clos Ste. Hune with dessert.
</P>
<P>
   No gewuerztraminer compares with the best from Alsace, which
have intense fruit flavors and a flowery bouquet. The Trimbach
style is rather lean and understated but the Seigneurs de
Ribeaupierre is still a rich, muscular wine.
</P>
<P>
   Vendange tardive, which means late harvest, is made from grapes
left on the vine long after the regular harvest, so that the water
in them can evaporate, leaving only the concentrated juice. The
Trimbach late-harvest rieslings have been aptly described as
``massive wines.'' They are almost dry, with intense fruit flavor,
and might go with game dishes. But I prefer them as aperitifs, with
no culinary distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to gainsay Renaud's dessert, a baked apple with
orange-peel ice cream. It was an attractive combination that wisely
made no attempt to upstage the Clos Ste. Hune.

HUMAN TOUCH MAKES A BEER TASTE MELLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (lb) 
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The newest beer of Rogue Ales sounds more aggressive
than it is. Brutal Bitter is actually a full-bodied, deeply
flavored, intensely hoppy brew. There is nothing brutal about the
rich, deep, mellow taste. It's crackling but not sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The brew master at Rogue, in Newport, Ore., is John Maier,
nicknamed More Hops, and that is no understatement. Even so, the
hops in his Brutal Bitter are emphatic in a full-throttled but
never biting way. This beer may raise eyebrows, but it won't pucker
lips. The aftertaste is clean.
</P>
<P>
   The beer, a cross between a bitter and a pale ale, will be
introduced in New York next week. It is amber in color and pours
thickly, with a creamy, beige head that lingers. Try it with juicy
red meats or with a corned beef or sliced-steak sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Maier credits the mellowness partly to the gentle way the malts
are treated: At Beeston Malting Co., in Nottinghamshire, Britain,
the pipkin malts are raked and turned by people, not machines.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the hops for their subtlety as well. ``We're aggressive
with the hops,'' he said. ``But I used three hops which have a low
bittering value, so you can use more and not get an upfront
bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   Brew masters have traditionally made new flavors to go with the
seasons _ wheat beer for summer, stout for winter _ and to
celebrate special occasions. In Brutal Bitter's case, it was the
20th anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The pub was the first in Portland to sell American microbrews
like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Anchor Steam Beer on tap. Or as
Jack Joyce, the president of Rogue Ales, put it, ``The Horse Brass
was the first outlet to put on draft a product nobody had heard
of.'' Maier was only too happy to brew a beer to mark the day.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal Bitter will be available in New York at $3.99 for a
22-ounce bottle at Hercules Fancy Grocery, 27{ Morton St. (Seventh
Avenue South), and at B &AMP; E Beverages, 511 West 23rd St. (Tenth
Avenue), and for $3.49 a bottle at New York Beverage, 428 East 91st
St. (York Avenue). For other stores: (888) 573-9700, extension
6405.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Often, the most successful meals evoke a childhood
memory. This dish was inspired by a long-ago trip to a ballpark,
where I had a smoky grilled hot dog that was slathered with sharp
mustard and topped with crunchy, slightly sweet relish. When I
became a chef, I decided to create a dish with the same trio of
flavors: smoky, sharp and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a leap from an all-beef frank to a velvety
salmon fillet, but I think I have captured the essence of what we
love in a hot dog by lightly smoking salmon and serving it with a
sweet-sour cucumber relish and a creamy horseradish-and-mustard
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking the salmon is mostly about fragrance: you pick up on the
aroma immediately, but once you dig into the dish, the smoke's
flavor recedes into the background as a minor note.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking a fish in a home kitchen is easy. You can use a
commercial stove-top smoker or improvise one with a heavy frying
pan, a cake rack that fits into the pan (press one-inch balls of
foil underneath the rack to give it needed height) and a lid.
</P>
<P>
   A wok is also perfect for this: because of its sloping sides,
you can eliminate the foil ball step.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter applewood chips over the bottom of the pan, turn on the
over-the-range exhaust system if you have one and heat the chips
until they smoke. Put the fillets on the rack and into the pan,
cover the setup, remove it from the heat and let the smoke waft
around the salmon for 10 minutes. The fillets will still be cold
and their edges will look a little dull, but their natural fats
will have grabbed the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking does not cook the salmon _ searing and roasting does _
and the fish emerges fragrant, perfectly moist and seductively
smoky.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon, like a hot dog, requires cool condiments. The
cucumber relish needs to chill until it is so crunchy it is
downright noisy when you eat it.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce _ chilled, tangy creme fraiche jazzed up with
horseradish and Dijon mustard _ is bold enough to match the
salmon's richness. This dish is a long way from the humble hot dog,
but it satisfies in just the same way.
</P>
<P>
   PAN-SEARED APPLEWOOD SMOKED SALMON WITH CUCUMBER-RED ONION
RELISH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus 30 minutes for chilling cucumbers
</P>
<P>
   2 medium English cucumbers (also known as European or hothouse
cucumbers), each about } pound, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   { medium red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh dill leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white horseradish
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup applewood chips (see note below)
</P>
<P>
   6 salmon fillets, skin on, 7 ounces each and 1 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   Chopped chives, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the relish: Slice cucumbers in half lengthwise, scoop
out seeds and slice \ inch thick. Toss cucumbers with kosher salt
and put them in a colander. Weight them down lightly, cover and
chill for at least 30 minutes or for as long as 12 hours. Drain
cucumbers, and toss them with the onion, sugar, vinegar and dill.
Season with salt and white pepper, cover and chill until needed.
Relish can be refrigerated for a day.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make the horseradish cream: Whip the creme fraiche with a
whisk until it is as thick as mustard. Fold in the horseradish and
mustard, add salt and pepper, and cover and chill until needed.
Mixture can be kept in the refrigerator for 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make the salmon: Center a rack in the oven, and preheat to
450 degrees. If using a stove-top smoker, follow manufacturer's
instructions for cold smoking. If fashioning your own smoker, place
applewood chips in wok or pan over high heat on top of stove. While
they are heating, brush a cake rack with the olive oil. Place
salmon fillets skin side down on rack. When applewood chips start
to smoke, after 5 to 10 minutes, put rack with salmon into wok (or
into pan, raised on 1-inch balls of foil) and cover tightly. Remove
from heat, and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove salmon, and season
fillets with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place a 10-inch ovenproof saute pan over high heat. When it
is very hot, brush skin of fish generously with the softened
butter. Put fillets skin side down in saute pan, and immediately
press them with a spatula or place another skillet on top of them;
stop pressing or remove top skillet after 1 minute. Cook 1 minute
more, put pan in oven, and roast 4 to 5 minutes, or until fillets
are cooked through but still moist inside.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, place a mound of drained relish in the center of
each plate, surround with horseradish cream and top with a salmon
fillet, skin side up. Sprinkle each plate with chopped chives, and
serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Applewood chips are available from People's Woods/Nature's
Own, (800) 729-5800.

   For the Cheese Lover, A Companion for the Road &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the population explosion at the cheese counter these days,
a guide that fits into a pocketbook could come in handy. ``The
Cheese Companion'' (Running Press, $24.95), Judy Ridgway's slim
guide, is filled with tempting color photographs and evocative
descriptions of about 50 varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Commonplace cheeses, like Edam, alternate with esoteric
examples, including Spanish tetilla, a mild cow's-milk cheese in a
distinctive, pointy pyramid shape; picodon, a nutty-tasting French
goat's-milk cheese, and Cornish yarg, a nettle-wrapped cow's-milk
cheese made from an old recipe (its name is that of the cheese
maker spelled backward).
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions of appropriate wines for cheeses are also given, as
is an overview of cheese-making and history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frozen Gefilte, Easy to Cook &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gefilte fish for Passover seder dinners (this year, the first
one will be next Wednesday) usually comes from jars in the
supermarket, or perhaps from a fancy food market. Now, there is
another alternative, a bit closer to homemade: A &AMP; B Famous Gefilte
Fish, a raw mixture sold frozen that is easy to cook.
</P>
<P>
   It comes in four styles: sweet; less sweet; sugar-free, which is
very bland, and salmon, which is also very sweet. All are sold in
one-pound rolls and can be cooked without thawing. If the fish is
thawed, it can be formed into balls and cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon takes 35 minutes, but the others need 90 minutes.
Adding pepper, salt and a little vinegar to the cooking liquid, in
addition to onions and carrots, enhances the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The kosher-for-Passover variety is made with mashed potatoes,
because some orthodox Jews will not eat matzoh meal that has been
in contact with liquid. Matzoh meal is used for the non-Passover
kind. But in taste and texture, it is hard to tell the difference.
</P>
<P>
   A &AMP; B Famous Gefilte Fish, $6.99 a pound, is sold at Kosher
Marketplace, 2442 Broadway (90th Street) in New York City, where
sample tastes are available, and at Gristede's and Shop Rite
supermarkets, among other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Matzohs for the Observant &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matzohs are being marketed for the very observant or the
wheat-avoiding. Whole Foods, 117 Prince Street (Greene Street) and
2421 Broadway (89th Street), is selling handmade shmurah matzohs
(shmurah means ``closely watched'') from Brooklyn _ big, lightly
charred round disks that have an earthier taste than the ordinary
supermarket matzohs.
</P>
<P>
   A one-pound box is $14.95, a dollar of which goes to the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods also has oat-flour, wheat-free shmurah matzohs from
Israel, $18.95 for a one-pound box. To order: (212) 982-1000. The
oat matzohs are also sold at Mrs. Green's Natural Markets in
Scarsdale, Mahopac, Mount Kisco, Yorktown Heights, Katonah and
Larchmont, N.Y., for $16 a box. These markets also carry Israeli
organic wheat matzohs, $2.99 for 14 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   From France, a Sleek Onion &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call it a racing onion, this ultra-sleek new produce arrival
that is done up in a smooth nut-brown skin and whose inside is
white tinged with lavender. The onion, from northern France, where
it's simply called an ``oignon long,'' looks like a shallot with
delusions of grandeur but does not have the slightly herbaceous
flavor of a shallot. It's fresh and sharp, with just a touch of
sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to take advantage of its shape is to halve it the
long way and cook it like endive: baked, simmered in consomme or
simply roasted or grilled. It is also excellent for stuffing but
can be eaten raw, finely slivered into a salad. The onions will be
available for $1.89 a pound starting next week at Fairway, 2127
Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132nd Street).

CALIFORNIA WINES BECOMING MORE POPULAR AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JIM HAMMETT WineToday.com   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Americans are increasingly more
sophisticated wine drinkers, new statistics on 1998 California wine
shipments show.
</P>
<P>
   ``American consumers are moving upscale to high-end varietal
wines, shifting their preferences away from many white and blush
jug wines, which declined in stores last year,'' said an industry
analyst, Jon Fredrikson of Gomberg, Fredrikson &AMP; Associates in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrikson's firm works with the Wine Institute to analyze the
wine industry. On Monday, the firm released its most recent
statistical report compiled from various government and business
sources. These studies are widely regarded as the most
comprehensive source of information on California wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   While sales of white wine continue to outstrip that of red table
wines, the report found demand for aged red wines and wine in
limited productions grew three-fold in sales over the past seven
years. Also, exports of California wine grew a sharp 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   California table wine priced $7 and above at retail was the
fastest-growing segment, with a 14 percent volume increase. While
this category represented 19 percent of the state's table wine
production, it generated 44 percent of winery table wine revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Total California winery sales to the United States and abroad
was about 437 million gallons in 1998, up 3 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers purchased most of this volume, as California
wineries shipped 388 million gallons nationwide for a 73 percent
share of the domestic wine market, or about three out of every four
bottles consumed. The estimated retail value of the state's
domestic wine shipments was $12 billion, up 5 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic sales of premium California table wine _ figured for
750 milliliter bottles costing $3 and above _ expanded by 8
percent. These sales comprise 53 percent of the volume and 79
percent of the winery revenues. Popular-priced jugs, those under $3
per 750-milliliter bottle, fell 3 percent and accounted for 47
percent of the volume and 21 percent of the revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant to California wine sales in 1998 was the
surge in exports. The huge 1997 harvest boosted wine inventories
and enabled California wineries to supply their flourishing export
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary numbers from the U.S. Department of Commerce place
the value of U.S. wine exports in 1998 _ 90 percent of which is
Californian _ at $537 million, a 26 percent increase over 1997.
Volume shot up 20 percent to about 72 million gallons. The largest
market was the United Kingdom, followed by Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that exports are the story this year,'' said Eileen
Fredrikson, a partner in Gomberg, Fredrikson &AMP; Associates. She said
growth of exports for the first time outstripped growth of domestic
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrikson said it was particularly significant that sales to
Japan were up 112 percent in 1998. She attributed that increase to
a depressed economy causing more people to eat at home and news
about the benefits of wine causing health-conscious Japanese to
choose wine to accompany their meals.
</P>
<P>
   Total 1998 wine sales in the United States _ including domestic
and imported wines _ grew 1 percent over 1997 to about 531 million
gallons. The estimated retail value was up 5.5 percent from 1997 to
some $17 billion for total sales of wine in the United States,
Commerce Department figures show. The slow volume growth and
stronger revenues also mirror the shift from jug wine purchases to
premium wines.

DINING ALONE NEED NOT BE A LONELY EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ We were four strangers. Each of us had happened upon a
narrow, smoky Alsatian restaurant in an unfashionable part of Paris
and taken a seat around the right-angled end of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, we found ourselves in a lively conversation about
the rise of the supermarket in France and the decline of the small
bakeries and food shops. We debated whether golf was a bore and
argued over the Frenchman's insistence that Alsatian pinot noir was
the only wine to drink with sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of experience that is almost unthinkable in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Dining alone in the United States is not exactly unpleasant, but
it is often uncomfortable. Solo diners, escaping briefly from the
office, may be common at lunch, but at dinner, when the demands of
the workaday world are put aside, they are considered downright
strange.
</P>
<P>
   Americans think of dining out primarily as a social activity, an
entertainment to be enjoyed with company. It falls into the
category of going to a movie, where couples and groups are the
norm, rather than a bookstore, where the lone browser is accepted.
A solo diner, intent simply on savoring a dinner, is assumed to be
missing out on a key element of the experience, and therefore must
be lonely, sad or depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at them, and they say: `He doesn't have friends. How
come he's by himself?''' said Jean-Claude Iacovelli, who grew up
outside of Paris and who now owns three restaurants in downtown
Manhattan, Jean-Claude, SoHo Steak, and Velli.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few times, I remember showing up by myself at
restaurants in New York, only to be welcomed by the host's raised
eyebrows of surprise and an almost imperceptible flash of pity.
Seating is generally behind a pillar or near the kitchen,
presumably to keep the lonely fly from spoiling the otherwise happy
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Things might be different at a local diner or cafe, where being
a regular may take the sting out of solitude, but show up alone
often enough and even a welcome familiarity may be tinged with
pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in our society think strangely of people dining alone
in restaurants,'' said Joseph Bastianich, an owner of Babbo
restaurant in Greenwich Village. ``It's much more a part of
everyday life in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you talk to restaurateurs, solo diners are not actually
that uncommon in New York. Often they are business travelers, on
their own in a strange place and unwilling to settle for room
service or the hotel dining room.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, solo diners in New York are like
asteroids in orbit, circling endlessly without ever bumping into
one another. That's why my experience at Alsaco, the little
restaurant in Paris, seemed so unusual.
</P>
<P>
   We made an odd quartet, for sure. A Frenchman in a dark blue
sweater dotted with cigarette ashes who whipped out a wood-handled
switchblade to saw off slices of his boiled pig's knuckle; an
elderly Englishman in a fine old tweed jacket, who consumed a
platter of grilled pork sausages slowly and meticulously, carefully
dabbing his mouth with a napkin as his jeweled cuff links gleamed;
a Belgian shoe designer with the thick neck and powerful arms of a
rugby player, who inhaled his soup as if he had a train to catch,
and me, savoring a huge plate of juniper-scented choucroute garni.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't exactly burst into conversation. But a tart flambee,
my first course, was the icebreaker. They stared as the waitress
set the huge tart in front of me on a wooden board. The flat, crisp
crust was irregularly shaped, like a map of western Europe, and
topped with cream, onions and bacon. It was delicious, as they all
agreed after I gave them each a slice. Why not? It was way too much
for me to finish, and soon we were all breaking bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' the Englishman asked the Belgian, ``when you were just a
small boy did you turn to your daddy and say, `I want to be a shoe
designer when I grow up?'''
</P>
<P>
   American attitudes toward solo diners may not be relaxed enough
to permit such acceptance or intimacies, partly because of
restaurant economics. In New York, at least, the restaurant
business depends more on volume than in Paris, and the sight of one
person sitting at a table for two stirs visions of red ink among
owners. What's more, lone diners usually drink proportionately less
than groups, further cutting the profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   But to an increasing number of enlightened New York
restaurateurs, that attitude is shortsighted. Single diners may not
maximize profits initially, but they may be instrumental in
creating new business. ``Single diners are always the most open,
and a lot end up being very interactive with the server,''
Bastianich of Babbo said. ``It's a good opportunity to show what
your restaurant is about.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rather than stick the single diner near the bathrooms or
kitchen, thoughtful restaurateurs do things like making the bar
comfortable for a meal, as at O Padeiro, a Portuguese restaurant in
Chelsea, where the handsome bar is small but spacious enough to
accommodate diners rather than just drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   More restaurants, like Mercer Kitchen, Tabla and Asia de Cuba,
are adding communal tables, which would seem like natural places to
seat single diners, although more often than not these seats go to
groups. Most important, though, is simple consideration, and a pair
of sensitive antennae.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put them at a good table where they can be comfortable,''
said Iacovelli, who says he regularly serves solo diners from the
Mercer and SoHo Grand Hotels. ``If they have a book, we put them in
a corner. If they want to talk, we pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying attention sometimes has its own rewards. In Paris, as I
was wondering what to have for dessert, the Frenchman insisted I
try the gewuerztraminer sorbet. I did, and it was wonderfully
refreshing, the perfect finish to the meal. Without the fellow
sitting next to me, I never would have known.

INTENSE MERLOT

   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canoe Ridge Merlot, 1996, Columbia Valley, Washington. About
$19.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state continues to produce some of the most
intriguing red wines in this country, wines with the intensity of
flavor that marks the best California wines but with a leanness and
elegance few California wines can match.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter cold in eastern Washington during the winter of 1996 cut
the size of the grape crop but did not affect the quality of the
wine. The result, thanks to a long, cool summer, is a wine of
intense flavors, a Bordeaux-like body and a long, luxurious finish.
</P>
<P>
   Canoe Ridge, partly owned by the Chalone Group in California,
specializes in merlot. The blend here includes 6 percent cabernet
sauvignon. It was aged in French and American oak for 16 months,
and 15,000 cases were produced, so it shouldn't be too difficult to
find.

BEST JOBS? HOW DOES YOURS RATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the same for every kid, isn't it? When they dream
about what they want to be when they grow up, don't all little boys
and girls picture themselves as . . . a Web site manager?
</P>
<P>
   Actuary, then? Computer systems analyst? Software engineer?
(begin ital) Mathematician? (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Uh, no. But maybe they should, according to ``Jobs Rated
Almanac,'' a new book that rates the best and worst jobs in the
country. According to the book, those are the top five. (Roustabout
ranks last.)
</P>
<P>
   The author, Les Krants, used data from the government, trade
groups and telephone surveys to rank 250 jobs according to six
criteria: income, stress, physical demands, potential growth, job
security and work environment.
</P>
<P>
   It's a combination that, on first glance, makes for some
interesting rankings. The president of the United States, for
instance, checks in at a measly No. 229, between butcher and truck
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Which sounded about right to Max Cotton. Cotton, the owner of
Cotton's Meats and a butcher himself (``I can take it from the
field to the freezer''), wasn't surprised his profession ranks
higher than chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics, I think, is the dirtiest thing in the world,''
Cotton said. ``Whoever does the best, convincing job of lying will
get elected. Do I have a better job than the president? Yeah, I got
a better job than the president.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Glad to be 11th &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paralegals rank No. 11, news that tickled Tammy Zaccaria. She's
a paralegal at Peskind Hymson &AMP; Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I do,'' she said. ``It's great to know that I
didn't waste my time.''
</P>
<P>
   What's even greater is how much higher paralegals rank than
lawyers, who ostensibly have the better job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be an attorney,'' Zaccaria said. ``But
they're No. 60 on the list, so I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What she does know is how to use the newfound knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go in and ask for a raise now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any such list is loaded with land mines _
perceptions, misconceptions, personal preferences, that kind of
thing. No one would seriously base career plans on such a study.
Which is my justification for newspaper reporter ranking No. 176,
between real estate agent and chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine such a list causing anyone to quit his day
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web site manager _ I couldn't even dream of that,'' said Dave
Weiss, a dentist (No. 86). ``That's way beyond my wildest dreams.
They say dream big, but I'm a small person inside. I can't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, he's happy where he is, between agricultural
scientist and cashier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five and above, I don't know what they are,'' he said.
``But if I had to pick another job that I covet, I'd be hard-put at
this point.'' &QL; 
Bound to be better &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Roswell, a bookbinder (No. 92) and the owner of Roswell
Bookbinding, likes his job, too. But there is that one
lower-ranking job that intrigues him . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be president,'' he said. ``I'd be a good one. I'd be a
hell of a lot better than the one we've got now.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for it to happen. For one thing, it would mean a
precipitous drop on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a pay cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Other oddities: professional baseball players rank No. 202,
basketball players 205 and football players 211. And astronaut (No.
180) ranks just below bartender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astronaut would be pretty cool,'' said Hans Bittikofer, a
bartender at Durant's. ``But you'd probably have to go to school
for a long time to do that. You don't have to do much schooling to
do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bittikofer showed little interest in occupying the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get paid as much as the president, but I have a pretty
damn good job,'' he said. ``I have a lot of fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could convince him to trade places with Bill Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``Except for the sex. He probably
has more sex than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   No word on how Web site managers rank in that department. &QL;

   ETHIOPIAN-RUNNER-TRIAL (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) _ Degaga (Mamo)
Wolde in 1968 became the second Ethiopian, after Abebe Bikila, to
win an Olympic gold medal. He also became a national hero and a
vital link in the rich tradition of distance running that has
distinguished Ethiopian athletes. Now he is on trial on charges of
genocide and illegal detention of prisoners during the reign of
terror that followed the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selaisse in
1974. Wolde, now either 67 or 68 years old, remains in the prison
he entered in 1993, protesting his innocence and waiting for a
deliverance he believes will come. By Jere Van Dyke.

LAWMAKERS PUSH BAN ON INTERNET GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers renewed a push Tuesday to enact
legislation that would ban gambling over the Internet under
pressure from state law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling is estimated to be a $600 million per year
business and is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is a serious issue,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
said during a Senate Judiciary panel hearing on the issue. Kyl,
chairman of the Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information
Subcommittee, estimates more than $1 billion will be gambled over
the Internet this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling enhances the addictive nature of gambling
because it is so easy to do. You don't have to travel. You can just
log on to your computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal gambling is a $50 billion annual industry that includes
casinos, slot machines, state lotteries and horse and dog-track
racing. It is regulated by states that have varying laws on
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys general have asked Congress for a federal ban on
Internet gambling because they argue they cannot police such
activity on a global network that defies state borders. They say
they cannot enforce Internet gambling even if states have their own
laws that ban such activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is already one of the most regulated industries in
the world, yet the Internet of one of the most heavily unregulated
and inherently difficult phenomena to regulate in modern time,''
said Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular form of Internet wagering is sports betting,
but casino-type games are becoming more popular as the Internet
becomes faster.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law makes placing a bet or sending gambling
information over telephone lines illegal, but the 1961 law predates
the Internet. Most computer users connect to the Internet through
phone lines but it is also possible to use cable television lines
and satellites, technically skirting federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect the Internet creates a loophole in gambling laws,''
said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Justice Department charged 21 owners and managers
of Internet gambling firms with illegally violating the 1961
telephone law, but law enforcement officials say the federal law
still needs updating to give authorities a good chance of
successfully prosecuting Internet gambling operators. Eight people
pleaded guilty, one is fighting the charges and the others remain
at-large.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl plans to reintroduce legislation this week that would ban
gambling on the Internet. It would impose fines equal to the amount
that a business received over the Internet or $20,000, whichever is
greater, and impose prison sentences of up to four years on those
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would require Internet providers such as America
Online to cut service for any illegal gambling site upon a state or
federal court order. The Senate passed a similar bill 90-10 last
year but the issue never made it to the House floor. House
lawmakers are also expected to reintroduce the legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Saum, the director of agent and gambling activities at the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, said Internet gambling is
attracting growing numbers of students who place sports wagers on
the Internet with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing consensus of research reveals that the rates of
pathological and problems gambling among college students are
higher than any other segment of the population,'' Saum said. Many
college students have access to the Internet as well as easy access
to credit cards that are marketed on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling sites typically require people to open an
account by providing a credit card number. Most sites require a
deposit of about $250 in order to play. Bets on sports teams, for
example, can range from 25 cents to hundreds of dollars. Betting
losses are charged to the credit card while winnings are posted as
credits, although in some cases gamblers report that they never
received their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   People can also play poker, blackjack and a variety of other
card and dice games with the click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 300 Internet gambling sites, up from about 15
just two years ago and recent studies have suggested that people
are increasingly becoming addicted to Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl and other lawmakers admit that federal legislation won't
stop all Internet gambling, especially in cases where gambling
operators set up shop overseas, which is a common practice.
Countries like Antigua, Costa Rica and Grenada license Internet
gambling sites.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery argued that a federal ban on Internet gambling would
still be useful because ``a public stance of prohibition tells
consumers that they should be extremely wary of Internet
gambling.''

A COAT THAT'S NOT TOO SWEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cooking a roast with a sugary coating serves a dual
purpose. The sweetness of something like apricot jam adds an
element of flavor not often found in savory dishes, and the sugar
encourages browning.
</P>
<P>
   It makes a dish, essentially of just two ingredients, that is
almost no work and has great flavor _ but the result is often too
sweet, at least for my taste.
</P>
<P>
   When I decided to experiment with alternative coatings for a
small roast of pork, one that would cook quickly enough for a
weeknight dinner, I settled on applesauce and quickly realized that
it has an additional benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Because it contains less sugar than jam, more can be used
without overwhelming the meat with sweetness, and the thicker
coating protects the meat and keeps it moist. This is important,
because the super-lean pork sold in supermarkets has a strong
tendency to dry out as it cooks.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case in cooking, these benefits come in a
trade-off: the lower-sugar applesauce (especially the unsweetened
kind, which I prefer) did not brown as quickly or as well as jam.
To counter this, I drained the applesauce to dry it out a bit while
the oven was preheating, then roasted the pork at an extremely high
temperature. The result was moist, with a slightly sweet, nicely
browned topping.
</P>
<P>
   Although bone-in pork does not dry out as much, the applesauce
works so well that boneless pork, which is also easier to carve,
becomes a good choice. Steer clear of tenderloin, which is so lean
that it seems to dry out just being near the oven. The lean end of
the loin is nearly as bad, but a roast taken from the loin's center
is acceptable. Best of all is a cut from the shoulder end, which
contains a higher percentage of the darker, moister meat.
</P>
<P>
   The small amounts of applesauce that drip off the pork into the
roasting pan will burn and stick, and removing this mess is more
work than the entire cooking process. Avoid this problem by lining
the pan with a double layer of aluminum foil, brushed with a tiny
bit of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ROAST PORK WITH APPLESAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   1 pork loin, 1{ to 2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   2 cups applesauce, preferably unsweetened
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees; set the oven rack as close
to the top of the oven as possible, taking into account the
thickness of the pork.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drain the applesauce in a fine sieve to remove excess liquid.
Line a roasting pan with a double layer of foil, and brush with a
little oil.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper, then spread the
applesauce evenly over it. Sprinkle with a little more salt and
pepper, and roast, checking every 15 minutes or so to make sure the
applesauce doesn't burn. It's fine if it darkens and browns, even
turning dark brown, as long as the top doesn't blacken.
</P>
<P>
   4. After 45 minutes, begin checking the pork with an
instant-read thermometer. When the internal temperature reaches 155
degrees, remove the meat from the oven. Let it rest 5 minutes, then
carve. Serve the sliced meat with any accumulated juices.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    GRAHAM URGES EXPANSION OF CARIBBEAN TRADE POLICY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trade restrictions should be eased on products from
the Caribbean and Central America, a congressional panel was told
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But textile manufacturers and their employees warned that
unfettered trade could harm U.S. cotton growers and garment
workers.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are proposals to eliminate tariffs on products covered
by the 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), which set lower
tariff rates. The proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean and
Central American countries trade status similar to Mexico's under
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of textiles has been a key issue in the trade
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., has sponsored a bill to eliminate
tariffs on textiles assembled in CBI countries from cotton and yarn
grown or processed in the United States. He said the barriers
should be reduced to help the region devastated by hurricanes
Georges and Mitch, and to protect U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is critical to the security of the U.S. and the countries
within the region that the people of the Caribbean Basin have real
opportunities in the legal economy so they are not forced to turn
to drug trafficking or illegal immigration to feed their
families,'' Graham told the House Ways and Means trade
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he believed differences between his bill and one in
the House that would allow textiles to be assembled in the region
from material grown or produced anywhere in the world could be
worked out in a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham said the most difficult hurdle would be to get the
bills through each chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Without the CBI extensions, Graham warned, the Caribbean
countries face the threat of enormous competition from China by
2005, when current quotas on Chinese textiles are lifted under
international trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up two green golf shirts, Graham noted that one was made
in China from cotton grown, spun and woven there. Another shirt was
made in Nicaragua from cotton grown, spun and woven in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicaraguan shirt had a slightly higher wholesale cost than
the Chinese shirt, but Graham said there was a market for it
because of the quota on Chinese textiles.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Caribbean textile industry can be strengthened over
the next five years, Graham warned that it would be undercut by
Chinese exports in 2005. That could throw thousands of Caribbean
garment workers _ and American cotton growers and textile
manufacturers _ out of work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and
business affairs, also urged the panel to adopt CBI expansion.
President Clinton's proposal would not lift restrictions as much as
Graham's bill, but Larson said some change was necessary to ensure
economic stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   F. Ronald Rayner, president of the National Cotton Council of
America, which supports Graham's bill, said it would help protect
the domestic textile industry. But Rayner warned that if
Asian-based textiles are given tariff protection through CBI
legislation, it would hurt American growers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mazur, president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
and Textile Employees argued that the CBI legislation was
unnecessary because Caribbean Basin apparel imports have increased
from 18 percent of the U.S. market share in 1993, when NAFTA was
adopted, to 24 percent in 1998.

   GELMAN-ART-COLLECTION (Paris) _ When Jacques Gelman died in
1986, he and his wife had two quite separate collections: one of

which was kept in New York, the other of paintings and drawings by
this century's most prominent Mexican artists, which was on display
in their home in Cuernavaca, Mexico. When Mrs. Gelman died last

gritty, unsentimental new novel, ``Nine Below Zero,'' in which love

genocide and illegal detention of prisoners during the reign of
terror that followed the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selaisse in

   PARIS _ Jacques and Natasha Gelman were art collectors in the
most beneficent sense of the word. ``Jacques liked to say that he
was not the owner, merely the link that carried the art from the
studio to the museum,'' recalled Pierre Schneider, a French curator
and longtime friend of the couple. ``But they were always
discussing where the paintings should end up. Their greatest
anxiety was to keep the collection intact. They considered it a
work of art in its own right.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, by the time Gelman died in 1986 at age 77, the couple
had two quite separate collections, to which the widowed Mrs.
Gelman continued to add: one of works by modern masters like
Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Balthus, which was kept in New York,
the other of paintings and drawings by this century's most
prominent Mexican artists, which was on display in their home in
Cuernavaca, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Gelman died last May at age 86, she bequeathed the
modern masters collection, comprising 85 works worth over $300
million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The gift
had been anticipated. A few years earlier she had endowed the
Jacques and Natasha Gelman curatorship of pre-World War II
20th-century art at the museum, and she financed restoration of a
gallery that carries the couple's name and is expected to house the
collection late next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the final home of the Mexican collection is still in doubt,
and in the meantime it has become a peripatetic homage both to
Mexican art and to the Gelmans as collectors. ``Modern and
Contemporary Mexican Painting From the Collection of Jacques and
Natasha Gelman,'' a 73-work show that runs through May 8 at the
Mona Bismarck Foundation near the Trocadero in Paris, is also
expected to travel to Argentina, Spain, New Zealand and the United
States over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   While the works donated to the Metropolitan Museum are more
valuable, the Mexican collection in many ways offers a truer
picture of the Gelmans' tastes, dreams, friends and long years
together. They knew most of the painters represented in the show,
and Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Rufino
Tamayo were among the artists commissioned to paint Natasha's
portrait. Put differently, the Gelmans collected European art, but
they belonged to the Mexican art scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1909, Gelman arrived in
Mexico City in 1938 via Berlin and Paris with a view to expanding
his movie distribution business to Latin America. Two encounters
changed his life. He met Natasha Zahalkaha, a divorcee from Moravia
(now in the Czech Republic) who was visiting Mexico; they married
in 1941. Then, as he prepared to produce his first movie in Mexico,
Gelman discovered Mario Moreno, a comedian who became known to the
world as Cantinflas and with whom he formed a highly profitable
movie partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly wealthy, Gelman turned his attention to collecting art.
Rivera was at the height of his fame, yet Gelman could easily
afford to have the artist paint his wife; the 1943 portrait shows
Mrs. Gelman lying on a blue sofa, with arum lilies filling the
background. The Paris show includes eight other works by Rivera,
who with Jose Clemente Orozco and Siqueiros made up the Big Three
of Mexico's post-revolutionary muralists and painters. The Gelmans
also bought works by Orozco and Siqueiros, although Mrs. Gelman
never liked Siqueiros' portrait of her.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's collection of 12 works by Kahlo, Rivera's wife, is
particularly impressive and includes six self-portraits as well as
Kahlo's small 1943 portrait of a pensive-looking Mrs. Gelman
bedecked in fur. This portrait was the first painting to hang in
the Gelmans' new home in Mexico City. And it is hardly surprising
that Gelman was able to persuade Tamayo to return briefly to
figurative painting in 1948 to provide his version of Mrs. Gelman
in oil.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of works in the Mexican collection (29 of 98)
are by Gunther Gerszo, an abstract painter who worked as a movie
designer in the 1940s and 1950s for Gelman but also for Luis Bunuel
(and others working out of Mexico City's Churubusco Studios) before
devoting himself entirely to painting. Gerszo, now 83, met the
Gelmans in 1944 and remained close to them throughout their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gelmans were completely obsessed by art,'' Schneider said.
``They couldn't have children, but the collection became their
child. I met them in 1968 when I was preparing the Matisse
centennial exhibition in Paris, and in the years that followed I
never heard Jacques discuss movies. He never reminisced. He only
talked about art.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Paris show also includes paintings by Maria Izquierdo,
Carlos Merida, Carlos Orozco Romero, Juan Soriano, Agustin Lazo and
other Mexican painters from the middle years of this century. After
her husband's death, Mrs. Gelman continued to acquire new art to
fill holes in the Mexican collection (just as she did with the
modern masters' collection) and to include contemporary artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted a Francisco Toledo and also a better Maria
Izquierdo, though we didn't find one she wanted,'' said Robert
Littman, the curator of the Paris show and head of the new Vergel
Foundation, which now owns the Gelmans' Mexican collection. ``But
she always would also say, `You have to buy your own generation.'
So I would show her younger artists and we'd put their works in her
house for a while to see if she liked them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while three of the Mona Bismarck Foundation's
galleries are given over to Mexico's modern figurative painters, a
fourth room is dedicated to contemporary Mexican art that Mrs.
Gelman bought in the 1990s. Among the new artists are Miguel
Calderon, 28, who photographed himself in Mexico's Natural History
Museum disguised in an Afro wig and false beard and threatening
stuffed tigers with a pistol, and Paula Santiago, 30, who used rice
paper to create tiny reproductions of Mexican peasant shirts and
then ``embroidered'' them with her own blood and strands of hair.
</P>
<P>
   While Littman expects to continue adding to the collection with
money from an endowment from the Gelmans, his more immediate
concern is how to carry out the Gelmans' wish to have it installed
permanently in a Mexican museum. ``She said that would be my
problem,'' Littman said. ``The ideal solution is a private museum
that is not attached to the government, but there isn't one.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility had been the Cultural Center for Contemporary
Art in Mexico City, which opened in 1987 and which Littman headed.
But the center's owner, the Televisa television group, closed it in
November for financial reasons. Among the alternatives are the
National Museum of Art, which is being restored by a group of
businessmen; an old customs house in the Caribbean port of Veracruz
suggested by the local governor, Miguel Aleman, and a space in the
historic heart of Mexico City being renovated by the National
Autonomous University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection will not be donated, but rather will be on
deposit,'' Littman said. ``It's a tremendous collection, and it
deserves a good home. I'm even willing to entertain suggestions
from the government. We're in no rush.''

 &HT;    From pride to confidence, unseeded Life College celebrates NAIA
championship
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He is scheduled for his second operation in six days,
but Roger Kaiser has something that will help to ease the pain
during today's procedure _ a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Life University coach watched Monday as his team win its
second NAIA title in three years with a dramatic 63-60 victory over
Mobile (Ala.) University in Tulsa, Okla. The team received a big
welcome upon its return to town Tuesday, but Kaiser, the former
Georgia Tech All-American, will have to delay his celebration as he
is scheduled for gall-stone surgery today, less than one week after
surgery for kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably won't feel any pain at all because of this
experience,'' said Kaiser, who missed the team's second-round game
against Oklahoma City suffering from pain related to the first
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded Running Eagles capped an unbelievable tournament
run by rallying from a 26-point second-half deficit for the
victory. Guard Corey Evans, the tournament's most valuable player,
was the hero of the championship game, as he hit a long-three
pointer with two seconds remaining for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt it,'' said Evans. ``That was the biggest shot of
my career. I didn't think it was going in. Thank God it did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who was stunned the most _ us or them,'' Kaiser
said. ``They were beating us so badly, all I was thinking about was
trying to make the game respectable. We kept talking about pride.
Then that pride turned into confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Evans, who scored 121 points in five tournament games,
including 16 of his team-high 22 points in the second half Monday,
said some doubts entered the minds of the Running Eagles (29-10)
after Mobile went up 50-24 with 17:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't give us a chance, but we started to think we
could win this thing after we came from 16 points down to beat
Concordia in our third game,'' said Evans, a 6-1 junior from Cocoa,
Fla. ``But in the second half (against Mobile), it looked like
those guys weren't going to let us back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the last 17 minutes, though, Life, the first unseeded
team to the win the NAIA national title, outscored Mobile 39-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaal Horton (12 points), Chummy Johnson (12) and Allen
Stozier (8) started to hit some big shots, and we started to force
turnovers,'' Evans said. ``They weren't timid, but they lost their
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, who won his first NAIA national title in 1974 while at
West Georgia College, called this five-game tournament run ``the
most satisfying'' in his 27-year career as a college coach. The
team entered the season with high expectations but had the most
losses of any team since the 1993-94 season, the third year of the
program's existence.
</P>
<P>
   The Running Eagles also had the nation's longest home winning
streak snapped at 99 games and was defeated at home by
Auburn-Montgomery in the Southeast Regional. Through it all, they
worked their way to the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It was very satisfying) especially under the circumstances,
(after) not having a good year,'' Kaiser said. ``We got beat badly
at home (by Auburn-Montgomery in the Southeast Regional) before we
came out. Then we fall behind by big margins in two or three of our
games and come back to win them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing feeling I wish everybody could experience _ a
lesson about life,'' Kaiser said. ``You never give up on anything.
These guys didn't, and I can't be anymore proud of them than I am
right now.''

<P>
   You have just had a long meal at Tabla _ three courses and
plenty of wine. When it's time to leave, you are feeling fine.
</P>
<P>
   Until you reach the staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Before you lies a steep, sweeping curve of steps. Suddenly your
legs feel less steady; the descent is dizzying. With the handrail
in a death grip, you take a deep breath, and a step.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fearful moment, but one that more New Yorkers are facing
when they dine out. Just a few years ago, upstairs rooms were used
only for banquets and the occasional overflow crowd. They were
closed off by small hidden staircases, and were the seating
equivalent of Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   But the restaurant boom, along with rising rents for
street-level space, has led a growing number of restaurateurs to
expand upward. Now, the second floor dining room is commonplace _
it may even be the best room in the house. But once you've gone up
to dine, there's only one way out: down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   One misstep and everyone seated on the ground floor will be your
audience. And those who have done it never forget.
</P>
<P>
   Walecia Konrad, an editor at Smart Money, was on a first date at
the Mackinac Bar and Grill, now the Ocean Grill, on Columbus
Avenue. They were walking down the splendid marble staircase at the
entrance _ when suddenly she found herself on the ground, looking
up. ``It was out of a cartoon,'' she said. ``My legs just came
straight up. There was nothing graceful about it.'' Well, there was
one saving grace: at least Mackinac Bar and Grill had no
first-floor tables. That was three years ago. For a long time, she
couldn't bear to walk by the place. Her date? Never heard from
again.
</P>
<P>
   Moments like that are all the worse because so many of these
staircases are beautiful, impressive structures _ just the thing
for a grand entrance or exit. Scaling the one at Tabla, for
instance, is like climbing steps to a palace. The staircase at Asia
de Cuba is a slim, minimalist low-lighted shaft _ more like a
catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller restaurants, where every inch counts, function
overrules form. Some of these staircases feel more like gateways to
medieval towers.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, ``obviously part of it is revenue,'' said Iva
Kravitz, the director of marketing at Bogdanow Partners Architects,
which designed the multilevel Obeca Li and the two-story Union
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Making a second-floor space a dining area instead of offices is
an easy way to make more money. If the restaurant can add drama,
too, then all the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make the staircase both central and open to both floors,''
Ms. Kravitz said. But that seems unusually cruel to diners for whom
staircases feel like coordination tests.
</P>
<P>
   Every night at Union Square Cafe, an unlucky few must scale one
of New York's most frightening staircases of all. It's about as
narrow as a rain gutter, and navigating it is like climbing a
ladder. It leads to a mezzanine with seven tables.
</P>
<P>
   Those seven tables can make a big difference to the bottom line.
It used to be that a restaurant needed to have 60 to 70 seats to
make money. ``Now, if you're not at 110 or 120, you can't pay the
health insurance,'' said Clark Wolf, a New York restaurant
consultant. Those seven tables could be worth $100,000 a seat a
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Department of Buildings code generally
requires restaurants with occupancies of more than 75 on the second
floor to have staircases at least 3 feet 8 inches wide, with steps
that rise no more than 7 inches and a tread no less than 11 inches.
At Alouette, for instance, on the Upper West Side, the stairs are
11{ inches by 7 inches, just within the code. Comfortable going up,
dicey coming down.
</P>
<P>
   But even extra-wide staircases, like the one at Ruby Foo's Dim
Sum and Sushi Palace, can be like a pass through a fun house. You
can hold on to only one handrail, and to one side the width of the
step is quite deep, forcing you into an antelopelike stride.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, it's made of a highly polished wood. Add a few
drops of rainwater off someone's coat, and it's like walking on
ice. The one at Tabla is within code but is made of dark wood in a
dimly lighted space.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't the design of the staircase that is perplexing, its
placement can be. Asia de Cuba's seductively lighted staircase is
inviting, but it takes you upstairs to a rum bar. Who needs a
sobriety test on the way down? Since the restaurant opened 17
months ago, the steel handrail has been reinstalled. The iron grips
of wary diners had pulled it loose.
</P>
<P>
   At Babbo, the staircase to the second floor dining area was
practically all that was left from the previous restaurant, the
Coach House. The chef, Mario Batali, and his partner, Joseph
Bastianich, wanted to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tall, grand structure that escalates rapidly to the
second floor. The tables on the ground floor are arranged like a
horseshoe around it. The staircase is so steep that even if you
stand at the top of it stone sober, you suffer from vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   When you are walking down the carpeted steps, Batali said, ``you
really feel what it's like to be prom queen.'' But for most people,
it's more about getting to the bottom as quickly as possible
without anyone noticing. It's a long way down, and the only thing
to break your fall is a large table covered with wine and flowers.
It wouldn't be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought certainly someone would tumble in the first six
months,'' Batali said. But so far, the only spill was by a waiter
carrying a tray of glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Petrecca, a reporter at Advertising Age and a chronic
tripper, regards the Babbo staircase with deep fear. ``I wonder if
they can see up my skirt,'' she said, ``but I also worry that if I
fall down there, everyone and their brother would see.'' At
restaurants like Docks in midtown, where a central staircase leads
to the bathrooms, she avoids going to the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants keep a careful eye out for people like Ms. Petrecca.
Babbo's wait staff is trained to screen people descending the
stairs. ``If they see someone even slightly tipsy or unable to do
the stairs,'' Batali said, ``they go over and assist them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Union Square Cafe, a towel is kept at the reservation desk to
wipe down the stairs leading into the main dining room if anything
spills.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative may not be far off. Soon there may be more
restaurants like Celadon, which provides a safe, secure elevator as
the centerpiece of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Diners may wear their stilettos _ and merely press a button. &QL;

SXSW FILM FEST DELIVERS THE STRANGE AND WONDERFUL GOODS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If the Sundance Film Festival can be thought of
as featuring earnest, well-meaning dramas that seek to improve the
human condition, the films at South by Southwest are more in tune
with a party here at which the entertainment was midgets, clowns
and circus freaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this is South by Southwest, all right,'' one of the
attendees said.
</P>
<P>
   The fare here is more unusual than you normally see at the
multiplex, as the titles make more than clear: ``Dill Scallion,
Dead Pet, Frozen Hot'' and ``There's No Fish Food in Heaven.''
Eager audience members conduct ad-hoc seminars with the filmmakers
in theater lobbies right after catching their work.
</P>
<P>
   (At least one person was heard complaining, ``Do they pick up
all of Sundance's rejects here?'' Several movies had played at
Sundance in January, such as ``A Slipping Down Life,'' which was
filmed in Austin; ``Happy, Texas,'' bought by Miramax in a bidding
war; and ``Drylongso,'' made by a UCLA student.)
</P>
<P>
   A few movies leaked the milk of humanity all over the
screening-room floor, but even the drenched-in-sentimentality
feature ``The Book of Stars'' was about a genius hooker (Mary
Stuart Masterson) trying to care for her suffering little sister.
So you could safely say that the melodramas, too, made an effort to
be different.
</P>
<P>
   There was lots of good stuff. ``A Day in Black and White'' was a
social comedy satirizing and examining the never-quite-healed
wounds of race in this country. It erred a bit on the side of
didacticism, not trusting the acuity of the humor to get its points
across.
</P>
<P>
   Actress/director Meredith Scott Lynn _ most recently, the woman
who busts Ben Affleck in ``Forces of Nature'' _ submitted the
energetic comedy of marginal show biz called ``Standing on
Fishes,'' which she also co-wrote. She seems to have a gift for
characterizing people who get balled up in their thoughts and
feelings but have to confess exactly what's going on in their heads
at all times. The funky ambience of SXSW (South by Southwest), and
Austin, is the perfect place for character comedy.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the documentary features got more attention
than in years past. One of the big buzz films of SXSW was ``The
Life and Times of Hank Greenberg,'' following the career, and span
of influence, of one of baseball's few Jewish stars. And there was
Jonathan Berman's ``My Friend Paul,'' a fascinating short
documentary about the filmmaker's relationship with a talented,
rebellious boyhood friend who broke out of their middle-class
existence and became a bank robber.
</P>
<P>
   The much smoother, but equally gripping ``Return With Honor'' by
veteran documentarian Freida Lee Mock told the story of American
POWs and their time of imprisonment in Vietnam. ``Return'' was most
horrifying as the soldiers discussed having their illusions of
invincibility dissipate under torture.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the wake of ``Sex: The Annabel Chong Story,'' the
controversial documentary about the porn actress/college student
that also played at Sundance, was ``Wadd: The Life and Times of
John Holmes,'' a crude but watchable feature on the '70s porn star
whose life was distilled into Mark Wahlberg's Dirk Diggler
character in the drama ``Boogie Nights.'' ``Wadd'' probably
provoked the most animated conversations between men and women
after it played. It also won the SXSW jury prize in documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   The shorts field was as strong as the documentary category.
Another Sundance favorite, ``Culture,'' an ironically titled
one-minute short, won a jury prize, too. A number of the notable
shorts focused on show biz, such as ``Script Doctor,'' a little
comedy about script rewrite teams that was staged like an episode
of ``ER.'' ``Music Supervisors'' was a brief, bitter and amusing
look at the scamming and humiliation endured by people who put
together the songs for movies.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all the shorts was probably ``Mutiny,'' a deadpan comedy
about a squabbling, white-boy slacker jazz band. No other short,
and very few other feature films for that matter, create such a
convincing and hilariously real glimpse into a world in brief
strokes. ``More,'' a gorgeously animated Claymation short that was
an Oscar nominee, also picked up an award.
</P>
<P>
   SXSW ended with a premiere screening of ``EdTV,'' the new Ron
Howard-directed comedy starring Matthew McConaughey as an amiable
slacker goof who becomes a TV star when he allows a camera crew
into his life to document every move he makes. ``EdTV'' rolled up
its sleeves, gritted its teeth and tried to be off-the-beaten path
as well. However, it was not only following a course piloted just
last year by ``The Truman Show,'' but one taken in 1979 when Albert
Brooks released a movie on the American obsession with media and
fame called ``Real Life.'' (It, incidentally, was co-written by one
of ``EdTV's'' featured players, Harry Shearer.)
</P>
<P>
   Though there were a few features that have been wrapped up for
distribution, like the upcoming ``Go,'' from ``Swingers'' director
Doug Liman, and ``A Walk on the Moon,'' most of the films were made
to be explored by an audience looking for something not quite so
major-release-ready. It's the great thing, and the bane, of most
film festivals. You've gotta rush out and catch everything that
sounds interesting, because odds are, these movies may never run
outside the festival circuit. SXSW is proving itself to be one of
those festivals worth pursuing.

 &HT;    U.S., OTHERS EVACUATE PERSONNEL IN BOSNIA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- With the possibility of a
NATO-led attack on neighboring Yugoslavia increasing, international
agencies Tuesday began to evacuate their staff from the
Serb-controlled region of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Several embassies, including that of the United States, have
urged their citizens not to travel in the Republika Srpska (CQ),
the Serb state within Bosnia, because of the possibility of Serb
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government employees were pulled out of the Serb state
Tuesday and embassy officials sent a letter to several U.S.
contractors and non-governmental agencies in the region urging them
to evacuate as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of the High Representative, the organization
responsible for implementing the peace plan in Bosnia, closed its
satellite offices in the Republika Srpska over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our satellite offices are very small operations and very
vulnerable,'' said said James Fergusson, spokesman for the peace
plan organization.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, two hand grenades were set off in the
parking lot of the organization's office in Banja Luka, the capital
of the Republika Srpska. No one was injured and only one car was
damaged in the explosion, Fergusson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Banja Luka office was not among those evacuated by the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, a key highway in the Serb state was
closed for several hours overnight by Serb demonstrators. The
demonstration was set off by rumors that members of the NATO-led
military peacekeeping force in Bosnia had shot rubber bullets at a
Serb politician passing through a checkpoint on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the peacekeeping force denied the rumors,
insisting that the politician hadn't even been stopped at the
checkpoint and pointing out that its soldiers aren't issued rubber
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is pure fabrication,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Sheena
Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration and the hand grenade attack are evidence of
increasing tension in the Republika Srpska. Two key political
setbacks at home combined with the threat of air strikes on Serbs
in neighboring Yugoslavia have only served to fuel feelings among
many Bosnian Serbs that the entire international community is
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago an international arbitrator announced his decision
to make Brcko a neutral district, taking control of the
strategically important port away from Bosnian Serbs. The same day
the Serbs lost control of Brcko, the Office of the High
Representative removed the hard-line Serb
</P>
<P>
   president of the Republika Srpska from office, further angering
many Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily protests were held in Brcko following the decision,
though none turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, officials of NATO-led military peacekeeping
force have been searching the Republika Srpska for secret weapons
caches. The searches were prompted by the discovery of two trucks
smuggling nine tons of weapons from the western Republika Srpska
through Brcko to some point in the eastern part of Republika
Srpska, or possibly even to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some indication that there are still some undisclosed
weapons
</P>
<P>
   storage sites,'' Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the NATO-led force is looking for the
sophisticated surface-to-air missile launchers that the Yugoslav
army used against American fighter pilots in the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the UN High Commission for Refugees is bracing for
the possibility more Albanian refugees will flee into Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees in Bosnia have asked the
agency for help since the conflict started, according to
spokeswoman Ariane Quentier. Another 70 come to Bosnia every week,
though she said the agency hasn't seen any increase in the past few
days, despite the recent Serbian offensive in Kosovo.

 &HT;    U.S., OTHERS EVACUATE PERSONNEL IN BOSNIA

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- With the possibility of a
NATO-led attack on neighboring Yugoslavia increasing, international
agencies Tuesday began to evacuate their staff from the
Serb-controlled region of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Several embassies, including that of the United States, have
urged their citizens not to travel in the Republika Srpska (CQ),
the Serb state within Bosnia, because of the possibility of Serb
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government employees were pulled out of the Serb state
Tuesday and embassy officials sent a letter to several U.S.
contractors and non-governmental agencies in the region urging them
to evacuate as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of the High Representative, the organization
responsible for implementing the peace plan in Bosnia, closed its
satellite offices in the Republika Srpska over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our satellite offices are very small operations and very
vulnerable,'' said said James Fergusson, spokesman for the peace
plan organization.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, two hand grenades were set off in the
parking lot of the organization's office in Banja Luka, the capital
of the Republika Srpska. No one was injured and only one car was
damaged in the explosion, Fergusson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Banja Luka office was not among those evacuated by the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, a key highway in the Serb state was
closed for several hours overnight by Serb demonstrators. The

 &HT;    PRIMAKOV CANCELS TRIP TO U.S. OVER KOSOVO
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW -- Ordering his airplane to turn around while over the
mid-Atlantic, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov abruptly canceled his
visit to Washington Tuesday as NATO warplanes were poised to strike
Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov decided to return to Moscow rather than face the
embarrassing prospects of holding talks in Washington while NATO
bombs Serbia, a close Russian ally. Russia has strongly opposed air
strikes, calling for further negotiations in an attempt to settle
the stalemate over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's U-turn marks a low-point in post-Soviet Union
relations between the Washington and Moscow. Yet Russia,
economically and politically weak, has little pressure to bring to
bear on the United States and NATO as it desperately seeks billions
of dollars in Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's decision to turn back came after two telephone
conversations Tuesday with Vice President Al Gore, the latter while
the Russian prime minister was over the Atlantic. Gore informed
Primakov that diplomacy had failed to resolve the Kosovo crisis,
and reportedly told him that bombing of Serb positions was
``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   During a stopover in Shannon, Ireland, before the decision was
made to turn back, Primakov told reporters that NATO strikes ``defy
common sense and could destabilize the situation in the world. We
are categorically against this, categorically.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from meetings with U.S. officials, Primakov was to have
held crucial talks in Washington with the leaders of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Those talks were to
be part of Russia's efforts to seek financial help to ease its deep
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, officials in Moscow warned that Russia may respond
to NATO strikes by helping to rearm the Serbs, contrary to United
Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an aggression, so the country which is attacked
must have weapons to defend itself,'' said Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's comments came as reports emerged that a Russian cargo
plane carrying MiG jet fighters had been seized last week in
Azerbaijan. Officials there said the plane was bound for
Yugoslavia, in violations of the arms embargo against Belgrade. The
Russian foreign ministry said the cargo plane was headed for
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, asked about the MiGs during his stopover in Ireland,
said: ``We have not broken the sanctions yet.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. and Russian officials insisted the round of meetings
between Primakov and Gore was merely postponed, the sudden decision
and Russia's tough talk about possibly arming the Serbs marks a
further souring of U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects Russia's increasingly feeble position in world
diplomacy since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Russia is
seeking to dig itself out of a severe economic slump amid political
disarray. Ailing President Boris Yeltsin has become increasingly
powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov put Russia's prestige on the line as Moscow stood by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in hopes that Russian
diplomats could broker a settlement and avoid NATO strikes. Russia
offered to supply troops to the NATO-led peacekeeping force for
Kosovo, an offer Milosevic eventually rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, senior Russian officials had hinted throughout the
day Tuesday that Primakov would postpone or cut short his U.S.
trip. The government faces intense pressure from the opposition
Communist Party and other nationalists who favor a tougher line
toward America and closer support for fellows Slavs in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned that NATO strikes could
spark a Vietnam-style war in the middle of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, officials across the Russian political
spectrum denounced U.S. air strikes on Iraq last December with Cold
War-style rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Russian opposition leaders have called on Russia to cancel its
cooperation with NATO if warplanes attack Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO strikes are also likely to further stall Russian
ratification of START II, said Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of the
Communist-controlled Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate ratified the arms control treaty in 1996. But
despite pleas from Yeltsin, the Duma has continually put off a vote
on the treaty, which would cut Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to about 3,500 warheads apiece.

DOLE CALLS TOUTS LESS GOVERNMENT IN SPEECH TO BUSINESS GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT FLORES  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In a wide-ranging speech that was heavy on themes
but light on specifics, prospective Republican presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole said Tuesday the public had lost faith in
the government because it is too big and too bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is remember the wisdom of our country's
Founding Fathers,'' Dole told 2,200 members of the National
Petrochemical and Refiners Association, which was meeting in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to dust off that 10th Amendment to the
Constitution,'' Dole said, referring to the amendment that
relegates to local governments those powers not specific to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who is in the process of exploring support for a
presidential bid next year, touched on issues such as crime,
education, drug eradication and national defense and repeatedly
emphasized a need for strong family values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never return to an age of innocence, but we can return
to an age of rediscovery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Dole said America must ``restore public
schools to greatness, return safety to our streets'' and set a goal
of ``ridding our society'' of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The America given to us by our parents is much better than the
one we are turning over to our kids,'' Dole said. ``We've been
embarrassed to talk about the values that made our lives good, like
discipline and modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's 35-minute speech was laced with several anecdotes about
her public service career that began with the Federal Trade
Commission more than 30 years ago. She served as Transportation
secretary in the Reagan administration, Labor secretary in the Bush
administration and was president of the American Red Cross until
January, but Dole has not held an elected office.
</P>
<P>
   She did not take questions from reporters or members of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   However, in responding to a question from the association's
president, Dole said the country's biggest challenge is to develop
a strategic defense system. She cited North Korea's development of
nuclear weapons as a major reason for the immediate need for a
shield against missile attacks from rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who was popular fixture in the 1996 presidential campaign
of her husband, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, is considered one of
the GOP's top prospective candidates next year. The other is Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, who earlier this month formed his own
exploratory committee.

AFTER THE OSCARS, THE COMPLAINTS 
GREATLY EXAGGERATED RUMORS
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC and the Academy Awards broadcast took a pounding from
critics after Sunday's show, the main targets being its extreme
length and Whoopi Goldberg's performance as host.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the ABC executive in charge of the broadcast,
said Tuesday that the first order of business for next year's show
would be insuring that it did not drag on. ``A four-hour and
seven-minute Oscar show is obviously too long,'' Davies said of
this year's length.
</P>
<P>
   The goal every year is three and a half hours, rarely achieved,
he said, for all the reasons that a live television event is an
unwieldy beast. But this year's show had special problems with
length, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   One was the usual challenge: acceptance speeches that go on too
long. Davies pointed out that the first big award went to James
Coburn, ``a film legend,'' as he called him, and thus someone whose
comments were not going to be drowned out by music, the usual way
speeches are cut short. Once Coburn went on a bit long, the tone
for the night was set, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's show was also stuffed with tribute pieces,
partly because the Academy felt obligated to mention film figures
who had died, like Frank Sinatra and Stanley Kubrick. But the extra
tribute pieces were also a way to solve one of this year's special
problems: There were not, Davies said, ``a lot of huge, popular
films, or huge stars for that matter, with nominations.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers had to try to grab the audience with the kind of
names they like to see, Davies said, adding, ``The only way to lure
them into being presenters is to ask them to give out a tribute to
someone they admire.'' John Travolta introduced the Sinatra
segment, and Nicolas Cage gave the Thalberg Award to the producer
Norman Jewison.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was effusive in his praise for Ms. Goldberg, whom he said
performed admirably in ``one of the most difficult roles in the
business, one that very few people can do.'' She was hampered, he
said, by a crowd that was less than ideal for any comic. ``That was
an extremely cold room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics assailed Ms. Goldberg for some of her material,
which was occasionally racier than what is generally heard on the
Oscar show. Davies said that ABC had received no calls objecting to
her jokes and that she had mainly made subtle comments that
``adults get but go over the heads of children.'' He did
acknowledge that she had let slip one barnyard epithet but he put
that down to the ``risks of live television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as ABC and the Academy are concerned, we'd love to have
her do the show again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be a tough invitation for her to accept, given the
nasty comments. Davies said harsh criticism of the show and the
host was becoming an issue for the producers. ``It's becoming more
and more difficult to persuade anyone to do these programs,' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With ratings down from last year, when the dominance of
``Titanic'' brought hordes of teen-age viewers with it, Davies
suggested something he would like to see in next year's show:
``Lots of nominations for the `Star Wars' sequel.''

   Blues Clueless
</P>
<P>
   The rumors sound like the Beatles hoax of the late 1960s, when
word spread that Paul McCartney had died and that the proof was
that he was barefoot on the ``Abbey Road'' album cover and that you
could hear ``Paul is dead'' if you played the song ``Revolution No.
9'' backward.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 30 years later, an almost identical hoax is swirling around
a different sort of cultural icon: Steve Burns, the cheery young
man in a green-striped rugby shirt who is the host of the preschool
show ``Blue's Clues'' on Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet prankster has spread word that Steve was killed in a
car accident and that a look-alike has been hired to play him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very different from Paul McCartney,'' said Angela
Santomero, the show's chief writer and one of its co-creators.
``It's very different when these are 2-to-5-year-old children
you're talking about. Steve has become someone they trust, someone
they almost have a play date with and go on adventures with, and
thinking he might not be there anymore is really upsetting to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rumor has spread nationwide among parents and day-care
providers. They, of course, could be expected to withhold it from
toddlers, but there is concern that older children could see the
rumor on the Internet and tell younger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Such a concern prompted Rosie O'Donnell to invite Burns to
appear on her daytime talk show, and he did. Burns has also kept up
a busy schedule of public appearances, speaking at a
UNICEF-sponsored children's television forum in Chile last week,
and participating in a reading for blind and dyslexic children on
Monday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to be back in the studio in New York, recording
new episodes, next week.

`THE NORM SHOW': ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You can't take my dog,'' insists a man who had left his
dachshund at the pound but has now changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're social workers, pal,'' replies Norm Henderson, who has
adopted the dog. ``We can take children.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a brave comedy writer to pen that exchange (of course
the National Association of Social Workers isn't thrilled with it),
and that's a good sign for ``The Norm Show,'' which has its
premiere Wednesday on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Norm is played by Norm Macdonald, formerly of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' who is also one of the new show's writers and executive
producers. The bad signs for the series are a strained gag early in
the premiere about a dog who does nothing but sit and stare (Moose,
who plays Eddie the Jack Russell terrier on ``Frasier,'' could sue
and win) and one of the most annoying, overinsistent laugh tracks
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The track becomes less disturbing as the gags get funnier, and
luckily they do. When Norm, a former professional hockey player now
doing court-ordered community service in social work (oh, sure,
that's realistic), first thinks about getting a dog, he explains,
``I love the idea of having a friend that I can lock up when I'm
not using him.''
</P>
<P>
   When it turns out that the teen-age boy he is counseling had
only stolen a comb, Norm dismisses him with words of wisdom: ``You
come back when you stab somebody, all right, Billy?''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie, a real social worker, is played by the fabulous Laurie
Metcalf, who started with the Steppenwolf Theater Company and went
on to win three Emmys for her role as the failure-prone but
determined sister in ``Roseanne.'' In the second episode of ``The
Norm Show,'' Ms. Metcalf manages to bring intelligence even to a
story line about a male client who smells really bad because of his
fear of physical contact with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norm Show'' could go either way, depending on the scripts
ahead. At its best, it proves that jerky-guy characters and actual
humor can coexist.
</P>

 &HT;    CheckFree to have competitorsBy Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two southern start-ups are starting to compete with
CheckFree, the Norcross, Ga.-based company trying to make the
Internet the place where people get and pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Derivion, an Alpharetta, Ga. start-up, and InvoiceLink, a
Greensboro, N.C., company, pitched for venture capital at last
week's Venture Market South conference, sponsored by Red Herring
magazine and held in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Derivion is not a direct competitor with CheckFree.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree has dominated the early stage of the electronic
payment processing market. What was a $1 billion electronic
bill-paying industry in 1997 is growing rapidly, according to
Killen &AMP; Associates. The Palo Alto research and consulting firm,
thinks it will be an $18.8 billion market by 2005, so there is
still a lot up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The market includes Transpoint, a venture between Microsoft and
First Data Corp., with a minority investment from Citibank; EDS and
Integrion. Killen sees that group thinning, either by merger or
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you pay bills electronically, by telephone or computer,
chances are CheckFree handles the paying of that bill, either by
sending a paper check or linking the bill payer to the biller.
CheckFree has signed more than 40 of the largest billers. The
company also has a deal with Yahoo!, the largest Internet portal,
according to Avivah Litan, a Gartner Group analyst. The deal, which
neither company has announced, would make Yahoo! a place where
people would go to see electronic versions of their bills and pay
them.
</P>
<P>
   Start-up Derivion considers itself a service company. It charges
companies that send recurring bills a fee for each transaction,
usually between 25 cents and 30 cents a customer, per bill, each
month. Derivion handles the entire process of posting a bill on a
Website: letting people know the option is available, enrolling
people in the program and taking the bill data and converting it
into a form that can be posted on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Derivion targets the mid-sized market, which it defines as
companies that send out between 50,000 and 1 million bills each
month.
</P>
<P>
   The company has two customers and letters of intent for two
others, said Greg Rable, Derivion's chief executive officer.
Derivion, which started in February, 1998, employs 25 people, 15 in
Toronto, 10 in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Derivion announced it will be iXL's ``preferred
provider'' for Web-based bill-paying and bill-presenting
technology. iXL is an Atlanta interactive ad agency that designs
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Derivion's investors include Bert Ellis, chairman and CEO if
iXL; Boland T. Jones, chairman of Premiere Technologies; Rex Fuqua,
managing director of Fuqua Ventures and Sergio Zyman, who was chief
marketing officer for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   InvoiceLink, founded in 1997, is considered a ``creative
upstart'' and an ``attractive choice for banks and billers,'' said
Litan, a Gartner Group analyst.
</P>
<P>
   InvoiceLink, which employs 11 people, is targeting the
business-to-consumer and business-to-business market.

 &HT;    CEO of Weather Channel resigns unexpectedly
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 17 years Michael J. Eckert is resigning as chief
executive of the Weather Channel effective March 31. Eckert was one
of the founders of the Weather Channel and served as CEO for 14
years.
</P>
<P>
   No successor has been named. In the interim, John O. ``Dubby''
Wynne, president and chief executive of the parent company _
Landmark Communications _ will act as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert said in an interview that his departure involved
personal, as well as professional considerations. ``A couple of
life things were also going on and that happens with CEOs,'' he
said. ``Every CEO, maybe every person, hits a point where it's time
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Weather Channel, it's a fabulous business,'' he
says. ``But you factor in a lot of holistic things. Our kids are
out of the house. My wife and I are adventurous types. We like
skiing and hiking and we just thought we might try to do some
things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future of the Weather Channel, Eckert says the
transition will be smooth. `` I have a wonderful leadership team.
(Interim CEO Wynne) isn't going to have to spend much time with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While he may not play an active role in choosing the next chief
executive, Eckert says there are some qualities necessary to take
the cable channel into the 21st Century: ``I have a theory that
there are five attributes people are looking for in all media. It
must be personalized, customized, convenient, fast and portable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next CEO should be someone who has a sense of where
technology is going _ not just the big picture, but how to make
money from it. That's the next person's challenge and it's not an
insurmountable challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark Communications executives weren't available to comment
Thursday, but industry watchers were struck by a comment Eckerd
made Monday: ``Periodic changes in any organization's leadership
are necessary for them to remain vital and challenged.'' Some see
that as a sign the company might want to bring in new blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about the Weather Channel is that they really
haven't been able to expand,'' says John Higgins of Broadcasting
and Cable magazine. ``They just really haven't found a way to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen years is a long time to be CEO of a cable channel,''
says Matt Stump, editorial director of industry trade magazine
CableWorld. Stump says Eckerd might be the third longest tenured
cable exectutive. ``That's an extremely long time in this business,
which in last three or four years is rapidly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says the Weather Channel is facing increasing challenges
as ratings remain predictable, with sharp increases in viewship
when the weather turns foul. ``But on the flip side, ``Stump says,
``it has great potential for interactivity for the Internet and for
the PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert, who celebrated his 52nd birthday this past weekend, says
he ultimately wants to go back to work. ``There might be
opportunities for me in Atlanta,'' he muses. ``There may be some
cable, venture capital players who are looking for somebody like me
that I might be able to help.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m. Tuesday, temperatures had risen into the middle 50s
across parts of Montana as a dry, warm ridge of high pressure held
steady over the northern Rockies and western Canada. Not only will
the sprawling warm ridge continue to embrace the region Wednesday,
but it will also impede the eastward progression of a Pacific low
pressure system west of Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy swells up to 20 feet high will pound the beaches in parts
of Oregon and Washington Wednesday as winds associated with the
Pacific low continue to agitate offshore waters. Moreover, showers
will speckle western Washington and Oregon as a pool of
high-altitude cold air drifts inland.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of the precipitation associated with the Pacific
system will be born by central and southern California as a potent
jet stream disturbance is flung inland on its southern flank.
Moderate to heavy rains are possible, particularly at low
elevations of west-facing slopes of the Coastal Range, while heavy
snow develops in the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms will erupt over
parts of Texas as a Pacific jet stream disturbance, which Tuesday
night slipped southward of the blocking ridge over Montana and
Wyoming, lifts very humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. Large hail
and downpours are possible across northern and central Texas to
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rain will develop along the New England seaboard as a
disturbance pivots northeast from the central Appalachians. Rain
may mix with wet snow at higher elevations farther inland.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Spring Floods
</P>
<P>
   Spring is flood season. In a typical year, melting snowpacks can
conspire with increased rainfall to make river and stream flooding
a threat. Sometimes, in northern areas, ice jams exacerbate the
floods on swollen rivers. This year, spring flooding is less likely
than normal over much of the nation. The generally mild winter in
the eastern states means that water locked in the remaining snow
cover is relatively scant. Meanwhile, in the mountains of the
Northwest, near record snow has brought an increased risk of
serious floods, but also an important boost in water supplies.

 &HT;    `Norm Show' stuck in D for `disappointing'
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norm MacDonald might be the funniest guy we have who doesn't
have a place to be funny. Dimply and droll, wuvable and wicked, he
killed 'em as the Weekend Update anchor on ``Saturday Night Live,''
right up until the day he was fired. His standup is legendary for
being the most outlandish routine this side of Chris Rock _ right
up to the moment audiences traditionally walk out on it.
</P>
<P>
   So what does TV do? Sticks MacDonald in a blandly generic sitcom
where his flat, devastating delivery can only occasionally peek
through _ right up until the day it's cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's forgettable ``The Norm Show,'' premiering tonight at 9:30,
revolves around MacDonald as Norm Henderson, professional hockey
player kicked out of the sport for gambling and tax evasion and
sentenced to five years of community service. Norm works in a
social services office where he alternates between toeing the line
and crossing it.
</P>
<P>
   Helping him do both: go-getter social worker Laurie, played a
little creepily by the wound-too-tight Laurie Metcalf of ``Scream
2''; and balding bad-boy-wannabe Danny (Ian Gomez).
</P>
<P>
   But there's too much situation to this situation comedy; it
unreels like MacDonald playing a role in an ``SNL'' skit that's not
working and won't ever end. His best lines only make a little
bearable the dreariness that surrounds him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't I have sex with a client?'' he asks. ``It's not like
we're psychiatrists. Or undertakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday TV will accomodate MacDonald's deadpan, slacker
Norm-ness. But not until it finishes off this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norm Show''
</P>
<P>
   Airs tonight at 9:30 on ABC
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: The wrong show.
</P>
<P>
   `It's Like' is an L.A. show about nothing
</P>
<P>
   By Drew Jubera
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Meet the love child of ``Seinfeld.'' Created by former
``Seinfeld'' writer-producer Peter Mehlman, this smug and zippy new
ABC sitcom seems sprung straight from the shallowest end of George
Costanza's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does this qualify as a discussion?'' one just-arrived
character exclaims to friends chattering on a patio about Elliott
Gould driving a Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's so great about L.A.,'' he's told. ``You don't
even have to be listening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Like, You Know . . .'' is the show about nothing that
George might have concocted if he had been a little more clever and
wanted you to know it _ right down to the over-calculated,
what-the-hell title. If there's a lot to laugh at here, there's
also a lot less to like.
</P>
<P>
   It's set in, like, you know, Los Angeles, of course. Most of it
takes place either in a car or the mansion of bald trust-fund
eccentric Shrug (Evan Handler). Robbie (Steven Eckholdt) lives in
Shrug's dream guest house; he's also wealthy, from a pay-per-view
business that televises the Jewish high holidays (``pay-per-Jew'').
One neighbor is the actress Jennifer Grey (``Dirty Dancing''),
played by the actress Jennifer Gray (``Dirty Dancing''), who sports
her new nose and new self-deprecating humor.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the single, underemployed, self-obsessed crew is
Robbie's best friend Arthur (Chris Eigeman), a New York magazine
writer doing a story on Los Angeles; and masseuse /summons server
Lauren (A.J. Langer).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Like, You Know'' is at its vapid best when it gives voice
to the yuppie Andy Rooney that lives, whines and wonders inside its
target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it amazing Germany didn't change its name after World
War II?''
</P>
<P>
   ``ValuJet changed their name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they should have changed the name Germany to something
nice-sounding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . Aspen.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of ``It's Like, You Know'' centers on the
in-the-know-ness of an L.A. that's the punch line of a thousand
stand-ups. While ``Seinfeld'' was set in New York, New York rarely
was mentioned; the city was a vast terrarium where it seemed all of
America's absurdities and neuroses and banalities could be
accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   To laugh along with this relentlessly clever show is to be
stamped an insider. You feel good about yourself when you get a
joke; you just don't often see yourself in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Like, You Know. . .''
</P>
<P>
   8:30 tonight on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Inspiration, like opportunity, often comes cloaked in
strange guises. For Jim Hodges, a Brooklyn artist, it came in a
life-changing way because a cashier at a Korean deli did what
cashiers do hundreds of thousands of times every day in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Hodges bought coffee, she would hand him far more
paper napkins than he needed. Reluctant to waste them, Hodges would
stash them in his backpack. One day he was feeling particularly
deflated about his art, which he was working on between duties for
the Dannheisser Foundation, the owner of a collection of
contemporary art that he cared for in exchange for a basement
studio. (The collection was donated to the Museum of Modern Art in
1996.)
</P>
<P>
   He even thought about giving up art altogether. While he mused,
he drew a flower on a spare napkin. It became a habit: As he sipped
coffee each day, he tried out various designs and styles and, on
the flip side, he sometimes wrote notes. ``They were honest records
of my days,'' he recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born ``Diary of Flowers,'' an array of 565 crumpled
napkins that he pinned to a gallery wall in early 1994, the
centerpiece of his first solo exhibition. Critics liked it. Roberta
Smith in The New York Times called the drawings ``as engaging when
taken one at a time as when viewed as a single field of blooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges now makes art full time. Nearly a dozen museums,
including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, own his works, and he has had solo
shows at half a dozen others, including one on view through April
11 at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. His pieces sell
for $5,500 to $40,000 to influential collectors like Peter Norton,
the California software entrepreneur and philanthropist, and his
wife, Eileen, who own eight of his works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is very provocative because it's beautiful, very
emotionally expressive, and it comes this close to being
sentimental but it never crosses the line,'' said Susan Cahn, the
Nortons' curator.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Nortons _ who are known for supporting political,
often difficult art _ commissioned Hodges to make their ``Christmas
project,'' the multiple artworks they send to some 3,000 people
each year. (Among the Nortons' previous choice of artists for the
yearly project is Kara Walker, who retells African-American history
in sexually explicit, violent terms in black paper silhouettes.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet far from being difficult, Hodges' work has won fans by being
colorful, visually alluring, even beautiful, curators say. (More
than one curator has placed it in group shows about beauty.)
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Diary of Flowers,'' Hodges takes ordinary materials
and makes something else. Mirrors become mosaics; artificial flower
petals are transformed into curtains; silver chains are woven into
gossamer spider webs. For the Nortons, Hodges designed an azure
blanket, an image of water in wool, with the inscription ``If there
had been a pool it would have reflected us.''
</P>
<P>
   His work, critics have said, is about memory, loss, lost time,
nostalgia, relationships, aging, personal growth. ``Jim is a
romantic character, a humanist,'' said Glenn McMillan of the CRG
Gallery, his SoHo dealer. ``There is no sarcasm or cynicism in his
work.''
</P>
<P>
   So while much contemporary art seems inaccessible to the
uninitiated, it does not seem at all odd that the easygoing Hodges
aims to make art that is easy to read. In a cheery yet emotive
voice, he recalls coming to New York to attend graduate art school
at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and ``not speaking the
language'' despite a fine arts degree from Fort Wright College in
Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   He had grown up in Spokane, one of six children, encouraged
before kindergarten by his parents and grandmother to be creative.
``They gave me a box of colored pencils and said `draw,' and I
enjoyed it,'' he said. ``My mom always said, `The details you put
in were different from the other kids,' and my kindergarten teacher
said the same thing. So it was at a very young age that I knew what
I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no art museum in Spokane, no repository of old
masters or impressionists or even American art, let alone the kind
of aggressive, provocative contemporary art dominant in SoHo and
the East Village in 1983, the year he arrived in New York. It
shocked him.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining what drives him now, at 41, Hodges said, ``When I
make art, I think about its ability to connect with others and its
ability to change or affect others, to bring them into the process,
to bring easy access to art.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to work. ``His show here was really popular,
superpopular,'' said Dana Self, a curator at the Kemper Museum of
Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Mo., where Hodges was an artist in
residence last year. ``Not many artists work in an emotionally
accessible way, but he does. His works are intellectually
accessible, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning a Lesson: `I Can Do That'
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, evidently a populist, would go a step further. Dressed
in a faded Cezanne-blue shirt and baggy gray camouflage pants, he
sat at a worktable in his tidy white studio in an old brick
industrial building in Brooklyn that has been converted to artists'
lofts, and said: ``I like that people say, `I can do that.' That's
part of the message _ yes, you can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before and after his ``Diary of Flowers'' episode, Hodges
himself had to learn that lesson several times. After completing
graduate school, while he worked at the Nancy Hoffman Gallery in
SoHo, he at first did only paintings. Realizing that he was a bad
painter, he abandoned his brushes and concentrated on charcoal
drawings. Then he started experimenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt beauty was very important to me,'' he said, ``so I made
as many ugly things as I could _ not because I set out to, but
rather to figure out what beauty was. It seemed so abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking money, he ``started using lots of materials _ paper
clips, tar paper, water, dirt,'' he said. The AIDS epidemic was
under way, and Hodges, as a gay man, had many afflicted friends.
For one, a florist, he made some roses of tar paper and Scotch tape
and exhibited them in a group show. But he discovered that people
were put off by them, deterred by the materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I had to rethink the material because I want my
work to be understood,'' Hodges said. Now he twists many materials
with everyday cultural associations into something new without
losing the identity of the original. ``The materials of art are all
around us, and it's the artist's job to expose them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His ideas, he said, come from everywhere. ``Music, poetry,
books, movies, friends, walking, the subway,'' he said. ``I'll walk
down the street and notice something. Ideas find me. I don't look.
The ideas I wake up with at 4:30 a.m. are the best. Then I figure
out how to get the idea out of me in the most understandable way.
That's where the job part comes in. I marry a material to an idea
so that it has a meaning. I think of it as braiding hair.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Hodges said he tried to keep things simple: ``The shortest
distance is what I go for, without much in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The process is slow. ``I have something in my head for a year,
maybe more, before I start work on it,'' he said. He makes no
preliminary sketches, though he does draw to help conceptualize his
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is apparent in his studio, which is just over the
threshold from the living quarters he shares with his partner.
Pinned to the wall are a spherical rendering filled with stars and
a rectangle covered with aluminum-foil squares; more drawings lie
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   As an idea jells, he starts working. ``When I start a piece, I
have no idea where I'm going,'' he said. ``I have an idea, but no
notion of what it's going to be like in the end. I have parameters
in terms of how big, what materials I'll use. The outcome is a
complete surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   When a Chain Became a Web
</P>
<P>
   A roll of silver chain, for example, sat in his apartment for a
year before he decided to turn it into webs, after visits to an
armor exhibition in Ireland and to a concert where a web made of
rope was part of the set. ``It suggested time and the sense of
absence; it seemed literary,'' he said. ``And the entire space
could become the art.'' Hodges has since made at least 100 webs,
one a 23-foot wall of interconnecting webs.
</P>
<P>
   The webs led him to curtains, which he has made from both
scarves and silk petals. ``My intentions were very simple: I was
taking a material and exposing it,'' he said of the way he
deconstructs artificial flowers, irons the pieces and sews them
together, end to end.
</P>
<P>
   With the cascades of flowers, which have been bought by several
museums, Hodges had too big a hit. Several were commissioned works,
and he feared he would have to start filling orders. ``My work was
just reaching a broad audience, but I didn't want to be the flower
artist,'' he said. He felt trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Broken Mirrors and a Vision
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors were his escape. The inspiration came on a plane ride to
Los Angeles, as he wrote in his journal about the need to break
from his history. ``I wanted to be brand-new, and I had a vision of
a mirror and a picture of a mirror breaking came into my head,'' he
said. ``And I felt incredible freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea germinated for a year, however, before he figured out
how best to shatter the mirrors. It involved a trick he learned
when he handled art for the gallery and the foundation,
specifically, covering glass with tape to prevent any further
damage if it broke during an art shipment.
</P>
<P>
   With his mirrors, tape cushions the breakage and allows Hodges
to reposition stray pieces easily. But the patterns are random.
``The only plan is to break them,'' he said. ``If I try to control
it, it adds a level of imposing design on a natural occurrence _ it
doesn't add to the work.''
</P>
<P>
   From breaking mirrors, Hodges has progressed into mirror
mosaics, perhaps predictably. ``I started thinking of putting the
things I break back together, and how to cut it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk is typical of Hodges. When he discusses the way he
approaches a new material, it is as if he is wrestling it to the
ground. When he knows how to use something new, he will say things
like ``Then the material was mine.'' More than once he used the
word ``freedom'' to describe what he felt after artistic
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges also revels, he said, in ``the physical sensation'' of
making art. Nowadays he even sees incidents like his flower-curtain
crisis as ``an opportunity for change'' that he welcomed. ``I
didn't come all this way to stop here,'' he said. Then he quoted
Walt Whitman: ``The strongest and the sweetest song yet remains to
be sung.'' Hodges added, ``He was about 70 when he wrote that.''

LAWMAKERS PUSH BAN ON INTERNET GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: RECASTS lede, pickup 2ndgraf: Internet gambling))  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from state law enforcement
officials, lawmakers on Tuesday renewed a push to enact legislation
that would ban gambling over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling is estimated to be a $600 million per year
business and is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is a serious issue,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
said during a Senate Judiciary panel hearing on the issue. Kyl,
chairman of the Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information
Subcommittee, estimates more than $1 billion will be gambled over
the Internet this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling enhances the addictive nature of gambling
because it is so easy to do. You don't have to travel. You can just
log on to your computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal gambling is a $50 billion annual industry that includes
casinos, slot machines, state lotteries and horse and dog-track
racing. It is regulated by states that have varying laws on
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys general have asked Congress for a federal ban on
Internet gambling because they argue they cannot police such
activity on a global network that defies state borders. They say
they cannot enforce Internet gambling even if states have their own
laws that ban such activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is already one of the most regulated industries in
the world, yet the Internet of one of the most heavily unregulated
and inherently difficult phenomena to regulate in modern time,''
said Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular form of Internet wagering is sports betting,
but casino-type games are becoming more popular as the Internet
becomes faster.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law makes placing a bet or sending gambling
information over telephone lines illegal, but the 1961 law predates
the Internet. Most computer users connect to the Internet through
phone lines but it is also possible to use cable television lines
and satellites, technically skirting federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect the Internet creates a loophole in gambling laws,''
said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Justice Department charged 21 owners and managers
of Internet gambling firms with illegally violating the 1961
telephone law, but law enforcement officials say the federal law
still needs updating to give authorities a good chance of
successfully prosecuting Internet gambling operators. Eight people
pleaded guilty, one is fighting the charges and the others remain
at-large.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl plans to reintroduce legislation this week that would ban
gambling on the Internet. It would impose fines equal to the amount
that a business received over the Internet or $20,000, whichever is
greater, and impose prison sentences of up to four years on those
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would require Internet providers such as America
Online to cut service for any illegal gambling site upon a state or
federal court order. The Senate passed a similar bill 90-10 last
year but the issue never made it to the House floor. House
lawmakers are also expected to reintroduce the legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Saum, the director of agent and gambling activities at the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, said Internet gambling is
attracting growing numbers of students who place sports wagers on
the Internet with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing consensus of research reveals that the rates of
pathological and problems gambling among college students are
higher than any other segment of the population,'' Saum said. Many
college students have access to the Internet as well as easy access
to credit cards that are marketed on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling sites typically require people to open an
account by providing a credit card number. Most sites require a
deposit of about $250 in order to play. Bets on sports teams, for
example, can range from 25 cents to hundreds of dollars. Betting
losses are charged to the credit card while winnings are posted as
credits, although in some cases gamblers report that they never
received their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   People can also play poker, blackjack and a variety of other
card and dice games with the click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 300 Internet gambling sites, up from about 15
just two years ago and recent studies have suggested that people
are increasingly becoming addicted to Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl and other lawmakers admit that federal legislation won't
stop all Internet gambling, especially in cases where gambling
operators set up shop overseas, which is a common practice.
Countries like Antigua, Costa Rica and Grenada license Internet
gambling sites.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery argued that a federal ban on Internet gambling would
still be useful because ``a public stance of prohibition tells
consumers that they should be extremely wary of Internet
gambling.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The University of Southern California announced on
Tuesday that its music school had received a $25-million gift from
the philanthropist Flora Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   The school said it was the largest donation ever made to a music
school in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sample, the university's president and a jazz drummer,
and Larry Livingston, the music school's dean, said the gift would
help finance the increasing efforts to train students and prepare
them for careers through market-oriented programs.
</P>
<P>
   The music school, which was founded in 1884, will be renamed for
Ms. Thornton, 85, the widow of Charles ``Tex'' Thornton, the
founder of Litton Industries, one of the country's largest
industrial conglomerates until it was broken up several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The university's music program has about 1,000 students. In
addition to classical music training it offers programs in such
areas as jazz, studio guitar performance and scoring for motion
pictures.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech among the best in engineering
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech, which has been striving to rise in
prominence among the nation's best engineering and technology
schools, took a step toward its goal this week.
</P>
<P>
   The College of Engineering, Tech's flagship, moved up to third
among the best of class in the annual survey by US News and World
Report, a list sometimes criticized but broadly consulted by
students, employers and competing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 engineering schools, according to the list, include
MIT, Stanford, Georgia Tech, Michigan, California at Berkeley,
Illinois, Cal Tech, Carnegie-Mellon, Purdue and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tech can boast of high marks for the College of
Computer Science, ranked 13th in its category, and the DuPree
College of Management, which came in 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   Tech President G. Wayne Clough, who has led a drive to improve
the standing of the school, was pleased and gave credit to his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased that the impressive work of our faculty and
students is so highly regarded at the national level,'' Clough
said. ``I'm particularly pleased that one of the nation's most
unique programs, our joint program with Emory University in
biomedical engineering, was ranked among the finest.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article accompanying its voluminous listings of the
academic best, the weekly news magazine cited the means used to
evaluate the colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The publications uses statistical information such as the
achievement scores of students accepted for study, job placement
statistics, and various scores. It also employs an elaborate survey
of the opinions of competing institutions about who is best in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Clough, a Tech graduate who has taught at Stanford, a perennial
leader on the lists, has said that attaining prominence is
important in moving the school forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduate education is extremely important as we continue to
transition to a high-tech, information-based economy,'' Clough
said, ``and the work conducted on this campus plays an important
role for the state and the nation as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The school is already being watched by the technology community.
Last week James Meindl, the Tech professor directing new research
into new chips, was recognized for his leadership by the
Semiconductor Industry Association at a Washington dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clough acknowledged that academic surveys have their doubters
but put it in some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important not to try to put too fine a point on these
things,'' he said. ``For instance, the distinction between being
the number one and number three ranked college is pretty difficult
to assess in scientific terms. But what pleases me about the
rankings has been the across-the-board improvement our schools have
shown.''

`NINE BELOW ZERO': LOVE AND FATE IN A LAND THAT BREATHES
DESPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By his own admission, Marvin Deernose, half Native American,
half something else, doesn't know a great deal about anything, but
he does know that we are not masters of our own lives, even if we
think we have control. He enunciates a kind of chaos theory about
the events of life. It's like that game in which you slide a penny
through a slot and it bounces down a series of nails that make it
go either left or right. ``The thing is, you can never tell where
it's going to end up at the bottom,'' Marvin says. ``Some little
thing comes along and shifts the penny off course by a millionth of
an inch and it comes out completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin is a former drug addict who has returned from California
to the small town in Montana where he grew up, hoping that there
will be something there on which he can anchor his lighter-than-air
existence. His notion about the illusory nature of meaningful
decisions seems on the mark very early on in Kevin Canty's smart,
gritty, unsentimental new novel, ``Nine Below Zero,'' in which love
and despair are set in a sorrowful, desperation-laden Western
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning, while driving his pickup home from his
girlfriend's house, Marvin sees an overturned Cadillac down an
embankment. The driver, suspended upside down by his seat belt, is
Henry Neihart, a former Montana senator whose life is saved by
Marvin's timely arrival. When Henry's granddaughter, Justine
Gallego, arrives in Montana from Oregon to take care of him, Henry,
now blind and not long for this earth, invites Marvin to dinner to
thank him. Justine and Marvin, two tormented and disillusioned
souls, form an attachment that is one part true passion, two parts
death wish, and the unfolding of their dangerous, jagged and
unplanned relationship provides Canty's narrative thread.
</P>
<P>
   Canty, whose previous novel was the highly praised ``Into the
Great Wide Open,'' has produced a new work finely tuned to the
precariousness and treachery of human need. Never mind that the
basic themes of ``Nine Below Zero'' are well worn: there is the
woman escaping the crumbling marriage, the ordinariness of
tarnished dreams. The love affair of Justine and Marvin is a kind
of duel between two late 20th-century emotional desperadoes who
sometimes seem to be imitating something they've read about the
inescapable soullessness of a world with plenty of avenues to
self-defeat and no God.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the return to the old homestead, in this case a
cattle ranch, for the expected death of the family patriarch, who
is Faulknerian in his brooding presence and his old-fashioned
authority. Some of the passages of ``Nine Below Zero'' are
reminiscent of ``While I Lay Dying.'' Henry is blind yet
sharp-eyed, a worthy match for his wayward granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But Canty gives these themes new life with characters of
unobtrusive complexity and a setting that is the perfect physical
emblem of their longing and despair. Justine is married to an art
professor at the university who is a decent man, but their
relationship has never recovered from the death of their 4-year-old
son, Will, in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still dead,'' runs a refrain in the afflicted mind of Justine,
who, having suffered wounds herself, inflicts them on others with
barely a thought of remorse. ``Still dead, still dead, the little
voices said.'' Justine behaves badly, and while we understand the
sources of her self-centeredness, Canty's laudable aversion to
sentimentality keeps him from providing her with excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd done bad enough things, she'd been malicious and mean,
she'd stolen small things and even once _ once before Marvin _
she'd cheated on her husband, but never once in her life had she
done anything bad enough to merit the punishment she'd taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin is a very different creature, but, like Justine, he is
among the walking bruised and wounded. He is rootless. His memories
are of deer hunting with his father, but he has lost the Indian
lore and adopted instead an ironic demeanor tempered by bursts of
sincerity, as when he takes the daughter of his pre-Justine
girlfriend, a bartender at the Sportsman's Lounge, to midnight mass
on Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin is dissatisfied and contemptuous but he is also
self-aware, noticing for example that ``his capacity for
self-forgiveness was unlimited.'' He looks at others in Rivulet,
his Montana town, enviously and dismissively, the way that
Dostoevski's Dmitri Karamazov viewed Russian peasants, as happier
than he is but undignified by spiritual struggle. ``He imagined
them bound to each other with a thick web of connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivulet, he believes, is ``the place where people stayed when
they were too slow or stupid to get out, the place where people
came to when they got afraid of the big wide world.'' For him,
Justine is the rich woman, the senator's granddaughter, not an
inhabitant of the same planet as he. But for that very reason she
becomes his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Canty's handling of their prickly relationship is distinguished
by his book's Montana background, an unforgiving place where the
cattle farms are hemmed in by tract houses with views of other
tract houses that have views of the mountains. His approach is also
distinguished by plain good writing, terse and profane. ``The
silence, as they sat and started to eat, was raw, half naked, full
of bare patches and open sores like a dilapidated calf,'' Canty
writes of Christmas dinner at Henry's. To get from silence to a
dilapidated calf is an achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Canty's story rolls inexorably toward danger, his characters
driven on in the spirit of Marvin's theories about human volition.
His figures live on the reckless extremes where every gesture seems
fateful, and Canty is in full command all the way to the end.

JVC JAZZ FESTIVAL TO OPEN WITH SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 27th annual JVC Jazz Festival on June 14 to 27
will present some of the leading names in jazz, rhythm-and-blues
and Latin music, with performers appearing in 36 places around New
York. The festival will open with a series of concerts at the
Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse featuring mostly swing-era shows,
including ``Revisiting the Kingdom of Swing,'' produced by the
clarinetist Ken Peplowski.
</P>
<P>
   There will be concerts by some of the biggest figures in
mainstream jazz, including Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Dave
Brubeck and Oscar Peterson. Brazilian music will be honored in a
rare appearance by Caetano Veloso and by Carlinhos Brown. Latin
music will be represented by Ray Barretto and Kenny Burrell in a
salute to Duke Ellington, and by a concert by two Cuban pianists,
Chucho Valdes and Gonzalo Rubalcaba. Tito Puente will share the
stage with Poncho Sanchez and his band.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Note Records will celebrate its 60th anniversary with two
concerts, including a night of music by Greg Osby, Charlie Hunter
and Brian Blade. Other shows by younger musicians include double
bills of Diana Krall and Joshua Redman, and Dave Holland and Brad
Mehldau; a tribute to John Coltrane with Donald Harrison, Carl
Allen and others, and a tribute to Kenny Kirkland that will include
Branford Marsalis and Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Rhythm-and-blues will be represented by James Brown and Ray
Charles, and there will be a concert of three blues artists, Buddy
Guy, Jimmie Vaughan and Shemekla Copeland. Some of jazz's most
popular singers are also to appear, including Cassandra Wilson and
Shirley Horn, and a concert will feature Manhattan Transfer, Anita
O'Day and Kevin Mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the festival will include three free outdoor
concerts at Bryant Park; the performers have yet to be scheduled.

`IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW ...': AN ECHO OF SEINFELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Seinfeld'' DNA is unmistakable and the title entirely
off-putting, but those are misleading first impressions of ``It's
Like, You Know ...,'' a witty, charming, acerbic comedy in which a
cynical New Yorker parachutes into the midst of a group of Los
Angeles friends. Experiencing severe culture shock, he is stunned
by the models, the road rules, the pretty masseuse who moonlights
as a subpoena server.
</P>
<P>
   The series was created by Peter Mehlman, one of the most
prolific ``Seinfeld'' writers, and its style undeniably derives
from that show, centered on the friends' wry conversations instead
of one-liners and sitcom plots.
</P>
<P>
   But just as ``Seinfeld'' was not really about nothing but about
the telling details of social manners, ``It's Like, You Know ...''
is about the culture clash between the East and West coasts and
between the New York life of the mind and the Los Angeles life of
the high-maintenance body.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Eigeman (so good in urbanely understated roles in Whit
Stillman films like ``Metropolitan'') is ideal for the role of
Arthur, the New Yorker heading to California for the first time to
write a book called ``Los Angeles, How Can You Stomach It?''
</P>
<P>
   On the plane he meets Lauren (A.J. Langer), the
masseuse/subpoena server, who tells him how a process-serving
colleague duped someone by claiming there was a cellulite detector
for arrivals at the Los Angeles airport.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Lauren knows the people Arthur will be staying
with: his old college roommate, Robbie (Steven Eckholdt), a
Protestant who made his fortune by selling the rights to the Jewish
high holy days on cable. ``He calls it,'' Arthur explains, with a
pause and just the right sardonic tone, ``Pay-per-Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie lives in the guest house of the bald, morose Shrug (Evan
Handler), who inherited his vast fortune and occasionally feels
guilty about it. When Arthur dryly suggests that Shrug pretend he
works in a bookstore that pays him $2,000 an hour, Shrug thinks
that's a plan.
</P>
<P>
   The three men have already shaped their characters with sharp,
terrifically confident performances. The women's roles are not yet
as well defined. Is Lauren a ditz or not?
</P>
<P>
   More problematic is Jennifer Grey, the ``Dirty Dancing'' actress
whose cosmetic surgery reshaped her face supposedly past
recognition. She plays a fictional version of herself as Robbie's
neighbor, or ``the wacky next-door neighbor'' as she puts it, eager
to talk about her stalled career and overactive sex life.
</P>
<P>
   The joke becomes tiresome after the first scene but is played
out relentlessly (at least in the three episodes available for
preview). The producers should have simply cast her as the wacky
neighbor and been done with it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jennifer Grey plot sounds more clever on paper than it
is, the rest of the series creates the opposite effect: It is far
funnier than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The show would fall apart without its precariously balanced
scripts. Happily, the culture clash is presented with a
sophisticated wink acknowledging that something can be both true
and a cliche. Robbie rattles off a litany of what outsiders hate
about Los Angeles. ``The murder trials last two years, the
marriages last two months,'' he says. ``Nothing's open late, you
have to drive to take a walk,'' he goes on, ``then you throw in
earthquakes, mud slides, road rage, race riots.''
</P>
<P>
   But one day you play baseball in January, he says, and the next
thing you know you're mindlessly happy waiting for your Guatemalan
gardener to show up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In next week's episode (all too reminiscent at first of the
waiting-in-a-Chinese-restaurant episode of ``Seinfeld'') the
friends sit in Robbie's living room and watch a car chase on
television. ``It's our version of a snow day,'' Robbie explains to
the bored-out-of-his skull Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode after that, the friends debate who is dating for
shallower reasons: Robbie is dating a model who likes him for his
money, and Arthur is dating an annoying, unattractive publicist who
might be able to introduce him to his idol, John Updike.
</P>
<P>
   The first minutes of Wednesday's episode may well drive viewers
away with a Seinfeldian conversation about whether the letter ``Q''
should come later in the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   And the title doesn't get any better even when it's explained as
a nervous tic of Los Angeles-speak. As the pilot on Arthur's plane
says of the weather, ``It's like you know, 82 degrees.'' But the
show soon rights itself to become one of the few new series to
deserve a long life.

PHOENIX-FINES (Phoenix) - Errant drivers who ignore traffic tickets
face bigger fines, suspended drivers' licenses, blemished credit,
and even jail. That isn't stopping thousands of Phoenix area
residents from cruising the streets with unpaid citations and
``what-can-they-do-to-me?'' attitudes. Phoenix court spokesman
Kevin Kane estimated that one cited driver in three ignores traffic
tickets and doesn't even show up in court. It's such a serous
problem that Phoenix's lawyers are developing a civil suit
collection process for traffic fines that could allow the city to
win judgements and place liens on drivers' homes, Kane said.
According to Phoenix court records, $162 million in unpaid fines _
predominantly traffic fines _ have been turned over to collection
agencies. By EDYTHE JENSEN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

MODULAR-FOOD (Phoenix) - If you master the few basic cooking
techniques, you can interchange ingredients with complete abandon
and come up with a vast menu of dishes. I call it ``modular
cooking,'' and it means you can build up your own ``recipes'' from
whatever you have in your larder. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved in
the ``D'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
STAHL (Phoenix) - TV broadcaster Lesley Stahl dishes some dirt in
her new memoir, ``Reporting Live,'' but this is not a titillating,
moneymaking tell-all. It's the engaging story of one of the leading
journalists in network news, a woman who admits she benefited from
affirmative action and made the most of it. By BARBARA YOST. Story

GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ When they dream about what they want
to be when they grow up, don't all little boys and girls picture

maybe they should, according to ``Jobs Rated Almanac,'' a new book
that rates the best and worst jobs in the country. By BILL

 &HT;    For young techies, Atlanta's the place
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Most high tech professionals look to Silicon Valley or New
York's Silicon Alley for fat paychecks and high-caliber careers.
Not Antony Chan or Ann Magruder.
</P>
<P>
   The Gen Xers say they can get all the Silicon Valley they want
in Atlanta _ along with a little Southern hospitality. And the
pay's not bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta seems to be a hotbed for opportunities. The people
I've talked to refer to it as 'Hotlanta'' or the Silicon Valley of
the East','' said Chan, whose pay will jump 30 percent when he
arrives in Atlanta next week from Sarasota, Fla. to work in
information technology consulting for Eagle Technology. The
24-year-old looked at Dallas, Chicago and New York before settling
on Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Vanderbilt University grad Magruder, 22, passed up
Houston and Nashville last year to work as a software consultant at
Atlanta software developer Manhattan Associates. She ruled out
Silicon Valley because ``just from talking with people who've been
there, I didn't really like the feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't enough for top IT talent. The deciding factor often
boils down to cost of living and comfort _ and that's where Atlanta
often gets the nod against rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta salaries _ especially those in information technology
_stack up rather impressively against other hotshot high tech
centers when cost of living, low unemployment and other quality of
life issues are considered, according to wage trackers and
recruiters. And that's a plus for worker-hungry firms in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A growing reliance on computer networks, heavy focus on Y2K
projects and the emergence of electronic commerce are pushing IT
salaries higher. Several recent wage surveys place Atlanta at or
near the top in IT pay.
</P>
<P>
   The metro area is an especially good drawing card for help-desk
managers, database administrators, systems programmers and network
administrators. A top help-desk manager can command close to
$80,000. A systems programmer and network administrator can expect
average annual paychecks of $70,542 and $60,832, respectively,
according to MATRIX Resources' latest quarterly hiring survey.
</P>
<P>
   Those three salaries topped those in Phoenix, Dallas and
Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. Professionals with
Internet and intranet skills and software and web developers also
are in big demand here, according to Robert Half International, a
specialty staffing service.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary look at hiring, RHI Consulting, a unit of
Robert Half International, found that the South Atlantic region,
which includes Georgia, had the strongest projected hiring in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we're seeing on a national scale is a strong
demand for Internet services and Atlanta has the same demand,''
says Reesa Staten, research manager at RHI in Menlo Park, Calif.
``A lot of the companies in Atlanta are looking for IT
professionals to help them provide or develop Internet-based
application.'' RHI predicts IT salaries will rise 7.3 percent in
1999 nationwide, double the wage hike in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is not a bad first-stop for college grads. An IT grad
with a master's degree in information systems or computer science
can start at $30,000 to $40,000, wage trackers estimate.
</P>
<P>
   With 165,000 high tech jobs in more than 9,000 companies, Metro
Atlanta is among the top eight tech centers in the nation, and
ahead of other Southern tech centers such as Raleigh, N.C. and
Austin, Texas, according to the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
The metro area ranks even higher in pay and opportunity for high
tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's in the top five,'' says recruiter Rick Rice,
director of permanent placement at MATRIX.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really good job offer,'' said Magruder, 22, who has
had a pay raise since joining Manhattan Associates seven months
ago. ``Pay was very competitive with other cities.'' But the bottom
line for Magruder was comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a small town girl,'' said the Ocean Springs, Miss.,
native, who wouldn't divulge her salary. ``I thought Atlanta still
had the feeling of a small town, but offered all the amenities of a
big city. It just sort of comes down to what I call 'southern
comfort'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wages are competitive on a national basis and extremely
competitive in the Southeast,'' said Sam Williams, president of the
Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, which did a study last year
looking at Atlanta's high tech ranking nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's closest rivals in the South: Research Triangle Park,
Dallas and Fairfax County, Va., which recently beat suburban
Atlanta's Cobb County for a telecommunications center for America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas and Raleigh topped Atlanta in pay in seven of eight IT
management jobs tracked in MATRIX's latest quarterly hiring survey.
Dallas was the frontrunner in pay in 14 of the 18 nonmanagement
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research Triangle is closer to us in cost of living than
Northern Virginia,'' Williams said. ``Our advantage is R&AMP;D and the
intellectual community we have among the universities and
established companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Those looking to advance their career and income through high
tech giants such as IBM and Northern Telecom are more apt to be
drawn to Research Triangle Park. Atlanta is more likely to attract
entrepreneurially minded candidates drawn by the likes of
MindSpring, WebMD and ISS, industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on skills, level and complexity of the
equipment,'' said Jim Reese, Randstad's managing director of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Rice: ``I've never seen so many organizations looking for
so many people. I tell you, if you want to compete in Atlanta,
you've got to pay.''

TROPICANA INTRODUCES NEW PACKAGING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW SAUER   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ In its ongoing quest for at-a-glance
identification, Tropicana has introduced new packaging for some of
its juices.
</P>
<P>
   The new packaging for the Season's Best line is aimed at
simplifying labeling and adding color to differentiate various
juices, pulp content and nutritional additives. The products will
debut in stores this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The new packaging identifies the juices as ``Pulp Free,'' ``With
Pulp,'' ``Calcium'' or ``Double Vitamin C.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote the new look, Tropicana plans to offer coupons for
Season's Best nationally in the Sunday editions of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Tropicana introduced new packaging for its Pure
Premium not-from-concentrate products shortly after the
announcement that the juice company was being bought by PepsiCo
Inc., based in Purchase, N.Y. The aim was similar. The new
packaging also included clearer charts of nutritional values and an
updated logo.
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo said Tropicana posted a profit of $40 million on $722
million in sales for the fourth quarter of 1998. Sales rose 5
percent, driven largely by a continued growth in the Pure Premium
product. Tropicana's profits were dampened by increases in the cost
of oranges during an unusually small Florida orange harvest.

SOLDIER DISCHARGED FOR REFUSING ANTHRAX VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A soldier who was twice demoted and then
discharged from the Army for refusing to take an anthrax
vaccination said Tuesday he had no regrets about the position he
took.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garner Jr., 23, said he was reduced from specialist to
private and given an ``other than honorable discharge'' Monday
night, averting a military trial.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time infantryman and paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne
Division who had served in the honor guard at Fort Sam Houston, he
was facing a court-martial for refusing to take the vaccine for
anthrax, a highly lethal biological agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get out of the Army like this,'' said Garner,
who fulfilled a boyhood dream by entering the service in 1994.
``But it's better than the alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A sergeant with an impeccable record, Garner was reduced in rank
to specialist earlier this month for refusing to be inoculated
against anthrax before being reassigned to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Garner could have been jailed and given a dishonorable discharge
if convicted of refusing to follow an order, For Sam Houston
spokesman Phil Reidinger said. He would not reveal details of
Garner's discharge, citing the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   Garner joined a small but growing number of military personnel
who have refused to take the vaccine, which is being given to the
nation's 2.4 million-strong force.
</P>
<P>
   Some 157 personnel have refused to take the vaccine, a series of
six shots given over 18 months, followed by an annual booster, Army
Medical Command spokeswoman Cynthia Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, seven of nine soldiers refusing to take the vaccine have
been discharged, with two other cases pending, Army spokeswoman
Elaine Kanellis said.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet has been court-martialed for refusing to take the
shots, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has been given to 230,074 service members, civilians
and contractors, 86,748 from the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Those refusing to take the vaccine have raised fears it might
trigger Gulf War syndrome, a mysterious, often-crippling malady
that has struck thousands who helped drive Saddam Hussein's troops
from Kuwait in 1991. Some foes of the drug also have claimed it may
cause sterility and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon insists the vaccine is safe. Still, the Air Force
last week revealed it would form a team headed by its assistant
vice chief of staff, Lt. Gen. David Vesely, to review the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force study is the only one of its kind among the
services, Defense Department spokesman Jim Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said he had no regrets about his stand against the
vaccine. He will lose all service benefits and risks being denied
jobs in such fields as teaching and law enforcement because of his
discharge status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say their problems are going to get bigger as time wears
on,'' Garner said of military personnel refusing to take the
vaccine. ``I think mine are pretty much over.''
</P>
<P>
   Word that Garner was spared a trial and heading home was
gleefully received by his parents, who live near Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud as a peacock of him,'' ex-Army infantryman and
disabled veteran Robert Garner Sr., 47, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they might say about him,'' said the
soldier's mother, Jeannie Garner, 48. ``He's not a coward or
anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's just something he feels real strong about and I
agree with him,'' she continued. ``I've always told him, `Bobby, go
with your conscience.'''

STATE TO LOOK FURTHER INTO BRAIN CANCER CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUGAR CREEK, Mo. _ Residents near the former Amoco Oil Co.
refinery in Sugar Creek may have a greater-than-expected risk of
developing brain cancer, according to a Missouri Department of
Health study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined cancer cases between 1985 and 1997 in two ZIP
codes _ 64053 and 64054, which include parts of Independence and
Sugar Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The study, state officials stressed, is considered preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, residents were concerned and confused by the
findings. State officials scheduled a public meeting for Tuesday at
Lanard Hall in Sugar Creek to further explain the study.
</P>
<P>
   More analysis will be required, the study cautioned, to
determine whether an excess number of brain cancers actually
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that we've found more brain cancer cases, not
deaths, than we expected to find,'' said Marianne Ronan, chief of
Missouri's bureau of cancer control. ``With these preliminary
results, we need to keep looking in Sugar Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's author, Eduardo Simoes, said Monday that the number
of brain cancers found in the study was not extremely elevated. But
it was high enough to warrant further study.
</P>
<P>
   The study found 15 brain cancer cases in the two ZIP codes; it
expected to find only about seven.
</P>
<P>
   The probability of finding such an elevated number, Simoes said,
is about 5 in 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department's study concluded that it should elevate
its inquiry to the next level, a process known as Level 3 that
state health officials began to use this year. It marks the first
time the Missouri Health Department has ordered such a study.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution from the old refinery, which Amoco operated from 1904
to 1982, has migrated into neighborhoods in Sugar Creek and
Independence. The pollution includes chemicals such as benzene,
which has been linked to leukemia in humans. Although the causes of
brain cancer are unknown, it has been linked to exposure to
chemicals in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco recently offered owners of about 130 properties in a
polluted area 154 percent of their property's fair market value
plus $5,000 in moving expenses. Residents also are involved in a
federal class-action settlement approved last summer. The case is
now on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading the state's investigation to Level 3 means the
geographic area in question will be expanded. As part of its new
study, Simoes said, the state will look at cancer cases in Jackson
County and possibly parts of Clay County to make sure an excess of
brain cancer does not exist in a wider area than Sugar Creek.
</P>
<P>
   He also will consider whether to widen the study area around the
refinery, although he said he thought the possible exposures to
pollution from the refinery were greatest in the two ZIP code areas
studied.
</P>
<P>
   The study released Monday did not find much evidence of elevated
numbers or clusters of leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma _ two
other cancers associated with exposure to chemicals in the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Further analysis, the study concluded, would be required to
determine whether clusters of the three types of cancers exist in
the Sugar Creek area. Although the possibility cannot be ruled out,
it is unlikely that such clusters will be proved, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's cancer inquiry process, a study can be
elevated to Level 3 if there's some evidence of a cancer cluster or
a heightened concern in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studies are showing some smoke,'' said Simoes, a Health
Department physician and epidemiologist. ``And it's a highly
publicized thing now. There's a lot of concern in the population.
And we can't be ignorant of (the concern) now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put all that together and we're justified in doing further
study.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morantz, a Kansas City physician who has treated many
Sugar Creek brain cancer patients, has launched with the University
of Kansas his own study of brain cancer incidence in the Sugar
Creek area. Jackson County is helping to pay for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Morantz said Monday that he agreed it would be proper to elevate
the state's study to a higher level given the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough suspicion to go on to Level 3,'' Morantz said.
</P>
<P>
   In his ongoing study, Morantz said 39 brain tumors between 1986
and 1996 have been found. But his study is looking at a wider
geographic area _ five ZIP codes near the former refinery site.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson City on Monday, Ronan said she would understand if
Sugar Creek residents were a bit baffled by the new study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the community may still have frustration with our
process,'' Ronan said. ``But we want to give them the best
information we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this information, while there are a lot of maybes tied in
there, the only way we'll know if there's more than maybes is to
continue following our process.''
</P>
<P>
   It's very difficult, she added, to determine whether a cancer
cluster exists. It's even more difficult to know whether it's
linked to any particular source. ... MORE

   UNDATED: Her urgent whisper came to me through the fog of sleep.
I wasn't sure I'd heard right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone did (BEGIN ITALICS)what?(END ITALICS)'' I mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone just flushed the downstairs toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   That was arresting news to receive at half past 3 o'clock in the
morning _ especially since we're the only two people who live here.
At least we (BEGIN ITALICS)think(END ITALICS) we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was a cat,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be silly. Cats use litter boxes. Whoever heard of a cat
flushing a toilet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you want me to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check it out, that's what! It might be a prowler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't it wait until morning?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``Now.''
</P>
<P>
   I listened at the top of the stair. There was no sound of
furtive movement below. Then I went down to check out the doors and
windows. Everything was closed and locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's gotten in,'' I reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I know what I heard. It did flush.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bafflement. The only explanation I could think of was
that we had a secret lodger _ someone who hid in the basement, or
in the crawlspace under the back room, slipping out into the house
at night to attend to sanitary needs.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unsettling notion. I wondered how long he might have
been with us. Only days? Or could it have been years? Then there
was another flush. And this one I heard, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's times like these when homeowners need guns,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going a little overboard, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' I told her. ``A man's house is his castle. He
has a right to defend the throne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely you wouldn't shoot someone just for using the toilet,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been shot for less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, ``and I remember reading about a man who shot
his mother-in-law in the garage at night because he said he thought
she was a raccoon. It was a terrible mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe. Maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   This time I descended the stair noisily, turning on lights as I
went, hurling my empty bluff ahead of me: (BEGIN ITALICS)``I'm
warning whoever's there! I will plug the first man who moves!''(END
ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   I looked in the hall closet, under tables. I opened all the
kitchen cupboards on the chance an intruder might have folded
himself inside. I even ventured down with a flashlight into the
dungeon of a basement.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there was no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it must be the phantom flush,'' my wife said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beg pardon?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone speak of it once. The thing goes off without
any explanation. It's one of life's big mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded screwy, so the next morning I telephoned a plumbing
contractor who confirmed there really was such a phenomenon. He
said they get calls all the time about phantom flushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a leaky valve in the flush box,'' he told me. ``Bring the
mechanism in and we'll fix or replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   I thanked him and hung up. I am ungifted at plumbing and
wouldn't dream of taking our toilet apart. Zoning prohibits
backyard privies, and it's too far to walk to an all-night
convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   By amazing coincidence, that very day's paper had a toilet
story. It told about a restaurant patron in Indiana who got upset
because the stool in the restroom flushed too slowly, so he whipped
out his pistol and blew the fixture apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have concealed carry in Indiana,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said my wife. ``But I think it goes to show
that toilets and guns don't mix.''

 &HT;    Penn plays prophet, catalyst
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He boldly predicted that Ohio State would go where no current
Buckeye had gone before. But other than a return to the NCAA
Tournament, even Scoonie Penn had no inkling Columbus would
rediscover the old world order in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was off the wall,'' Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien
said about his point guard's forecast that the Buckeyes would reach
the NCAA's for the first time in 1992. ''I just wanted us to be
better than we were a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Penn was a practice phenomenon but game-day
spectator who could only watch as Ohio State suffered one of the
worst winters in Buckeye basketball history. ''Sitting out last
season was very tough,'' said Penn, who had helped take O'Brien and
Boston College to two NCAA's, then sat out last season after
following his coach from BC to Columbus, Ohio. ''The hardest part
was just watching the guys go 8-22, knowing there was nothing I
could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 22 losses tied the school record for futility. In the last
four of their five consecutive losing seasons, the Buckeyes were
34-88. But before he had fired a single 3-pointer in Big Ten play,
Scoonie vowed that Ohio State was NCAA material.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scoonie's mentality was he's played two years in college and
two years he's played in the NCAA Tournament,'' O'Brien said. ''So
his mentality is when March comes around, you're in the NCAA
Tournament. But he obviously knows more about this team than I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   However, not even Scoonie foresaw this. After a second-place
finish in the Big Ten, the Buckeyes advanced to the Sweet 16. Two
victories followed in the South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Those wins advanced Ohio State beyond even Scoonie's wildest
dreams _ into Saturday's Final Four semifinal against UConn. Of the
four teams in St. Petersburg, only the fourth-seeded Buckeyes
aren't a No. 1 seed. But their improvement from eight wins last
season to 27 this season is the best for any NCAA Tournament team.
This team has become the school's most celebrated since the early
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the state of Ohio was the epicenter of the college
hoops universe. With three sophomore starters including Jerry Lucas
and John Havlicek, Ohio State beat Cal for the 1960 NCAA title. The
Buckeyes were national runners-up to Cincinnati in 1961 and '62.
After the '68 team, however, it would be 31 years before Ohio State
finally returned to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst? Scoonie. ''He's the difference in that team from
last year to this year,'' Auburn coach Cliff Ellis said after Penn,
with four fouls and his team trailing 52-46 with 10:14 left, scored
13 of his 19 second-half points, and 26 total, to oust Auburn.
''They won eight games a year ago and they've won how many this
year? He's not a good guard; he's a great guard. He's their heart
and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Salem, Mass., Penn was 5-feet-9 as a high-school
freshman and has grown just an inch since. He was the Massachusetts
state player of the year as a high-school senior and the 1996 Big
East freshman of the year. He led BC to the '97 Big East Tournament
title. But then O'Brien left his alma mater after 11 years as head
coach. He was dismayed after losing a couple of prize recruits to
heightened admissions requirements after a football gambling
scandal at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ''The previous two years, I had a good time,'' Penn said. ``But
the way the program was going and where it was headed, I wasn't
sure I wanted to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Penn waited his turn in Columbus, practicing with the
Buckeyes and sneak-previewing the skills that would make him this
season's Big Ten co-player of the year. In practice, Scoonie and
any four subs drubbed the starters. Regularly. The one Buckeye who
stuck with Scoonie: Michael Redd, the 6-foot-6 hometown left-hander
and one of the sweetest-shooting guards in the college game. ''I'd
never heard of the kid,'' Penn said. ''But that first day they
opened the gym, I said, 'This kid can play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The two guards played one on one and went hard in drills. ''He'd
push me around; I'd push him around,'' Penn said. ''Sometimes, we'd
get into it _ pushing, somebody elbowing somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ohio State has elbowed its way back into the Final Four.
Penn and Redd combined for 48 points against Auburn and 42 against
St. John's. After Penn landed hard in the regular-season finale at
Penn State and bruising his backside, his shooting suffered; he hit
just 31 per cent of his shots _ 15 for 48 _ in the next four games
and then started out 1 for 6 against Auburn, although he finished 9
for 16.
</P>
<P>
   Then he helped finish off St. John's with 22 points, eight
assists and three critical free throws in the last 44.4 seconds.
''I think my teammates look to me for that,'' Penn said. ''When
things get tough, I think I'm the guy with the ball in my hands.
I'm not afraid to take the tough shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Or speak his mind.

   SUGAR CREEK, Mo. ... any particular source.
</P>
<P>
   Last July longtime Sugar Creek residents Bud and Barbara
Chappell contacted state and federal health officials. They were
concerned about what they thought was an unusually high number of
brain cancers in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Chappells have been concerned about the refinery
site's pollution and its slow cleanup. They asked state officials
to study the cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said in October that they would conduct a
scientific investigation into whether there was an excess of cancer
in the Sugar Creek area. They said they had already confirmed 36
cancer cases in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The study released Monday was the result of that scientific
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Simoes said he hoped he would be able to complete the Level 3
study this year. If it confirmed the excess brain cancer risk,
further study would be required to determine a possible cause, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the Chappells gathered in their living room
with friends and their attorney, Beverlee Roper, to await delivery
of the state report.
</P>
<P>
   The results were both satisfying and disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   What mattered most was that the study meant they still had no
clear answer to their health questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to know,'' said Barbara Chappell, ``is whether we
should live here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Chappell, who is a candidate for the city's Board of
Aldermen, said the report was written in such a technical style
that it would be difficult for almost anyone to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost me after `Dear Mr. and Mrs. Chappell,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haman, another alderman candidate pushing for faster
cleanup of the former refinery site, read the report with the
Chappells and Roper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they leaving out 64050?'' Haman asked. ``By doing that
they're not looking at the plant's air emissions,'' which would
have blown west toward that ZIP code area.
</P>
<P>
   Later, under the glare of a television camera, the emotion
welled in Barbara Chappell's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She thought of a neighbor whose son died of brain cancer, and
how her friend longs to know whether the tumor was related to the
neighborhood's pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't given her an answer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's report was not formally discussed during Monday
night's Sugar Creek Board of Aldermen meeting.
</P>
<P>
   However, much of the meeting featured debate between board
members and spectators who criticized the city's relationship with
Amoco over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Chappell asked Assistant City Attorney Bob Buckley whether
he stood to receive legal fees in the buyout program offered by
Amoco. Buckley said that he did not.
</P>
<P>
   Haman suggested that the city had been careless in its relations
with Amoco, adding that visitors inspecting the city's documents
pertaining to Amoco allegedly had found several sealed and
unopened.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Creek Mayor Charles Dumsky denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Dumsky, who received a summary of the state report Monday, said
after the meeting that he welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a final answer,'' he said. ``I want closure.''

can't survive if he agrees to the Rambouillet accords, even

JUSTICES FOCUS ON POLICE SEARCHES OF CARS USED IN SUSPECTED DRUG
DEALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, weighing the constitutionality
of the drug war, considered Tuesday whether police need a warrant
before seizing and searching a car suspected of having been used in
a cocaine deal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and other states have laws permitting police to seize
vehicles suspected of having been used in the drug trade. Under
these statutes, the cars are regarded as motorized criminals who
can be ``arrested'' and ``searched'' if the police have probable
cause to believe they were used in illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   The issue raised by the Florida case before the high court was
whether police violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on
unreasonable searches and seizures when they failed to get a
warrant before impounding and examining the car of a man suspected
of dealing drugs from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Florida, Carolyn Snurkowski, urged the justices
to reinstate the drug-possession conviction of Tyvessel White, who
was found guilty based on the cocaine police found in an ashtray
during their search of his seized 1983 Toyota, four-door
automobile. David Gauldin, a Florida assistant public defender
representing White, pressed the high court to uphold the Florida
Supreme Court's decision to throw out his client's conviction. The
court said the police had failed to get a required warrant before
searching the car.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in Florida
vs. White by July.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting Florida's appeal to a skeptical U.S. Supreme Court,
Snurkowski argued that police have the same constitutional
authority to seize and examine an automobile suspected of being
used in a crime as they do to stop and search a person they suspect
of having committed a violent act.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, pressing the
Clinton administration's support for Florida's position, added that
police do not need a warrant to seize and search a car suspected of
having been used in a drug deal and parked in a public place, such
as an outdoor parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But Gauldin told an equally critical court that Florida's goal
was not to take White's car off the streets but to secure evidence
against his client, an effort that, he said, required a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices pressed the three attorneys, warning Snurkowski
and Stewart that their view of police power could lead to
law-enforcement abuses and telling Gauldin that federal and state
governments have summarily seized and searched vehicles hauling
illegal goods since the dawn of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in questioning Snurkowski, said he was
concerned about the ``potential for abuse'' by police officers who
under Florida's theory could spot a suspicious car but then wait
years before seizing and searching it in hope of catching a drug
dealer. The car thus becomes an ``evidence repository'' for patient
police who want the car solely as a mechanism for trapping
criminals without first getting a warrant, Scalia told Snurkowski,
who said little to assuage the justice's concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This instrumentality, the car, is the offender here,''
responded Snurkowski, conceding that police can wait before acting.
``The car cannot wipe itself ... of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, of the Clinton administration, said police without a
warrant may seize a car from a public parking lot and search it if
they have probable cause to suspect the vehicle was used in a drug
deal. But police would need a warrant before taking a car from a
suspect's closed garage because the owner in that case would have
``a reasonable expectation of privacy'' akin to that of a person
sitting in his or her home, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Countering the two government lawyers, Gauldin echoed Scalia's
concern about police abuse in arguing that Florida was interested
not in the car but in securing incriminating evidence against his
client. To prove his point, the public defender said police waited
at least 68 days from when they allegedly saw White deal drugs from
his car before seizing the Toyota from a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Gauldin said that Florida police often use the automobiles they
seize not as evidence at drug trials but in performing undercover
work or to raise money at civic auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy incentive to enforce the law,'' Scalia said of
the benefits the police derive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too healthy,'' Gauldin responded.

 &HT;    Physics in '99: Hawking now accepts acceleration of expansion
theory
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cosmologist Stephen Hawking said Tuesday he now
accepts what scientists are calling a stunning breakthrough in
astrophysics _ evidence that the universe not only is expanding,
but that the expansion is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, speaking at a press conference in Atlanta, said he was
not sure of that when scientists announced last year they had hard
evidence the universe is flying apart at ever greater rates. But
after carefully checking the measurements, Hawking said he now
accepts them as correct.
</P>
<P>
   The finding has profound implications for our understanding of
the fate of the universe. Science magazine, one of the world's most
respected scientific journals, called the accelerating universe
finding the ``Breakthrough of the Year'' for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, 56, the Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge
University in England, has been regarded by some as Albert
Einstein's intellectual successor. He is in Atlanta this week for
the 100th anniversary meeting of the American Physical Society, and
will give a public lecture at 8:30 p.m. tonight at the Atlanta
Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, 56, suffers from Lou Gehrig's Disease, which affects
his motor skills, and speaks by touching a computer screen that
translates his words through an electronic synthesizers. He is the
author of the best-selling ``A Brief History of Time,'' in which he
explains his theories on black holes and time and space.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to another question, Hawking said there is not enough
known matter in the universe to halt its expansion, and the
universe may keep flying apart forever. The expansion began,
scientists say, some 15 billion years ago in the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   In response to other questions, Hawking said:
</P>
<P>
   _ No one single thing can stand out as the greatest development
in physics in the 20th century. ``It's a ridiculous question,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are still wide gaps in our understanding about the
universe, but he says there is a 50-50 chance that scientists will
develop a theory within the next 20 years unifying the four forces
of nature _ gravity, electromagnetism and the weak and strong
forces associated with atoms.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether humans will be able to travel back in time
and in another dimension in the 21st century, Hawking abruptly
answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   In other research presented Tuesday at the APS meeting,
physicist Dan Spergel of Princeton University said that an
accelerating universe suggests the existence of a cosmological
constant. It was first suggested by Einstein in 1917 but was later
discarded by him because it seemed impossible. He later said that
it was his greatest blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmological constant would represent a huge energy
reservoir which means that the universe of matter, which includes
everything from rocks and sand to stars and clusters of galaxies,
may be but the minor portion of creation.
</P>
<P>
   In another presentation, physicist Ernest Sternglass theorized
that the universe will reach a size 200 times its present radius,
and will neither fly apart into dead ashes, nor collapse into a
fiery point, allowing life to continue forever.

CHINA SAYS U.S. MISSILE SYSTEM MAY LEAD TO ARMS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's chief negotiator on Taiwan on Tuesday
strongly attacked a proposal under consideration in the United
States to deploy a missile defense system, warning that if it was
used to protect Taiwan, it would provoke an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Daohan, a senior adviser to President Jiang Zemin,
criticized the proposed defense system, called ``theater missile
defense,'' as tantamount to a military provocation that would
threaten security throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said in an interview that if the United States deployed
such a system in Taiwan, ``it is like playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That will completely disrupt the current world situation, and
instead a new Cold War will appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system has been under discussion to protect U.S. troops
in Japan and South Korea from North Korean missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But with China already wary since U.S. intervention three years
ago when mainland tensions with Taiwan were rising, it is concerned
over the prospect of having such a system in the region. The system
would be partially deployed at sea, meaning that it could easily be
moved to protect Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China would regard such a move as the establishment of a
military alliance between the United States and Taiwan, Wang said.
In China's view, that would represent an unacceptable violation of
China's internal affairs, since China considers Taiwan a breakaway
province, not a separate country.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's comments represent China's sharpest denunciation so far
of U.S. proposals for an advanced missile defense system that would
use rockets to shoot down incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress this month that a
full national missile defense system to protect the United States
had not yet been tested, would cost billions of dollars, could be
operating by 2005 at the earliest and even then would have a high
risk of failure.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion of creating one has suddenly become popular in
Washington. The Senate recently voted 97-3 to declare that a U.S.
missile defense system should be built as soon as technologically
possible.
</P>
<P>
   It is a smaller, more technically feasible plan for a theater
missile defense system that makes Chinese officials like Wang so
irate, even if it is also years away.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say that since China would have difficulty
invading Taiwan, it has instead focused on the possibility of
launching missiles if, for example, Taiwan declares itself
independent. In 1996, Beijing fired several missiles that splashed
into the ocean near Taiwan, causing widespread panic on the island.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks China has apparently moved and targeted several
batteries of missiles toward Taiwan. That may be little more than
posturing, but it comes as U.S. tensions with China are growing.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an uproar recently in the United States over
allegations that in the last decade China was given nuclear secrets
by a Taiwan-born American scientist at the research center in Los
Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Wang dismissed such concerns. ``Chinese people have been very
poor for many years,'' he said. ``Now we are awakening. But we will
never have the goal of invading another country. Our goal is to
pursue peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Other military experts warn that the increasingly tense volleys
of accusations from Washington jeopardize Asian-Pacific security,
as well as relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we treat China as an enemy, it will surely become one,''
former Defense Secretary William Perry said in Hong Kong on Monday.
``I cannot point to a time in recent history when I was more
concerned about the U.S.-China relationship based on what is going
on in Washington today,''
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing tensions, China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, is
planning to visit the United States early next month, the first
such visit by a Chinese prime minister in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy on the China-Taiwan issue is delicate. In recent
years the United States has pursued a strategy of deliberate
ambiguity about whether it would protect Taiwan in a potential
military conflict with the mainland. Washington has been careful
not to declare that it would take military action, both to avoid
provoking China and to avoid giving Taiwan license to act
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was President Clinton's move, sending two aircraft
carriers toward Taiwan in 1996, that effectively defused the
China-Taiwan crisis at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Although tensions are growing now, China and Taiwan are
proceeding with a series of occasional talks that began in 1993.
The talks are aimed at exploring the ultimate goal of
reunification, but they have made little headway.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, whose title is chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, said he was still planning to proceed
with his first visit to Taiwan in September or October. It would
follow a trip to mainland China by his Taiwan counterpart, Koo
Chen-fu.
</P>
<P>
   China still wants to build a ``constructive strategic
partnership'' with the United States, Wang said. ``Note the word
`constructive,''' he said. ``That means that it is progressing,
moving toward closer, more cooperative relations.''
</P>
<P>
   If a theater missile defense system is deployed in Taiwan, he
added, ``then I ask you: Are our relations constructive or
destructive?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years Chinese officials have accused the United States,
which has sold F-16 fighter planes and Patriot missiles to Taiwan,
of violating the three joint communiques that provide the
diplomatic framework for U.S. relations with China by promising to
phase out U.S. military support for Taiwan. Wang reiterated China's
objection on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at today's Taiwan, which has already purchased
advanced weapons systems from the United States, we think that it
already constitutes an arms race on Taiwan,'' Wang said. ``There
should be no such arms race on the island.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say building a theater missile defense system for
Taiwan, a decision that is still far from being made, would not
represent a change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. diplomat who is based in China, and who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said such a system would not be
``significantly different from selling F-16s or Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang differed, saying that if such a system was used, ``Are we
moving closer to reunification or closer to an arms race?''
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand,'' he said, ``the United States has repeatedly
advocated making efforts for security in the Pacific. But on the
other hand it is advocating an arms race.''

 &HT;    Tests on Wright Flyer give scientists surprises
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Wind tunnel tests of a full-scale Wright Flyer
replica wrapped up in California last week with surprises for both
airplane researchers and wind tunnel operators.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer researchers from the Los Angeles section of the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics spent from March
1 through March 18 assembling and testing a replica of the
wood-and-fabric machine the Wright brothers used to make the
world's first powered flights in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers, mostly retired aerospace scientists and
engineers, worked with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to test the flyer in a giant wind tunnel at the NASA
Ames Research Center on Moffett Field in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   The AIAA research team, dubbed the Wright Flyer Project,
collected data on how the flyer behaved in winds of up to 30 miles
per hour, the speed at which Daytonians Orville and Wilbur Wright
flew the original craft in strong head winds at Kitty Hawk, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some surprises,'' AIAA wind tunnel engineer Rich Grimm
said Monday from his home near Los Angeles. ``The cloth wings
seemed to change shape more than we expected under aerodynamic
loads.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant the flyer would have flown a little differently than
predicted by previous tests with rigid, small-scale models. It also
means the original flyer's performance likely was different than
previous research has indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The group has just begun to refine and analyze the wind tunnel
data, Grimm said. Besides gathering historical information, the
project team hopes to use the data to build a more stable replica
of the Wright Flyer and fly it at Kitty Hawk on the 100th
anniversary of powered flight in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   NASA researchers also discovered their cavernous wind tunnel,
designed to test large-scale aircraft models at speeds up to 350
miles per hour, develops eddies in its otherwise smooth air flow at
low speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a huge effect,'' wind tunnel manager Pete Zell said,
but it caused the relatively lightweight flyer to rock from side to
side during tests. As a result, some tests had to be run for
minutes at a time instead of seconds to gather enough data to
cancel out the effects of the unstable air.
</P>
<P>
   Zell said the flyer was removed from the tunnel on Monday.
Project member Marilyn Ramsey said it will be reassembled and put
on display in an aviation museum at the Federal Aviation
Administration's Los Angeles-area regional office.

TEXAS SENATE PASSES DRUG BILLS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some drug dealers who sell as little as one gram
of illegal substances would face life imprisonment under a bill
that cleared the Texas Senate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, Senate Bill 41, would subject drug dealers to a
minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum life sentence if the
buyer dies from using the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the presence of deadlier and more potent drugs today that
are out on the street and risk of overdose as well as death
increasing ... this is an important piece of legislation,'' said
bill sponsor, Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would allow prosecutors to seek stiffer penalties
against drug dealers if the buyer suffers serious bodily injury as
a result of taking the drug. Punishment in those cases could be
increased to the next highest category of crime, and first-degree
felonies would be subjected to a minimum 15-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also approved another Shapiro proposal Tuesday,
Senate Bill 43, which would establish a statewide database of drug
overdoses. Under that proposal, physicians would have to report
deaths attributed to substance abuse, much as they now report
deaths from firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills are part of a package of anti-drug measures that
Shapiro introduced this session in the wake of the deaths of more
than two dozen young people in North Texas in the past two years;
all the deaths were attributed to heroin overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   SB 41 mirrors federal legislation imposing a maximum life
sentence on drug dealers if an individual dies as a result of
taking a substance bought from the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Goodman, spokesperson for the Texas Commission on
Alcohol and Drug Abuse, said the number of deaths due to cocaine
and heroin overdoses rose dramatically between 1992 and 1997, the
last year for which the agency has figures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, there were 333 deaths attributed to heroin overdoses
and 338 attributed to cocaine overdoses. By comparison, in 1992 the
state recorded 223 deaths from cocaine use; that number dropped to
189 in 1995, Goodman added, before rising rapidly in the next two
years. In 1992, 167 deaths were attributed to heroin overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the rise in cocaine and heroin use to a drop in
prices and newer methods of ingesting the drugs _ such as snorting
as opposed to intravenous injection _ which makes drug use more
acceptable to some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When price is low, more people use _ it's like selling
shoes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One drug counselor told her that an individual can buy enough
heroin to kill himself for $10.
</P>
<P>
   While prices have dropped, Goodman said, the purity has risen,
particularly with heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Lubbock, a shipment of black tar (heroin) was so strong
that dealers had to dilute it twice before they could sell it,''
Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's third anti-drug initiative, SB 42, would set a model
for drug testing of public school students at parents' request.
Senate Bill 44 would prevent 16- and 17-year-olds from checking
themselves out of drug treatment programs.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As Ginny Venneberg described it, her two

she was helpless to do anything about it. Venneberg herself was

AT&AMP;T'S DEBT OFFER DRAWS INVESTORS' ATTENTION AS BOND PRICES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of government securities rose modestly Tuesday
as investors focused primarily on AT&AMP;T Corp.'s record-setting
global bond offering priced earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds received a lift from the record corporate offering as
securities firms that underwrote the corporate debt bought back
Treasuries they had sold as a hedge against losses. Also, a
slumping stock market added to the buying momentum as investors
sought refuge from equities.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 12/32, to 95 26/32.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
fell to 5.54 percent, from 5.57 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To help meet strong investor demand, AT&AMP;T sold $8 billion of
debt in a global offering, increasing the size of the deal from an
announced $7 billion on Monday, which was up from the initially
planned offering of $5 billion to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Appetite for the blue-chip giant's deal, which was underwritten
by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., far
outstripped supply and garnered about $12 billion in orders,
according to some traders.
</P>
<P>
   The company had filed registration statements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to sell as much
as $13 billion of debt and plans to borrow more this year, possibly
$3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal included $2 billion of five-year notes, up from $1.75
billion and priced to yield 5.735 percent, or about 64 basis points
more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity; $3 billion
of 10-year notes, up from $2.5 billion at a yield of 6.032 percent,
or 84 basis points over notes with a similar maturity; and $3
billion of 30-year bonds, up from $2.75 billion that were priced to
yield 6.582 percent, or about 94 basis points over similar
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   When it was priced, AT&AMP;T's debt offering became the largest
investment-grade deal ever in the corporate bond market. And
because of its size, it took on bellwether status as it becomes
part of the Lehman bond index, which fueled demand from
institutional investors who felt they must have exposure to it.
</P>
<P>
   Before AT&AMP;T's offering, Worldcom Inc., now known as MCI
Worldcom, held the record for the largest high-grade deal after
selling $6.1 billion in debt last August.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist for Gruntal &AMP;
Co., said the deal came in at a slight discount to where other
single-A-rated corporate bonds are trading. ``Yes, the securities
have fair market value, which is where you would expect them to be
selling if you wanted them to move from off the shelf and into the
hands of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew C. Palmer, a managing director and corporate bond manager
at ASB Capital Management, a company in Washington with more than
$6 billion in bonds, said, ``After all the AT&AMP;T issue had been
expected for quite some time and the bonds had been discounted over
and over again, tightened a bit when they became too cheap, than
discounted again. Right now I think the deal has a fair market
value.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, based in New York, was in the market to sell bonds for the
first time in almost four years to help pay for recent
acquisitions. ``This is going to be a bellwether corporate bond,''
Palmer said. ``It will also be a popular deal for nondomestic
investors who tend to buy the names they know, and AT&AMP;T they
know.'' Traders said another reason for the good attraction was
that there is little likelihood that the company will turn into a
high-yield company overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently completed its $32 billion purchase of
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's second-largest cable
provider. It is also paying $5.5 billion to a TCI unit, Liberty
Media, and acquiring IBM's global network business for $5 billion
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's debt is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by
the Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury will auction $15 billion of new two-year notes
Wednesday that were being offered at a price to yield of 4.97
percent.

DOLE STRESSES MORAL RENEWAL IN TEXAS SPEECH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Republican presidential prospect Elizabeth
Hanford Dole told a gathering of oilmen Tuesday that Americans must
recover the core values of the past to meet the challenges of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never return to an age of innocence,'' Dole said. ``But
we can move on to an age of rediscovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the annual meeting of the National Petrochemical and
Refiners Association, Dole paid tribute to America's recent social
and technological revolutions but said change has often come at the
expense of virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks, Dole's first in Texas since announcing her
presidential exploratory committee March 10, underscored the
decidedly measured approach the former head of the Red Cross and
erstwhile Cabinet member is taking in this precampaign phase.
</P>
<P>
   She made no mention of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, her closest
rival in the GOP presidential race. Instead, she sounded themes
similar to the ones she used in a speech to a gathering of
dermatologists Monday in New Orleans. In some cases Dole even used
the same language.
</P>
<P>
   She took only two questions, both of them from an official of
the petrochemical group and kept the news media at a considerable
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from the podium to center stage throughout her 40-minute
address, Dole seemed relaxed but well rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of Bob Dole, former Senate Republican leader and the
1996 GOP presidential nominee, Elizabeth Dole routinely places
second to Bush in polls around the country. Bush has formed an
exploratory committee, but has not yet formally entered the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than address the apparent front-runner in his home
state, Dole invoked long-standing GOP themes such as a less
powerful federal government. She called Washington ``too big, too
bloated and too bureaucratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole also focused on foreign policy in response to a question
about America's biggest challenge. On the day that NATO prepared
airstrikes in Kosovo, she expressed concern over North Korea's
nuclear strike capability and said the United States must quickly
develop a missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   While never elected to public office, Dole said her experience
at the Red Cross and as a member of the Reagan and Bush
administrations has prepared her for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Dole called public education a top priority, but while she
mentioned the need for academic reform, Dole also stressed a
broader theme of moral renewal. The hope of the nation, she said,
is ``the conscience and character of its children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never go back, not an inch,'' said Dole, especially
mindful of the women's movement. At the same time, Dole said the
changes of the past 40 years have yielded ``a pornographic culture
and a society that no longer blushes.''
</P>
<P>
   She lamented the plight of the nation's youth, recalling a
generation of children who lived ``in homes whose locks we didn't
turn.'' The remark was not unlike ones Kansas native Bob Dole made
during his 1996 run for the presidency, when he too saw yesterday's
values as an answer for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they lack is living in a world without worry,'' Dole said
of America's youth. ``In seeking to make America better, we've
neglected what's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole added that the nation's drug problem must be addressed with
a ``moral seriousness'' and said the president of the United States
must use the bully pulpit to convince kids that ``drugs aren't
cool, they kill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My passion doesn't come from polls,'' said Dole. ``We need
leadership on this issue.''

TOUGH TIMES: ROCK'S INCUBATOR TURNS DOWN THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the past at the South by Southwest
convention, for years the rock business' most important cavalcade
of performances and panel discussions, talent scouts came looking
for tomorrow's rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   Acts like Fastball, Lisa Loeb, the Presidents of the United
States of America, Cake and even Hanson set deals in motion here.
But something was different this year.
</P>
<P>
   The change was best represented by the agenda of one scout from
a major label. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said he had
come here not to sign a band, but to prevent his label from signing
one. The group's contract with his label had expired, he said, and
he wanted to make sure no one else at the label tried to renew it
at the band's showcase performance.
</P>
<P>
   During this convention, held from Wednesday to Saturday, it was
impossible to ignore the effects of record-label consolidation and
rock's cyclical fall from commercial grace. The atmosphere was like
Bourbon Street in New Orleans after Mardi Gras but when even the
die-hard revelers have gone home, leaving the streets dirty and
desolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd see the day when I didn't care about Sonic
Youth,'' said another major-label talent scout, referring to the
seminal New York alternative rock band. ``It's sad what's happened
to indie rock. This is the least exciting year I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. The number of major labels at South by Southwest
severely dwindled this year, with almost no top executives in
attendance and many lesser employees opting to stay home. Even the
bulk of smaller independent labels didn't bother to bring their
most popular bands, only the struggling ones.
</P>
<P>
   The convention center and showcases for unsigned bands seemed
emptier than usual, though a conference spokeswoman said attendance
was up slightly from last year's 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   And most tellingly, a new music-industry class emerged: the
great unemployed, laid off as a result of consolidation, chiefly
Universal's recent acquisition of Polygram. Most were trying to
find new opportunities but ended up just sharing war tales, like
the Mercury employee who remembered colleagues being summoned to a
room 50 at a time to get laid off one January afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Nighttime concert showcases were no longer just for unsigned
bands: they were also for former Polygram bands like Radish and
Robbie Fulks, both of whose record deals were recently terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Overall there was a sense that festival goers were no longer on
the cutting edge. Speakers at panels agreed that the biggest thing
happening in music today was setting beats to rhymes: rap. Yet here
they all were, holding the rock banner in the air and wondering
when people would start noticing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is booming, the Internet is popping, the Dow is
reaching 10,000, but the music industry is acting like it's waking
up from a really bad hangover,'' said Andrew Rasiej, who heads the
New York Nightlife Association and a charity called Mouse, which
brings computer networks to schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This feeling of neglect, of having missed the bus, was also
common at a separate convention in Miami, the Winter Music
Conference, a five-day event for electronic dance music that ended
on the day South by Southwest began.
</P>
<P>
   When alternative rock began to wane commercially three years
ago, major labels looked to electronic dance music to plug the gap.
Instead, as pop veered back into the middle of the road with the
Spice Girls, Hanson and fey boy bands like the Backstreet Boys, the
contrarian fringe movement came not from white music (the rock of
South by Southwest or the electronica of Miami) but from black
music, showing just how little control the established industry _
denizens of conventions like these _ has over pop success.
</P>
<P>
   (To be fair, the Miami conference isn't all electronica: it's
also known for its component of Latin dance music, a genre with
sales on an upswing and one that the established business is even
less equipped to deal with than rap, despite a few visionary
executives who began taking crash courses in Spanish this winter.)
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a viable rock undercurrent in some ways made South
by Southwest a success, signaling an end to mercenary concert going
and a return to music for music's sake. Some at the conference
simply chose to see the group Built to Spill perform three nights
in a row, and they were better off for it.
</P>
<P>
   This ever-changing Boise, Idaho, group boasted its strongest
lineup, blurring lyrically astute songs into sonically intense
guitar solos and proving itself to be one of the closest things
alternative rock has to a classic rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Younger performers like Diane Izzo, a songwriter from Chicago,
probably would have been the object of a major label bidding war
three years ago, hailed as the next P.J. Harvey or Liz Phair.
Instead, Ms. Izzo played her winningly dark-minded rock this year
in a half-empty club with few record executives in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to Austin's deep well of songwriters, it was
possible to go out every night and hear great music without ever
attending a show by anyone under 35. (As talent scouts will tell
you, with the same conviction with which they once said that rap
was dead, no one over 35 is going to be the next big thing.)
</P>
<P>
   Semi-reclusive artists well past their showcasing days, like Tom
Waits and Jeff Beck, flew into town in hopes of building excitement
for their new albums. The back garden of a Mexican restaurant
played host to a high-spirited jam including Joe Ely, Freddy
Fender, Rosie Flores and Ruben Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   A fatigued Lucinda Williams turned in a lackluster performance
in support of a terrific album. Guy Clark, Clarence (Gatemouth)
Brown and the always talented, always inconsistent Terry Allen _
with a guest appearance by David Byrne _ performed to a packed
house at Liberty Lunch. (Willie Nelson was scheduled to perform
with Leon Russell, but the show was rained out.) Even Wanda
Jackson, the 61-year-old rockabilly queen, played one night at 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to past years, when the shows with the most buzz
(jargon that conjures images of both swarming and irritation) were
by young alternative rock bands, this year's most talked-about show
was by a pop star, Robbie Williams, formerly of Take That. He
erected an elaborate arena-ready performance in the tiny garden of
an Austin club to kick off an American campaign that he hopes will
make him as big a celebrity here as he is in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As conference goers complained of the lack of hip-hop, only a
handful of people ended up at the best of the week's few rap shows,
by the savvy-rhyming Ugly Duckling, of Long Beach, Calif., at Bob
Popular. They performed as teen-agers outside took turns
demonstrating a loose-limbed style of break-dancing as part of what
they called the Texas swing-hop scene.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting shows were the oddest. Todos los Manos were
a German group featuring members from Chile, Brazil and Hamburg
singing in Spanish, Portuguese, French and English (but not German)
and playing hard-driving songs that switched styles every 30
seconds. Bellatrix, a mostly female quintet from Iceland, packed
Bob Popular one night, mixing violin, drum loops, and wailing,
biting avant-rock vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bands once again matched their American counterparts in
talent and diversity, from the big-beat dance-rockers Boom Boom
Satellites to the obsessive record collector known as Fantastic
Plastic Machine to the guitar-bashing girl pop group Seagull
Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite so much good music, many people left the conference with
the sinking feeling of having spent a week treading water with a
rock tied to their legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to give the music back to the people,'' Lucinda
Williams said in a keynote speech that began the conference. ``I
don't think major labels are working anymore.'' On a panel on the
closing day of the conference, David Byrne echoed her sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   This moment in pop may seem like a time of low spirits and
layoffs. But in retrospect it may prove to be one of the most
exciting periods to be involved, especially with the changes that
will be wrought by the Internet; label consolidation; the sale of
concert companies, record labels and options on song royalties to
Wall Street, and the rise of easy-to-use computer programs enabling
anyone to become a producer. Those out of work today may be the
ones starting companies vital to reassembling the business in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   All this hasn't gone unnoticed by the producers of South by
Southwest: in recent years they've started conferences on
interactive technology and film to surround the music festival,
clearly envisioning a day when the rock convention seems as quaint
as a television without cable.

   WRESTLEMANIA (Undated) _ The red-hot growth sector for media
analysis in 1999 is the apocalpse theory. And the word
``Millenarianism'' is the belief in a battle between good and evil
at the end of the millennium that lays waste to the earth and is
then followed by a thousand years of peace and human perfection.
(Mill(italics)i(end italics)nerianism, on the other hand, is the
belief in, um, hats.) What better way for the pop-cult eggheads and
satraps to earn their living than by pointing out for us the early
warning signs to the death of civilization? One such harbinger, the
seemingly inexplicable resurgence of professional wrestling, is
already being written about and spoken of by those on the critical
edge of the crackpot apocalypse. Wrestlemania, apparently, is the
end of the world as we know it. In our Age of Incivility, it should
come as only a small surprise that professional wrestling is now
the hippest ticket in town and a regular ratings juggernaut on
cable television. By Jeff MacGregor. Photo..

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ARCTIC-CIRCLE-FILM (Undated) _ Julio Medem, 40, makes
sophisticated, elegantly constructed films whose characters seem to
wander blindly through a maze of experience. The director has
earned a reputation as Spain's most promising auteur; but as an
artist, he prefers not knowing where he's going. Spanish audiences
have had no trouble connecting with ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle''
(``Los Amantes del Circulo Polar''), Medem's fourth feature and a
surprise hit. The movie will be presented in the New Directors/New
Films series at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan on April 7
and 8, and will open theatrically the next day. Highly stylized,
the film is a love story told alternately from the perspective of
each of the lovers, and it plays with the tension between the
lovers' fairy-tale idealism and the hazards of chance and will that
govern their fate. By Leslie Camhi.
</P>
<P>
   TONY-GOLDWYN-FILM (Undated) _ About five years ago, the actor
Tony Goldwyn started getting restless. His performance in the 1990
off-Broadway play ``The Sum of Us'' had put him on the New York
theater map. The same year, his portrayal of the yuppie villain in
``Ghost'' had done the same in Hollywood. But he wanted more. His
response was perhaps inevitable for the son of the movie producer
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and the grandson of the Hollywood legend Sam
Goldwyn. He would find a script he wanted to act in and produce it
himself. He saw it as something that might happen 10 years down the
road. But it didn't turn out the way he expected because of a
script called ``The Blouse Man,'' by a poet and playwright named
Pamela Gray. As ``A Walk on the Moon,'' the film opened on Friday,
and although Goldwyn does not act in it, he is indeed one of the
producers and, more important, its director. By Sylviane Gold.

   NO-FRILLS-CINEFEST (Liverpool, N.Y.) _ The phrase ``film
festival'' conjures glamorous images: the beaches of Cannes, the
slopes of Park City, Utah, and a crush of photographers aiming at
the latest starlet. Then there's Cinefest, which prides itself on
offering lots of films and not much festival. Held at a
standard-issue Holiday Inn here off Interstate 81, just northwest
of Syracuse, Cinefest has quietly developed a reputation as the
un-Cannes. For four days, several hundred people gather to sit on
banquet chairs in the hotel ballroom and watch movies that run from
9 a.m. until well past midnight. The films being screened are not
orphans in search of a distributor or indies hoping to generate
buzz, but rather spirits from the past: rarely seen movies from the
silent and early talkie era. By Ted Loos. Photo.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW-MUSICALS (New York) _ For musicals with big bold intentions,
they certainly didn't make much noise. The first to come and go
quietly was ``Parade,'' the funereal $5.5 million Lincoln Center
Theater show about the lynching of Leo Frank. Next was ``Bright
Lights Big City,'' the $500,000 musical adaptation of the Jay
McInerney novel that opened and closed at New York Theater Workshop
in what seemed like the span of a single yawn. The last to depart,
``Captains Courageous,'' a $1 million musical that opened in
mid-February to the equivalent of a citywide shrug, is to vacate
the Manhattan Theater Club next Sunday. There you have it. Over the
course of a few punishing winter months, the musical hopes of three
of New York's most successful nonprofit theaters were smothered in
a blizzard of mixed-to-negative reviews. By Peter Marks. Photo.

<P>
   NY-BALLET (Undated) _ Rehash or celebration? As a work in
progress, the New York City Ballet's 50th anniversary year looks
like both. The celebration is, in effect, a retrospective: Now
halfway through the 100 ballets it plans to present through June,
the company leaned toward the familiar in its recent winter season.
Yet the packaging was often different, and new contexts made for
new insights. By Anna Kisselgoff.

<P>
   WEIR-THEATER (London) _ Ian Rickson says he admires auteur stage
directors like Robert Wilson and Anne Bogart, who leave their
emphatic imprint on a production. But he prefers to burrow out from
the inside of a play. And if people don't notice what he has done,
that may be the highest compliment. Rickson's work is on display in
``The Weir,'' by the 27-year-old Irish playwright Conor McPherson,
which opens on Thursday at the Walter Kerr Theater in Manhattan.

opera in its significantly revised, definitive form. By Matthew
Gurewitsch.

<P>
   CHOPIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Another anniversary is upon us, yet the
music business is strangely muted. Frederic Chopin died 150 years
ago, and the relative silence has less to do with our forgetfulness
than with our despair. For what are we to give the man who has
everything? Centennials _ bi-, tri-, sesqui- or of whatever nature
_ promise concentrated looks, resuscitations of neglected works,
re-evaluations of worth, new editions and musicological
discoveries. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   GRAND-MACABRE-OPERA (Undated) _ Probably no opera of the last
quarter-century has been seen by more people than Gyorgy Ligeti's
``Grand Macabre.'' Since its premiere in Stockholm in 1978, the
work has had several different stagings in Europe, though none so
far in this country. Now comes its second recording, taken from
public performances in Paris a year ago of the production made for
the 1997 Salzburg Festival (Sony SK2 62312; two CDs). Esa-Pekka
Salonen leads the Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta
Voices and an excellent cast, most of whom will be returning in

<P>
   ROSCOE-MITCHELL-JAZZ (Undated) _ Roscoe Mitchell, whose album,
``Nine to Get Ready'' has just appeared, is a leading member of
jazz's forgotten avant-garde. Once hailed as an heir to Ornette
Coleman and Albert Ayler, Mitchell found himself pushed to the
margins in the 1980s by Wynton Marsalis and his traditionalist
followers, who reviled free jazz as an evil second only to fusion.
Since the early 90s, Mitchell has been staging a comeback,
recording and performing at a furious clip. He might not be welcome
at Lincoln Center, where musicians are expected to adhere to
blues-derived forms and steer clear of European dissonances. But
among younger jazz listeners who chafe at such restrictions,
Mitchell's audience is expanding. By Adam Shatz.

<P>
   ROCK-IMAGE (Undated) _ Today, rock-and-roll is having problems.
Promoters say there are no new bands with members under 40 that can
sell out stadiums the way wrestling can. Monster truck shows, on
the other hand, have no problem selling out stadiums night after
night. And monster truck shows don't even have real celebrities, as
wrestling does: just unseen drivers like Gravedigger, who is
basically loved because he takes his turns too fast and too tight
and likes to drive through stadiums destroying props. There's that
violence and danger again. And maybe that's what rock needs. By
Neil Strauss.

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-LOW-CULTURE (Undated) _ There is nothing these days that is
too Low for High thought: trailer parks, snuff films, Mickey Mouse.
Some of this is because of the unparalleled power of American
popular culture, its extraordinary influence with world audiences
and its aggressively democratic perspective. Boundaries are
dissolving so fast that even the lowly life of a cultural critic is
swept up in the maelstrom: in recent months I have written about
swimming pools, video games and lingerie as well as Arnold

According to a Chinese legend from the Qin Dynasty, to avoid
further bloodshed, a war between an uncle and nephew was settled by
a game of weiqi, a kind of chess. This and many other stories are
charmingly related through the nearly 100 objects exhibited in

AT FESTIVAL, ALMOST ALL THE WORLD IS A STAGE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ In a scene with a strange sense of deja vu,
two federal agents corner a man in a SoHo warehouse in New York and
besiege him with questions and accusations while saying,
unconvincingly, that he is free to leave at will. The man, an
erudite editor at Random House, cynically passes off the
interrogation as mere harassment until he realizes the earnestness
of the agents' inquiry and the extent of their knowledge about him.
</P>
<P>
   As Arthur Kopit's new play, ``Y2K,'' slips smoothly into a
flashback, it becomes clear that the editor and his wife have been
victimized by an invidious computer hacker who has completely
undermined their lives. Vicious lies have become, to the world at
large, seemingly unassailable truths, and the editor's favorite
quotation from Flaubert gains a new relevance: ``Everything you
invent is true.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sizzling 80 minutes, the play, the centerpiece of the 23rd
annual Humana Festival of New American Plays at the Actors Theater
of Louisville, exposes the control that computers can have over
lives, morality, even bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the play refers not only to the threat of a
computer breakdown at the millennium but is also a metaphor for the
subjugation of man by machine. A work that starts out as a dark
comedy becomes a horrifying cautionary tale, a kind of contemporary
version of a Jacobean revenge play.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the principal characters is acutely delineated: the
editor (Graeme Malcolm), who is jolted from his plateau of
complacency; his superchic wife (Lucinda Faroldo), for whom
trendiness is paramount, and the hacker from hell (Dallas Roberts),
whose power of invasiveness is as awesome as the gaps in his
cultural background. Only two things seem to matter to him: sex and
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   With diverse knowledge of the intricacy of the Internet, Kopit
plays with questions of reality, illusion and delusion _ and
paranoia. The work is filled with artful twists and turns (and a
few plot strands need tying up). As directed with precision by Bob
Balaban, ``Y2K'' provokes a shudder of anxiety that should be
repeated wherever it is staged. To borrow from Kopit's dialogue,
the play has ``a lethal feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Y2K'' was an inexhaustible subject of conversation at
Louisville this weekend, theater professionals were also focusing
on another festival phenomenon: the attempt to blur the boundaries
between actors and audience.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Jory, the producing director of the company, has explored a
wide range of theatrical experience in previous festivals, making
his most significant contribution the discovery of new female
playwrights. But rarely has the festival moved away from formal
theatrical structures.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the theater opened the doors to
site-specific events, including what was referred to as ``a car
play,'' ``What Are You Afraid Of?'' by Richard Dresser. Outside the
theater, a shabby town car was parked for the weekend. In it, at
15-minute intervals, a play was presented, with a rather
astonishing ratio: two actors in the front seat and an audience of
three in the back seat. With such limited seating, there was a
waiting list for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   On cue, the driver invited a pretty hitchhiker into his vehicle,
each taking a chance on the other's stability. While bantering and
moving into a romantic relationship, the hitchhiker observed,
``Just the two of us, not a soul around'' _ except, of course, for
the three voyeurs in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The sketch had a rollicking spontaneity. After the performance,
the actors took a bow in the street in front of the car, an action
that must have startled passengers in passing vehicles. Though
brief, the dialogue could have a future life: it is a play that
literally can be taken on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, people were lined up inside the theater to
listen to a series of five ``telephone plays,'' picking up a
receiver to overhear conversations. While several of the
playwrights tried to cram too much plot into their allotted three
minutes, a few understood that the message was itself the medium.
Diana Son (author of ``Stop Kiss,'' recently at the Public Theater)
wrote a clever dialogue between former lovers in which the
apparently Insignificant Other turned out to be triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of eavesdropping so evident in the car and telephone
plays was also felt on the theater's main stage with an anthology
of eight 10-minute plays by writers under 30. As is often the case
in Louisville, the women were the most accomplished contributors:
Caroline Williams (with a comedy about office politics), Sheri
Wilner, Julia Jordan and, especially, Brooke Berman. Ms. Berman's
``Dancing with a Devil'' is a harrowing memory of rape and its
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The central theme in these and other plays was an identity
crisis: young people trying to find themselves, older people trying
to redefine themselves and the protagonist in ``Y2K'' adrift
without passport or portfolio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Two full-length works expressing this theme seemed to have at
least a regional interest: David Rambo's ``God's Man in Texas,'' an
overlong battle between ministers for control of a Houston
megachurch, and ``Cockfighter,'' a rustic coming-of-age play as
adapted by Vincent Murphy from a Frank Manley novel. Naomi Iizuka's
``Aloha, Say the Pretty Girls,'' tracking a group of tiresome young
people who repeatedly cross paths on a journey that takes them from
New York to Hawaii and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Far more appealing was ``Cabin Pressure,'' devised and directed
by Anne Bogart with her company of actors. For this performance
piece about actors and audiences, Ms. Bogart deconstructed the act
of theater as the actors analyzed and made physical their various
approaches to their art and offered snapshot scenes from plays by
Noel Coward and Edward Albee.
</P>
<P>
   In an antic coda, the actors did a lampoon of audiences, miming
their fidgets and gestures _ lolling, shifting in their seats,
sleeping, and, occasionally, being moved by what they saw on stage.
</P>
<P>
   As an additional offering there was ``The T-shirt Project.'' Six
playwrights wrote playlets short enough to fit on a shirt. The
T-plays were on sale (for $20 apiece) at the theater with the
suggestion that the buyer could wear one, read it and act it out.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Kushner composed a dialogue in sonnet form, Mac Wellman
introduced an epic for 22 dwarfs in red fezzes and Wendy
Wasserstein wrote a colloquy in which famous playwrights from
Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams competed in writing T-shirt
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Aphra Behn had the last words: ``Women playwrights at Louisville
_ 35 years of scribbling for excellence,'' an appropriate epigraph
for the Actors Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the weekend there was an exhibition of set
design (by Ming Cho Lee and others) and there were panel
discussions, one with playwrights who teach playwriting. Marsha
Norman, who achieved her first recognition at Actors Theater, said
that her advice to writers was to determine what their ``true
content'' was, indicating that it should be something so endemic to
them that ``if they didn't write about it, we wouldn't know about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the weekend's contributions by that description, it
was clear that Kopit's play qualified.

WAITS RETURNS WITH THE BEST OF HIS 30 YEARS OF MATERIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``I must sound like George Burns!'' Tom Waits
commented midway through his performance on Saturday night as part
of the South by Southwest festival at the Paramount Theater here.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been talking about his gravelly, nicotine-stained
voice or the steady stream of jokes he kept making between songs.
It was Waits' first concert in nine years (not counting benefit
performances), and by the end of the two-hour, 19-song show, it was
hard not to wonder why he doesn't perform more often.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, he was a natural showman, much more accessible a
performer than the way he comes across in his choppy concert
documentary, ``Big Time,'' and his eclectic ``Mule Variations,''
his first album of new music since the score from his 1994
collaboration with Robert Wilson, ``The Black Rider.'' (``Mule
Variations'' is due April 27 from Epitaph, an independent label
known for its punk-rock releases.)
</P>
<P>
   For some 30 years, Waits has been creating a body of work, from
beautiful ballads to clattering avant-jazz-rock, in which each new
song delves into the mind of a different character battered and
almost beaten in a neighborhood of Waits' own making.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dangerous night town filled with hard liquor, pawn
shops, old-time religion, murderous derelicts, yellowing bed sheets
and sailors on shore leave.
</P>
<P>
   At the Paramount, Waits rolled out nearly all his best-known
characters: the besotted penitent waiting to die in ``Jesus Gonna
Be Here Soon,'' the reminiscing heartbreaker of ``Innocent When You
Dream,'' the itinerant musician of ``Sixteen Shells From a
Thirty-Ought Six,'' the belligerent drunk of ``Goin' Out West'' and
the lovelorn loner of ``Downtown Train.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Larry Taylor on acoustic bass, Waits' four-piece band
was all new to his music. The musicians had rehearsed 30 songs
before the show, and went on stage with no idea which of those
numbers Waits still remembered the lyrics to.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, songs began tentatively as he tinkered with the
set. In new pieces like ``Filipino Box Spring Hog,'' Waits was
forced to conduct the band as he sang, cueing guitar solos,
crescendos and silence.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hodges worked with his percussion like a folkie artist,
making sound effects more than rhythms; Danny McGough played organ
and keyboards quietly and intermittently, like an Expressionist
painter composing a landscape out of disconnected splashes of
color.
</P>
<P>
   And Smokey Hormel, a much stiffer guitarist than Marc Ribot who
played on Waits' last tour in 1988, nonetheless slipped easily into
his role as versatile accompanist and stage sidekick. At its worst
the band's playing seemed learned instead of felt, but that will no
doubt fade as Waits begins a small, rare American tour later this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the show Waits either sat at the piano or hunched
over the microphone (purposely positioned well below his mouth),
with his hands clapping, knees buckling and face twisted in a
knowing smirk. Each song came across like a theater piece without a
set, only Waits' expressive Howlin' Wolf voice, intense stage
persona and lyrics that jumped from Brecht to beatnik to Beefheart
to blues.
</P>
<P>
   Between pieces there was a lot of stand-up comedy. ``I haven't
been here in about 20 years,'' he wryly assured the worshipful
audience. ``But let me just say that there hasn't been a day that's
gone by that I haven't thought of you, collectively as well as
individually.''

FBI AGENTS IDENTIFY ONE VICTIM IN CALIFORNIA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBs byline to add credit)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and VICKIE HADDOCK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BARN, Calif. _ Authorities have identified one of two
charred bodies found in the trunk of a burned-out car in this
mountain hamlet as that of missing sightseer Carole Sund but are
still searching for the missing third person.
</P>
<P>
   Sund's body, burned beyond recognition, was identified through
dental charts, according to Tuolumne County Sheriff Dick Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   A second body found in the trunk was not identified. Officials
said that they may have to use DNA testing to complete the
identification, and that it could take at least several days.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news of the whereabouts of a third member of the
sightseeing trio, who have been missing since Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sund's parents, Francis and Carole Carrington, spoke briefly
Monday after their daughter was identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like a nightmare that you never wake up from,''
said Carole Carrington, dry-eyed but clearly stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, of Eureka, Calif., along with her daughter,
Julie, 15, and Silvina Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend from
Argentina, were last traced by investigators to Cedar Lodge in El
Portal, where they had been staying during a visit to Yosemite
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Their car was found Thursday near here in a wooded area off
Highway 108 and investigators expect that the other body may be
either Julie Sund or Silvina Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could take some time but we feel confident we will get
identification on the second victim,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators said they were shifting the focus of
the investigation to Sonora, Calif., the central location for the
combined task force of federal and local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Monday, the FBI released seven photos,
developed from film found among the evidence near the car, that
show the trio in the days just before they disappeared. The
pictures, taken in Yosemite National Park, show them smiling and
happy as they ice skated, posed in front of a waterfall and hiked
along the Merced River.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent James Maddock, head of the FBI's Sacramento
office, said the time-stamped photographs were from an undeveloped
roll of film found among evidence near the car, but he would not
reveal the exact location. He said investigators decided to keep
other pictures in the roll.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the decision to release the photographs to the
public was made by the families, who hope the pictures may generate
useful clues about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone out there knows something, knows what happened,''
Rogers said. ``We need that person to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sund's badly burned body was identified by the FBI crime lab in
Quantico, Va., using dental charts.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff confirmed that an autopsy had been performed, but he
declined to disclose the cause of her death. Nor would he say when
Sund died or whether the two victims in the trunk were still alive
when the car was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The trio's disappearance prompted a massive search in this
mining country just outside Yosemite National Park. The car was
discovered late last week about three hours north of the park in a
remote wooded area just off Highway 108.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know how they got here,'' Maddock said. ``We
still don't know where the crime occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents are talking again with witnesses who said they saw
the trio shopping and buying gas the next day along Highway 108
near where the car was found.
</P>
<P>
   They were reported missing Feb. 17 _ a day after they failed to
meet Carole Sund's husband, Jens, at San Francisco International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and tourism officials in Sonora, Twain Harte and
Sierra Village have reported seeing the trio in the area on Feb. 16
and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Maddock said authorities have been inundated with
tips about sightings, but that not all can be correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't necessarily believe one eyewitness sighting and not
another,'' Maddock said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which said weeks ago that the three were victims of a
violent crime, has been working on the theory that they were
kidnapped or carjacked outside El Portal late Feb. 15 or early Feb.
16. The FBI requires documentation or corroboration before it
confirms a sighting in a missing persons case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have a confirmed sighting beyond the Cedar
Lodge,'' Maddock said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, authorities moved the car to a hangar at
nearby Columbia Airport, where arson experts from the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were looking for telltale
chemical residues in the vehicle's burned-out shell.
</P>
<P>
   Using relatively new technology, they are looking for
case-breaking clues _ even fingerprints _ from the car, outside
experts told The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The experts believe investigators already know much more than
they are admitting about the crime, including, some say, the
identity of the victim found burned in the trunk with Carole Sund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think they knew the IDs on both days ago,'' said one San
Francisco-based investigator who's handled similar cases. ``My
hunch is they have a good idea who did this and they're trying to
`roll' one of the guys'' by trapping him into revealing
unpublicized details of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   While criminals can destroy a lot of valuable evidence with a
fire, ``there are a lot of guys sitting in jail now because they
made the mistake of thinking they were covering themselves,'' said
Jean Daly, a San Francisco assistant district attorney who
specializes in crimes involving arson.
</P>
<P>
   She and other experts tick off an inventory of evidence that
could be retrieved from a torched car:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fingerprints. While blackening a metal surface often erases
fingerprints, new chemicals make them recoverable in some cases.
Specialists also would check for any areas of the car not damaged
by flames, including the exterior windows, the undersides and
insides of the glove compartment, the inside pages of things like
maps, checkbooks and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Physical evidence like hair, pollen and fibers. Again,
specialists are likely to zero in on pockets not demolished by
flames. Because fires tend to burn upward, floorboards sometimes
still contain clues. And if the fire-starter neglected to leave the
windows down to allow oxygen to feed the fire, flames might have
extinguished themselves in areas like the trunk or even the
interior compartment before they had a chance to do much damage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cause of death. While the FBI is not revealing anything about
the cause of death of either victim, forensic experts may be able
to determine if they were shot or strangled before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   _ How the fire started. Tests for chemicals along a spectrum
will indicate whether the accelerant of the fire was gasoline,
butane or some other fuel.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ NATO is poised to begin air strikes
against Serbia after the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, in
talks with U.S. envoy, refused to agree to a ceasefire in the
province of Kosovo. By Jane Perlez. (Eds.: note dateline and byline
changes.)

<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY-ASSESS (Brussels, Belgium) _ The Yugoslav armed
forces and paramilitary police units that NATO warplanes would
attack to try to stop the fighting in Kosovo are regarded as tough
and well-equipped, and far more powerful than the Bosnian Serb
forces that allied warplanes bombed four years ago. Before allied

HIGH COURT EXPANDS JUDGES' POWER TO MONITOR TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a substantial victory for defendants in product
liability suits, the Supreme Court on Tuesday gave federal judges
new authority to keep expert testimony of questionable reliability
out of the courtroom and away from the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on a decision of six years ago that established
federal judges as powerful monitors of the quality of scientific
evidence presented in their courtrooms, the court said Tuesday that
the approach it endorsed then was not limited to testimony about
purely scientific principles.
</P>
<P>
   Judges were obliged under the federal rules of evidence to play
the same gatekeeping role when it came to testimony based on
technical or other specialized knowledge, Justice Stephen Breyer
wrote for a unanimous court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In fulfilling that obligation, Breyer said, judges should take a
flexible, case-by-case approach, tailored to the potential witness'
experience and field of expertise, whether it be engineering,
economics, handwriting analysis, or any of numerous other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life and the legal cases that it generates are too complex''
for sharp dividing lines between different kinds of expertise, he
said. Further, Breyer said, ``It would prove difficult, if not
impossible, for judges to administer evidentiary rules under which
a gatekeeping obligation depended upon a distinction between
`scientific' knowledge and `technical' or `other specialized'
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower court in this case, reflecting generalized confusion
among the lower federal courts over the scope of the Supreme
Court's 1993 decision in Daubert vs. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,
had ruled that the judge's gatekeeping role was limited to
testimony based on ``the application of scientific principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury itself should be able to appraise the value of expert
testimony that relied on ``skill- or experience-based observation''
instead of scientific principles, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Atlanta, ruled in a dispute over the reliability of
testimony by an expert in tire failure in a lawsuit growing out of
an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   By overturning the 11th circuit's limited view of the Daubert
precedent and finding the tire expert's testimony inadmissible, the
court Tuesday added an important weapon to the arsenal of critics
of the civil justice system who have complained that ``junk
science'' has been finding its way into too many courtrooms and
distorting the deliberations of unsophisticated jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Kumho Tire Co. vs. Carmichael, No. 97-1709, attracted
briefs from a variety of business groups urging the court to make
it clear that the judge's role was an expansive one. Groups
representing trial lawyers and consumers, on the other hand, urged
the court not to take from juries their historic function of
evaluating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The case Tuesday was a lawsuit brought by a family whose Ford
minivan was involved in a single-car accident on Interstate 65 in
Baldwin County, Ala. Seven people in the minivan were injured and
one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the vehicle's tires had blown out, and the plaintiffs,
suing the tire manufacturer, wanted to present testimony by an
expert in tire failures to prove that the accident was due to a
manufacturing defect rather than wear or poor maintenance of the
tire, which was bald in spots and had imperfect repairs of two
punctures.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Mobile, regarding the proposed
testimony as technical rather than scientific, nonetheless applied
the approach of the Daubert decision. Finding the expert's
analytical methods insufficiently reliable, the court excluded the
testimony and granted summary judgment to the tire company.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing that ruling, the 11th circuit said the trial court
should not have applied the Supreme Court's guidelines in the
Daubert decision for evaluating scientific testimony. These factors
were: whether the expert's theory or technique had been tested;
whether it had been subjected to peer review and publication;
whether there was a high ``known or potential rate of error'' in
the method, and whether the theory or technique enjoyed ``general
acceptance'' within a ``relevant scientific community.''
</P>
<P>
   In his decision Tuesday, Breyer said a trial judge could pose
any or all of those questions, as circumstances warranted. The
court then went on to apply the analysis to the tire expert's
proposed testimony, concluding that the district judge had properly
exercised his discretion to exclude it.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, while agreeing with the court's
overall approach to the issues, dissented from the portion of the
decision that applied the analysis to the case at hand. The appeals
court was in a better position to review the record and come to a
final judgment in the case, he said.

JAPAN FIRES WARNING SHOTS AT SUSPICIOUS BOATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese patrol boats, warships and aircraft intercepted
two suspicious boats with false markings on Tuesday and later fired
warning shots in an attempt to force them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 46 years that Japan had fired warning
shots at sea and the first time since World War II that Japan had
sent destroyers to chase suspicious vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi convened an emergency meeting of
crucial Cabinet officials at his house overnight, and Japan invoked
its ``self-defense law'' to try to capture the vessels on the high
seas.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time the law had been used in such a
situation, and it underscored the sense of crisis here.
</P>
<P>
   One mysterious vessel slipped away during the night. Japanese
warships and planes continued to pursue the other early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no proof of where the ships came from. But Japanese
government officials clearly suspect North Korea of the
infiltration. The chief of the defense agency, Hosei Norota, was
quoted in Japanese press reports as having said the main aim of the
pursuit was to prevent the two ships from returning to North Korea,
although he later added that he could not be sure that they were
North Korean.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese response to the incident was startling, for foreign
boats often sneak into Japanese waters to fish or drop off smuggled
cargoes or illegal aliens without prompting nearly such a serious
response. So the reaction strongly suggested that Japanese
officials had intelligence about the vessels that they were not
sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The incident underscores Japan's increasing assertiveness in
security affairs and may complicate relations between the West and
North Korea. Japan is an essential partner in a consortium that is
providing energy to North Korea in exchange for North Korea's
freezing its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Japan could back out of the consortium _ and thus create major
problems for the United States and South Korea _ if it feels that
it has been threatened by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the whole episode was mysterious. The Japanese
Maritime Safety Agency, roughly the equivalent of the U.S. Coast
Guard, said it spotted one ship on Tuesday morning 28 miles east of
the Noto Peninsula in central Japan, on the side facing the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Then, officials said, the Maritime Self-Defense Forces
dispatched a destroyer, the first time that it had done so, and the
second vessel was found. The authorities did not explain why they
felt compelled to dispatch destroyers to investigate or what they
found mysterious about the ships.
</P>
<P>
   The vessels were about 100 feet long and bore the names of real
Japanese fishing boats. Transport Minister Jiro Kawasaki told
reporters that one boat used the name of a vessel that was sailing
elsewhere and that the other used the name of a boat that was no
longer operating.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials also dispatched three destroyers and an
airplane to track the ships, and Maritime Safety Agency patrol
boats joined the chase. The patrol boats fired more than 1,200
rounds of warning shots from machine guns on two occasions on
Tuesday night, more than 100 miles from Sado Island.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Japan had fired warning shots at sea since
1953, when a patrol boat fired off the bow of a Soviet spy ship
near the northern island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
   The warning shots were intended to force the two boats to stop
for boarding. But they continued at a very high speed that
suggested they had been fitted for military purposes rather than
fishing. Film taken by Japanese aircraft showed no sign of fishing
equipment and no people on deck.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We started firing shots as the ships ignored orders to stop,
and we are continuing fire,'' a senior Maritime Safety Agency
official, Kazutami Sugihara, said at a news conference, according
to Agence France-Presse. ``It is unthinkable that fishing boats can
move at such speed, and we believe they have been modified.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is periodically accused of infiltrating South Korean
waters. In December, South Korean naval vessels sank a North Korean
semisubmersible boat that Seoul said was being used to drop off or
pick up commandos.
</P>
<P>
   Similar charges have been made, more rarely, about North Korean
vessels' sneaking into Japanese waters. Japanese intelligence
officials say North Korean vessels have occasionally picked up
kidnapped Japanese citizens and smuggled them to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials also say that they monitor hundreds of radio
transmissions each week that they believe are instructions from
North Korea to agents in Japan, but that they cannot break the
codes.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea denies that it infiltrates the waters of other
countries. But it has not commented on the new incident.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials are trying to negotiate through Parliament a
set of military guidelines that would clarify how they can join the
United States in confronting any security crisis in the region. An
incident like the new one may help Obuchi make the case that swift
passage of the guidelines is essential to deal with crises before
they arise.

FREEMAN HOPES TV MOVIE `MUTINY' CHANGES HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Morgan Freeman loves history.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a country, we don't really know a great deal about
ourselves,'' said the actor, who has starred in such historical
dramas as ``Glory'' and ``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Freeman didn't know much about the worst stateside
disaster of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy took place July 17, 1944, when a ship loaded with
ammunition exploded at Port Chicago in San Francisco Bay, instantly
killing 320 naval personnel, most of them African-American sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, like Freeman, you were only slightly aware of the
catastrophe or its aftermath. The event, which injured an
additional 390 and leveled a nearby town, was quickly hushed up and
rarely discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was a massive explosion somewhere in the U.S.
during World War II,'' Freeman said. ``I didn't know Port Chicago
was in California. Movies like `Glory' and `Amistad' tell of
moments in American history that were hidden. History buffs know
about these stories, but the general public knows nothing. I
strongly believe you must know your history in order to know
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaster, followed by the court-martial of 50 sailors, is
the subject of ``Mutiny,'' an NBC movie produced by Freeman's
company airing Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before the nighttime explosion, sailors had complained about
long hours and unsafe conditions for handling munitions _ a task
for which they were untrained. Afterward, they were assigned the
same duty at another Navy base. Fearing the same fate that befell
their comrades, 50 sailors refused their assignments and were
charged with mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   After only 80 minutes of deliberation by a specially convened
military court, the men were found guilty and sentenced to hard
labor. All were dishonorably discharged from the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Although a memorial to those lost in the disaster today stands
on the waterfront of Port Chicago, now known as the Concord Naval
Weapons Station, Freeman and the elderly survivors of the tragedy
hope for an act of Congress to exonerate those who were convicted
despite evidence that racism played a hand in both the explosion
and the dishonorable discharges. So far, there has been no response
from President Clinton. Tuesday, California Congressman George
Miller (D-Concord) lined up a Bay area law firm to try and get the
record changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things many people are going to be exposed to for
the first time (when watching `Mutiny') is seeing Negro seamen
doing the work they were doing _ that's going to be a big
surprise,'' said real-life survivor and Toronto resident Robert
Routh Jr., who was blinded in the home-front explosion but did not
take part in the mutiny. ``Historically, no one really knows the
actual good and great contribution that was made by the kind of
work that came out of Port Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Oscar nominee Freeman served as co-executive producer
through his 2-year-old film and television company, Revelations
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   David Ramsey, Michael Jai White and Duane Martin portray some of
the sailors involved, although no actual names were used for any
characters except that of Thurgood Marshall (Joe Morton).
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said he was surprised to learn of the support the
court-martialed sailors received from Marshall, then of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and
later a Supreme Court justice. Marshall campaigned to have the
dishonorable discharges reversed, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just know what we've been told in the history books. Nobody
knows anything about this incident or black involvement in the war,
especially people who've studied Warld War II,'' said Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Mutiny'' reveals a wartime Navy as segregated as the
deep South of that era, a period Freeman is familiar with. He sees
the Port Chicago explosion as a turning point for race relations in
the Navy and increased safety in munitions loading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Mississippi in a divided society,'' he explained.
``That made me who I am today. I didn't grow up in a society that
told me one thing and showed me another.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Mutiny,'' Freeman visited filming locations and took part
in preproduction, including actor auditions for the part of Vernon
Nettles (Ramsey), an ambitious young man who looked forward to
fighting for his country but joins with the others in protest
against their dangerous assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big part of African-American history I didn't know
anything about which was a big attraction to me,'' Ramsey said.
``There's a real human element to the story. These were men with
great honor and dignity who went to war for this country. At a
minimum, I think the case should be reopened. But it's going to
take more than a TV movie to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 15 survivors of the Port Chicago court-martial
still alive, most of whom have changed their names out of shame.
Among those found by the producers of ``Mutiny'' was Carl Tuggle,
who was convicted and sent to the brig for 30 days before being
shipped overseas on cleanup duty and eventually released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to know that things happened during World
War II that the government is not revealing to the public, and that
case out there in Port Chicago, Calif., is a good example,'' said
Tuggle, who lives in Cincinnati and is in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk down the street and ask the average person who lived
during that period, and they'll say they don't know anything about
it ... because the government didn't want anyone to know anything
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who recently finished shooting his part in the
forthcoming film by Neil LaBute (director of 1997's ``In the
Company of Men''), said he wants future Revelations projects to
have some social significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to make movies that would inform as well as
entertain,'' he said, ``because so much of our history is taught
through the entertainment medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Also part of Freeman's company is Lori McCreary, who
co-executive produced ``Mutiny.'' A native of Concord, where the
explosion took place, McCreary recalls hearing stories of the Port
Chicago catastrophe as she was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing all the details, I had heard a lot about it,'' she
said. ``The six survivors who came to the set _ I thought they'd be
bitter. But they have so much reverence and joy for the armed
forces still. They showed up the day we were shooting the funeral
scene for all those killed. I'd be talking to these guys, and as
soon as `Taps' started playing, they took off their hats and stood
at attention and paid their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're quite remarkable men.'' &QL;

OIL COALITION AGREES TO SLASH CRUDE PRODUCTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ A group representing most of the world's
biggest oil-producing nations formally agreed Tuesday to slash
crude production by 2.1 million barrels a day in a concerted effort
to boost world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But whether this 14-nation coalition of OPEC and nonaffiliated
oil producers spanning five continents can hold together long
enough to rescue its struggling economies remains an open question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good deal,'' said Mehdi Varzi, director of
research for Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd. in London. ``This is
a good start. We just don't know how long compliance will go.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil markets, which had been expecting just such a 2.1
million-barrel-cut, were less congratulatory Tuesday. Oil prices,
which had risen strongly ahead of the meeting, fell 23 cents to
close at $15.51 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have followed crude upward in recent weeks,
tracking the climb of crude oil prices. The Department of Energy
reported earlier this week that the national average price of a
gallon of regular gasoline was $1.02. That's up about 10 cents a
gallon from where prices stood about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prices began to rise in late February after Tosco Corp. shut
down its Avon refinery in Martinez, Calif., due to an explosion
there that killed four people.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers expect gasoline prices to continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   George Gaspar, an analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co. in
Milwaukee, expects additional increases of as much as 10 cents a
gallon. He said the cuts could continue to buoy gasoline prices
into the fall when prices typically decrease slightly as colder
weather makes driving less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   While the oil markets reacted skeptically, the oil ministers did
all they could to make this major reduction seem like routine
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ in a
20-minute session Libyan Oil Minister Abdalla Salem El-Badri
described as ``the shortest meeting in history'' _ ratified an
agreement in which 10 of the group's 11 members will cut their oil
production by 1.7 million barrels a day over the next year. That
represents a 7 percent reduction in those members' daily output.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed,'' Badri said, adding the meeting was marked
by a ``good atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other, non-OPEC producers _ Mexico, Norway, Russia and Oman
_ also promised to slow their crude production by another 388,000
barrels a day. Together, the 2.1 million-barrel-cut should trim
world production by about 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only OPEC member Iraq, whose oil exports are controlled by
United Nations sanctions, was given the go-ahead to continue
expanding production.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. sanctions permit Iraq to sell up to $5.2 billion of oil
every six months to purchase food and medicine, but because of
capacity constraints, Baghdad has been unable to produce even that
much.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Rasheed said Tuesday that his country
plans to kick up production by about 300,000 barrels to 3 million
barrels a day by the end of the year, a level that _ depending on
how prices react _ would likely approach the U.N.-imposed cap.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC and non-OPEC producers rubber-stamped an accord reached
earlier this month at The Hague and orchestrated by the cartel's
powerhouse Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spirit of cohesion, solidarity and responsibility has
prevailed amongst us, and oil exporters _ from both within and
outside OPEC _ have reached a decision, which, I believe, goes
beyond expectations,'' declared Algerian Oil Minister Youcef
Yousfi, the current OPEC president.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez Araque said the meeting
had restored the group's ``spirit of brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood Tuesday was in contrast to the conclusion of OPEC's
last meeting, when the member-states could reach reach no consensus
on how to proceed and oil prices responded by plunging to historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
   While oil prices have recovered this month, they are still short
of the goals set by the OPEC countries, which are shooting for
prices around $20 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   In London, North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery in May fell 15
cents to $13.73 per barrel. While that's up from less than $10 a
barrel in February, it's not much better than last year's average
$13.30 _ a 22-year low, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks of gasoline have been declining and continued to do
so last week, according to figures released late Tuesday by the
American Petroleum Institute. The trade group said gasoline
inventories fell by 4.7 million barrels to 221 million barrels,
while crude oil stocks rose by 823,000 barrels last week to nearly
338 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Varzi believes the next few months will be critical for the
coalition members to demonstrate they are serious about making
substantial cuts. Otherwise, oil prices could tank once again.
</P>
<P>
   Few oil analysts believe the 14 nations will actually cut
production by a full 2.1 million barrels. But a sustained reduction
of just 1 million barrels a day would give prices a substantial
boost, analysts say, while a compliance rate of 75 percent would
push prices up somewhere in the $17 to $20 range by the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Varzi argues the current accord is good for an extra $1 or $2 to
the price of crude, if the parties can demonstrate their commitment
to the agreement over the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement Tuesday is the third time in a year OPEC and
nonaffiliated producers have teamed up to cut production. Mexico
has been a key player in all three agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But Jorge Chavez Presa, Mexico's deputy energy minister, said
Tuesday the world is not seeing the creation of some kind of
neo-OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are special circumstances,'' Chavez said. ``We are an
independent producer, and as long as we see the need to take action
we will do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The often-quarrelsome OPEC members had little trouble reaching
an agreement Tuesday because the group's two largest members and
chief rivals _ Saudi Arabia and Iran _ had already worked out their
differences ahead of time. Saudi Arabia made a key concession,
agreeing to drop below its production floor of 8 million barrels a
day for the first time since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the sacred floor of 8 million or displeasing Iran,''
noted Nawaf Obaid, a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis also accepted an Iranian demand that Tehran be
allowed to calculate Iran's cuts assuming production based on
Iran's stated production, which is 300,000 barrels a day higher
than the Saudi's estimate of the country's output.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian delegation, which typically arrives days ahead of an
OPEC meeting for the usual series of back-and-forth negotiations,
arrived in Vienna only a few hours before the start.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC producers also have good reason to find common ground,
since the low crude prices have ravaged their national budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's Rodriguez said his government had budgeted spending
this year assuming a price of $9 a barrel for Venezuelan crude. But
by mid-February, Venezuela was fetching only an average $7.35 a
barrel for its crude, an 18 percent shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Since The Hague announcement was reached, Venezuela's prices
have risen, and Caracas now estimates its oil will average about
$9.15 a barrel this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; I's like, you know, ``Seinfeld'' for the left coast.
Instead of Kramer, Jerry, George and Elaine, ``It's Like, You Know
...,'' the new ABC series premiering tonight, has three guys and
two girls sitting around doing nothing in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it will have half the success of ``Seinfeld'' _
especially in the heartland _ is the big question. (ABC reportedly
wasn't quite sure what it had on its hands; hence it's being aired
as a midseason replacement.) But if it fails, audiences will be
missing one of the more offbeat and just plain funny series to come
along on network television in a while.
</P>
<P>
   The resemblance to ``Seinfeld'' is not a coincidence. ``It's
Like'' was created by Peter Mehlman, a veteran writer/producer of
the long-running series. But ``It's Like'' is a lot more than a
knockoff. It takes L.A. on its own weird, seductive terms and
affectionately lampoons it.
</P>
<P>
   As Robbie (Steven Eckholdt), a transplanted East Coaster who has
made a fortune with his pay-per-view scheme for the Jewish High
Holy Days called ``Pay Per Jew,'' says to his friend Arthur (Chris
Eigeman), a New Yorker who has come out to LaLa Land to write a
book called ``Living in Los Angeles _ How Can You Stand It?'':
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be like everyone else, talking about how you
hate L.A. ... how the people are so dumb, so plastic, so silicon,
how nothing is open late, how you have to drive to take a walk, the
murder trials last two years, the marriages last two months, the
houses are ugly, the clothes are loud, the bagels are doughy, the
pizza sucks. Then you throw in the earthquakes, aftershocks,
mudslides, road rage, race riots, guns, tasers, pepper spray. And
just as your head's about to explode, one warm afternoon you play
softball and you think to yourself, `My God, it's January.' The
next day you wake up, and it's two years later. You sold out every
belief you held sacred, and you don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   If the first three episodes of ``It's Like, You Know ...'' are
any indication, Mehlman and his writers are on the way to taking
shallowness to new _ and hilarious _ depths. Along the way,
conversations touch on such hot topics as why the letter Q doesn't
come at the end of the alphabet; would you rather be on the corner
of Florence and Normandie when the riots broke out or on Normandy
Beach during D-Day; and why Elliot Gould was driving a Honda.
</P>
<P>
   The second show takes place almost entirely in Robbie's house,
where the cast spends an afternoon watching a live freeway chase.
(It's like an L.A. version of a ``snow day.'') When Arthur
protests, Robbie explains that ``the entire city is going to sit
around like idiots watching the car chase.'' And they do,
second-guessing the driver's moves and waiting for something to
happen in their wacky sunshine variation of Luis Bunuel's ``The
Exterminating Angel.'' Later, Arthur laments, ``Someday I'll look
back on this day and not remember any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Seinfeld'' was about nothing, ``It's Like, You Know ...''
is about the nuance of nothing, but it also seems to be willing to
let its characters have a bit more self-awareness than Jerry and
the crew ever had.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``It's Like'' is top flight. Eigeman, who made his
mark in Whit Stillman's films ``Metropolitan,'' ``Barcelona'' and
``The Last Days of Disco,'' is suitably cranky. Eckholdt
marvelously glides between being shallow and knowing that he is.
</P>
<P>
   The other regulars include Evan Handler who plays Shrug, a
trust-fund rich and insecure native Angeleno; A.J. Langer, who was
on ``My So-Called Life'' as a masseuse/process server; and, in a
``Larry Sanders''-esque inspired bit of casting, Jennifer Grey of
``Dirty Dancing'' fame as herself _ after a nose job.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Grey really did have a nose job to get more roles. Now
she's playing a fictional version of herself _ and doing a darn
good job of it, too. And it's that kind of loopiness that
television needs more of. Let's hope ``It's Like, You Know ...''
gets the chance to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``The Norm Show,'' which is like, you know,
simply shallow. Also premiering tonight, it stars ``Saturday Night
Live'' alum Norm Macdonald as a former hockey player working out a
community-service sentence as a social worker. The premise is built
for cheap laughs but rarely delivers, although just when you're
nodding off, Macdonald comes up with a zinger. But it's not enough
to keep you tuning in. In the meantime, ``Norm'' wastes the talents
of Emmy winner Laurie Metcalf in a thankless role.!end! &QL;

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The suburb was deserted. Washing flapped
on clotheslines, cars were parked outside the houses, but there
were no people. Four figures, two women and two children carrying
bundles and bags, were hurrying up the hill away from the houses.
</P>
<P>
   They started to run as a black jeep bumped along the muddy track
between the houses. The residents were fleeing what they thought
was a police jeep. They had cause to fear.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Serbian police raided the ethnic Albanian
suburb, on the southern edge of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial
capital. The neighborhood is a quiet cluster of houses on a
hillside, near the town hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrived at 7 p.m. in three or four armored jeeps with
mounted machine guns and an armored personnel carrier. They
announced their arrival with a burst of machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparently unprovoked action, they raided houses, beat
people and smashed cars, windows and household goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people saw the violence, they panicked and started to
run,'' said Hilmi Tahiri, the local representative of the ethnic
Albanian political party, the Democratic League of Kosovo. Within
minutes the suburbs' 500 houses had emptied.
</P>
<P>
   The panic is just one sign of the increased tension in the city.
Both Serbs and ethnic Albanians are frightened as the violence of
the war in the countryside encroaches on the city and NATO air
strikes appear imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police operation on Monday was followed by attacks
on two ethnic Albanian cafes in the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In one attack, a gunman sprayed more than 30 bullets into the
glass-fronted Cafe Magic, on a central street. One person, a
well-known actress, was killed and several people were wounded. On
Tuesday children peered through the punctured windows in curious
horror. Glasses of beer stood half full on the tables, and blood
stained the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, at the Cafe Koha, someone wrenched open the
door and threw in an explosive. The blast killed one person and
injured two, the force of it blowing out the door and buckling the
metal grills over the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Police reacted instantly and aggressively, setting up roadblocks
and checking people at gunpoint. Clearly on edge, police officers
opened fire on a 14-year-old boy who tried to run away from a
roadblock. The youth was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Residents took no chances Tuesday. Restaurants, shops and cafes
were closed by 5 p.m., and by the time darkness fell, the streets
were deserted except for police officers. Both Albanians and Serbs
said they feared the violence would only worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today nowhere is safe,'' said an Albanian housewife who would
give her name only as Hajrija. She said her sister lived downtown,
near the cafe that was sprayed with bullets. ``She is so afraid,''
Hajrija said of her sister. ``She has young children. She keeps
calling me and crying on the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from such random attacks, the Albanians fear violence from
police and from armed Serbian civilians. They say NATO air strikes
could bring retaliatory attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO bombs, they will have us all in their hand,'' said a
63-year-old pensioner named Halil, one of the few people who
refused to leave the hospital suburb. ``However it started, the
situation is spinning out of control. Every situation has a final
line and things are ready for that line to be crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not flee. ``I have nowhere else to go,'' he
said. ``The worst that they can do is kill me, but better that it
happens in your own house than in a field or in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs in Kosovo, who constitute only 10 per cent of the
population and who often speak out against the West and NATO with
aggressive passion, muted their anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners attending a funeral for one of four policemen killed on
Sunday in an ambush in central Pristina said they feared more
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will get worse and worse, even if we hope conditions will
get better,'' said Miodrag Mitic, one of the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues of the dead officer said they saw no way out of the
situation. ``It has now become a usual thing to shoot at
policemen,'' said a senior colleague. He had lost six men in just
two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see a way out,'' he added with a heavy sigh. ``It is
politics, something others decide.''
</P>
<P>
   As mourners passed behind the coffin through Lapje Selo, where
the funeral was held, Serbian MiG fighter jets roared overhead,
taking off from the nearby airport and wheeling away through the
sky. A heavy explosion sounded in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder to the quiet Serbian village, which has been
largely untouched by the year-long conflict, that the war is in
full progress.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy shelling continued around Poljance, 25 miles northwest of
Pristina, as Serbian forces pushed westward against positions above
the road occupied by Albanian rebels. There was also activity near
Podujevo, north of Pristina, where houses in at least one village
were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   In Lapje Selo, Serbs said they feared the consequences of NATO
strikes more than the actual bombs and spoke of the possibility of
losing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course NATO is more powerful than us,'' Mitic said. ``We
are only a small country.'' He said air strikes would herald the
end of Serbs' lives in Kosovo because the Albanians, and in
particular rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army, would not show
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to leave,'' he said. ``If the government cannot
protect us here, we may have to go.''

BRITISH TRUCKING COMPANIES MOVE AGAINST HIGHER COSTS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLE OF SHEPPEY, England _ When European nations hang out their
shingles to attract foreign investors, Britain's appeal runs
something like this: come to Britain for low labor costs, low
taxes, low overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wood doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, a trucker based on this marshy island at the mouth of the
River Thames, runs 20 rigs carrying construction equipment the
length and breadth of Britain. And, when the government announced a
10 percent rise in the price of diesel fuel and a 50 percent
increase in some truckers' license fees in its annual budget this
month, Wood decided it was time to move, legally at least.
</P>
<P>
   So, Wood plans to set up a subsidiary in the Netherlands _ RW
Haulage International _ where his trucks will be licensed as Dutch
trucks. As European Union vehicles, they will have the same access
to British roads as any other European truck.
</P>
<P>
   But, since the Netherlands, like the rest of continental Europe,
has much lower license fees than Britain _ roughly $1,100 per
vehicle in the Netherlands, compared with $9,000 in Britain _ Wood
expects to save $160,000 annually for his $5-million-a-year
business. Despite the Dutch registry, he will continue to pay
relatively low British wages and British taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Others are pondering similar calculations. After this month's
budget, some 1,500 haulers called the Road Haulage Association,
which represents about one third of Britain's haulage companies, to
inquire about the technicalities of incorporating in continental
Europe, said Steve Williams, a representative of the association.
</P>
<P>
   One of Britain's biggest operators, Eddie Stobart, whose fleet
comprises 800 trucks each bearing a different woman's name, is
thinking about registering 200 of his rigs in Luxembourg, and ``may
rename them Helga or Nicole,'' a spokeswoman for him said.
</P>
<P>
   So incensed are Britain's truckers that hundreds of them,
including Wood, clogged central London with their rigs Tuesday in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   By moving abroad, the haulers will be reversing a trend of
continental companies seeking tax-breaks in Britain, opening one of
the first chinks in Britain's argument that, alone among Europe's
major economies, it is a haven from high costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that haulage is now becoming a very European
business,'' Williams said. ``So European haulers can come in here
and work without paying the same costs as we do. It's not a very
level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the decision by Wood, 48, and others to `'flag out''
their vehicles in foreign lands is the latest sign of unease among
Britons that, while their government tells them direct taxes are
falling, a combination of indirect taxes and retailers' margins
means they pay more for fuel, cars, computers, cigarettes, liquor
and many other goods than anyone else in Europe or the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   British truckers now pay the highest fuel and license fees in
Europe _ over $5 a gallon for diesel fuel _ twice what it costs in
Luxembourg _ up to $9,000 a year to license a single 40-ton,
five-axle rig, 17 times the cost in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Since a European Union directive in 1998, moreover, all European
Union road haulers have been permitted to carry loads not simply
into and out of each other's countries but also to carry loads
internally. Consequently, European trucking companies are rolling
into Britain and offering to haul goods at one third Wood's price.
</P>
<P>
   A German truck, for instance, powered by cheap diesel fuel
purchased in Belgium or France before crossing the Channel, can
pick up a load of steel in Sheffield and drop it off in London _ a
practice that was once banned _ without paying British license
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The British authorities, though, contend that the battle is
really not about competitiveness but cleanliness, pitting pounds
and pennies against environmental policies intended to meet
Britain's international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The price rises on pollutants like diesel fuel, said Vickie
Sheriff, a spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment,
Transport and Regions, are offset by lower prices for cleaner fuels
like low-sulfur diesel and unleaded gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle is that the polluter pays,'' she said. Trucks
with six axles, similarly, qualify for much lower license fees than
five-axle rigs because they do less damage to the highways.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the Road Haulage Association, Britain's 65,000
haulage businesses employ 500,000 drivers and a similar number of
ancillary staff, carry 1.65 billion tons of goods a year _
four-fifths of all domestic freight _ and contribute over $7.4
billion of the $49.5 billion the government collects in excise and
fuel taxes and duties. The latest price increases, Williams said,
will jeopardize 50,000 of those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, jobs are cheaper in Britain than in much of
continental Europe because hourly wages are generally lower, and
Britain does not insist on the same levels of social spending,
personal taxes or corporate taxes. Indeed, John Reid, the transport
minister, said, ``Britain is not only cheaper than our major
European rivals when it comes to road transport, but comes out
almost on top of the list worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haulers who are thinking of relocating to other European
countries should consider these facts very carefully before making
a decision,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   What the authorities are not considering, Wood argues, is that
continental European haulers operating in Britain ``have already
made their profit by the time they arrive'' with a tankful of cheap
diesel fuel. They offer internal haulage in Britain at a discount
rather than return home empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally flagging-out was meant as a threat,'' Williams
said, ``but now it's becoming a reality because so many people have
had problems with the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Wood put it, ``I'd rather go to Holland than go out of
business.''

 &HT;    Life is indeed beautiful when Scoonie's involved
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ Jim O'Brien watched the Oscars on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to a lot of movies,'' the Ohio State basketball coach
said.
</P>
<P>
   By going to the movies, most coaches mean they go to their
offices and watch movies of the next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, real movies,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign film, Life is Beautiful, was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best movies of all time,'' O'B said, and he
immediately recognized the irony _ life is beautiful for a coach
going to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons O'B and the O'Buckeyes are heading to
St. Petersburg this week is the remarkable relationship between the
guards, Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd.
</P>
<P>
   A season ago, most OSU basketball games were The Michael Redd
Show with the other guys _ his ``staff,'' as it were _ adjusting
the microphones, fixing the lights, focusing the cameras. Redd took
1 of every 3 shots, led the Buckeyes in scoring and was named the
Big Ten Freshman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   But the season was covered with Redd ink: The Buckeyes went
8-22. Life wasn't beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Scoonie.
</P>
<P>
   Redd knew he was going to lose shots (down from 18 a game to
15.5) and points (down from 21.9 to 19.7). What he didn't know is
that he was going to be shunted into the background by a media that
can't get enough Scoonie.
</P>
<P>
   Like the radio disc jockey who locks himself in the control room
and plays Stairway to Heaven nonstop for a month, coverage of the
Buckeyes has tended to be All Scoonie All the Time.
</P>
<P>
   And with cause. In Ohio, Scoonie is Babe Ruth. You market a
Scoonie doll right now, you buy an island in the Caribbean next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Why this didn't cause friction is still an open question. But it
hasn't, and it's as simple to quantify as watching them play
together. The chemistry between these two strong personalities is
at the core of OSU's turnaround from Final Breath to Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen dozens of teams where one ball isn't enough;
where two stars work against each other like pit bulls in a dog
fight.
</P>
<P>
   This team avoided that abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happened,'' O'Brien said, denying any credit.
``Scoonie showed up, and within a couple of days, all the guys
welcomed him with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no animosity,'' Redd said. ``You want the best
players to come in because that makes you better.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy to say. Not as easy to enact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me out last year when he wasn't playing,'' Redd
said. ``He kept telling me, 'Keep your head up. You're playing
well.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Redd's English teachers will be thrilled. I didn't touch up the
quote. He actually said, ``playing well,'' not ``playing good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship blossomed from the very start,'' Scoonie
said. ``Why should he get mad at me if I'm here to help out?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, because it's happened so many times at so many places. He
had the spotlight; you took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down and talked,'' Scoonie said. ``We talk all the
time. I know this: If I was Big Ten Freshman of the Year and scored
21 a game but finished 8-22, I would want someone to help me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Logically, yes. But this is basketball, where jealousies and
egos ripping teams apart are as common as backdoor cuts in a
Princeton scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize you can't do it all,'' Redd said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I said, but you're 19. Nineteen-year-olds aren't supposed
to understand that.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Redd looked at me and laughed. ``Scoring means nothing
to me,'' he said. ``I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He is. They are. And life is beautiful.

 &HT;    Ohio State's success a team effort
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ Guards Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd get all the ink
as Ohio State's scoring stars. But their supporting cast deserves
equal credit for the team's improbable climb into the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Ken Johnson, Jason Singleton, Brian Brown and George
Reese have been invaluable in the NCAA tournament. And as their
confidence builds with each victory, their game only seems to get
better. Some highlights of their contributions:
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, OSU's 6-11 junior center, had seven blocks and 12
points in the Bucks 77-74 victory against St. John's in last
Saturday's regional final. St. John's coach Mike Jarvis called
Johnson ``the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton, a 6-7 power forward, contributed 13 points vs. the
Red Storm _ his highest point total in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve forward Reese grabbed a career-high 15 rebounds in OSU's
second-round victory over Detroit. Freshman guard Brown was 3-for-3
from 3-point range in that same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a collection of guys that do a couple things pretty
well but have some limitations,'' OSU coach Jim O'Brien said.
``When you have some limitations, you really have to have guys that
understand what their roles are. And all of these kids have
accepted (them).''
</P>
<P>
   They've been able to do that, in large part, because ``this is
an ego-less collection of guys,'' O'Brien said. They understand
Penn and Redd are the ``marquee'' players.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien points to Singleton, a poor perimeter shooter, and
sophomore forward Jon Sanderson, a starter yanked from the lineup
in the NCAA tournament, as two players who have willingly
acceptedlesser roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason Singleton understands his role as well as anybody I ever
coached,'' O'Brien said. ``Have you seen Jason take a lot of
perimeter jump shots?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Jon Sanderson,'' O'Brien continued. ``He starts the whole
year and he finally gets a chance to get into his first NCAA game
and then I tell him, 'You're not starting.' And his response is:
'OK fine.' Instead of complaining, he wants to see how he can do
(his bench role) a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a wonderful group of guys to coach. They are
very receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   By accepting their roles, the players have clicked. Team
chemistry has never been better, they say. Jealousy is
non-existent. Everybody just wants to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken has to block shots, rebound. Jason has to get on the
fastbreak and finish, rebound, play great defense,'' Sanderson
said. ``Brian Brown handles the ball and distributes the ball.
Everyone has their roles and everyone seems pretty happy with it.
As long as we're winning, that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his new role as a reserve, Sanderson said: ``If I have to
come off the bench and contribute in that regard, that's definitely
fine with me. I'm just extremely grateful to be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien admits it's been an easier sell with the Buckeyes 27-8
and Final Four-bound, instead of 8-22, like last season. He said he
would love to coach a team comprised of several high school
All-Americans, such as the one Duke has now. (Who wouldn't?) But
O'Brien wouldn't trade this Ohio State squad for any other one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special group,'' he said.

TEXAS PANEL APPROVES PLAN OFFERING ORGANS TO IN-STATE PATIENTS
FIRST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Organs recovered in Texas would be offered to
in-state patients first and the statewide organ distribution system
revamped under a bill approved Tuesday by a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is about ensuring that decisions about organ
allocation and availability are made by patients and medical
professionals at the local level, not by federal bureaucrats in
Washington,'' said state Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Galena Park, author
of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos' Senate Bill 862 is part of a trend among states toward
crafting their own alternatives to new federal guidelines for organ
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved by the Senate Health Services Committee, will
head to the Senate after members do some more work shoring up its
provisions, said state Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, committee
chair.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson amended Gallegos' bill to include a measure establishing
a single, statewide organ donor list. If enacted, the list would
replace a current distribution system in Texas that is based on
three regional lists.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, donated organs in Texas are offered first to patients
served by the bank that collected them. If there is no match, the
organs are shared regionally and then nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government last year announced new transplant
regulations to take effect Oct. 1. Generally, the guidelines call
for sharing organs nationally, with the sickest patients receiving
the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos' plan has divided those in the field of organ donation
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is backed by several prominent transplant surgeons
in The Texas Medical Center in Houston, in addition to Houston's
LifeGift Organ Donation Center and many transplant recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the plan are also gathering steam _ hoping to
head off Senate approval of the bill, and a companion measure in
the House filed by state Rep. Kyle Janek, R-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Silvestri, media services manager with the Dallas-based
Southwest Transplant Alliance, called the Texas-first plan
``selfish and provincial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a state's rights issue, this is a human rights
issue,'' Silvestri said. ``This is a reactionary plan to the new
federal guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   A better approach would be to direct organs to those who need
them most, regardless of what state the organs were collected in,
bill opponents said. Medical advances in organ preservation have
made it possible to send them farther distances to meet critical
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Creech, a heart transplant recipient from Houston, said he
supports the bill because it would create a more equitable system.
Creech said the federal guidelines would increase Texans' waiting
time for many organs and increase the costs associated with
exporting organs great distances.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos disputed claims his bill amounts to ``hoarding'' organs
for Texans, noting the state would continue to share with others as
it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, those associated with the organ transplant field
agreed the biggest problem in Texas and the nation is the shortage
of donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Texas exported 222 organs to other states, according
to Gallegos, and received 77 from elsewhere. There are an estimated
3,300 Texans currently awaiting organ transplants. Last year, about
1,600 organs were donated in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos' bill, if enacted, would include patients from other
states who come to Texas for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Other states that have taken steps to protect their organ
supplies from export are Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and
Wisconsin. Gallegos said the Texas bill would take into
consideration the concerns expressed by opponents of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there is a great deal of debate about what is best
for Texas,'' Gallegos said. ``I am anxious to work with my
colleagues in the Senate and the House, as well as Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry and organ transplantation professionals, to figure out
compromise language that resolves this issue to everyone's
satisfaction.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Clinton administration put shoring up
Social Security at the top of the national agenda early last year,
White House officials said the first order of business was to make
it politically safe to have a frank debate about the options.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, the two parties have an array of choices
before them, and from the White House to the Capitol to the scores
of research and lobbying groups with an interest in the issue, the
pros and cons of all of them are being examined in detail.
</P>
<P>
   But while it has proved safe to talk about Social Security, the
chances of talk turning to action remain questionable. Moreover,
the positions staked out by the most influential forces in the
debate reflect fundamentally differing visions of the role of
government.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme difficulty of reconciling the faith among Democrats
in the government and the push by Republicans for a more
market-based solution to social welfare problems was on full
display earlier this month when a bipartisan commission on Medicare
collapsed amid bitter disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats, especially those liberals who view Social
Security as Exhibit A in their argument that government has a
crucial role to play in ensuring the well-being of citizens, are
determined to maintain the system as much as possible in its
current form.
</P>
<P>
   They have rallied around the outline of a plan offered by
President Clinton in his State of the Union address. Clinton called
for keeping intact the current system, with its guaranteed
retirement benefit. He proposed using a big chunk of expected
federal budget surpluses, in a somewhat circuitous way, to extend
Social Security's solvency for about 17 years, to 2049.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed allowing the federal government for
the first time to invest a portion of Social Security's reserves in
stocks and bonds, a step he said would extend the system's solvency
to 2055. To meet the system's historical goal of 75 years of
solvency, Clinton said, the two parties would have to agree on
other unspecified steps, like raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed an important change outside the Social
Security system. To promote retirement savings, he wants to
establish a new form of private investment account, mainly for low-
to middle-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans are coming at the problem from a completely
different perspective. They say the system needs a total overhaul,
both to bring its financial condition into line with the pressures
it will face and to give individuals additional flexibility to
amass wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans considering a number of variants are working on
legislation they hope to introduce in coming months. But their
basic approach is to establish personal investment accounts within
Social Security through which individuals could invest in stocks
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Although such individual accounts would carry with them the risk
of loss should Wall Street suffer a sharp or protracted downturn,
most of the Republican plans contemplate some kind of guarantee
that no retiree would emerge worse off than under the current
system.
</P>
<P>
   The details of both the Democratic and the Republican approaches
are complicated and confusing, even to economists and policy
analysts. The arguments surrounding them touch on finance,
demographics and human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle ultimately is being fought over ideology, not
mathematical computer models.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very deep ideological divide, and it's going to be
very difficult to bridge,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who
favors keeping the current system intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans by and large want to privatize Social Security and
believe in a system of personal accounts,'' Nadler said. ``The
Democrats by and large believe that would destroy Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic view, which tends to be held more among
Republicans than Democrats, starts with a belief that there is
considerable common ground between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists say that both Clinton and the Republicans endorse
seeking higher returns for Social Security in the stock market and
that they differ only over whether individuals or the government
should do the investing.
</P>
<P>
   They say Clinton and Republicans agree on the desirability of
private investment accounts, and disagree only over whether the
accounts should be established within Social Security or outside
it.
</P>
<P>
   And they say both parties have an interest in dealing with the
problem now, since every passing year will make the proposed fixes
more painful for recipients and taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are fewer and fewer optimists on either side these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different approaches really are irreconcilable,'' said
Mark Weisbrot, research director of the Preamble Center, a liberal
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who say a deal can be struck assume that it will be
the other side that moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the prospect of a deal once everybody understands the
situation facing the system,'' said Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., who
favors private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Once both sides agree to put aside the demagoguery that has long
inflamed the debates and study the facts, Smith said, there will be
no choice but to quit having payroll taxes levied on today's
workers to pay today's retirees, and begin having each generation
save and invest for its own Social Security benefits _ in other
words, to have private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it, say most Democrats, who argue that Republicans have
exaggerated the crisis facing Social Security and the steps needed
to ensure the system's health.
</P>
<P>
   Weisbrot said the country did not really need to be having this
debate at all, at least not on the grounds of there being a
pressing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps it on the table is that you have Republicans who
want to privatize or otherwise go after the system,'' Weisbrot
said. ``You have Democrats who know it's a great way to win
elections. You have a president who used the issue to beat back
Republican tax cuts and is looking for a legacy other than
impeachment.''

COMMENTARY: PROFITS FROM GARAGE SALES ARE NOT MONETARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, March 25)  
(lb) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS  
 
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I much prefer going to garage sales to having them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the junk in our house reached critical mass just
eight months after we moved in, I decided it was time to sort and
sell.
</P>
<P>
   My 8-year-old was suspicious, having been traumatized by our
moving sale last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that time I woke up and saw that kid carrying off my
favorite toy?'' he asks still.
</P>
<P>
   The way he sees it, garage sales are the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   So I was surprised when he took this one in stride. He seemed
delighted to see people milling about, examining discarded
videotapes and bubble rockets and outgrown ``Small Soldier'' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a party,'' he said, settling in to count the money.
</P>
<P>
   Then the 2-year-old came sleepily down the garage stairs.
</P>
<P>
   She took one look and started gathering every toy she could
reach from the tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine,'' she said. ``Mine, mine, mine.''
</P>
<P>
   After some persuasion, she got to keep her yellow fabric
umbrella, and I got to put everything else back.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to guess what people would buy as they were walking down
the drive, but I was always wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One teen-age girl, who bought ``The Seven Habits of Highly
Effective People,'' had just come from taking the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-school guidance counselor bought all the cookbooks, the
magazine holder and some small plastic bugs for a model of the rain
forest she was making with her students.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors came by with children grass-stained from softball
practice. Soon, there were five kids playing in our yard, the first
time such a spontaneous group had formed since we moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Adam and Sarah were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of customers informed me my signs had swung upside
down. So I headed off to right them, leaving my husband in charge.
</P>
<P>
   This is always dangerous since:
</P>
<P>
   A) He would have donated everything to charity instead of
bothering with a sale.
</P>
<P>
   B) Now that there was already a sale in progress, he would
gladly sell anything for a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   When I came back, I was carrying a child's wooden rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you actually BOUGHT something from a garage sale
in the middle of OUR garage sale,'' he said, amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody gave it to me when I was putting up the sign in front
of her house,'' I replied, shrugging. ``We can sell it if you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah wandered over with wide eyes. ``It's so BEAUTIFUL,'' she
said. Jim rolled his eyes. I smiled. Sarah sat and rocked.
</P>
<P>
   As the customers dwindled, I started packing boxes for the
Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A final car pulled up with a mother, daughter and grandmother.
The girl, translating for her elders, explained they were from
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   I told them anything in the boxes was free, and they sorted for
15 minutes, filling up a bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother thanks you very much and says to tell you that my
grandmother will be taking these things back to her country when
she returns, to give them out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of it _ my fuzzy bedroom slippers and Adam's Bart Simpson
doll getting a second lease on life in the former U.S.S.R. You've
got to love garage sales.

RICKY MOORE IS UCONN'S DEFENSIVE STOPPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ You want defense? Ricky Moore can play the D, bay-bee.
He's a whirling dervish of arms, and legs, and hip checks. On a
smaller scale _ OK, a ``much'' smaller scale _ Moore is to the
Connecticut men's basketball team what Deion Sanders is to the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sanders, Moore sticks to the other team's best player and
you just don't hear from him again: Michigan State All-American
Mateen Cleaves shot 2- of-15 from the floor when they played;
Pittsburgh's Vonteego Cummings was 2-of-18 in one game; and
Stanford's Arthur Lee was 4-of-13.
</P>
<P>
   In the NCAA Tournament West Regional final Saturday that sent
Connecticut to its first Final Four, Moore, a 6-foot-2 guard, held
Gonzaga's best NBA prospect, Matt Santangelo, to 1-of-9 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get in a guy's chest,'' said Moore, a senior who
has been a starter the past three seasons. ``It's tough to shut a
guy out. But I'm a competitor. And no matter who the other team
brings in, it can be Michael Jordan, I'm going to do my best to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding Jordan might be a bit far-fetched. But Moore did a nice
job on cross-over king Allen Iverson, holding the then-Georgetown
star to 4-of-15 shooting in the 1996 Big East Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes, of course, are much higher Saturday, when Moore will
match elbows with Ohio State's James ``Scoonie'' Penn in a
tournament semifinal in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's role is clear. First-team All-America junior forward
Richard Hamilton scores most of the points and gets most of the
media spotlight. Point guard Khalid El-Amin runs the team. Moore
runs through picks, takes charges and plays in-your-face defense.
He has as much of an effect on the game as anybody, despite
averaging a modest seven points and four rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Calhoun calls Moore the best defensive player he has
ever coached. That is no small compliment from a man who has
coached more than 800 career games and seen the likes of Donyell
Marshall, Ray Allen and Scott Burrell go pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky has incredible athletic ability, and he's smart,''
Calhoun said. ``He could play any sport. He'd be a terrific
cornerback. He's got the attitude, the speed, the toughness. And
he's got the will to want to shut the other guy down.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore studies film of the opposing player as ambitiously as he
studies a political science textbook. He then combines brainpower
with a blend of strength and quickness. He gets in the face of jump
shooters like Santangelo, and he backs off guards who like to
drive, such as Cleaves and Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get more of a charge out of locking a guy up,'' Moore said.
``The way I look at it, if I'm playing good defense, that's going
to make our guys better. That's more important to me than scoring.
I can score. I scored a lot of points in high school, but we've got
guys here that can score. I want to stop the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Used to be, Moore was ``The Guy.'' He came to Connecticut as a
national top 40 recruit, having averaged 21.7 points and 8.4
assists per game at Westside High School in Augusta, Ga. He led his
team to a 33-1 record and its first Class 3A state title. He was
named runner-up in voting for Georgia's Mr. Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's game improved steadily in his first two seasons at
Connecticut. He averaged 4.7 points per game as a freshman. He
averaged nine points and a team-leading 5.4 assists per game as a
starting sophomore point guard.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies' recruitment of El-Amin in 1997 put the brakes
on Moore's offensive development. El-Amin took Moore's starting
point guard position. Moore, if he was to stay at Connecticut,
would have to move to the off-guard and change his focus from
offensive to defensive playmaker. Moore's family, thinking his new
role would hurt his chances to go pro, talked to him about
transferring to a school where he could showcase his talents.
</P>
<P>
   Moore stayed at Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help the guys here win a championship,'' Moore
said. ``I get respect because we are winning. I know I'm a pretty
good offensive player. But this is not about me. It's about the
team. We're trying to win a championship here.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Moore can't score if he has to. When
El-Amin sat on the bench for more than 15 minutes of the first half
against Gonzaga because of foul trouble, Moore took control. He had
nine points, three assists and three rebounds in 19 first-half
minutes, keeping the Huskies in the game until El-Amin returned. In
the second half, he returned to his customary role, putting the
clamps on Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought Khalid in and made him the starter, Ricky made
a decision to do the best thing to help the team win,'' Calhoun
said. ``That is play defense. But that's not to say that he can't
score. He can run the offense whenever we need him to, and when
people don't guard him they pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so much better because Ricky is on our team.''

 ABC's WEDNESDAY LINEUP BOLSTERED BY TWO SMART SITCOMS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC's ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' and ``The Drew Carey Show'' may never go
down as classic TV comedies in the style of ``I Love Lucy'' and
``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' but they're better than most of the
stuff that's out there.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for their new temporary stablemates, ``It's like, you
know ...'' and ``The Norm Show,'' which join Dharma, Greg and Drew
in the Wednesday lineup, giving ABC a foursome certainly as strong
as the one NBC sends out on Thursday nights. All ABC needs is a
decent 10 o'clock drama instead of another incarnation of ``20/20''
_ gee, if only it hadn't canned ``Maximum Bob,'' or ``Cupid,'' or
``Cracker'' _ and it might become the Wizard of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the wrong idea. ``It's like, you know ...,'' created
by former ``Seinfeld'' writer/producer Peter Mehlman, isn't another
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Norm Show,'' featuring deposed ``Saturday Night Live''
player Norm Macdonald and ``Roseanne'' star Laurie Metcalf, is a
little rough around the edges. But it's easy to see promise in both
series, which is something ABC should get excited about in this
midseason of major mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   With ``It's like, you know ...,'' Mehlman brashly re-creates the
Seinfeldian ethos, this time with a cast of five instead of four.
To use Mehlman's words, it's about ``people coming out to L.A. in
search of their dreams and reinventing themselves completely.''
</P>
<P>
   But after watching three episodes, it's like, you know, Mehlman
was just saying that so critics wouldn't say ``It's like, you know
...'' is about nothing. That would be way so Sein-fully derivative,
even for television.
</P>
<P>
   So you be the judge. Here's a conversation from the pilot
episode, featuring four of the five characters: Robbie, Shrug,
Arthur and Jennifer. Robbie starts it by mentioning that he saw
Elliott Gould on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Shrug: ``What was he driving?''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie: ``A Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, disbelieving: ``A Honda?''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie: ``A Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrug: ``Maybe it was a rental.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie: ``I think it was his Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrug: ``Why would he drive a Honda?''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer: ``Maybe he does voice-overs for Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie: ``Maybe he owns a Honda dealership.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrug: ``Maybe it was his wife's Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer: ``Maybe he doesn't know it was a Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrug: ``Maybe it was an Acura Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie: ``No, it was a Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, the vexed New Yorker trying to grasp what passes for
conversation in L.A.: ``Aaaargh! Will you listen to yourselves? Who
cares what Elliott Gould drives? How does this qualify as a
discussion?''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie: ``That's what's so great about L.A. You don't even have
to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Or substantial, for that matter. The more trivial, the better.
At least from Mehlman's Left Coast observatory, where he has spent
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Mehlman moved to Los Angeles in 1989 because he says he needed a
change of scenery. He had worked at the Washington Post, wrote and
produced Howard Cosell's ``Sportsbeat'' show from 1982-84, then
free-lanced out of New York for five years after that.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., Mehlman hooked up with Larry David, whom he had known
in New York. David hired Mehlman to write for a new show called
``Seinfeld,'' and Mehlman ended up staying for six years.
</P>
<P>
   For the TV audience, one-time Seattleite Chris Eigeman plays the
wide-eyed, often incredulous, transplanted New Yorker _ a guy named
Arthur Garment, ostensibly in L.A. for a short time to do a
magazine piece on why he hates L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Arthur will be staying a little longer, mainly
because he's smitten with Lauren (A.J. Langer), an L.A.-based
masseuse/process server he met on the plane. He's also impressed
that the real Jennifer Grey of ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Red Dawn''
lives next door to Robbie (Steven Eckholdt).
</P>
<P>
   Grey, made virtually unrecognizable by a nose job, has a ball
poking fun at herself. Her castmates are strong, too, particularly
Evan Handler as Shrug, an enormously wealthy ``trustafarian'' who's
never known what it is to work for one's money.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a problem in the early going, it's that the
performers aren't interacting as much as they're reciting funny
lines. Fortunately, most of the lines recall the barbed-wire
spikiness of ``Seinfeld.'' If the cast settles in and the writing
stays sharp, ABC has a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Norm Show,'' ABC has a very close relative of ``The
Drew Carey Show.'' Like Carey, Macdonald is a snide comic who rubs
many people the wrong way, not the least being NBC exec Don
Ohlmeyer, who canned Macdonald from ``Saturday Night Live'' because
Ohlmeyer wasn't amused. Like Carey's show, Macdonald's also has
that dark ``Roseanne'' feel to it. Not surprising, since Bruce
Helford, a former executive producer of ``Roseanne,'' is co-creator
of both ``Drew'' and ``Norm.''
</P>
<P>
   While Macdonald is often as profane as an NBA coach, his show is
remarkably mild. Still, producer Helford always manages to tweak
the network censors, apparently to assert his manliness or
something. It's probably the only reason ``The Norm Show'' is rated
TV-14 while ``It's like, you know ...'' gets a TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional blue lingo aside, ``The Norm Show'' has some good
things happening. There's the marvelous Metcalf, who plays Norm's
gullible mentor/colleague/friend. And there's the versatile Ian
Gomez, fresh off his spectacular performance as Javier, the gay
cafe manager on ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald is his usual sarcastic self, playing a deposed hockey
player relegated to the penalty box for five years for failure to
pay taxes. To avoid prison, he agrees to perform community service
as a social worker. Sure, it makes no sense. But it's worth
suspending disbelief just for this exchange between Norm and a guy
who wants to reclaim the dog Norm bought at the pound.
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``You can't take my dog!''
</P>
<P>
   Norm: ``What do you mean, pal? We're social workers. We can take
children!''
</P>
<P>
   In humor-challenged places, lines such as this will be dissected
and examined for their appropriateness. In more relaxed circles,
people will laugh. And that's good.
</P>
<P>
   It's like, you know ... Half-hour comedy series about a New
Yorker trying to make sense of life in L.A. Starring Chris Eigeman,
Steven Eckholdt, Jennifer Grey, Evan Handler and A.J. Langer.

ELITE SEASON SHOWS UCLA IS ON RISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA speaks of building its women's basketball
program to compete with the nation's elite _ the Tennessees, the
Louisiana Techs. The Bruins' season ended Monday night with a
26-point loss to Tech, showing how far away they remain from that
goal. And also showing they are moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built a great foundation,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier
said. ``This team has a fantastic springboard. It's been a great
year.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won its first Pac-10 title, won 26 games, reached the Elite
Eight for the first time and made the NCAAs in consecutive seasons
for the first time (they made consecutive AIAW Final Four
appearances in 1978 and '79). And maybe it made the Bruins'
faithful temporarily forget the UCLA men.
</P>
<P>
   ``People realize,'' Maylana Martin said, ``there is a women's
basketball team at UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, there were no seniors on this team, meaning
another season of Martin's leadership and turnaround bank shots,
Janae Hubbard's domination in the middle, Marie Philman
outrebounding taller players, Melanie Pearson's outside shooting,
LaCresha Flannigan's speed and defense and Carly Funicello's help
in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``May, she's already talking about her senior year,'' Olivier
said. ``She'll want to go out and be a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica Gomez, who broke Ann Meyers' career assist record this
season, has talked about not returning because she graduates in
June. A sprained ankle in the regional semifinal against Colorado
State and a one-sided loss to Tech might have influenced Gomez's
decision, but even if she calls it a career, UCLA has the personnel
with Michelle Greco and incoming freshman Nicole Kacmarski to carry
on.
</P>
<P>
   Greco, from Crescenta Valley High, proved her worth by filling
in for Gomez after spending most of the season watching and
learning. She has shown she can take over.
</P>
<P>
   Kacmarski, from Farmingville, N.Y., is the top prep guard in the
nation, according to Blue Star Scouting Report. She averaged 25.9
points and 5.2 assists last season and was named to USA Today's
All-USA honorable mention team. She also was named All-America by
Street &AMP; Smith's and earned state player of the year honors as a
13-year-old eighth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record my freshman year was 13-14,'' Gomez said. ``Each
year, we've improved and we're getting better and better. We're
getting more famous. People recognize us. Now, UCLA is known.''

 &HT;    Lodging industry told to brace for changes
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hospitality executives were told Tuesday to expect ``a
tremendous amount of change'' in the lodging industry, including
further consolidation among hotel owners, more high-tech services
in rooms and greater diversity among workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last decade has been known as the golden era of the
lodging industry,'' said Valerie Ferguson, regional vice president
and managing director of Loew's Philadelphia Hotel and former
chairwoman of the American Hotel &AMP; Motel Association. She gave her
outlook at an industry summit on diversity, held at the Hyatt
Regency in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, more than 45 mergers among hotel
companies have been completed and that's not expected to stop, said
Ferguson, a former general manager of the Hyatt Regency and
Ritz-Carlton hotels in Atlanta. At least 15 deals have been
announced this year. Much of the activity has been fueled by Wall
Street's interest in the lodging industry, resulting in a
``deluge'' of money, she said. There are 75 publicly traded hotel
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong summit was sponsored by the Atlanta Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau's diversity marketing committee in conjunction with
the Atlanta Business League, the Asian American Hotel Owners
Association and the Atlanta Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said technology will allow hotels to offer guests
offices away from the office, with services such as
teleconferencing, computers and Internet access from their rooms.
But there are few issues more important to the industry than
managing diversity, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our markets and labor pool are becoming increasingly
diverse,'' said Ferguson, one of the highest-ranking women and
African-Americans in the hospitality industry.
</P>
<P>
   She warned that few companies can risk a public relations
disaster similar to what happened with the Denny's restaurant
chain. Five years ago, Denny's paid $54.4 million to settle two
class action lawsuits that alleged racial discrimination. Recently
the company announced a $2 million advertising campaign aimed at
sparking discussions on the importance of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the industry employs about 16 million people. That is
expected to grow between 30 percent and 40 percent over the next
decade. Employees filling those jobs will come from the nation's
fast-growing minority populations _ Hispanics, African-Americans
and Asians, Ferguson said. With an annual turnover rate of 52
percent, the industry is challenged is to hire _ and retain _
workers from diverse backgrounds, she added.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the industry has maintained an ``average'' grade
addressing those issues, said Gerry Fernandez, president of the
Multi-Cultural Foodservice &AMP; Hospitality Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   On the marketing side, Fernandez said hospitality executives
must recognize the buying power of minorities. African-Americans
alone have estimated purchasing power of $450 billion annually, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is taking the first step by coming together to
collect research and plant the seeds for the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black community has not had a positive image of the
industry,'' Fernandez said. ``The image for years is that all we
can do is cook and clean. And the industry has done nothing to
change that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, possibilities include management jobs as well as
ownership of restaurants and hotel properties. Atlanta businessman
Gary A. Cross is tapping into those opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Cross is among a group of entrepreneurs who recently purchased
the 100-room Travelodge Suites in downtown Macon. He also is one of
the developers of a new hotel planned for Auburn and Piedmont
avenues in Atlanta. The proposed hotel is expected to open next
year at the site of the now closed Palamont Motor Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Cross said he once sold hotel franchises. He observed that other
ethnic and racial groups often banded together and bought or
developed properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized they controlled a lot of the money and a lot of the
power, especially to employ people,'' he said. ``When
African-Americans own properties, we can do likewise. We can hire
people and trade with other African-American businesses. That's
true economic development.''

 &HT;    Burbage soars to take on Lockheed challenge
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Burbage is used to hot seats.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 3 1/2 years, he's led Lockheed Martin Corp.'s
high-profile F-22 fighter program, shepherding it through a barrage
of technical and political obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   He once was a Navy test pilot, and he's an avid rower who hopes
to participate in a national masters competition on Lake Lanier
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now Burbage, 51, is taking on another challenge as the new
president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems, headquartered at
the company's Marietta, Ga. plant.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion, announced last week, makes Burbage the division's
fourth president in five years. He follows the retiring Bill
Bullock, who was installed in 1997 to troubleshoot problems, cut
costs and improve manufacturing processes at Cobb County's largest
private employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really just kind of begun that journey,'' Burbage said.
``My job is to try and take us to the next level, to increase the
competitiveness of the company and expand the business base.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbage assumes responsibility for all plant programs, which
include the F-22 and the updated C-130J cargo plane _ both facing
near-term obstacles _ along with modification work on other planes.
</P>
<P>
   Plant employment has dwindled from 11,500 to 9,200 in the past
five years, and it will fall more if sluggish C-130J sales don't
pick up soon.
</P>
<P>
   There's even been speculation Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed
Martin might close the Marietta plant and move its programs, a
theory roundly denied by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage exudes glass-half-full optimism, noting the plant has
fared better than a lot of contractors in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably got the most robust portfolio of any military
aircraft manufacturer, with both the F-22 and the C-130J here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage said he's confident the F-22 will enter production
despite concern about high costs that the General Accounting Office
last week warned will exceed congressional caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the Air Force needs and wants the plane,
although it will be procured in smaller numbers than anyone ever
envisioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be cost pressures, but we feel we're
on top of them and are within the congressional caps. The GAO's
report tended to mischaracterize some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he's confident Lockheed Martin will secure enough
U.S. and foreign C-130J orders to sustain production beyond 2001,
when current orders will be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage, who formally assumes the president's job April 5, said
he's not yet ready to talk about any strategy shifts or structural
changes he might implement.
</P>
<P>
   His selection was a mild surprise. Executive Vice President
Terry Graham, a Lockheed Martin veteran who had left the company
but was brought back as Bullock's No. 2, was considered by some the
more likely successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been on the F-22 for 3 1/2 years, and that's about as
long as anyone stays on a program like that,'' Burbage said. ``So I
was expecting to move, but where was another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham remains in the executive vice president post, a key
day-to-day operations and marketing job.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage is a 19-year Lockheed Martin veteran who moved to the
Marietta plant in 1991, after prior stints in California and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Naval Academy graduate and spent 11 years in the Navy,
mainly as a test pilot. One of his three daughters followed his
footsteps into Annapolis and the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage no longer flies but recently rode in the back seat of an
F-15 chase plane to watch an F-22 during a flight test over Edwards
Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than just an executive perk, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt like I needed to see the airplane in the air,''
he said. ``You get a really vivid picture of how it flies that
really can't be duplicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbage is known as a candid and unpretentious executive. He's
sometimes kidded for folding his 6-foot-4 frame into a well-used
Honda del Sol he drives back and forth to his home in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets harassed a lot for that car,'' said his wife of 30
years, Ellen, who drives an even older Honda Civic. ``Our cars
don't identify who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbage's rowing hobby is rooted in a devotion to fitness _ he
goes to work early to work out at the plant gym _ but has become
more than that. He admits his plans for the national competition in
August might be sidetracked by the demands of his new job but
added, ``I'm going to keep trying to shoot for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When twilight allows, he's known in his neighborhood as the guy
who rows a skull on a small lake near the Burbages' house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always watches him row up and down this lake,'' Ellen
Burbage said. ``I'm a little concerned he may not have time now,
but I can't see him giving it up.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Initial NATO bombings of Yugoslavia will be
broader and more punishing, focusing on 60 different targets, than
the short, sharp strike that NATO military planners had originally
envisioned, French and American officials said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO diplomats said that Supreme Allied Commander Gen.
Wesley Clark would have authority to strike any targets he chose in
the first round, instead of having to go step by step or ask for
permission to hit tank or troop concentrations carrying out attacks
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials speaking on the condition of anonymity
said air and missile strikes would target more than just those army
and police units waging war against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo
province, but would attack the Yugoslav military more generally,
striking at targets inside Serbia vital to supporting the
repression. Those include military bases, lines of communication,
fuel supplies and ammunition dumps.
</P>
<P>
   French and American officials also said the second phase of the
attack would follow the first without a break.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that like the raids on Iraq in December,
the strikes would almost certainly occur at night, taking advantage
of American technological superiority. That would leave ``pauses''
during daylight hours during which Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, could agree to accept a peace agreement. ``At any time
he could say `enough,''' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana ordered the airstrikes
Tuesday night, and officials said it would take until Wednesday to
program cruise missile to strike the 60 targets.
</P>
<P>
   Officials still hope that a bombing will persuade Milosevic to
end his repression in Kosovo, but the Pentagon has not declared it
as a goal, largely because officials concede that air power alone
might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do then?'' one Pentagon official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise-missile strike _ from ships and submarines as well as
from B-52s based in Britain _ could last a day or two, followed by
an air campaign involving American and NATO jets that could last
two to four days or more, according to officials who have been
briefed on the planning.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the plan is guided more by the targets NATO
hopes to destroy than by a strict timetable. A number of factors,
including weather and the success of Yugoslavia's defense could
affect the duration. ``I don't have a clear idea how long it will
take,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
briefed senators on the scope of the planned strikes on Tuesday,
describing a devastating barrage. ``Unfortunately it's going to be
a devastating series of attacks,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav armed forces and paramilitary police units that
NATO warplanes plan to attack are regarded as tough, well-equipped,
and far more powerful than the Bosnian Serb forces that allied
warplanes bombed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 90,000 soldiers of the Yugoslav National Army are equipped
with thousands of tanks, multiple rocket launchers, heavy artillery
pieces and surface-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Before allied warplanes would attack any of these forces, allied
officers said, NATO commanders would try first to destroy as much
as possible of Serbia's sophisticated integrated air defense
system, which gives it considerable ability to shoot down planes.
</P>
<P>
   This, probably the single most formidable component of the
Serbian defenses, consists of hundreds of Soviet-era surface-to-air
missiles and 2,000 anti-aircraft artillery batteries linked to
radar and guidance systems by a fortified command and control
network. Its main command and control site is at Kopanik in
central-southwest Serbia, according to Jane's Information Group, a
leading British publisher on defense information.
</P>
<P>
   After strikes on the air defense systems, the allies would
concentrate on striking tanks, armored personnel carriers and other
heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 allied aircraft from the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, and 10 other countries stand ready to attack from
bases in Italy and England and aircraft carriers in the Adriatic
and Mediterranean Seas. Of those about 200 are American.

 BRUSSELS, Belgium: are American. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Pentagon quietly ordered 15 jets based in Turkey
to patrol the northern ``no flight'' zone over Iraq to bolster the
aircraft already poised to strike Yugoslavia, officials said. Those
aircraft included a number of EA-6B electronic combat jets, which
are important to attacking and evading air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also withdrew a liaison team that had been sent to Belgrade
to coordinate the reconnaissance flights permitted over Kosovo
under last October's cease-fire. A team of Yugoslav officers who
had been sent to NATO's base in Vicenza, Italy, also were sent
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train has pretty much already left the station here,''
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and his command did not disclose in advance what targets
they planned to strike first. The main Serbian military bases in
Kosovo are just north of Pristina, with army garrisons located at
Prizren near the Albanian border and Gnijilane.
</P>
<P>
   He did say, ``We know what Serbian capabilities are, we know
what Serbian vulnerabilities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders say they believe Serbia's 16,700-member air
force, with more than 60 MIG-21 fighters and 15 MIG-29s, some armed
with air-to-air missiles, according to the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London, would be no match for the American
and European armada preparing to launch strikes against them.
</P>
<P>
   They have also warned the Serbs against trying to attack the
allied troops gathered in neighboring Macedonia. Those forces were
to be the vanguard of a 28,000-member peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo if Serbia's leaders accepted a settlement providing autonomy
for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders have considerable respect for the Serbian air
defense system, which has 1,000 Russian-designed surface-to-air
missiles of different ranges, including SA-6 missiles with
relatively advanced guidance systems. Serbian defenses also include
five other types of surface-to-air missiles of various ranges.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Yugoslav Navy lost most of its bases when Croatia
became independent, Serbian forces in the Adriatic still include
four powerful frigates with surface-to-surface and surface-to-air
missiles based at Tivat on the Adriatic coast that could pose a
threat to allied warplanes and navy ships, the London institute's
latest handbook, ``The Military Balance 1998/99,'' reports.
</P>
<P>
   All allied nations have emphasized that they have no intention
of fighting their way into Kosovo to install the peacekeeping force
envisioned in the peace agreement that Milosevic rejected.
</P>
<P>
   So the question before allied commanders is how effective air
power alone, without ground-based spotters to guide planes closer
to their targets, would be in terrain that is every bit as rugged
and mountainous as it was in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the kind of laser- and infrared-guided
``smart'' bombs and air-to-ground missiles the United States used
against Iraq, particularly in the desert operations vividly shown
on videotapes taken during the war in the Persian Gulf, would not
necessarily be as effective in the Balkans, if only because clouds
frequently cover the terrain there.
</P>
<P>
   Picking out individual tanks and artillery pieces from 10,000
feet can be like looking for a needle in a haystack, experienced
pilots say, and the 30,000 Yugoslav soldiers and paramilitary
police now operating in Kosovo could draw from an arsenal of
thousands of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And if allied planes descend to lower altitudes to try to spot
these targets more effectively, the Serbian forces have nearly
2,000 air defense guns they could bring to bear. The tank forces
alone include 239 modernized 1970s-vintage Soviet-designed T-72s
that the Yugoslavs designate as M-84s, brought into action in
Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav forces also have about 1,000 older tanks, according
to ``The Military Balance,'' and close to 1,000 long-range heavy
artillery pieces as well as hundreds of multiple rocket launchers
capable of firing heavy barrages into targets on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this weaponry is in Kosovo, by any means. The allies
threatened earlier this year to bomb military targets inside Serbia
proper if attacks did not cease. Whether the allied target lists
include such major military installations as the main Serbian
airbase at Batajnica, 10 miles west of Belgrade, or Krusevac, the
main tank base in central Serbia, commanders would not say.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has long made most of its own weaponry in Kragujevac,
also in central Serbia, according to Jane's. And if the allies
think that a spectacular demonstration of air power close to home
might be all it took to get Milosevic to change his mind, they
could strike at missile and radar sites on the hills surrounding
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance headquarters here provided no information in advance
about what would be hit, saying that could endanger the safety of
allied pilots.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav foreign minister said on
Tuesday that his country could not accept a ``biased policy of
diktat'' from the West, whose bombing would violate international
law.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, was by turns
sarcastic and defiant, saying Yugoslavia threatens no other country
and did not deserve to be bombed for offending Washington's pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia desires a peaceful resolution to Kosovo that
provides extensive autonomy, self-government, democracy and human
rights to the province's population,'' he said. But Yugoslavia, as
a sovereign state, ``cannot accept foreign troops to occupy our
land, while our authorities and forces must leave the territory.
What kind of sovereignty is that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In ``an internal affair,'' and without going to the United
Nations, both NATO and the United States are ``destroying the
system of international law,'' Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States cared only about inserting NATO
troops into Kosovo, not about any just political settlement there,
and desired to punish Belgrade because Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright ``could not bear the idea of her failure.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that Serbian forces were engaged in an offensive
against the Kosovo Liberation Army or burning ethnic Albanian
villages, saying that Belgrade's troops were only responding to
attacks upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he himself understood the consequences for a Yugoslavia
at war with the West, its army damaged, its isolation deepened, its
poor economy further degraded, Jovanovic said he understood them
very well. ``We may develop at a slower pace,'' he said, smiling
thinly, ``but we will develop.''

 &HT;    Women's Final four will have to do without regulars as Lady Dogs
get set for Duke
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A women's Final Four without Tennessee or Connecticut?
The giants of women's college basketball, who defined the sport in
this decade, are nowhere to be found with a national championship
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there's Georgia, which will be making its fifth trip to
the Final Four under coach Andy Landers and its third in five
years. With only one senior on the team, Georgia secured its Final
Four berth Monday with an 89-71 victory over Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better this time because nobody expected us to be
there,'' said Georgia senior Pam Irwin-Osbolt.
</P>
<P>
   The last two times Georgia advanced to the Final Four, Tennessee
blocked the road to the national title. But with the Lady Vols and
Connecticut eliminated, the path toward a possible national
championship appears to be clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was in line to play both, had they not been knocked off
_ UConn by Iowa State in the Mideast semifinals and the Lady
Volunteers by Duke in the East finals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Tennessee has done has been good for women's basketball,
as did Connecticut's undefeated season (1994-95),'' Landers said.
``Their stories have been good. But when it's the same people over
and over again, it becomes kind of predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The road took a twist and a turn and a fork somewhere else,''
he said, ``and that's good for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Landers and his players expressed some regret that they
didn't get another chance at Tennessee, which accounted for three
of Georgia's six losses this season. The Lady Dogs will face Duke,
which upset the three-time defending champion 69-63 in the East
Regional to become the first school to have men and women in the
Final Four in the same year since Georgia in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia team was en route to Athens, Ga. from Cincinnati
late Monday when word came that their SEC rivals would not be
joining them in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really weren't concerned with who we were going to play, we
were just excited about going to the Final Four,'' junior forward
Angie Ball said. ``I kind of wish we were the team that knocked
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of the two traditional powers, the Final
Four should have enough fresh stories to savor while the Tennessee
and UConn camps watch the action from the comfort of their living
rooms. Georgia, which will be making its fifth trip to the Final
Four and will play Duke on Friday, isn't an unfamiliar name among
the game's elite despite never having won it all. Neither is
three-time champion Louisiana Tech, which has 12 previous Final
Four appearances but hasn't been in the winner's circle for 11
years.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's first and only trip came in 1994, and Duke has never
been this far before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wide-open now,'' Louisiana Tech's Monica Maxwell said.
``It's anybody's championship to win.'' The Lady Dogs are striving
to maintain the consistency that has steered them in the
post-season. Although the team has only two upperclassmen among its
regulars, Landers said this year's team is starting to jell, much
like his young 1995 Final Four team did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, like I told the other groups, that there's
greatness that's waiting to come out,'' Landers said. ``It was
about the regionals that they started to dig some of it out. This
group hasn't always been the picture of consistency, but we're
starting to come together at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Landers and his players expressed some regret they didn't get
another chance at Tennessee, which accounted for three of Georgia's
six losses this season. The Georgia team was enroute to Athens late

 &HT;    Georgians wary of jumping on bandwagon too early
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In some states, politicians have flocked to the
presidential-campaign-in-waiting of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. The
scene is somewhat different in Georgia, and the experience of four
years ago may have something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   By this time in 1995, Georgia's Republican congressional
delegation was in lock step behind Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and
his well-financed presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The move was led by Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell, and the
support extended to statewide officials and state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was that when the campaign headed south after the Iowa
Caucuses and the New Hampshire Primary, Gramm would be
well-positioned to score momentum-generating wins in South Carolina
and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff?
</P>
<P>
   Gramm dropped out of the race before the Georgia Primary and the
politicians scrambled to throw their support elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly did not work out too well being out there early
last time,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who so far is uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the unhappy outcome with Gramm, Coverdell is again
leading the charge, this time for Bush, and he has Reps. Mac
Collins and Charlie Norwood with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the delegation has declined to make an
endorsement so far. Other Georgians are choosing sides. Cobb
Commission Chairman Bill Byrne, Gwinnett Commission Chairman Wayne
Hill and David Ralston, the 1998 GOP nominee for state attorney
general, are co-chairmen of Lamar Alexander's Georgia steering
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Mack Mattingly is a national co-chairman of the
campaign of former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publisher Steve Forbes has former Georgia Christian
Coalition Chairman Jerry Keen seeking support among religious
conservatives nationwide. And state Republican Chairman Rusty Paul
will join the Forbes campaign when he steps down as chairman in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Primary concern
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Zell Miller changed the date of Georgia's presidential
primary in 1992 and reaped a reward, a keynote address at the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. Roy Barnes has similar hopes, he had better think again.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has said he is considering moving up the primary from
March 7, when California and New York, and possibly Florida and
Pennsylvania, also will hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   His concern is that Georgia would be lost among the behemoths of
presidential politics. The nominees in both parties may very well
be known by the time the votes are counted on the 7th. But
advancing the primary is unlikely to generate the kind of attention
from the candidates and the media that Georgia saw in 1992. Miller
led the fight to change the date so that Georgia would vote before
most other Southern states. Miller's candidate, then-Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton, won his first primary in Georgia and did not look
back.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republican pollster Whit Ayres said, ``Whatever
attention you get will likely last just a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Chairman Rusty Paul said he isn't sure that
many campaigns will even make a big push in the South because of
the looming contest in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a little bit of money could get you a big
kick in Iowa and New Hampshire. Then you headed south with some
momentum,'' Paul said. ``You can't do that this time. If you don't
go play in California, it's over.''Staying in the House
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) had already met with Majority Leader
Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay last week when he got a call
from aides to Speaker Dennis Hastert. ``They said he was coming to
see me and the topic would be remaining in the House,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley took himself out of the running last week for the Senate
seat that Sen. Connie Mack will give up at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in both parties are pressuring their members to stay put
because a change of just six seats in 2000 would swing control of
the House to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is on districts that would be competitive were there
no incumbent. At least eight Democrats with notions of running for
the Senate have heard from party leaders, said Erik Smith,
spokesman for the House Democrats' campaign committee. ``We tell
them, `We need you here. You have a great opportunity to serve in
the majority and you will have a whole lot more power here than as
a freshman senator in the minority,''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Rep. Sherrod Brown
(D-Ohio) have agreed to pass up Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders also are pleading with members whose
term-limit pledges come due next year. Rep. Tillie Fowler (R-Fla.)
and Rep. George Nethercutt (R-Wash.) are weighing running again in
spite of their pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse won't run
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson is
expected to announce today that he will pass up another try for the
White House in 2000, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is supposed to make the announcement on the campaign Web
site of his son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.). The site is
www.jessejacksonjr.org.

 &HT;    SENATE VOTES TO AUTHORIZE AIR STRIKES IN KOSOVO CRISIS
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. With KOSOVO-US.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate provided last-minute support Tuesday
night for a NATO air assault on Yugoslavia, voting 58-41 to
authorize the attacks even as U.S. and allied pilots prepared to
carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution authorized President Clinton ``to conduct
military air operations and missile strikes ... in cooperation with
our NATO allies.'' But several senators made clear they expected
Clinton to seek fresh approval from Congress before sending U.S.
ground forces to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts are widespread in Congress about the goals, costs and
exit strategy for the operation, intended to protect rebelling
ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo from attacks by
the government in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday morning, the Senate appeared ready to vote on a
resolution that would have blocked funding for the military action.
But after the president met with about 30 leaders from both parties
at the White House to tell them that the strikes were imminent,
resistance evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Senate's most outspoken critic of the military action,
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, emerged from the White House
resigned to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not we agree with the policy, it's a different
question ... if, in fact, troops are in harm's way,'' she said in
announcing that she was dropping her resolution. The measure would
have blocked funds for the intervention unless a peace agreement
was reached first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want (President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia)
to get the impression that the troops would not have the full
support and that the president wouldn't have the support.'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Senate floor Tuesday evening, Hutchison repeated her
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing a sovereign country that has not threatened the United
States of America is a very serious step,'' she said. ``I think it
is premature to do what we are going to be doing.'' She voted
against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   While she was willing to drop her move to block the air strikes,
Hutchison said, she had extracted a promise from Republican leaders
``that if there is going to be a war declared, it will be Congress
that will declare it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans shared Hutchison's misgivings about involving
American troops in a civil struggle that has roots going back 600
years and no clear resolution in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still am concerned about taking military action in a country
where there's conflict within their own borders,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi. ``How will it be paid
for? Where will it lead?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington compared the authorization of
air strikes to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that was used as the
legal basis for the buildup of troops for the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma said, ``I don't think you can
bomb a country into a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic backers countered that the action was necessary to
uphold NATO and stave off chaos in the former Yugoslavia, even as
they conceded that the public was not yet convinced about the
necessity of sending U.S. planes to war.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the most vigorous defender of
intervention, said lawmakers had urged Clinton to work much harder
to persuade the American public. Biden said they told Clinton: ``We
should be with you, but make your case to the American people more
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to address the nation on the planned
bombing, although no date has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps of greater concern to lawmakers was the absence of a
clear route out of the Kosovo involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start this process, we better be prepared to finish it,
which means we better be prepared to go to Belgrade,'' Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., said, complaining that the Clinton administration
had not satisfied his concerns about long-range policy in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said military action was necessary to back up the
repeated threats the United States has made by ``drawing a line in
the sand which Milosevic keeps kicking in our face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no good news in it,'' said Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.,
who supported Clinton but also raised questions about how the
operation. ``We have to define our objectives,'' he said, adding
that the goals should be as modest as possible so that the forces
can be withdrawn quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is keep the bar low enough that (the
goals) can be achieved,'' Cleland said.

RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER ABRUPTLY CANCELS TRIP TO WASHINGTON WHILE EN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after 1 p.m. on Tuesday, an angry Russian
prime minister, en route to Washington for some of the most
important talks of his short tenure, ordered his pilot to turn his
Ilyushin airliner around and return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was a few hundred miles
northeast of Newfoundland when he received a satellite telephone
call from Vice President Al Gore. Gore grimly informed him that a
last-minute diplomatic effort had failed and that the United States
and NATO were preparing to deliver a barrage of air and missile
strikes against Serbian targets in Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was in an untenable situation, having argued for months
against the use of force against Moscow's allies in Serbia.
Whatever he might have hoped to gain from three days of meetings _
with President Clinton, Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and officials of the International Monetary Fund _ was now
overshadowed by the likelihood of American-led military action in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov told the vice president, `We categorically oppose
this,''' according to a senior American official privy to the
telephone conversation. ``He was so committed to coming here that
he took it as far as he possibly could, until he realized he
couldn't avoid a situation that he found completely unacceptable.
So he turned back.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's abrupt decision to cancel his visit to Washington was
a mark of the significant souring in the U.S.-Russian relationship.
Administration officials said that the split over Kosovo, which has
been festering for some time, could poison discussions on a variety
of matters, particularly Russia's desperate need for cash to cover
its foreign debts and keep its economy functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, like all Russian prime ministers under the
unpredictable President Boris Yeltsin, is also in a precarious
domestic political position. His mission to Washington was designed
in part to bolster his political standing at home by presenting him
in high-profile meetings with top officials to negotiate for new
commitments of Western financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had warned Primakov for the past
several days of the awkward timing of his visit, with the United
States and its European allies preparing to carry out an ultimatum
to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. But Primakov pressed
on, even after Gore told him at 9:30 on Tuesday morning, when
Primakov was in Shannon, Ireland, for a refueling stop, that there
was little hope that Milosevic would relent and accept allied
demands that he withdraw his forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:50 a.m., Primakov left Shannon, intent on coming to
Washington until 1 p.m., when Gore reached him aboard his aircraft
with word that allied air strikes were imminent. Richard Holbrooke,
the U.S. troubleshooter for the Balkans, had just left Belgrade,
where his efforts to persuade Milosevic to back down were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was approaching Gander, Newfoundland, not far from U.S.
airspace, when Gore's call was connected. A senior administration
official paraphrased Gore's side of the conversation this way:
``Yevgeny, my friend, this is what happened in Belgrade. We feel we
must go to the next stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added, ``In no sense did we uninvite him or make
him unwelcome. We just wanted him to know what cards he had in his
hand. The Russians had always said that if the bombing began while
Primakov was in Washington, he would speak out strongly against it
and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov and Gore are co-chairs of the U.S.-Russia Joint
Commission, a body that meets twice a year to discuss a variety of
matters of common interest. This session was to have been devoted
to Russia's dire economic situation, particularly its inability to
make good on $17 billion in interest payments due this year to
international lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda also included arms control, the environment,
agricultural sales and efforts to halt the spread of nuclear
weapons. But all that will have to wait. Gore and Primakov did not
set a date to reconvene.
</P>
<P>
   In a formal statement issued by the White House on Tuesday, Gore
said: ``The prime minister and I are both committed to a strong
bilateral relationship,'' ``and we are both convinced that work of
the commission helps strengthen that relationship. We will take up
the important work of the commission at a time when both sides can
better focus their attention on the issues before us.''
</P>
<P>
   The bland words mask a deep division between Washington and
Moscow over the Balkans that dates to the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the unraveling of Yugoslavia. Friction over the expected
NATO military action could affect the broader relationship between
the two major powers, administration officials acknowledged on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright made an effort on Tuesday to contain the damage from
the dispute over Kosovo, according to aides. She spoke by telephone
for more than a half-hour with her Russian counterpart, Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, said James P. Rubin, the State Department
spokesman. Albright told him she hoped the United States and Russia
could find a way ``to deal with the situation and continue to work
in other ways,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has expended huge amounts of time and money
into bringing Russia into the global trading system as well as
keeping its 7,000 nuclear warheads under close control. Russia's
failing economy has produced a long-running crisis that has caused
enormous hardship among the Russian people as well as jitters among
Russia's global lenders. Moscow is also irritated at the expansion
of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is putting a lot of strain on our ability to conduct some
of these other negotiations,'' one official said. ``Do we recognize
that the Kosovo thing hasn't made it any easier? You bet.''

SUSPECT IN KILLING OF ROCKET BELT BUSINESS PARTNER DENIES
WRONGDOING

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The man Harris County sheriff's detectives call the
only suspect in the slaying of his rocket belt business partner
denies any role in the killing and says he plans to sue the county
for violating his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly had nothing to do with his murder,'' Bradley W.
Barker said Tuesday, ``absolutely not, absolutely, positively
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket belt, a Buck Rogers-type contraption strapped on like
a backpack, is similar to the rocket belt used in the 1965 James
Bond movie ``Thunderball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials have said their investigation has eliminated
all possible suspects other than Barker, who said he was in Fort
Smith, Ark., when Joseph Wright, 37, was beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found July 19 in his northwest Harris County home.
Harris County, which includes most of Houston, has 3.1 million
people and is the largest county in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, 44, said he has no idea who killed Wright and had not
spoken to him for at least a year before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, Barker and Thomas L. Stanley were partners in American
Rocket Belt Corp., which owned a hydrogen peroxide-powered rocket
belt, dubbed the RB2000. The belt could propel a man aloft for
about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The belt is an improved version of a machine developed in the
early 1960s by Wendell Moore, an engineer at Bell Aircraft in
Buffalo, N.Y. Built for the Department of Defense, its 20-second
flight duration made it impractical. Since the patents on that belt
have expired, others have copied the design and improved it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Stanley sued Barker and Wright for allegedly conspiring
to defraud the corporation of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before his death, Wright agreed to help Stanley, 54,
recover the rocket belt, last flown publicly at an NBA party for
the Houston Rockets at the Houston Ship Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot who flew in that event, Bill Suitor of Lewiston, N.Y.,
said he unstrapped the belt after the flight and handed it to
Barker, who put it in a trailer and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said he does not have the rocket belt and does not know
where it is.
</P>
<P>
   He said sheriff's detectives took him into custody Aug. 19 and
held him for two days without charges being filed and denied his
requests for an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have just tormented me,'' he said. ``They have told my
family members that I killed this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker said several people in Arkansas told detectives he was
there at the time of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have definitely slandered my name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Major Juan Jorge said the department received a letter
from Barker in September concerning the allegations, but that he
has never made a formal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge said Barker has informed him that he would have to make a
sworn statement to the department's internal affairs unit before it
could look into his allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge noted that Barker was in the County Jail recently on a
theft charge and did not even file a formal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   That charge accuses Barker of theft of a firearm from Stanley. A
hearing is scheduled April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said the charge is false and part of Stanley's vendetta
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said the lawsuit and slaying of Wright have dominated
his life for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1994, Stanley said, Barker attacked him with a
hammer, splitting his head open and nearly tearing off a finger.
Barker was convicted and received deferred adjudication. Charges
against Stanley were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said he wants the rocket belt back as well as other
assets of the corporation amounting to about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   That case is scheduled for trial May 17 in the 269th Civil
District Court in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rocket belt contains two tanks filled with hydrogen peroxide
and a third containing nitrogen under high pressure. When the
throttle is opened, the nitrogen pushes the hydrogen peroxide into
a catalyst pack, made up of tightly packed samarium nitrate-coated
silver screens.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the catalyst, the propellant turns into
high-pressure superheated steam that blasts out two nozzles,
providing the lifting thrust.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In 2000, the Insect of the Year may
be the millennium bug. But here in the shady gardens (and sometimes
the quiet bedrooms) of the northern suburbs, 1999 belongs to the
real chitinous-skeletoned thing, the tiny scourge of Johannesburg
known as the Parktown prawn.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans _ even few New Yorkers, who can keep their cool
around cockroaches the size of the villain of ``Men in Black'' _
have heard of Parkies. They are lucky. Johannesburg is rife with
stories of locals who have leapt shrieking from their beds, flung
shoes out windows and nearly crashed their cars, all because they
found themselves mandible to mandible with a big orange
wiggly-antennaed, barbed-leg prawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The males have very large jaws, and the females have big,
scimitar-shaped ovipositors, so they're quite fierce-looking,''
said Caroline Crump, curator of the zoology museum at the
University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. ``And if they're
cornered, they may jump at you. They're just trying to get away,
but people think they're attacking.''
</P>
<P>
   The prawn's tough hide makes it newspaper- and
slipper-resistant. At up to 3 inches long, it has enough body mass
to shake off most household insecticides _ the first shot just
makes it more jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all: when threatened, it empties its bowels of a
noxious black effluvium that disgusts predators and Parktonians
alike.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Libanasidus vittatus is no prawn, nor is it confined
to Parktown, a section of northern Johannesburg. It is a king
cricket. But it does avoid poorer neighborhoods, which tend to be
dry, preferring the wet, leafy gardens of elegant old mansions.
</P>
<P>
   As a species, it may be 200 million years old, but it celebrates
its centenary this year. It was first described in 1899 by
entomologist William Kirby, whose first example still resides at
the Natural History Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   No one is blase about them. The squeamish scream. The first
human words heard by most prawns intrepid enough to explore houses
are ``Eww, gross!'' But entomologists in Pretoria, which is only 40
miles away, ``are very jealous that we have them and they don't,''
said Marcus Byrne, a Johannesburg entomologist. ``As a publicity
hook, it's a brilliant animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The prawn is the centerpiece of an insect exhibit that he and
Professor Crump opened at the Johannesburg Zoo on March 1. Earlier
this year, the insect got its own Web site
(http://home.intekom.com/intekom/parktown prawns/). And, ``if
there's enough demand, we might have a formal birthday party,''
said Professor Rob Toms, curator of entomology at the Transvaal
Museum in Pretoria. ``To the best of my knowledge, that would be
the first time anybody did that for a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatness is being thrust upon the lowly Parkie. Johannesburg's
rough-rock-and-shock-yak radio station, 94.7 Highveld Stereo, whose
sound signature is the beer belch of the host of its ``Rude
Awakening'' morning show, has just adopted it as its billboard
icon. Where the British crown employs a lion and a unicorn to guard
its coat of arms, 94.7 has two prawns rampant flanking an old
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, though, it is not a Johannesburg native. Kirby found
his first in Barberton, a small town on the forested lowveld.
Johannesburg, up on the flat highveld savannah, was once too hot
and dry for them. But trees, lawns and swimming pools have modified
the habitat invitingly.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Professor Crump said, Parktown residents should be
grateful it migrated here. Given their druthers, prawns will eat
garden snails all night long rather than hop into the dog dishes
where they are often found on wet summer mornings.
</P>
<P>
   She worries that they may be threatened. Another South Africa
native that has adapted to urban gardens, the hadeda ibis, enjoys
prawn dinners. Fat gray hadedas, named for their raucous
``hah-dee-dah'' cries, are on the increase and prawns ``are getting
harder to find each year,'' Professor Crump said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   Extinction can't come too soon for some people. Jenny
Crwys-Williams, a talk show host on Radio 702, occasionally
encourages listeners to call in and describe their worst prawn
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our violent society, they've assumed a legendary status,''
she said. ``They just keep coming. You can't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   A disturbing number of her listeners describe moments in which
their first realization that they weren't alone in the bathroom was
a faint tickling sensation on their bare bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crwys-Williams said her favorite caller was a woman who had
been taking a bath with cucumber slices on her eyes. She felt
something scratchy on her sponge as she soaped herself, and ran
screaming into her garden stark naked. A brave neighbor, hearing
the screams, immediately vaulted the garden wall.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Crump said she can top that. A woman who visited her
museum ``to talk about some other bug,'' she said, had a daughter
who woke up to find one on her pillow, staring at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She screamed, and it was so startled it jumped in her mouth,''
she said. ``When she pulled it out _ you know it has those barbs on
its legs _ one of them got stuck. She had to go to hospital.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization authorized
airstrikes against Yugoslavia on Tuesday as President Clinton
declared that force was necessary to halt the aggression of the
Serbs against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign, using primarily American aircraft and cruise
missiles, was poised to begin over southern Serbia and targets in
Kosovo under the cover of night Wednesday, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It would come almost a year after the conflict in Kosovo began
and more than six months after NATO, backed by the Clinton
administration, first threatened the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full explanation of why the administration had
decided NATO should strike, Clinton said in a speech to a union
group here on Tuesday: ``If President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war on the
Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing concerns in the Pentagon about the possible loss of
pilots as they deal with the air defense systems of the Yugoslav
Army, Clinton said: ``I want to level with you. This is like any
other military action. There are risks in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that not acting against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would ``discredit'' NATO by showing that ``we
didn't keep our word.''
</P>
<P>
   The President said that he was acting after lessons learned from
the five-year war in Bosnia. ``We learned that if you don't stand
up to brutality and the killing of innocent people, you invite the
people who do it to do more of it,'' he said. ``We learned that
firmness can save lives, and stop armies.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO military plans accelerated, Milosevic's forces in
Kosovo continued to set fire to houses, sending ethnic Albanians
fleeing into the countryside. Serbian artillery targeted villages
in the central Drenica region, the traditional heartland of the
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 senators and congressmen met with Clinton at the
White House Tuesday morning, and after hearing his arguments for
intervention, rallied around him by canceling a planned Senate
debate on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a debate for another time. We are at a critical
hour,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the near certainty of air strikes, the Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned his aircraft around over the
Atlantic Ocean as it was heading for Washington and postponed a
planned three-day visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, adamantly against NATO air strikes, had made clear that
Primakov would take it as a personal slap in the face if Serbia, a
traditional if frayed ally of Russia, was attacked during
Primakov's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization of the airstrikes by NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana occurred at NATO headquarters in Brussels Tuesday
night after Clinton's envoy, Richard Holbrooke, failed to persuade
Milosevic to agree to a ceasefire in Kosovo that would pave the way
for talks on a peace settlement already agreed to by the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has negotiated many times in the past with
Milosevic, talked with the Yugoslav leader for about six hours in
Belgrade. Lt. Gen. Edward Anderson, accompanying Holbrooke, spelled
out to Milosevic that NATO was planning a heavy air campaign that
would crush his forces in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But while Holbrooke was trying to induce Milosevic toward the
path of peace, the Serbian parliament, apparently under orders from
the authoritarian leader, railed on Tuesday against foreign forces
in Kosovo. ``This was the ultimate two-finger salute by Milosevic
to his friend Holbrooke,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of what administration officials called a
``last chance'' for Milosevic, a subdued Holbrooke flew to NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where he briefed Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Solana gave the go ahead to NATO's Supreme Commander
Gen. Wesley Clark to go ahead with an air campaign. The Secretary
General called Holbrooke a ``great diplomat'' but said that NATO
was taking over.
</P>
<P>
   The planned air attacks would come after a series of diplomatic
efforts by the Clinton administration in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after the massacre of more than 20 ethnic Albanian
civilians by Serb forces, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to agree to
a ceasefire in Kosovo, accept more than 1,000 unarmed monitors and
reduce the number of troops. But within two months Milosevic
violated the agreement by increasing the number of troops and
unleashing them in attacks against civilians and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   After another massacre in January at Rajak, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright orchestrated a diplomatic effort that
culminated in peace talks in France. But while the ethnic
Albanians, including the Kosovo Liberation Army, signed on to an
agreement that gave Kosovo autonomy rather than independence,
Milosevic treated the talks with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   When Holbrooke presented the settlement to Milosevic on Monday
and argued that it suited the Yugoslav leader because it called for
the disarming of the guerrillas, Milosevic was equally dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   As the last minute diplomatic efforts gave way to military
action, Milosevic's forces in Kosovo showed no sign in letting up
in their effort to wipe out the guerrillas of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian offensive, which intensified Saturday as
international monitors left, continued on Tuesday , humanitarian
officials still in Kosovo said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday
that 25,000 ethnic Albanians had been forced to flee their homes
since last Friday and that another 85,000 had become refugees since
the end of peace talks in Rambouillet, France, last month. In all,
there were about 460,000 ethnic Albanian refugees, the United
Nations agency said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since NATO has threatened force against
Milosevic, the State Department said it was suspending all
activities at the American embassy in Belgrade and the remaining
core staff, including the charge d'affaires, Richard Miles, were
leaving Wednesday morning. Other Western embassies, concerned about
being targets of Serb anger, said they were also closing.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO geared up for the final showdown Wednesday night,
administration and NATO officials said they saw only a remote
chance that Milosevic would back down. ``For Milosevic to change
his mind _ I'd say that's very remote,'' said a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and Pentagon planners said that the air campaign would
target Yugoslav military bases, lines of communication, fuel
supplies and ammunition dumps. The idea was to crimp the ability of
the Serbian police units and Yugoslav soldiers to wage war in
Kosovo where they have been burning homes and hitting at KLA
positions.
</P>
<P>
   After a briefing by the Pentagon on Tuesday, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., said: `Unfortunately it's going to be a
devastating series of attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing how the air attack would unfold, a NATO official said
that once the air defense systems had been taken out, and supply
dumps and radar attacked, mobile missiles would be tracked down.
``If they concentrate in one place, we smash them, if they move, we
find them,'' said the official. In this way, Milosevic's ground
force would be ``left without protection,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The risks to everyone _ civilians on the ground and the pilots
in the air _ were much higher than in the desert warfare that the
Pentagon has waged against Iraq, planners said.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the sophisticated air defense systems of the Yugoslav
Army was also less inviting in another respect. ``There won't be
the impressive hits of a desert war and there may not only be
misses but also collateral damage,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   There was also some nervousness about whether air power would be
enough to persuade Milosevic to give up. ``What do we do then?''
asked a Pentagon official, repeating a concern expressed last week
at a congressional hearing by Gen. Charles Krulak, commandant of
the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said Tuesday there was mounting concern about
the need for prolonged attacks against Milosevic's forces. This
could provoke a slaughter in Kosovo by Serbs against ethnic
Albanians and in turn retaliation by ethnic Albanians against
Serbs, said a European diplomat who was about to depart Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If pictures emerge from Kosovo of a slaughter, then there will
be a lot of pressure for the intervention of ground troops,'' the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials said there were no plans for intervening with
the NATO soldiers who have been stationed in Macedonia in
preparation for entry to Kosovo as a peacekeeping force. ``Nobody
is putting together an invasion force, it has never been part of
the discussion,'' said an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   For some diplomats and officials at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, where Clark has made no secret of his judgment that an
air campaign was justified against Milosevic long ago, the mood
this evening was almost jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's accelerating and exhilarating,'' said one official.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ When Slobodan Milosevic and Richard Holbrooke first met
in August 1995, an onlooker remarked of their prolonged and
animated exchange, ``The two egos danced all night.''
</P>
<P>
   From that first encounter in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, through many
desperate sessions at the Bosnia peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, to
the fruitless talks in the Yugoslav capital Tuesday, a particularly
charged chemistry has existed between the Yugoslav president and
Washington's Balkan envoy: a web of repulsion, rancor and grudging
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Through its highs and lows, its tantrums and its truces, the
relationship has brought results _ most conspicuously, a belated
peace in Bosnia that was forged in Ohio in November 1995 and has
held ever since. But on Tuesday, it seems, nothing could be
conjured from the old ties, not even a diplomatic phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in the Balkans is ``the bleakest since we began
this effort almost four years ago,'' Holbrooke told CNN, adding
that Milosevic was not even ready to enter serious talks on the
deployment of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These words, bereft of any hint of compromise, appeared to open
the way for the United States and its allies to reverse course and
bomb the country led by the man they rehabilitated and turned into
their de facto ally at Dayton just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long road for Holbrooke. The observer who watched
and recorded the egos dancing that first night in Belgrade was
Robert Frasure, a seasoned State Department official who was killed
five days later in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, as Holbrooke knows, it was Milosevic who sent
Frasure and two other senior American officials to their deaths on
Aug. 19, 1995, by refusing to provide security guarantees for a
flight from Belgrade to Sarajevo and so obliging the officials to
take a dangerous mountain road where their vehicle crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that accident, on a mission he was leading, Holbrooke
has been obsessed by the memory of his fallen colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a man seldom lacking in energy or drive, the loss has
added an overwhelming personal determination to somehow wrestle
Milosevic to the floor and bring an end to the wars of Yugoslavia's
slow destruction that began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Another memory has also colored Holbrooke's relationship with
Milosevic, whose 12 years in power have coincided with an almost
uninterrupted cycle of killing. That memory is of the start of the
Bosnian war in the summer of 1992, when Holbrooke was a direct
witness to the murderous Serbian rampage against the Muslims that
marked the first six months of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Banja Luka, at the heart of the horror, a Muslim survivor of
a Serbian concentration camp handed Holbrooke a wooden carving of
man with head bowed. Asked once if he thought of that carving when
speaking to Milosevic, he replied, ``No, it's not that linear.'' He
added: ``But I understand the connection. I'm sure we all do.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection, of course, is the one between Milosevic and the
killing for which he has so often denied responsibility: the single
chain that links the Serbian leader's quashing of Kosovo's autonomy
in the late 1980s, his relentless whipping of the Serbs into a fury
of nationalist indignation, and his arming of the marauding Serbian
militias of 1992 that hounded Muslim civilians into packed camps in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has never had any illusions about any of this; he
would not argue with the notion that he has been talking to an
unusually destructive man. But when he began his diplomacy in 1995,
he found Milosevic was anxious to end a Bosnian war that was
turning against the Serbs. There lay the seeds of a bond of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   There were other elements to the initial success of the
relationship. Milosevic's dismissal of detail _ referred to, in his
broken English, as ``mere technology'' _ was attractive to
Holbrooke, who likes the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian leader's extraordinary power _ he gave away Sarajevo
with a wave of the hand at Dayton _ was also useful to the American
envoy: In effect, Holbrooke was able to move fast because he had to
deal with only one man.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting, cajoling, laughing, raging, the two men gradually
learned how to deal with each other. Each understood that the other
had a deep respect for force. Milosevic has made a habit, as in
Kosovo, of applying military might even as he talks. Holbrooke was
convinced by the successful NATO bombing of Bosnia in 1995 that
Balkan diplomacy unbacked by force amounts to dithering.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir of Balkan diplomacy, ``To End a War,'' Holbrooke
held back from an in-depth portrait of his Serbian interlocutor, no
doubt because, as events have proved, he knew he had unfinished
business.
</P>
<P>
   But at one point Holbrooke wrote, ``Watching Milosevic turn on
the charm, someone observed that had fate dealt him a different
birthplace and education, he would have been a successful
politician in a democratic system.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That ``charm'' has not been much in evidence of late, and it
seems clear that the intensity, even the thrill, of the two men's
initial jousting has gradually given way to a battle marked mainly
by sourness and mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   After his Kosovo diplomacy last October, which brought a fragile
truce that soon collapsed, Holbrooke expressed only exasperation
over his meetings with Milosevic, saying he would be happy if he
never had to return to Belgrade again.
</P>
<P>
   But events have brought this most forceful of American diplomats
back to the scene of his first meeting with Milosevic, only in
changed circumstances. Kosovo, of course, is not Bosnia. It is
still seen by many Serbs as the womb of their civilization; it
lies, formally speaking, within Serbia; it is the place where
Milosevic's rise to power began.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the question of placing foreign troops on Serbian soil
is as explosive as any can be in Belgrade. It was precisely
Serbia's refusal to allow the Austro-Hungarian police into the
country to investigate the killing of the Hapsburg heir, Archduke
Franz Ferdinand, that ushered in World War I. Such acts resonate in
Serbia as if they happened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Having fought, for much of the last 200 years, for the territory
it now controls, Serbia is passionately, irrationally and often
destructively attached to every inch of it. Even a man of the power
of Milosevic can scarcely ignore this overwhelming national
sentiment, as Holbrooke knows.
</P>
<P>
   How, in these circumstances, he thought he could sway the
Serbian leader _ squeeze out one last waltz in the long dance _
remains unclear. On Tuesday the envoy expressed indignation at how
American plans were being ``grossly mischaracterized'' by Serbian
politicians and suggested that their comments revealed ``a lot of
history'' and ``a lot of misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing new about this state of affairs. A lot of
history and a lot of misunderstanding have accompanied Serbia's
destructive implosion for more than a decade. What is new is that
Holbrooke seems unable to use Milosevic to bully his way past the
Serbian bravura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent many hours with him, but I would not say that I
know him in the sense that I can see inside his mind,'' Holbrooke
said Tuesday of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy is about understanding even the most destructive of
minds. Holbrooke has proved unusually adept at that. But perhaps
his _ and America's _ patience with the Serbian leader has simply
run out.

ACTING AS HIS OWN LAWYER, KEVORKIAN STUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Insisting upon acting as his own lawyer in his
trial for first-degree murder, Dr. Jack Kevorkian stumbled
conspicuously through the first day of testimony on Tuesday, asking
witnesses legally inappropriate questions and raising impermissible
legal arguments as he tried to convince a jury to acquit him for
his role in ending the life of a seriously ill man.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of legal skill was especially evident as he sought to
call his first witness, the wife of the dead man. He was unable to
convince the judge that the woman's testimony was relevant and
should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, what you seek to introduce is not cognizable under the
laws of the state of Michigan,'' Judge Jessica Cooper of Oakland
County Circuit Court told Kevorkian early Tuesday afternoon out of
the hearing of the jury, which was dismissed so that she could
discuss Kevorkian's efforts to introduce testimony from the wife,
and his other proposed witness, the dead man's brother. Prosecutors
contend that the testimony would serve only to promote the jury's
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law in Michigan is very clear,'' she said, patiently
explaining to the 70-year-old pathologist that she could not let
the man's relatives testify that the man consented to his death,
because consent is not a legal defense for murder. ``And I know
that you disagree with that,'' the judge continued, ``and I know
that that's what you want to talk to the jury about. But you can't.
The jury doesn't decide whether the law is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she decided that the defense would submit a brief by
Wednesday morning, laying out their arguments for the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented a key piece of evidence Tuesday: a
videotape that Kevorkian made of himself injecting the man, Thomas
Youk, with a fatal dose of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But while that evidence and Kevorkian's weak performance as a
lawyer may allow prosecutors to shut down much of his legal
defense, it is hardly certain that a jury will convict him of
murder, which could mean a life sentence. Experts say it will be
tough to convince a jury that granting a desperately ill man's wish
to die is equivalent to the average person's idea of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Cooper was careful to lecture Kevorkian only when the jury
was out of the room. She repeatedly implored him to reconsider his
decision to represent himself. On Monday, before jury selection
began, she had cautioned him about the risks, asking if he had seen
the inside of a state prison. He said he had seen the prison-break
movie ``The Shawshank Redemption'' twice.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Tuesday, as Kevorkian's proposed witness was being
discussed, the judge said, ``You need to have counsel here and in
the waiver of counsel you put yourself in a difficult position.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevorkian said he did not think a lawyer could explain his
position better. So the judge urged him to pay closer attention to
the coaching of two lawyers who were advising him on the case. From
the defense table, the lawyers, admittedly frustrated, frequently
beckoned to Kevorkian during his arguments, but he did not always
appear to heed what they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is attempting to convict you of murder in the first
degree,'' said the judge, referring to the prosecutor. ``If your
attorneys are telling you that there's something going on here that
you need to object to than you need to get up and object.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I cannot be here as a law professor and a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, who claims to have helped more than 130 people commit
suicide, is on trial in the September death of Youk, 52, of
Waterford Township, Mich., who suffered from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fifth trial for Kevorkian; he was acquitted three
times, and a fourth case ended in a mistrial. But in each of the
four previous trials he was charged with violating assisted suicide
laws, not with committing murder. In those cases, Kevorkian did not
inject people directly but used a ``suicide machine'' that allowed
them to pull a string and administer the dose themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those trials, he was represented by the flamboyant
and aggressive lawyer Geoffrey Fieger, who helped persuade the jury
that Kevorkian was simply acceding to the wishes of a terminally
ill person.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this case, prosecutors believe they can prove murder partly
because of Kevorkian's videotape, which he took to the CBS
television news program ``60 Minutes.'' The program was broadcast
in November, along with an interview in which Kevorkian dared
prosecutors to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution started and finished its case Tuesday morning,
presenting the videotape, along with excerpts from the ``60
Minutes'' broadcast. Kevorkian cross-examined two of the
prosecution's three witnesses, becoming confrontational with the
third, his longtime nemesis, the Oakland County medical examiner.
For example, he asked the medical examiner if he was personally
against euthanasia, a question not legally permissible.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, who has not yet said whether he will testify himself,
argues that he did not intend to kill Youk, only to end his
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors initially charged Kevorkian with assisted suicide as
well as murder, but they dropped the lesser charge after Judge
Cooper ruled that the defense could present evidence of Youk's pain
and suffering in an assisted suicide case, but not in a murder
case.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling appeared to be limiting the defense strategy on
Tuesday, as Kevorkian sought to have Youk's wife, Melody, testify
about how her husband wanted to end his suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're talking about is mercy killing,'' Judge Cooper
said, explaining that euthanasia is not a defense for murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you may say it's mercy killing, but I call it something
else,'' Kevorkian replied. ``I call it a medical service for an
agonized incurably suffering patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian appeared to be becoming agitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have fine stipulations of law standing in the way, to
a dedicated physician, and I am, my integrity would be killed,
destroyed if I turned my back on that patient,'' he said. ``That's
worse than taking my life. Why do you think I don't fear prison? My
intent is not to kill. It's to do my duty as a physician. And that
often has disagreeable outcomes.''

 &HT;    KOSOVO CRISIS COMES DOWN TO AIRSTRIKES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- NATO on Tuesday ordered airstrikes against Serb
military positions, citing a ''moral duty'' to end the bloody
repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and a strategic interest
in preventing a widening conflict in the troubled Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. pilots poised to lead the attack, President Clinton
said he reluctantly approved military action only after the
collapse of months of diplomacy aimed at halting a Serb campaign
that has left more than 2,000 dead and a quarter of a million
homeless in the tiny province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop an authoritarian regime from repressing its
people in Europe at the end of the 20th century,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana. ``We have a moral duty to do
so...and we will fulfill it.'' Hundreds of NATO warplanes and
support craft -- 250 of them American -- stood by ready to bomb the
Serbs and a half dozen U.S. ships and submarines awaited nearby,
bristling with long-range cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Calling on Americans ''to say a prayer,'' for the safety of U.S.
pilots, Clinton said the dangers they face are outweighed by the
risks of inaction, an option that would invite ``more massacres,
more refugees, more victims, more people crying out for revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a two-hour White House briefing on the crisis by
Clinton and his top foreign policy advisers, Republican and
Democratic congressional leaders emerged to offer support for the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 58-41 late Tuesday to support the mission, and
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said he expected a similar action on
his side of the Capitol soon.
</P>
<P>
   Solana announced the NATO decision hours after special U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke ended a last-ditch effort at diplomacy in
Belgrade, where Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, repeated his opposition to a U.S.-backed plan that
calls for placing 28,000 NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a somber Holbrooke left the Yugoslav capital, Milosevic
braced his country for imminent war and declared a nationwide state
of emergency, mobilizing thousands of troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case war is imposed on us, we will defend from the
aggressors with all available means,'' Gorica Gajevic, the
general-secretary of Milosevic's Socialist Party, said during an
emergency session of Serbian Parliament. ``We are not accepting
foreign military troops on our territory under any excuse and at
any price, even at the price of bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, some 40,000 Serb troops and police backed by an
estimated 300 tanks and other armored vehicles were massed in or
around Kosovo, a province of 2.2 million 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav state of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Solana stressed that the NATO strikes he ordered are meant to
end the bloody repression those troops have inflicted upon ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, not the Serbian public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is not waging war against Yugoslavia. We have no quarrel
with the people of Yugoslavia, a people who for too long have been
isolated in Europe because of the policies of their government,''
Solana said. ``Our objective is to prevent more human suffering,
more repression, more violence against the civilian population of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the NATO decision prompted an immediate split between
the United States and Russia, which has opposed military strikes
against the Serbs, who share historic and cultural ties with the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic gesture high above the Atlantic, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov cancelled a long-scheduled official visit
to the White House, ordering his airplane to turn around between
Ireland and Newfoundland after Vice President Al Gore, in a
15-minute telephone conversation, informed him of NATO's position.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Solana stressed the dangers the Kosovo crisis
poses to regional stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The tinderbox for World War I, a savage killing ground in World
War II and a frontier where East clashed uneasily with West
throughout the Cold War, the Balkans, Clinton said, have been an
achilles heel in European stability throughout a tumultuous
century.
</P>
<P>
   Both Solana and Clinton made clear, however, that the decision
to strike was driven by a determination in Washington and European
capitals to prevent a repeat in Kosovo of Serb offenses that left
more than 200,000 dead and another 3 million homeless in 3.5 years
of fighting in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we learn in Bosnia,'' Clinton said, speaking to a
group of state and local officials in Washington. ``We learned that
if you don't stand up to brutality and the killing of innocent
people, you invite the people who do it to do more of it. We
learned that firmness can save lives, and stop armies.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO airstrikes have two objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal is to compel Milosevic to accept the
international peace plan, and the NATO implementation force the
plan would mandate.
</P>
<P>
   White House and Pentagon officials acknowledge privately that
there's no assurance that military action would force Milosevic to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, the strikes would continue with the aim of
damaging the Serb military machine to the point that it could no
longer sustain its campaign of terror against Kosovo civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to prevent more human suffering, more
repression, more violence against the civilian population of
Kosovo,'' said Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the House approved a measure backing the use
of U.S. troops as part of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo in
the event such a force was approved by both the Kosovar Albanians
</P>
<P>
   and Yugoslavia. For the moment, at least, Clinton has ruled out
the use of U.S. ground troops to try to impose peace upon Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate plea for support for the NATO airstrikes, the
president recalled the war in Bosnia, in which Serb troops fought a
decision by the democratically elected Bosnian parliament to secede
from the former Yugoslavia, which shattered into five pieces
following the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Atrocities were committed by Serbs and non-Serbs alike in
Bosnia, but the vast majority of military attacks against civilians
were committed by Serbs. They laid siege to the city of Sarajevo,
routinely fired on women and children and systematically shelled
villages, burned homes and otherwise terrorized non-Serb
communities.
</P>
<P>
   That war ended in the fall of 1995, only after a week and a half
of NATO airstrikes against Serbs followed by weeks of U.S.-led
diplomacy ending in the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that the carnage and destruction Milosevic
visited upon Bosnia could not be repeated in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Milosevic started the war in Bosnia seven years
ago, the world did not act quickly enough to stop him,'' said
Clinton. ``Innocent people were herded into concentration camps.
Children were gunned down by snipers on their way to school. Soccer
fields and parks were turned into cemeteries...this was a genocide
in the heart of Europe. It did not happen in 1945; it was going on
in 1995.''

IN THE HORROR OF CAPSIZED WATER RIDE, DEATH APPEARED NEAR
</HEADLINE>

And JAN JARVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As Ginny Venneberg described it, her two
young daughters were drowning in a ride at Six Flags Over Texas and
she was helpless to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Venneberg herself was upside down under water. It was dark. She
was disoriented. Her leg was broken. She could not find her
children, and she feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we were going to make it,'' Venneberg, 40, said
Monday at Fort Worth's Cook Children's Medical Center, where she
and her daughters _ Jessica, 9, and Ashley, 7 _ described Sunday's
harrowing experience on the Roaring Rapids ride at Six Flags in
nearby Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas woman, Valeria Cartwright, died in the accident, and
10 people were injured, including the Vennebergs.
</P>
<P>
   Venneberg's husband, Fred, was kept overnight at Arlington
Memorial Hospital, where he was checked out for an irregular
heartbeat, probably due to the stress of the ordeal, Ginny
Venneberg said. Jessica had bruises on her stomach and back from
the raft's seat belt, and Ashley was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Vennebergs had arrived Friday from Lawrence, Kan., for a
spring break vacation. It was their first visit to Six Flags, and
they were taking advantage of a free ticket that third-grader
Jessica had won in a competition called MathCounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Venneberg said the raft started taking on water soon after
the ride started.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the raft flipped, Venneberg said, water in the round
boat was at midcalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't draining away. I told another lady, `This boat is
going to sink,' '' she said. ``The boat kind of stopped on a ridge
like it couldn't get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly it was dark and they were under water, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Christie Wilson, 23, of Everman, Texas, was also on the raft.
She said that when she felt it popping up into the air, then
flipping over into the water, she was grateful that her friend
somehow managed to reach over and unhook the seat belt that held
them both in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had she not done that, I don't think I would be alive now, ''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Once under water, Wilson said, she was apparently the only one
who did not have the seat belt still on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel people struggling, arms just trying and trying to
get the seat belt off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, Wilson didn't know what to think, she just
reacted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all thought we were going to die,'' she said. ``The
water was very cold. I couldn't see anything because the water was
so dark green.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she got her bearings, Wilson spotted a little girl in the
water whose seat belt was still on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get the seat belt loose, so I just grabbed hold of
her and pulled her out,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   That little girl may have been Ashley Venneberg, who said she
wasn't sure who rescued her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another woman got me to a safe spot,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, too, was unsure who the girl was amid the chaos. She
said she just struggled to hold the child's head above water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get out because we were too far from anything,''
Wilson said. ``She was barely breathing, and she had taken in a lot
of water. Finally somebody who worked there got another raft.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's sister, Jessica, said she believes she and at least two
others were pulled out by her dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared. I thought I was going to die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she noticed that at least three people had jumped
into the water to help in the rescue. She said her friend tried to
help a man whose head was trapped between the rubber seal and the
hard plastic shell of the raft.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was trying her hardest to hold the raft up so he could get
out,'' she said. ``It was hard because the water was moving and she
was floating down the river with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the next thing she realized, was she was being
pulled to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Venneberg said her family had planned to stay in the area
for a week but that they were hoping to fly home yesterday evening
instead.
</P>
<P>
   She said she harbored no resentment toward the amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful my family is alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica, asked if she would ever go on the ride again, said: ``I
won't go on that ride, but I'll go on other ones.''

pilots, Clinton said the dangers they face are outweighed by the
risks of inaction, an option that would invite ``more massacres,
more refugees, more victims, more people crying out for revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a two-hour White House briefing on the crisis by
Clinton and his top foreign policy advisers, Republican and
Democratic congressional leaders emerged to offer support for the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 58-41 late Tuesday to support the mission, and
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said he expected a similar action on
his side of the Capitol soon.
</P>
<P>
   Solana announced the NATO decision hours after special U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke ended a last-ditch effort at diplomacy in
Belgrade, where Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, repeated his opposition to a U.S.-backed plan that
calls for placing 28,000 NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a somber Holbrooke left the Yugoslav capital, Milosevic
braced his country for imminent war and declared a nationwide state
of emergency, mobilizing thousands of troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case war is imposed on us, we will defend from the
aggressors with all available means,'' Gorica Gajevic, the
general-secretary of Milosevic's Socialist Party, said during an
emergency session of Serbian Parliament. ``We are not accepting
foreign military troops on our territory under any excuse and at
any price, even at the price of bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, some 40,000 Serb troops and police backed by an
estimated 300 tanks and other armored vehicles were massed in or
around Kosovo, a province of 2.2 million 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav state of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Solana stressed that the NATO strikes he ordered are meant to
end the bloody repression those troops have inflicted upon ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, not the Serbian public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is not waging war against Yugoslavia. We have no quarrel
with the people of Yugoslavia, a people who for too long have been
isolated in Europe because of the policies of their government,''
Solana said. ``Our objective is to prevent more human suffering,
more repression, more violence against the civilian population of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the NATO decision prompted an immediate split between
the United States and Russia, which has opposed military strikes
against the Serbs, who share historic and cultural ties with the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic gesture high above the Atlantic, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov cancelled a long-scheduled official visit
to the White House, ordering his airplane to turn around between
Ireland and Newfoundland after Vice President Al Gore, in a
15-minute telephone conversation, informed him of NATO's position.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Solana stressed the dangers the Kosovo crisis
poses to regional stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The tinderbox for World War I, a savage killing ground in World
War II and a frontier where East clashed uneasily with West
throughout the Cold War, the Balkans, Clinton said, have been an
achilles heel in European stability throughout a tumultuous
century.
</P>
<P>
   Both Solana and Clinton made clear, however, that the decision
to strike was driven by a determination in Washington and European
capitals to prevent a repeat in Kosovo of Serb offenses that left
more than 200,000 dead and another 3 million homeless in 3.5 years
of fighting in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we learn in Bosnia,'' Clinton said, speaking to a
group of state and local officials in Washington. ``We learned that
if you don't stand up to brutality and the killing of innocent
people, you invite the people who do it to do more of it. We
learned that firmness can save lives, and stop armies.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO airstrikes have two objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal is to compel Milosevic to accept the
international peace plan, and the NATO implementation force the
plan would mandate.
</P>
<P>
   White House and Pentagon officials acknowledge privately that
there's no assurance that military action would force Milosevic to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, the strikes would continue with the aim of
damaging the Serb military machine to the point that it could no
longer sustain its campaign of terror against Kosovo civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to prevent more human suffering, more
repression, more violence against the civilian population of
Kosovo,'' said Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the House approved a measure backing the use
of U.S. troops as part of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo in
the event such a force was approved by both the Kosovar Albanians
</P>
<P>
   and Yugoslavia. For the moment, at least, Clinton has ruled out
the use of U.S. ground troops to try to impose peace upon Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate plea for support for the NATO airstrikes, the
president recalled the war in Bosnia, in which Serb troops fought a
decision by the democratically elected Bosnian parliament to secede
from the former Yugoslavia, which shattered into five pieces
following the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Atrocities were committed by Serbs and non-Serbs alike in
Bosnia, but the vast majority of military attacks against civilians
were committed by Serbs. They laid siege to the city of Sarajevo,
routinely fired on women and children and systematically shelled
villages, burned homes and otherwise terrorized non-Serb
communities.
</P>
<P>
   That war ended in the fall of 1995, only after a week and a half
of NATO airstrikes against Serbs followed by weeks of U.S.-led
diplomacy ending in the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that the carnage and destruction Milosevic
visited upon Bosnia could not be repeated in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Milosevic started the war in Bosnia seven years
ago, the world did not act quickly enough to stop him,'' said
Clinton. ``Innocent people were herded into concentration camps.
Children were gunned down by snipers on their way to school. Soccer
fields and parks were turned into cemeteries...this was a genocide
in the heart of Europe. It did not happen in 1945; it was going on
in 1995.''

PARK VISITOR TRIED TO SAVE WOMAN WHO LATER DIED
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Valeria Cartwright still had a pulse when
Wendy Crown began a desperate struggle to save her life as the
woman floated face up inside a raft in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a faint pulse; I had sporadic breathing,'' she said.
``There was still life going on in that body.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, 28, of West Helena, Ark., was dead on arrival at an
Arlington hospital on Sunday after the Roaring Rapids raft she was
riding at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington capsized. Ten others
were injured when the boat overturned in four feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Crown, who said she is certified as a master dive instructor,
was waiting with her son to ride the Roaring Rapids when she saw
the raft in the water underneath a bridge suddenly dip down, make a
loud noise and flip.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who is trained in water rescue, Crown said she was
prepared to offer her help as she began moving toward the area
where the boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hollered out, `I'm a dive instructor,' '' she said. ``A
staff person told me, `Do not go in the water.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But she could see wallets and watches floating in the water and
Crown said one Six Flags employee nearby appeared to be
hyperventilating. So Crown took off her hiking boots and went in
the water, where she could see people in the raft floating face up
in the water. She said she saw one man being tended to, so she
moved toward a woman whose eyes had rolled back in her head.
</P>
<P>
   She checked the pulse of the unconscious woman, who she later
learned was Cartwright. The woman's camera was still tied to her
belt when Crown approached her and began performing mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did five to eight breaths and she started throwing up in my
mouth,'' said Crown, 44, a financial adviser in Richardson. ``I
sensed that she had started breathing, then she convulsed.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued trying to revive her and estimated that it took
her 15 to 20 minutes to reach the dock, where a uniformed man
pulled her to the deck and took over.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the dock, Crown said, she ran into one of Cartwright's
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said a prayer on the dock,'' Crown said.

PROCEDURES AND SAFETY AT SIX FLAGS TO BE REVIEWED
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanies SIX FLAGS-SURVIVORS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By SEAN WOOD c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ A review of safety procedures and emergency
responses will be part of a Six Flags Over Texas investigation of
an accident that killed a 28-year-old park guest Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring Rapids ride had been inspected by park employees
Sunday morning and had a clean bill of health from the Texas
Department of Insurance. But an accident late Sunday afternoon
killed Valeria Cartwright and injured 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials, ride safety inspectors, insurance officials and
safety officials from the park's corporate parent descended on Six
Flags on Monday to investigate the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really casting a very wide net,'' said Nancy St. Pierre,
Six Flags spokeswoman. ``We're looking at our procedures, how we
responded and what the ride was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The park does not require water-rescue training for the staff at
the ride, which sends passengers in rafts through a simulated set
of river rapids. St. Pierre said none of the park's water rides,
including Splashwater Falls and the Log Ride, requires water-rescue
training.
</P>
<P>
   That could change after a review of the accident, she said. She
would not speculate on whether more employees will be trained in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The only employees now required to
have CPR training are the park's paramedics. Four certified
paramedics were on duty at the park at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   When the accident occurred, the ride operator brought the ride
to an emergency stop and notified park operations. Park operations
then called the security office and the health and safety office.
An official in the health and safety office dispatched two
paramedics to the scene to assess the situation before calling 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees did exactly what they are trained to do,'' St.
Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the park's paramedics arrived, St. Pierre said,
other park security and operations people had heard the call over
their radios and arrived on the scene. Park employees, along with
some Roaring Rapids passengers, helped free people from the
overturned raft, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, park officials said that they had no idea what caused
the accident and that the ride was in full compliance with state
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically looked to make sure everything was in order,''
said Mark Hanna, spokesman with the Texas Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance department requires that all rides be inspected
annually by either an independent ride inspector or the ride
owner's insurance company. Amusement parks also must carry at least
$1 million in liability insurance on each ride and must make
quarterly injury reports.
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre said all the rides at the park had been checked by an
independent inspector before March 6, the start of the park's 1999
operating season.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was also inspected Sunday morning by Six Flags
employees. Four departments _ fiberglass, electrical, mechanical
and operations _ signed off on it, park officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come out and reinspect each and every ride,'' St.
Pierre said. ``Every morning there is a major inspection. Every
inch of every ride is inspected.''
</P>
<P>
   During the off season, everything that carries passengers is
removed and tested for stress and structural damage. All seven
boats that were operating Sunday at the Roaring Rapids ride had new
components, such as tubes, seat belts, upholstery and ropes
securing the tubes to the raft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an impeccable safety record,'' St. Pierre said.
``Safety is paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   All employees working at a ride are tested on the park's
response to emergency situations and must correctly answer at least
90 percent of the questions, St. Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   All five employees who were working at the ride at the time of
the accident are seasonal employees and had passed the required
safety tests, St. Pierre said. While some employees are trained on
more than one ride, St. Pierre said these employees were all
trained on the Roaring Rapids.

 &HT;    NATO airstrikes only temporary solution to age-old conflict
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For some reason I have a hard time keeping up with
who is killing whom over what in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the centuries-old religious and tribal feuds of
the Middle East is a walk in the park compared to that chunk of
land in Europe that has been conquered, split up, and forced
together so many times that there shouldn't be any fight left in
the current inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a millennium or two of being pushed around has made the
separate ethnic, cultural and religious groups fighting mad over
unresolved grudges passed from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   Now the United States and NATO are prepared to take sides in
these ancient Balkan blood feuds by dropping bombs on Serbs who
have been busy killing and running off their own citizens in the
southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Serbia's Kosovo residents are Albanians.
Albania is a country west and south of Serbia's Kosovo province.
Albania is primarily Muslim, whereas Serbia is primarily Orthodox
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo has never been an independent nation. But Kosovo's
Albanian secessionists proclaimed Kosovo as the independent
Republic of Kosovo in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army launched vicious attacks against
Serbian government forces. Predictably, that was followed by much
more vicious attacks by superior Serbian forces against Kosovo's
Albanian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevec and other Serbian officials
apparently have decided that if Kosovo's Albanians want to live in
an independent country then the Serbian military will force them
out of Serbia and back into Albania, or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalists are still resentful over the battle of Kosovo
Field in 1389 when Serbia's Prince Lazar was executed after his
capture by Turkish forces. A Serb posing as a deserter was able to
stab to death Turkish Sultan Murad I before Serbia fell under
Ottoman rule. That Serb, Milosh Obilich, is celebrated today.
Obilich's sacrifice 610 years ago is being used today to punish the
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys in this region
of the world except when one side gets the upper hand and starts
killing noncombatants when there are television cameras around to
beam the carnage into homes worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The only times when these diverse ethnic, religious and cultural
groups in the Balkans have not been at each others' throats were
under repressive totalitarian regimes such as Germany's Nazis or
the Soviet Union's communism.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were accused of employing similar ``ethnic cleansing''
policies against the Bosnians the last time President Clinton sent
U.S. military planes into the region. Then, as now, members of
Congress wanted to know exactly what was America's national
security interest in the former Yugoslavia and how long would our
troops be there.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments in support of U.S. military intervention in the
Balkans are basically two _ one strategic and the other ethical.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic argument holds that the violence must be contained
before it spills out to Macedonia, Greece and Turkey, causing
worldwide alliances to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical argument holds up the example of the Holocaust and
the shameful reluctance of the United States to get involved in
European affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both are compelling arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It's inconceivable, however, that dropping a few bombs will have
any permanent impact. The animosities nurtured by the Balkan
peoples have roots that stretch back more than a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans, we should do what we can, when we can, to relieve
suffering worldwide. At the same time, we must recognize that we
can't solve all the world's problems.

MALONE: OSUNA NOT READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ A year ago, right-hander Antonio Osuna began
the season as the Dodgers closer. This season he might begin it by
making rehab appearances with Single-A San Bernardino in the
California League.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who's encountered setbacks in trying to return from elbow
surgery, might not be ready for the season opener April 5 against
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at him probably not being ready,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said Tuesday. ``There's no advantage taking
risks. If (he's ready) one week into the season, two weeks into the
season or a month, there's no reason to take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who was 7-1 with six saves and a 3.06 ERA last season,
underwent surgery to remove a bone spur in his pitching elbow Sept.
8. He experienced discomfort in his elbow after throwing a few
bullpen sessions earlier in the spring. The Dodgers backed off his
work routine until the soreness went away, and Osuna threw on the
side with manager Davey Johnson late last week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said there is nothing wrong with the repaired components
of the elbow and was pleased with Osuna's progress in the last few
days. However, Malone said he would like to get Osuna into five to
seven spring games before he's declared ready for the season.
Including today's game with the Cleveland Indians, the Dodgers have
11 exhibition games remaining, which doesn't give Osuna much time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things have to happen every day for us to think he can be
ready to open the season,'' Malone said. ``My guess is he'll be
close enough to where he'll go with us when we go west. If he needs
game action, San Bernardino won't be far behind us (in starting the
season) and he could go there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sheffield named in suit: The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel
reported that Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield was named in a
paternity suit filed in Florida's Broward County Court. The suit
alleges Sheffield is the father of Garrett Wan-Dre Sheffield, born
Jan. 13 to Wandra Y. Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said Carey is seeking child support, medical and life
insurance for the child. Sheffield wasn't in Dodgertown on Tuesday
because it was an off day. He couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The suit adds to the tumultuous spring training for him. He's
been plagued by a sore right shoulder, expressed frustration about
playing left field, talked about retirement and said he felt
singled out for Dodgers' stance against facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Johnson said shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, bothered by shin splints the last few days, should be
ready to play today. . . . Right-hander Ismael Valdes continued his
stellar spring with another strong outing. He allowed one run on
five hits in five innings in a Triple-A game against the Florida
Marlins. Valdes struck out three and didn't walk a batter.

   MOSCOW _ Azerbaijan has detained a Russian transport plane that
was ferrying arms to Yugoslavia in violation of an international
embargo, a senior Azerbaijani official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Vafa Guluzade, chief foreign-policy adviser to
President Heydar Aliyev, said the transport plane was carrying six
MIG jet fighters for the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Guluzade said the plane took off from Kazakhstan and was
impounded last week after stopping in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations brought a sharp denial from the Russian Foreign
Ministry, which insisted that the plane had been bound for
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Slovakia said, however, that they knew nothing
about the shipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Slovak Republic does not have any connection with these
MIG's,'' a spokesman for the defense ministry, Pavel Vitko, said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mystery, documents obtained by authorities in
Azerbaijan variously listed the cargo as destined for North Korea
and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of the plane occurs at a critical juncture.
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia said on Tuesday that NATO
air strikes could lead to an end of the United Nations ban on arms
for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities insist that they have been abiding by the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is a huge AN-124 with a Russian flag painted on the
nose that has been sitting at the Baku airport, cordoned off by
Azerbaijan guards, since last week. The crew and passengers _ 18
Russians and 14 Kazakhstan citizens of Russian ethnicity _ have had
their passports confiscated and are being detained at a hotel
there.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off from the southern Kazakh city of
Taldy-Kurgan. Russian-made fighters are stored in Kazakhstan
because of its dry weather, according to Paul Beaver of Jane's
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   Russian air force officials said the plane was owned by the
Volga-Dnieper Co., which controls much of the air-cargo business in
Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry said, however, the plane was
owned by the Polyot Aviation Co., another Russian entity.
</P>
<P>
   The plane arrived in Baku for refueling, Russian officials said.
Azerbaijani customs officials said its papers were not in order.
</P>
<P>
   Flight plans filed in advance by the Russians listed the final
destination as Pyongyang, North Korea, the customs officials said.
The documents said the plane was carrying 50 tons of cargo and a
crew of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijani officials said they had found six MIG-21 fighters,
broken down to fit in the transport plane, and almost twice as many
people on board. The crew reportedly insisted then that the cargo
was being sent to Bratislava, Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia denied that.
</P>
<P>
   A customs declaration on the plane also listed the recipient as
the Agroplast Co. in the Czech Republic. The sender was listed as
the Uralsky Metallist Plant in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   A Czech official said Agroplast produced granite and sandstone,
not military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such discrepancies, Azerbaijan started an
investigation. Guluzade, who has criticized Moscow, said the cargo
was intended for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   If the cargo was intended for Yugoslavia it is not clear whether
the operation was sanctioned by the Russian government or it was a
rogue maneuver by corrupt executives.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has not taken the seizure lightly. Deputy Foreign
Minister Leonid Drachevsky met Aliyev in Baku on Tuesday and
demanded the release of the plane. He said the detention violated
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan has ignored that demand. Relations between Azerbaijan
and Russia are strained. Azerbaijan has been particularly irritated
with Russia's use of fighter planes and antiaircraft systems in
neighboring Armenia, Azerbaijan's chief adversary.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Azerbaijan has sounded the
alarms about the Russians. In March 1998, Azerbaijan customs
officials detained a Russian truck on its way to Iran. The truck
was laden with 22 tons of stainless steel that could be used to
make missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had asked the Russians to stop the shipment,
which left from Moscow. The Russians failed to do so. The Americans
kept the seizure quiet, but then Azerbaijan decided to announce its
triumph.  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After meeting with President Clinton on Tuesday,
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, remained tight-lipped about
whether he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on May 4,
as he has indicated he might, and administration officials said
they gleaned no clue about which way he might be leaning.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton told Arafat that the United States is
firmly against such a declaration.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also reassured Arafat that the United States would
stand by him through the remainder of the peace negotiations with
Israel, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the hourlong session, which was sandwiched into a
day when the administration was laying the groundwork for NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, Arafat declined to discuss the
substance of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very, very extensive and in-depth conversation on
this issue, and I will not deliberate on what took place between me
and him,'' Arafat said through an interpreter in a brief session
with reporters in the White House driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that came out of the meeting with
President Clinton,'' he added, ``is that in spite of all the
difficulties and obstacles we face today, President Clinton has
shown me the determination to protect and to preserve and to move
forward in the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had requested the presidential session as part of what he
termed a consultation process that he is conducting with world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He is heading to Canada from here and plans to visit Russia,
Japan and possibly China.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, told
reporters, ``I think the president will reiterate our long-held
position that a Palestinian state is a subject for final status
talks,'' meaning that the United States, like much of the
international community, wants Arafat to defer any declaration of
statehood to the final peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader faces mounting pressure at home to stick
with making a proclamation on May 4 _ the day when a transitional
period of limited self-government is supposed to end.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, senior administration officials said that
Arafat did not raise the question of whether he expected a promise
of recognition from the United States if he deferred the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't raise it,'' said one official, adding that the
president offered no incentive for Arafat to hold off on a May 4
declaration. But he said Clinton emphasized that the United States
would stick by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stand by and insure that this process does come
to a conclusion,'' the official said. ``The commitment to seeing an
accelerated permanent-status approach, to not having it open-ended,
to being there every step of the way _ that was something that the
president did emphasize to Chairman Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat did not tip his hand on what he would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically in a guessing game at this point,'' said
another official. ``Trying to read the tea leaves is premature.''

REPORT LINKS ORGANIC SOLVENTS TO BIRTH DEFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian scientists reported on Wednesday that women who were
exposed to organic solvents, like phenol, xylene and acetone,
during pregnancy had a greatly increased chance of having a baby
with a birth defect.
</P>
<P>
   But several leading experts on birth defects said the study had
serious methodological problems. They feared that the paper,
published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, would needlessly frighten pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The research, by Dr. Sohail Khattak, a pediatrician and a
clinical pharmacologist, Dr. Gideon Koren, a clinical
pharmacologist, and their colleagues at the Hospital for Sick
Children in Toronto, involved women who contacted the hospital's
program, Motherisk, for pregnant women who are worried that they
have been exposed to something that might harm their fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators focused on organic solvents that caused birth
defects in animals when they were administered in high doses. They
compared the experiences of 125 women who said they were exposed to
such chemicals to 125 women who said they were exposed to other
chemicals or drugs that had not been known to cause birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The women exposed to organic solvents included factory workers,
laboratory technicians, artists, chemists, and painters, for
example. As a rough gauge of the levels of exposure, the
investigators asked the women if their eyes had watered or they had
had a headache or trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the babies born to mothers who said they had been
exposed to organic solvents had major birth defects, including
congenital deafness, club foot and spina bifida; almost all of the
women whose babies had these more serious birth defects had
reported symptoms of exposure. Just one woman in the control group
had a baby with a major birth defect.
</P>
<P>
   Khattak said that the findings offer strong evidence that these
chemicals cause birth defects. Because his group knew the women's
professions, how long they had worked with chemicals, and what
precautions they took to protect themselves, he said, they had ``a
unique advantage'' in assessing exposures.
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists were unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've added to the suspicion that there might be an
association,'' said Dr. David Erickson, the chief of the birth
defects and genetic disease branch at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I don't think this nails it down in any firm
way.'' To do so, he said, would require a much larger and more
expensive study involving meticulous measurements of chemicals and
notation of the time that women are exposed.
</P>
<P>
   In animal studies of chemicals that cause birth defects, timing
and dose are critical and scientists believe the same is true for
humans. For example, Dr. Lewis Holmes, who is chief of the genetics
and teratology unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston, said if a chemical is to cause spina bifida, it must act
during the first three weeks of pregnancy, when few women even know
they are pregnant. Asking women to recall the time of their
exposure and then asking if they had a headache when they thought
they were exposed is not sufficient, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and Dr. Allen Mitchell, who directs the Slone
Epidemiology Unit at Boston University's School of Public Health,
noted that the women in the study were not randomly selected but
came to the Motherisk program because they were worried about their
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Half who said they had been exposed to organic solvents had had
miscarriages in previous pregnancies _ compared to a fifth of the
women in the control group _ which could mean that it was the
genetic makeup of the parents, and not the workplace, that caused
the high rate of birth defects, Holmes and Mitchell said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The birth defects themselves were a very mixed bag, Holmes said,
rather than specific patterns of birth defects that might be
expected if they were all caused by similar exposures.
</P>
<P>
   And the control group of women had far fewer birth defects than
usual, Erickson said, one baby rather than the expected four to
six, which made the comparison even more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Khattack said not every chemical that causes birth defects
causes only one specific kind of defect and that the women were
exposed to a wide variety of chemicals, which could account for the
diverse group of birth defects in their babies.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the extraordinarily high numbers of birth defects
in the group that was exposed to the chemicals could not be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But Holmes and Mitchell said they worried about how women will
react to the study. Suppose a woman is a painter, or a factory
worker, or a laboratory technician and has just learned she is
pregnant? Will she have an abortion? Will she be terrified?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is likely to have a really negative impact,'' Mitchell
said. ``Think of all the women of childbearing age who will be
scared to death.''

YELTSIN'S INNER CIRCLE INVESTIGATED FOR CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The evidence is still flimsy, and the political motives
are obvious, but Russia's chief prosecutor's office confirmed on
Tuesday that it was investigating corruption inside the Kremlin
itself, aimed at members of President Boris Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on orders from Yuri Skuratov, the general prosecutor who
last week defied a Kremlin order to resign, investigators have
seized documents from the offices of the presidential
administration's powerful property-management office, headed by
Pavel Borodin.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation marks a new phase in Russia's latest round of
political warfare, in which the weapon of choice is ``kompromat,''
the Russian word for compromising material that is routinely
collected and stored by politicians for use against their enemies.
Given the level of official corruption at all levels of the Russian
government, no one doubts that there is enough ``kompromat'' to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   One clear example of the use of ``kompromat'' was a secretly
taped video showing Skuratov naked in bed with two women, which _
on orders that could have come only from the Kremlin itself _ was
broadcast on a government television station on the night the upper
house of Parliament voted overwhelmingly to let him keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Russia's periodic anti-corruption campaigns have
steered clear of the Kremlin. But on Tuesday, even as the
prosecutor's office made its investigation public, yet more
``kompromat'' against the Yeltsin entourage was tossed into the
public arena, suggesting that the president's political enemies,
sensing his growing isolation, are zeroing in on a weakened target.
</P>
<P>
   The most outrageous accusation came from a top-ranking Communist
Party official, Viktor Ilyukhin. He charged that Tatyana Dyachenko,
the president's daughter and political adviser, was holding shares
through an intermediary in an Australian company that received $2.3
billion in foreign credits issued to the Russian government last
year.
</P>
<P>
   These and other charges have been vehemently denied by Kremlin
officials as ``pure nonsense.'' Borodin, in a television interview,
called the investigation into his office, which he said began 10
days ago, a ``political farce.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Kremlin on Tuesday reactivated its
investigation into Skuratov's own behavior and the circumstances
surrounding the making of the compromising videotape. The
commission investigating the case had interrupted its work when
Yeltsin abruptly fired its chairman, Nikolai Bordyuzha, who was
also Yeltsin's chief of staff _ reportedly because of his
mishandling of a case that had turned into an embarrassing defeat
for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin's property-management office is a vast empire of office
buildings, apartment blocks, clinics, country houses and vacation
spas used by government employees. The investigation of the office
followed a Jan. 22 raid by Swiss investigators at the offices of
Mabetex, a construction company based in Lugano with extensive
business throughout the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mabetex's best-known projects was its work on the Russian
government building known as the White house _ the headquarters of
both houses of Parliament _ after it was shelled in 1993. Mabetex
also was employed for the lavish restoration of Yeltsin's Kremlin
office building, where, Borodin said, Mabetex had a $49 million
contract to supply furniture and do finishing work on the
building's interior.
</P>
<P>
   Although no charges have been filed against the company here or
in Switzerland, the accusations that have surfaced during
Skuratov's investigation suggest that Mabetex paid Kremlin
officials to secure the lucrative contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, arrived in
Moscow on Tuesday for two days of meetings with Skuratov about
Swiss-Russian cooperation on a series of criminal investigations,
which Skuratov's office says includes the continuing investigation
into the Kremlin's ties to Mabetex.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of her visit gave legitimacy to the Russian
prosecutor's investigation, although Ms. del Ponte has so far had
no comment on the subject of her talks, which are taking place at a
country retreat outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Behgjet Pacolli,
president of Mabetex, suggested that his company was being used as
``a card in dirty political intrigues.'' He also said the campaign
against Mabetex might have been mounted by its various Russian
clients that owe the company $260 million, including $20 million
owed by the Kremlin's property-management office.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli denied published reports that his company had built a
dacha outside Moscow for Mrs. Dyachenko.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first public mention of Mabetex was made last week in a
telephone interview of Skuratov by a Russian television reporter _
on the morning after the compromising video was shown on the
Russian government channel. Skuratov was interviewed as he was
driving to a Moscow hospital for an early morning meeting with
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov said the videotape had been used to force him to submit
a resignation letter on Feb. 1, which at the time was attributed to
his health. In fact, Skuratov said, he was being blackmailed to
prevent him from pursuing the Mabetex investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Skuratov's own credentials as a corruption fighter remain
open to question, given his generally lackluster performance during
his 3{ years in office. Many political analysts also contend that
the cases on which he has said publicly that he is working indicate
that he shares the political bias of his supporters within the
anti-Yeltsin opposition _ in particular within the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   But as the war of ``kompromat'' continues, more players have
entered the game. On Tuesday, one radio station reported that the
sexual escapades of another top law-enforcement official are now
available on tape.
</P>
<P>
   And Yeltsin's former bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov, who had a
public falling-out with the president several years ago, wrote in a
newspaper article on Tuesday that he was prepared to publish
damaging material about Yeltsin's own extramarital affairs if the
Kremlin failed to rein in its attacks on Skuratov.

LAKERS' ROAD: LESS TRAVEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's comfort to be found in the Lakers' just-completed 3-3
road trip, it is this: It's over. And it should get easier from
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit less than I thought we would get when we
started off the road trip,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``It was a
long, hard trip, with a lot of adjustments. I feel very fortunate
to be out of it 3-3.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Dennis Rodman, the Lakers stammered to a 1-3 start, then
won the last two games of the trip after he returned and, perhaps
not coincidentally, rediscovered their defense.
</P>
<P>
   If they can simply keep both their defensive intensity and
Rodman around for any length of time _ an iffy proposition in both
cases _ the schedule will provide the only other edge the Lakers
need to finish the season strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining 22 games, 13 are at the Forum _ including the
next four in a row, seven of the next eight and nine of the next
11. And the remaining road trips are short and sweet _ five
one-game trips and a pair of two-game trips.
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch in the latter half of the schedule is two sets of
three games in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers also play less frequently, with more recovery
time, from here on out. So far, the schedule has included only one
instance when the Lakers had more than one day off between games (a
two-day stretch Feb. 12-13).
</P>
<P>
   Coming up, they'll get three straight off-days twice (March
30-April 1 and April 14-16) and two straight off-days three times
(April 22-23, April 27-28, April 30-May 1).
</P>
<P>
   Those much-needed breaks will afford them both time to heal and
time to practice, which has become all the more important since the
acquisition of new players Rodman, Glen Rice and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking at the three days we'll have off coming up
soon here as a good opportunity to get two good practices in and
hopefully gain a little bit of cohesiveness that we're missing,''
Rick Fox said. ``We've still got a number of games to go. But this
was our toughest run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis gave the team Tuesday off.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shoeless Dennis: Several media outlets have confirmed what
Rodman told everyone Sunday _ that Converse has terminated its
contract with him, erasing the final year of a $15 million deal. He
was due to earn $3 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's new spokesman said he will fight the contract
termination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis has a contract with Converse,'' Matt Labov told the
Associated Press. ``Dennis has not breached any terms of the
contract and we expect Converse to honor the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Converse did not comment, but analysts said the move probably
has more to do with the decline in popularity of expensive athletic
shoes than with anything Rodman has done.

MCDOUGAL TESTIFIES, BUT ADDS LITTLE, IN CONTEMPT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (wg) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Susan McDougal, whose steadfast refusal to
answer prosecutors' questions about President Clinton put her in
jail for 18 months, crisply and directly answered those very same
questions on Tuesday in a federal court, testifying that she had no
knowledge of any wrongdoing by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal took the witness stand in her own defense at a
trial in which prosecutors for Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, have charged her with criminal contempt and obstruction of
justice. The prosecutors contend that Mrs. McDougal's stubborn
refusal to answer questions before a grand jury on two occasions
was calculated to obstruct their investigation into the complicated
financial dealings of Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
in Arkansas in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But her answers on Tuesday did little to illuminate one of the
most puzzling aspects of the Whitewater investigation, why she
would endure a lengthy prison term if she had nothing to conceal.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from her own lawyer, Mark Geragos, Mrs.
McDougal answered three of the principal questions that prosecutors
had tried to put to her in September 1996 and April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever discuss with Clinton a loan of $300,000 made to her
in 1986 by an Arkansas businessman who testified he lent the money
at the urging of Clinton? Geragos asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discussed the loan with William Jefferson Clinton,''
she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever discuss a real estate development called Lorance
Heights with Clinton? Perhaps in a social setting, she said, but
``I certainly never discussed it in any substantive matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, did President Clinton testify truthfully at her
1996 trial in which she was convicted of fraud? ``As I sat there
that day, I did not hear anything untruthful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when Geragos completes his direct examination of
Mrs. McDougal, he is expected to ask her the fourth question she
would not answer for prosecutors: what is the meaning of her
handwritten note, ``Payoff Clinton,'' on a 1983 check for
$5,081.82.
</P>
<P>
   So why then did Mrs. McDougal refuse to answer prosecutors'
questions if she had so little information to impart?
</P>
<P>
   Because Starr, she said on Tuesday and has said in the past, was
more interested in getting the Clintons than in getting to the
truth. Indeed, much of her defense has been devoted to trying to
put Starr and his tactics on trial. The transcripts of her grand
jury appearances show that Mrs. McDougal adopted a defiant tone,
telling the grand jurors that they were being lied to by the
prosecutors who only wanted to get information harmful to the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday by Geragos why she chose the road of silence, she
replied, ``It was not an easy decision.'' She then began a long and
rambling account of her life in Arkansas starting with when she met
James McDougal, an Arkansas political fixture and sometime friend
of Bill Clinton who eventually became her husband. The McDougals
and the Clintons were partners in the failed real estate venture
known as Whitewater, which was the initial focus of Starr's
investigation before it expanded into numerous other areas,
including the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Mrs. McDougal listed several examples of what she
contended were abuses by Starr's prosecutors that led to her
defiance. In one, she said that she had received a telephone call
from the wife of Chris Wade, who was a sales manager at Whitewater.
Mrs. McDougal said that Wade's wife told her that she believed
Starr's prosecutors had seen to it that his prison conditions were
made worse because they were unsatisfied with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors who tried unsuccessfully to question her in the
grand jury may now follow up her answers with further questions.
But it is also possible that they will simply concentrate on the
straightforward facts of their contempt case: that a federal judge
gave Mrs. McDougal immunity and ordered her to testify and she
refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman Ewing, a top aide to Starr, suggested in an interview
outside the courthouse that Mrs. McDougal's information was no
longer useful or usable. ``Unfortunately, the grand jury was not
able to hear what she said,'' he said, noting that the
Arkansas-based grand jury that had tried to question her had since
disbanded. Had she given the same answers to the grand jury, he
said, it would have been subject to rigorous scrutiny ``and this
was no substitute for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing jaunty at times but also tearful when she spoke of her
late husband, who died in a federal prison last year, Mrs. McDougal
said he had once ``loved Bill Clinton very much.'' But she said
that James McDougal became deeply disappointed and angry with
Clinton when he felt that he had abandoned him during a bank fraud
trial in 1990. After McDougal was acquitted on those charges, she
said he looked for a way to get back at Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that during the 1992 presidential campaign,
McDougal, from whom she was by then divorced, told her that he had
received a considerable sum of money from Sheffield Nelson, a
Little Rock Republican and Clinton political opponent, to talk to
Jeff Gerth, a New York Times reporter, about the Clintons and
Whitewater. She said he told her that he would ``go down in
history'' and that he would ``pay back the Clintons.'' Nelson was
turkey hunting, his wife said, and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos told reporters that Mrs. McDougal believed her husband
was paid at least $10,000 to talk with Gerth. Last April, Mrs.
McDougal told a television interviewer, Charles Grodin, that her
former husband was paid to talk to The Times, but she did not make
it clear that she had been told the payment came from a third
party. McDougal was eventually convicted on new fraud charges
brought by Starr and died in jail last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's refusal to testify earned her a civil contempt
citation and the 18 months in jail. She was released after Judge
George Howard Jr. ruled that her continued imprisonment would not
force her to testify. Starr then charged her with criminal
contempt. She was also sentenced to two years in jail on a fraud
conviction but was set free by Howard, who ruled that keeping her
in jail would aggravate a serious spinal condition. The current
trial for criminal contempt is before Howard.

U.S.-LED ATTACK IMMINENT AGAINST KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S.-led airstrikes against Serbian military
positions were imminent as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
refused to halt attacks in Kosovo and to agree to a cease-fire with
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done everything we could do to solve this issue
peacefully,'' President Clinton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said at alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that he had authorized military
action against Yugoslavia. Improving weather and the opportunity
for a full night of cruise missile attacks in the opening volley
indicated the assault would begin Wednesday night. British Defense
Secretary George Robertson also indicated the attack would begin
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic international implications were highlighted by the
decision of Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was en
route to Washington, to order his jet to return to Moscow. Russia
objects to NATO military operations against fellow Slavs, and Vice
President Al Gore told Primakov in a ground-to-air telephone call
that airstrikes might be launched while the Russian delegation was
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO order followed the failure of a final mission to
Belgrade by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, and brought the West to
one of its most harrowing points since the end of the Cold War.
Holbrooke, before flying to Brussels to brief NATO chiefs, said it
was the ``bleakest'' moment in the latest dispute over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All efforts to achieve a negotiated, political solution to the
Kosovo crisis having failed, no alternative is open but to take
military action,'' Solana said. He ordered U.S. Army Gen. Wesley
Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, to begin action with the
more than 400 aircraft and a half dozen missile-armed ships at his
command.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic declared a state of emergency
because of an ``imminent threat of war.'' Major international air
carriers halted flights to the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department ordered U.S. diplomats remaining in
Belgrade _ less than two dozen _ to close the embassy and leave
Yugoslavia. The missions of most European Union members appeared
ready to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton set the stage for NATO bombardment by telling
a labor union audience in Washington about Holbrooke's two days of
talks with Milosevic: ``We got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is now united and prepared to carry out its warning,''
Clinton said. ``If President Milosevic is not willing to make
peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war on the
Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, after wrestling with doubts about the mission,
passed 58-41 a resolution supporting the air attacks. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The initial attack on Serbian positions was expected to be made
with cruise missiles from U.S. warships and a British submarine in
the Adriatic Sea. The initial targets were to be Serbian
anti-aircraft installations and command centers.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with a bipartisan delegation of House and Senate
members, Clinton said the approaching mission was ``no slam dunk,''
and he conceded the dangers faced by U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are risks to our pilots, and there are risks to people
on the ground, who themselves are innocent bystanders,'' Clinton
said in a subsequent address to the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Workers. ``But the dangers of acting must be
weighed against the dangers of inaction. If we don't do anything
after all the to and fro that's been said here, it will be
interpreted by Mr. Milosevic as a license to continue to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Yugoslavia has a
``fairly substantial'' air-defense system. ``And, therefore, we
will take very seriously the threat posed by this air defense
system and do our best to suppress that....''
</P>
<P>
   The second wave of attacks would likely feature U.S. B-52
bombers based in England. The bombers can launch cruise missiles
from out over the Adriatic, out of range of the Yugoslav defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Yugoslav military officers stationed at a NATO air
operations center in Italy for a year were being sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. forces would lead the attack, Britain and France
said they would participate, and the action is backed by the newly
expanded 19-member NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``To walk away now would not only destroy NATO's credibility, it
would be a breach of faith'' with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reminded his union audience _ and the broader audience
of Americans in general: ``This is not the first time we've faced
this kind of choice. When President Milosevic started the war in
Bosnia seven years ago, the world did not act quickly enough to
stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Milosevic, in his intransigence, ``is still
denying his responsibility for the crisis, defying the
international community and destroying the lives of more people.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of airstrikes, Clinton said, is an attempt to limit
Milosevic's ``ability to win a military victory and engage in
ethnic cleansing and slaughter innocent people and to do everything
we can to induce him to take this peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton referred to an accord put forward by a six-nation group
in recent talks in France and accepted by the Kosovar Albanians,
including the Kosovo Liberation Army, but rejected by Yugoslav
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for Yugoslavia to accept NATO forces, including a
U.S. contingent, to be stationed in Kosovo to police the cease-fire
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovar Albanians seek independence or alliance with
Albania, a position that Washington does not support and which is
anathema to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on Milosevic to return autonomy to Kosovo because
it ``is the only way in the wide world over the long run he's going
to be able to keep Kosovo'' part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, with its 90 percent ethnic Albanian population, is a
province of what remains of Yugoslavia. Milosevic, a Serb, denied
Kosovo autonomy 10 years ago as the old Yugoslavia was breaking
apart after the death of Communist strongman Tito and the fall of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. refugee officials estimate that of Kosovo's 2 million
residents at the beginning of the decade, 190,000 had fled before
the latest Serb assault and that another 240,000 people have been
displaced over the past two years.

ANNAN SEEKS INQUIRY INTO U.N. ROLE IN RWANDA MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Five years after the worst massacre in recent
African history, Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday proposed
an independent inquiry into the U.N. role in the killing frenzy in
Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Security Council last week, the
secretary-general asked the Council to support an inquiry, a
spokesman for Annan said Tuesday. The inquiry, which is to have
``full access'' to U.N. records, including sensitive diplomatic
cables, would establish facts and reach conclusions about the
response to the tragedy, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan wrote that he sought the inquiry because of the scale of
the killings and to resolve the questions that ``continue to
surround the actions of the United Nations immediately before and
during the period of the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter follows widespread criticism of Security Council
actions before and during the massacre, as well as criticism of
Annan, who was heading the organization's peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in
Rwanda from April to June 1994 after a plane carrying the
presidents of Rwanda and Burundi was shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have contended that Annan played down a warning from
Gen. Romeo Dallaire, who was the U.N. commander in Rwanda, that
Hutu extremists were planning a massacre, and that Annan denied him
permission to seize hidden arms intended for use in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement about the inquiry drew a mixed response from
human rights figures. David Rieff, an analyst who has written
critically about Annan, called the inquiry long overdue. ``It shows
you that for all the talk of institutional reform, the sclerotic
nature of the U.N. is unchanged,'' Rieff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty International representative at the United Nations,
Florence Martin, praised the initiative, saying, ``Apart from the
issue of what the body did or did not do to prevent the genocide _
and it has a fairly miserable record in this regard _ any lessons
learned from Rwanda would be most welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Annan said the inquiry would have a time limit
and that its findings would be public.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Annan requested support for ``this important
undertaking.'' Diplomats here said the president of the 15-member
Council, Qin Huasun of China, expected to respond favorably to the
initiative by Thursday, unless other members objected.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium and France have opened inquiries into the massacres, as
has the Organization of African Unity. In addition, the United
Nations has set up a tribunal to consider evidence of war crimes
against individuals involved in the killings.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
In his postgame news conference Saturday, Connecticut coach Jim
Calhoun said the Huskies' victory over Gonzaga in the West Regional
final wasn't just for this year's team but for all his former
players who had come close to reaching the Final Four only to
experience heartbreak.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The near misses in regional finals have been well-documented,
from Christian Laettner's overtime buzzer-beater for Duke in 1990
to the misfortune of running into UCLA en route to its national
championship in 1995 to having to play North Carolina in its home
state in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sweet 16 disappointments, the Huskies faced Duke in 1991,
bowing to the eventual national champion. They ran into a red-hot
Florida team that beat them in overtime on its way to the 1994
Final Four. And they shot a season low from the field in '96 to
suffer a devastating loss to Mississippi State, which also advanced
to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   So as far as his players were concerned, Saturday's victory
wasn't really about them. It was for Jim Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I wanted him to go to the Hall of Fame the right
way,'' UConn point guard Khalid El-Amin said. ``I didn't want him
to go as the best coach never to have gone to a Final Four but
rather as one of the best coaches ever.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't in question. In 13 seasons at Connecticut, Calhoun
has 2{ times as many wins as losses (302-120). He is 552-257
overall in 27 years of coaching, and now, on the heels of his
seventh Sweet 16 appearance and fourth Elite Eight berth, he will
for the first time coach in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a better coach today than I was yesterday or last
week,'' Calhoun said after Saturday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers lend his comment credence. They have been
consistently good throughout his career and spectacular in the
'90s. He began the decade with a 31-6 record in 1989-90, earning
him National Coach of the Year honors from five media
organizations. In the last 10 seasons, he has averaged nearly 26
wins, going 255-74. His teams have won the Big East regular-season
title six times this decade and the tournament crown four times.
They won both this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I average 26 wins a year for the next 10 years, I'll be
happy _ happy, but not satisfied,'' Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, like it or not, the Final Four is the pinnacle
of college basketball success, and without a good showing in the
NCAA Tournament, 26-win seasons end in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to all the questions I get about it, 100 percent of
how you're judged comes from what you do in these three weeks,''
Calhoun said. ``I've coached 800-plus college games, but the
measuring stick is Final Four appearances. Is it fair? I don't make
the rules, but I know the way the game is played. Every step you
take in the Tournament, the pressure increases exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some who whispered that Calhoun perhaps bowed to
that pressure. After all, his Northeastern teams went to five
Tournaments from 1980-86. They, too, never got to a Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's explanation is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fate and other good teams and players got in the way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Huskies made sure Gonzaga didn't. Getting beaten by
a Cinderella team would seem all too familiar to a coach who has
seen his teams fall in about every way possible in the Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach never talks about it, but with the talent we've had here
(10 players have gone on to NBA careers), I'm sure it's frustrating
not to have been (to the Final Four),'' forward Richard Hamilton
said. ``The thing is, at this level, stuff happens that has nothing
to do with coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Now another set of pressures begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to make up more lines for different questions,''
Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   Though UConn (32-2) will be the only first-timer in the Final
Four, the Huskies will be the favorite in their semifinal against
Ohio State (27-8), which rebounded from an 8-22 campaign to become
the first team in history to get this far after failing to make the
Tournament the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Connecticut, people don't settle for anything
but the best,'' junior forward Kevin Freeman said. ``We got here;
now everybody expects to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a team that doesn't worry about pressure. We
turn pressure into good, because we want to be the hunted team, the
team with the bull's-eye on their back that everybody wants to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that's Duke (36-1), which is riding a 31-game
winning streak into the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke is far and away the best team in the country,'' Calhoun
said. ``But I haven't always seen the best team win the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the best coach. And whether Calhoun is better today than he
was yesterday, he finally can etch his name into a spot where it
has long belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along, we are good enough to make a ride, and I
think we have made a pretty good ride already,'' Calhoun said
before the Gonzaga game. ``Winning the national championship is our
ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer the question, `Will I get relief (from a Final
Four trip)?' Once we get there, I won't have to answer the same
question. I will have to answer, `Can I get back there?'''

THERE IS LITTLE CONSENSUS ON WHAT WOULD FOLLOW BOMBS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The stated purpose of NATO airstrikes against Serbian
military targets is to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo,
but analysts say it could have the opposite effect unless NATO is
willing to follow up by sending in ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials and President Clinton say the airstrikes are
aimed at getting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the
ethnic cleansing of Albanian villages in Kosovo, and to get the
Serbs to sign an agreement that would end the fighting and give the
Yugoslav province autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   It is Milosevic's refusal to accept the agreement, and in
particular to allow 28,000 NATO troops into Kosovo to police it,
that has led to the latest confrontation. But analysts say it was
NATO's refusal to send in ground forces, and accept the casualties
that would result, that emboldened Milosevic to defy the Western
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Military and political analysts say NATO's pledge to rely
exclusively on air power dramatically limits the alliance's ability
to force Milosevic to capitulate. And they predict that ethnic
Albanian civilians in Kosovo will face immediate reprisals for
NATO's bombs, with massacres on a scale far greater than those that
prompted Western nations to intervene in Kosovo in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Eyal, director of the Royal United Services Institute
for Defense Studies, said airstrikes will destroy Yugoslav military
installations but leave ethnic Albanian civilans at the mercy of
Serb forces, without any international monitors or forces to
prevent, or even document, atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Michael Rose, the British general who led international
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia in the last round of ethnic strife in
the Balkans, said NATO can do little to change the situation in
Kosovo, and could make it worse, if it relies exclusively on
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   James Lyon, a Sarajevo-based analyst for the International
Crisis Group, said NATO was literally ``winging it'' by relying on
air power alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like hitting a hornet's nest and standing back to see
how they'll react,'' said Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Milosevic may actually welcome NATO
airstrikes, seeing them as enhancing his political stature as
someone willing to stand up to the West, especially the United
States. Such defiance appeases ultranationalists who are
Milosevic's coalition partners, and plays well to a population that
some say has a persecution complex. By exploiting Serbian
nationalism, even as he presided over the breakup of the former
Yugoslavia and the deterioration of the Serbian economy, Milosevic
has held onto power.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have said the first wave of airstrikes against
Yugoslav air defense systems and air bases would be carried out by
cruise missiles fired from US warships and a British submarine in
the Adriatic Sea. The second and subsequent waves of airstrikes
would be carried out by some of the 400 NATO aircraft based in
northern Italy, and would be aimed mainly at wiping out air bases
not destroyed in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts agree that the mobile Serb forces that have been
driving out civilians and burning villages in Kosovo, creating the
humanitarian disaster that Clinton said the NATO attacks are aimed
at ending, will not be targeted until NATO is satisfied that its
jets can attack with minimal risk of being shot down. In the
interim, the number of civilians killed on the ground could mount
quickly. An estimated 2,000 have died in the year since the Kosovo
fighting began.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts also agree that unless Milosevic capitulates
quickly, or NATO follows up its air attacks with substantial ground
troops to fight Yugoslav forces dug in along the Macedonian border
with Kosovo, there is little chance the western allies will achieve
their objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The reliance on airstrikes could produce results similar to what
has evolved in Iraq, devastating the country's air defenses but
leaving a defiant leader intact. And they will entail considerably
more risk to NATO pilots, most of them American.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beaver, a military analyst for Jane's defense publications,
said the Milosevic regime has spent the last five years diverting
resources into military spending, despite Yugoslavia's worsening
economic condition. Beaver says the Yugoslav defenses are
formidable.
</P>
<P>
   As General Michael Ryan, the US Air Force commander, told the
Senate Armed Services Committee, ``There is a distinct possibility
that we will lose aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are not convinced, likening the Yugoslav forces
to Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, which collapsed within days
of coming under intense attack during the Gulf War. Lyon says the
Yugoslav forces would ``cut and run'' if NATO followed airstrikes
with ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyon acknowledges a NATO ground assault is unlikely, given
the lack of political will in European capitals to commit ground
forces, and the unwillingness of Washington to stomach even minimal
casualties in conflicts where American interests are ill-defined.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in a moment of frustration at a NATO conference
in London, a German general uncharacteristically voiced regret that
NATO had ruled out the threat of using ground forces in Kosovo.
That general, and many analysts, say that Milosevic would not be
nearly as defiant and antagonistic toward NATO if he believed that
his forces would face NATO infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon said NATO can change that dynamic immediately ``with firm
action followed by ground forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Spyros Economides, a professor of international relations and
European politics at the London School of Economics, said that
despite NATO's reluctance, the confrontation will gradually rachet
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Milosevic will sustain considerable losses before he
gives in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, ultimately, he added, the terms for ending the conflict
will be the partition of Kosovo, with the Serbs keeping portions of
northern and western Kosovo that are rich in natural resources and
dotted with monasteries that are historically and religiously
important to Serbs.

 &HT;    Portrait of dragging victim to be auctioned
 &HT;    By Brad Mayhar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ About seven months after its unveiling at Lamar
University, a portrait commemorating Jasper dragging death victim
James Byrd Jr. will go on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got one bid from an L.A. real estate man,'' said Ricky
Jason, CEO of Houston-based Colorblind Entertainment and co-owner
of the portrait. ``He bid $1.5 million. We have another bid from a
tribe in Africa that bid $2 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason would not release the identities of the bidders, but said
the non-profit Colorblind Entertainment planned to donate proceeds
from the sale of the portrait to the Hughen Center for disabled
children in Port Arthur, an NAACP Youth Center and the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, our idea was to do something to help and get
something good out of this,'' Colorblind board member Robin Zaruba
said. ``As far as donations, that was our plan all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait will remain in a Houston vault until the end of the
auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to leave it up for auction until we feel we have
enough bids,'' Jason said. ``When we're through taking bids, the
board will meet and determine how much to give to each charity. We
want to be able to go there with a nice check because some of those
kids might need new computers, wheelchairs, crutches, or games or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Although department heads at the Hughen Center and MDA could not
be reached for comment, receptionists at each of the charities
confirmed they had been contacted by Colorblind.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with about 60 artists, Jason and Zaruba paid
painter Scott Weldon $200 to paint the portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saddened by the pictures they were showing us,'' Jason
said. ``We wanted the family to have something nice to remember him
by.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorblind representatives gave six replica copies of the
portrait to members of the Byrd family.
</P>
<P>
   Since its unveiling at Lamar University, the portrait has
appeared at several Texas schools, the NAACP Image Awards, the YMCA
Awards, Rice University and has been viewed privately at a Beaumont
prison by blues legend B.B. King's son, Riley.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Jason and other Colorblind representatives took the
portrait to Houston to be seen by heavyweight boxing champion
Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after its unveiling at Lamar's Dishman Art Gallery,
the portrait and frame _ which have a combined appraisal value of
$500,000, according to university contracts and a police report _
sustained a cut in the right side of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, university officials discovered a new chip
in the top of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Jason believes someone intentionally damaged the portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we decided to leave it there, because we want the
world to know that there is still hate,'' he said. ``We also don't
want to take a chance on damaging the historical portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of three suspects charged with chaining Byrd behind a
pickup and dragging him to his death down a country road on June 6,
1998, John William King, was found guilty and sentenced to the
death penalty on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the second suspect 31-year-old Lawrence Russell
Brewer, will begin on May 17. Authorities have not yet set a trial
date for the third suspect, 23-year-old Shawn Allen Berry.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the auction, contact Colorblind
Entertainment and CompuCord Studios at (281) 774-9050 or (409)
351-9188.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Through six hours of negotiations over
two days with the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia refused ``every opportunity'' to avoid an
onslaught of NATO air power, a senior American official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been any sign of compromise, I would suggest that
we probably wouldn't be on the way to the airport right now,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior American official engaged in the talks, which
were aimed at halting Serbian attacks on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, said quietly, ``Given the choice of NATO troops in Kosovo
or NATO bombs, he chose the bombs.'' The official said that
allowing foreign troops to enter Kosovo, a province of Serbia,
proved insurmountable for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks, Holbrooke and Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia, went over and over the consequences for
Milosevic, his army and his country if he did not bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic said he did understand,'' Holbrooke said before
leaving Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Did Milosevic miscalculate? ``Maybe he didn't,'' one of the
American officials said, suggesting three possibilities. ``Maybe he
thinks we're bluffing. Or he thinks he can't survive if he agrees
to the Rambouillet accords, even modified, and especially can't
agree to a foreign force on Yugoslav soil because of history or
politics or whatever. Or third, he's still planning some sort of
deal at some point in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Milosevic ``knows how to reach us,'' the official
added.
</P>
<P>
   The official referred to the talks last month in Rambouillet,
near Paris, on a peace plan that would involve sending peacekeepers
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in past contacts, which began with the 1995 Dayton
accords that ended the fighting in Bosnia, Holbrooke and Milosevic
had been able ``to find some humor in the situation, because even
in the most tense negotiations, there can be moments of levity.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, there were no such moments. Instead, an official
said, Milosevic issued ``a steady stream of vilification, a long
litany of injustices committed against the Serbs and accusations of
some international cabal against Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union negotiator here, Wolfgang Petritsch, said his
own talks with Milosevic, along with Hill and a Russian envoy,
Boris Mayorsky, were also difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only wants to believe what he wants to believe,'' Petritsch
said. ``He is not ready in any way to engage even in a meaningful
discussion about alternatives and what can be done. He never refers
to any of the issues that are of real relevance at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the drumbeat from NATO countries about what they
see as a need to bomb Serbia in order to halt the fighting in
Kosovo, the officials refused to discuss what results any bombing
might have on Milosevic and his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feared that bombing _ what NATO calls
humanitarian intervention _ could unleash worse attacks by Serbs
against ethnic Albanians and vice versa, one official said,
``That's our greatest concern by far _ by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senior NATO officials have expressed the hope that a
sufficiently severe blow to the Yugoslav and Serbian military might
be enough to topple Milosevic. Serbia and little Montenegro are the
last republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In what some officials interpreted as a sign of nervousness at
the top, Milosevic demoted his chief of military security, Gen.
Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, on Tuesday night and replaced him with
Gen. Geza Farkas.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, after an earlier NATO threat of air strikes,
Milosevic replaced the chief of staff of the Yugoslav army, Momcilo
Perisic, who had warned of the dangers of taking on the Western
allies, and the internal security chief, Jovica Stanisic, who is
said to have criticized Belgrade's policy in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Yugoslav officials, less ready than their president to
confront the West, also expressed concern that Montenegro would use
this crisis to declare independence from Belgrade, as Slovenia,
Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia have done over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Belgrade on Tuesday night, there was increased
nervousness and anger with the West as the Yugoslav prime minister,
Momir Bulatovic, declared a ``state of imminent war emergency.''
But there were few signs of war preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after Tuesday night's television news, lines of
automobiles at gasoline and diesel stations grew up to three blocks
long. While diesel has been scarce for months and lines are not
unusual, Tuesday night's were much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Ella Fitzgerald at a club called Wunderbar, Vesko
Stefanofski, a 21-year-old theology student, called American policy
``totally stupid,'' saying it would ``destroy a Christian Europe.''
(Most Albanians are Muslim.)
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night on a private entertainment television channel
called Pink, a much-advertised Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy called
``Twins'' was replaced by ``The Battle for Kosovo,'' an epic about
the defeat of Serbs by Turks in the 14th century that is at the
heart of the Serbian national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the oratory from the loyal Serbian parliament, which met
all day in a televised session to reject the idea of allowing
foreign troops into Kosovo, aggravated the tension. A nationalist
deputy, Stevo Dragesic, said, ``If we give them Kosovo now, nothing
will stop them from taking Vojvodina,'' a province in northern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the republic of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, said
the West had given Belgrade a choice between ``troops or bombing,
nothing in between.'' The West ``didn't say take it or leave it, _
just take it,'' he said, and he called the Serbs ``moral winners.''

TWOFOLD MANAGEMENT CAUSES STRAIN AT DAIMLER-CHRYSLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The merger in November of Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler
Corp., presented at the time as a merger of equals, is producing
considerable unhappiness among some American managers at
DaimlerChrysler AG who contend privately that the combined company
has come to be dominated by Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent developments have worried some of the Americans,
although the company's American leaders say that their subordinates
should not be concerned. A half-dozen highly regarded executives
have resigned or retired early since the merger.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's fruitless negotiations this winter to buy a
stake in Nissan Motor Co. of Japan were led by German executives
using investment bankers in Germany. And nine of the 11 executives
in the management tier directly below the company's two chairmen
are German, although the new company's management board is divided
equally between Americans and Germans.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of auto executives say that they expect Robert
Eaton, the former chairman and chief executive of Chrysler and now
one of the chairmen of DaimlerChrysler, to retire as soon as the
end of this year instead of staying the three years after the
merger that his employment contract allows.
</P>
<P>
   American managers still at DaimlerChrysler also complain
privately that more and more decisions are being made at Daimler's
former headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, even though
DaimlerChrysler officially has dual headquarters there and in the
Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Meyers, the former chairman and chief executive of
American Motors, which Chrysler bought in 1987, said that Germans
were dominating DaimlerChrysler now and that this was hurting
company morale in the United States. ``To have to go and kneel at
the altar of Stuttgart has to be demoralizing,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler executives acknowledge that some employees here
are worried about the effects of the merger. But they say that
these concerns _ particularly the persistent and anxiety-causing
rumors that more plum jobs will be going to Germans _ are
unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have a merger as big as this one, you're going to
have certain things be started, and quite frankly there's an awful
lot of rumor,'' said Thomas Gale, DaimlerChrysler's executive vice
president for North American design. ``It's unfortunate, but it's a
fact of life.'' Because there is little overlap between Chrysler
cars and Mercedes-Benz cars, there are actually few posts for which
American and German officials are vying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Stallkamp, the president of DaimlerChrysler's North
American operations, said that he did not think authority was
becoming concentrated in Germany. Concerning anxiety among the rank
and file, he said: ``I don't believe it's building. I believe it's
diminishing, if it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some departures of executives are to be expected at a company
that had virtually no attrition in its top ranks for years, he
added in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp, who used to be Chrysler's president, said that he and
other senior executives had spent so much time traveling to
Stuttgart, Tokyo and elsewhere outside the office that a misleading
perception might be created among some subordinates that decisions
were no longer being made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not communicating enough to our midlevel management, and
that's our fault at the top,'' he said, while adding that German
executives had also been complaining about their increase in travel
time. ``It's crazy, our schedule _ we've flown to Europe for a
two-hour meeting and flown back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some German managers have been fretting that American executives
have too much influence, and DaimlerChrysler executives use this to
suggest that the merger must therefore be striking an appropriate
balance between the two nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the guys who are sitting in departments where the boss
is American, there is also frustration, particularly among those
who are not able to speak English clearly,'' said Roland Klein, a
former spokesman for Daimler-Benz who is now the chief spokesman
for DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Daimler side of the company has lost virtually no
prominent executives since the merger, while the Chrysler side has
lost several. Ford Motor Co. hired the two Chrysler senior vice
presidents for minivans and vehicle engineering last month, while
General Motors Corp. hired Chrysler's vice president for
communications. Chrysler's executive vice president for
manufacturing retired early at the start of this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most recent departure came on Monday, when DaimlerChrysler
announced that the managing director of Chrysler's tiny German
sales division, Hans-Bernhard Port, had left the company and that
his duties had been added to those of Eckhard Panka, the
Mercedes-Benz executive responsible for German sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences, while perhaps seeming unimportant on the
surface, can pose serious problems in international mergers of
automakers. Renault SA had to sell its controlling stake in
American Motors to Chrysler in 1987 because clashes between
American and French executives produced managerial chaos; a planned
merger of Renault and Volvo AB was called off six years later
because French and Swedish managers could not get along.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly controversial within Chrysler has been Eaton's
decision last year to accept as part of the merger a three-year
tenure, after which Juergen Schrempp, Daimler's former chairman,
will become the sole chairman. Meyers, the former American Motors
chairman, said that Eaton's move had undermined the rest of
Chrysler's managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He declared himself a lame duck, and when he did that he was
finished. He no longer became the person to go to on anything,''
Meyers said. ``He can't protect the existing management.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp said that Eaton's declaration might ``have caused some
temporary'' concern but that any such concern had abated. While it
might have been helpful for the merger in the short term if Eaton
had not disclosed his plans, the long-term management of the
company demanded a clear line of corporate succession, Stallkamp
said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that Eaton had agreed last year to leave after three
years or sooner if the work of the merger is completed before then
and that this had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robinet, an auto consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich.,
said that any international merger of automakers would take a long
time. ``It really will take many years,'' he said, ``for Chrysler's
entrepreneurial background and mentality to nest with Daimler's
different way of doing things.''

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS LEAD THE FALL AS STOCK PRICES DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A broad sell-off sent stock prices sharply lower
Tuesday, as worries about high valuations and anxiety about
corporate profits led investors to pare their holdings. Chances
that the United States might soon be involved in airstrikes over
Kosovo only added to the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage was worst among technology stocks, the sector that
has led the market's advance in recent months. But few areas were
immune: nearly seven stocks fell in price for every two that rose
on the New York Stock Exchange, the broadest drop since Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average,
only AT&AMP;T rose in price. Eighty-seven of the 89 industry groups
that constitute the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things look pretty ugly to me,'' said William Meehan, chief
market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``It has been a long time
since we have seen breadth this negative. A lot of people are
saying it doesn't matter, but I think it does.''
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading, the Dow had fallen 218.68 points, or
2.2 percent, to 9,671.83, its biggest decline since Jan. 14. The
S&AMP;P 500 had its worst day since Oct. 1, losing 34.87 points, or 2.7
percent, to 1,262.14.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index shed 73.10 points, or 3 percent, to
2,322.84, the worst drop since Feb. 12. And Thestreet.com's index
of Internet companies fell 36.82 points, or 5.8 percent, to 596.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tech-wreck,'' said one trader, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``The next rally has to be driven by
corporate earnings, not interest rates. And if we get good
earnings, a lot of money will come into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, investors have been concerned that prices could
undergo a fairly significant correction, if only because stocks
have risen so far, so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Between the end of August and last Thursday, when it peaked at
9,997.62, the Dow rallied 33 percent. According to the ISI Group, a
New York consulting firm, there have been only four other times in
the last 30 years when the Dow rose as much during a similar
143-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in broader indexes have been even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Between Aug. 31 and last Thursday, when it hit a record of
1,316.55, the S&AMP;P 500 shot up 37.5 percent. And from Oct. 1 to Feb.
1, when it peaked at 2,510.09, the Nasdaq advanced 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10 percent correction would not be unreasonable on the
Dow,'' said Louise Yamada, a managing director in technical
research at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Nor would a 15 percent to 20
percent correction on the Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern about earnings, particularly among personal computer
makers, continues to hound technology stocks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dell Computer was the most active Nasdaq issue Tuesday, losing 2
3/16, to 35 11/16, on concerns it faces another quarter of slowing
sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kevin McCarthy, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette, lowered his earnings estimate on Dell and said he
expected the PC industry to grow only 8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the dominant software provider, fell 6\, to 166 9/16.
And IBM, which sank last week after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
voiced concerns about revenue growth, dropped 1|, to 165].
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings will probably be good this year for most of these
technology companies,'' said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment
officer at BankBoston. ``But expectations were unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth joined the list of earnings trouble stories. The
telecommunications company said that additional spending to build
its data and wireless businesses would lower its profit growth in
the first half of the year to the low end of the current range of
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Klugman, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, lowered his
first-quarter earnings estimate on BellSouth. The company's shares
fell 2 13/16, to 42}.
</P>
<P>
   The price drop was not confined to technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial giants like General Motors and General Electric were
battered. So too were financial service companies and banks,
including J.P. Morgan, the American Insurance Group and
BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors fell 4 11/16, to 85 9/16. General Electric lost 3
13/16, to 106 9/16. J.P. Morgan shed 3 11/16, to 122}, while AIG
slumped 5, to 117. And BankAmerica fell 3{, to 69.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Coca-Cola fell 1 13/16, to 65~ after analysts at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. cut their earnings forecasts for the first
quarter and the entire year, citing what appear to be deteriorating
conditions in Latin America and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But the session's biggest loser was Pathogenesis, the
pharmaceutical company. Its shares tumbled 22 3/16, or 65 percent,
to 12 3/16 after it said it expected to post a loss this year on
weaker-than-expected sales of its sole drug product, an inhaled
antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   But Autoweb.com, an online car retailer, saw its shares soar 26,
to 40, on their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet stocks did not fare nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the most active issue on the Big Board, fell 9,
to 121. Amazon.com lost 12|, to 119]. And Yahoo dropped 9{, to
155{.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sharp pullback, analysts at ISI provided a glimmer
of hope.

 Indian Wells President Under Fire
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Indian Wells Water, the Sonoma startup that is marketing bottled
water as an American Indian enterprise, said it ``is re-evaluating
the role'' of its president, Brian N. McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it learned that McCarthy was involved in
several past business failures after a story about Indian Wells ran
in The Chronicle last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Company Chief Executive Officer Jim Stevens said the number and
severity of McCarthy's business failures ``were apparently not
turned up in investigations'' by the Mille Lacs Band of American
Indians before it bought a 10 percent stake in the company for $10
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Indian Wells aims to become a major force in the $4.3 billion
U.S. bottled water business by tapping springs and building
bottling plants on American Indian lands and returning profits to
the participating tribes.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that McCarthy has been named in civil
lawsuits in connection with companies he ran in the past, Stevens
stated, ``to our knowledge, he has never had a judgment against
him, nor has he been convicted of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy conceded this week that some of his previous ventures
were unsuccessful, but denied that he was personally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCarthy founded Indian Wells and still owns about 30
percent of it, when the Mille Lacs agreed to invest in the company,
they insisted that Stevens _ a former executive with Perrier,
Coca-Cola and Suntory Water _ become CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said McCarthy's responsibilities are ``entirely
operational,'' rather than financial, and center on negotiations
with prospective tribes. In the wake of The Chronicle story,
several of McCarthy's former colleagues and investors alleged that
McCarthy was involved in at least four businesses that failed.
These allegations include:
</P>
<P>
   _McCarthy previously founded a company, also called Indian
Wells, that distributed water to homes and offices in the North
Bay. The firm was liquidated about four years ago, costing
investors an estimated $3 million. McCarthy said the company was
undercapitalized.
</P>
<P>
   But he blamed the company's demise on bad business decisions
made after he was removed as president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   _McCarthy co-founded Watermark Corp., another Bay Area water
company that once had 24 stores and 18 delivery trucks. It filed
Chapter 7 bankruptcy and was liquidated in 1990, owing its major
investor $15 million. McCarthy said the company's problems occurred
largely because its main investor, Commercial Intertech Corp. of
Ohio, cut off financing after it became the subject of a hostile
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  _Brichard &AMP; Co., which was &UR;  &LR; founded &UR;  &LR; by McCarthy and Richard
Roland, managed eight real estate limited partnerships in Phoenix
and San Diego. The San Francisco company reportedly raised $56
million by selling shares in the partnership to about 3,500
investors in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Several former salesmen say investors lost everything after the
partnerships went bankrupt. Various lawsuits were filed, but
McCarthy blamed the bankruptcies on American Resource Corp., a
defunct Los Angeles real estate firm that bought Brichard's assets
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   _McCarthy and Roland also operated several Burger King
businesses in Michigan. At least one of them filed for bankruptcy.
McCarthy said the businesses were profitable and the bankruptcy
filing was a technicality designed to keep Burger King from
rescinding a franchise.

 Column: PaineWebber's Veteran Market Strategist Saw the
Tumble  Coming 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
PaineWebber's Ed Kerschner saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Paine's chief investment officer released a
research note on Monday declaring that the stock market ``was
increasingly vulnerable to a 5 to 15 percent correction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is a little bit overvalued, (and) I think you'll
see the Dow hit 9,500 before you see 11,000,'' Kerschner said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after yesterday's 218.7 point sell-off of the Dow to
9,671.8, Kerschner's comments may not seem that clairvoyant. But
the veteran market strategist made those prescient remarks on
Monday evening from the comfort of his Embarcadero hotel suite some
15 hours before Tuesday's tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Kerschner isn't new to making gutsy market calls. In 1987, the
New York Times credited the strategist with giving fair warning of
the Black Monday collapse of October 1987. More recently,
Institutional Investor magazine praised him for predicting the
surge in consumer spending that is driving the latest phase of the
bull market.
</P>
<P>
   While he remains relatively bullish over the long haul,
Kerschner said the impetus for his bearish short-term call was
pretty straightforward: His economic models indicated that the
stock market is overvalued. And that means investors are paying too
much for stocks, Kerschner said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Dow Jones industrial average sits at 10,000, 10,500
or 9,500, ``it would seem that the market is at least a little
ahead of itself,'' Kerschner said.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber's financial models indicate that the fair value of
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index for year-end 1999 is 1,250. After
hitting its all-time high of 1,316.55 on March 18, the S&AMP;P 500 got
whacked 2.7 percent yesterday _ plunging 34.9 points to close at
1,262.14
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with the S&AMP;P still 12 points above 1,250, stocks continue
to be a little pricey, and the market has some additional ground to
give.
</P>
<P>
   When the broader S&AMP;P 500 index _ the market indicator that most
pros prefer to use over the Dow industrials _ was hovering above
1,300, it was at a level that might be justified 12 months from
now, Kerschner noted.
</P>
<P>
   However, unless interest rates move meaningfully lower and (or)
earnings growth is significantly higher than the 5 to 8 percent
projected by Wall Street analysts, investors can expect _ in the
best case _ to see the market stall at its current level for a few
months, Kerschner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, there is the very real possibility that, if this
market doesn't simply run out of steam and stall, you could expect
to see'' the Dow industrials falling as far as 9,000 before the
market starts to rebound, Kerschner said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Kerschner contended that it is reasonable for the
S&AMP;P 500 to trade 10 percent above or below the 1,250 mark. ``But to
expect the market to get excessively overvalued, that is, to move
up 10 to 20 percent from (all-time high levels) is a risky
proposition,'' Kerschner said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   If corporate profits don't start to improve (and judging by some
of the dour pre-announcements that have been made in recent days
this is doubtful), the market will continue to be choppy at least
until the middle of the summer, said Kerschner, whose current
portfolio allocation is 60 percent stocks, 25 percent bonds and 15
percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all of the faux fervor over the industrials busting through
the 10,000 barrier, an important point was lost: There are very few
fundamentals (such as increasing profits or lower interest rates)
that would justify stock prices that are higher than their already
lofty levels.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, the way that the Dow toyed with 10,000
during intra-day trading was incredibly wimpy. That could be
because the current market has no business being above that
arbitrary benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It barely made it twice, and then there wasn't any follow
through,'' Kerschner noted.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the respected investment strategist thinks that
the traditional media's obsession with the Dow is a waste of
perfectly good trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Dow 10,000 is about as significant as the Year
2000, which is pretty insignificant,'' Kerschner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hoopla is reminiscent of many of the more sensational
stories the press has seized upon in recent years, where the story,
the denial and the story of the denial become the story,'' said
Kerschner, referring to the O.J. Simpson trial and President
Clinton's sexcapades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the chorus of pundits universally denying any
significance to the 10,000 level itself seems to be just the
material that is being used to make the story a story,'' Kerschner
said.
</P>
<P>
   This columnist pleads guilty as charged.

 Consumers to Choose Local Toll-Call Carrier
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, Californians will be able to choose which
phone company carries their local toll calls, much like they choose
a long-distance provider, according to a decision by federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission said yesterday that
regional Bell companies, including Pacific Bell, must make it
easier for customers to use competing carriers for local toll calls
_ regional calls outside your own area code.
</P>
<P>
   The commission set a deadline for Pac Bell and other companies
to implement ``dialing parity'' _ an arcane term that basically
means customers will be able choose AT&AMP;T or MCI or any competitor
to process local toll calls.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if a Pac Bell customer in San Francisco picks up the
phone and dials a number in San Jose, Pac Bell collects a toll for
that call. Customers who want to use a competitor such as AT&AMP;T to
make a local toll call must first dial a seven-digit access code to
get around Pac Bell's system.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's ruling means that on either May 7 or in mid-July,
customers will be able to sign up with a local toll carrier, then
just dial 1 plus the area code and phone number for these types of
calls. Customers who don't select a carrier will still use Pac Bell
by default.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC set two deadlines for implementation _ May 7 for Baby
Bell companies that have a local toll plan approved by a state
commission and mid-July for those that don't. It's unclear which
category Pac Bell fits in.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Utilities Commission in the past has said
it would require implementation as soon as Pac Bell is allowed to
offer long-distance service, which has not yet happened. But the
PUC has also said it would comply with any FCC order.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of when local toll competition starts, the decision
could mean lower local toll rates as competitors flood the market
and try to capture customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good thing. We may see more consumers willing to
switch carriers and we may see more competitive prices,'' said
Charles Carbone, a consumer advocate with the Utility Consumer
Action Network in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling caps two years of bitter arguments between Pac Bell
and its rivals, who disagreed about when dialing parity should be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act gave competitors the right to
handle these calls, but the Baby Bells balked at opening the local
toll market before being allowed into the long-distance market.
They argued that it would give long-distance companies an unfair
advantage and take away a lucrative source of revenue for the Baby
Bells.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been tied up in state commissions and at the FCC
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials said they were still reviewing the FCC
decision but indicated they don't support the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan right now is for simultaneous entry. Obviously from
the FCC's perspective, that's not going to be the case,'' said Bill
Mashek, a spokesman for Pac Bell. ``We will review the FCC's order
and evaluate its impact on the market. We hope that this is an
indication from the FCC that they will begin to open up the
long-distance marketplace as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors such as AT&AMP;T and MCI, who have been eager to get
into the local toll market, said they will soon start soliciting
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to respond,'' said James Peterson, a spokesman for
AT&AMP;T. ``This market should have been open to competitors already.
The sooner other companies are allowed in, the sooner consumers
will start to benefit.''

 California Given Low Grades for Its Workforce
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
California is still not doing enough to train the highly skilled,
educated workforce necessary for the state's booming high-tech
industry, according to a report being released today by the
American Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   The state received a D+ grade from the AEA for the quality and
availability of an educated workforce, just a slight improvement
over last year's D grade.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report card, put together by the AEA and 35 of the
state's biggest tech companies _ whose agenda is to have a large,
educated workforce to choose from _ ranks the state's high-tech
climate on categories such as education, taxes and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   This year, California got an A for electronic commerce but still
scored low for its corporate taxes, high cost of living and
congested roads. Company officials and the AEA say these factors
impede the state's ability to attract and retain high-tech
companies, which are being courted heavily by other states such as
Texas, Oregon and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unless California starts training its students in the areas of
math and science and tackling these other issues, company officials
warn, the state that built the high-tech industry will watch it
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is growing by leaps and bounds, and other states are
attracting high-tech workers out of California,'' said Theresa
Casazza, executive director of state public policy for AEA. ``We
want to make sure California is as competitive as it can be so we
keep the hub of the high-tech industry here.''
</P>
<P>
   The report card is a jumping-off point for legislators, who are
meeting with 100 high-tech executives today in Sacramento to
discuss the information technology industry. The AEA compiles the
information so it can point legislators toward issues that need
attention, Casazza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create a dialogue, and the report card is a way to
set the stage and have a framework for discussion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The AEA and 35 of California's biggest high-tech companies began
ranking the state's performance in 1992. With the high-tech
industry accounting for more than 780,000 jobs and 62 percent of
the state's exports, it has become a vital part of California's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But while the state is No.1 in high-tech employment, companies
here face a severe shortage of qualified workers to fill the
high-paying, skilled jobs available.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Casazza said, is that California's schools
are not training students well enough. The AEA and companies are
hoping to push legislators to continue making improvements in the
state's academic arena, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The AEA gave the state a slightly higher grade this year because
of new science standards that are being implemented in California's
K-12 grades. But the state still lags behind others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas, Oregon, Washington adopted standards years ago,''
Casazza said. ``We need to focus on teacher training, on
significant class size reductions ... and improving technology in
classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state does have at least one bright spot. California
received an A grade, up from an A- last year, for being a driver of
the electronic commerce phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Many of California's companies produce the hardware, software
and content used in selling products over the Internet.

 Column: Checking Out A Firm Before You Invest
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; QUESTION: &LR;   &LR; Before investing in a business venture, what can you do
to check out its track record and that of its top executives?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  Obviously, checking out a small or privately owned
enterprise is more complicated than researching a large publicly
traded company that files disclosure documents and is followed by
stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The first, but often overlooked, job is to check a person's
resume by calling references, colleges and former employers. If
it's a business, check with the Better Business Bureau, licensing
authorities, local chamber of commerce and the state Department of
Corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Next, turn to the Internet. Do keyword searches on popular
search engines, or check Web sites for newspapers and magazines
where the person has lived or the business has operated. (The
Chronicle's Web site is  &LR; sfgate.com &LR; .) &LR;   &LR; Other sites, such as Dow
Jones Interactive, let you search thousands of publications at
once, for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other Internet sites where you can check
lawsuits, judgments, liens and bankruptcy records. Some require an
annual or monthly subscription, others charge a per-use fee. Among
the most popular:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lexis-Nexis ( &LR; www.lexis-nexis.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   _ CDB Infotek ( &LR; www.cdb.com &LR;   &LR; /public &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   _ AutoTrack ( &LR; www.dbt.com &LR;   &LR; /products/products.htm &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   _ KnowX ( &LR; www.knowx.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   Online searches, however, are hardly foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fallacy is that you can find everything on the Internet
and it is free,'' said Lynn Peterson, a private investigator and
public records researcher who runs PFC Information Services in
Oakland. She suggests that only about 10 or 15 percent of important
information is available online, and then only in skeletal form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine times out of 10, you will need to retrieve a copy of the
information from case files,'' she said. That's easier for
professional researchers who have a network of court retrievers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes skill to navigate databases and mine the right
information. Peterson, who charges about $150 an hour, works
primarily with attorneys and venture capital firms who want to
check out entrepreneurs before they make a major investment. The
cost for a complete search is often $750 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   You can find public records researchers in the Yellow Pages
under Information Retrieval Service and Research.
</P>
<P>
   Taxing Online Auctions
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the tax liabilities for the growing number of
individuals who are selling goods on eBay and other online
auctions?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are now more than 150 online auction sites, and a lot
of folks are treating the revenues like the proceeds from a garage
sale or newspaper classified ad. In other words, they are not
reporting gains and losses on sales of property to the IRS or the
state.
</P>
<P>
   That's a violation of tax laws, according to Internal Revenue
Service spokesman Larry Wright. ``They should be paying tax on the
gains they generate from the sale of goods, the same as a
storefront retailer,'' he said. But he acknowledged ``that it might
get murky figuring the cost basis of Aunt Mabel's brooch.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright added that ``e-commerce poses new challenges to tax
administrators'' but as far as he knows, the IRS has not yet asked
online auctioneers to turn over information on transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Wright would not discuss future IRS audit strategies. But he did
say, ``It doesn't take a nuclear scientist to recognize that if
online auctions represent a large dollar amount, the agency will
most likely be interested in the tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals and sole proprietors who sell items should file a
Schedule C attached to their Form 1040 individual tax returns
detailing auction income and expenses. If the seller operates in
California and sells in-state, a state sales tax likely should be
collected from the buyer and reported as well.

 Yahoo About to Snap Up Broadcast.com
<TEXT>

Yahoo is on the verge of acquiring online video company
Broadcast.com for $4 billion in stock in a deal that would bring
film and audio clips to Yahoo's popular Internet portal, industry
sources said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, CEO Tim Koogle and President Jeff
Mallett have met with executives of the Dallas company, and a deal
could be inked within days, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Yahoo of Santa
Clara may offer $110 to $120 for each share of Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo shares stumbled yesterday on the news during a down day on
Wall Street. They fell $9.50 to $155.50, while Broadcast.com stock
slid $4.50 to $112 after soaring 37 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo isn't the only one pursuing Broadcast.com. Microsoft, NBC
and America Online reportedly have expressed an interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Yahoo and Broadcast.com declined comment.
Analysts, though, said the multibillion-dollar purchase would be a
wise investment for Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   As the Web grows in popularity, consumers increasingly are
subscribing to high-speed Internet connections so that they can
view clips of audio and video, such as the immensely popular ``Star
Wars'' movie trailer that debuted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yahoo is one of the Internet's most popular
destinations, detractors say its content is text-heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com offers a range of streaming video clips from news
to concerts and sporting events. It is best known, however, for
Webcasts of President Clinton's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and the Victoria's Secret lingerie fashion show last month,
a multimedia event that drew more than 2 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The company reaches about 800,000 cybersurfers a day who can
choose from nearly 400 radio stations and 40 television and cable
networks. Broadcast.com has begun to beam earnings reports and
investor conferences for major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   A buyout of Broadcast.com would shore up Yahoo's site with one
of the Web's most popular services and help it keep pace with its
rivals, industry sources say.
</P>
<P>
   In January, AtHome Corp. purchased Yahoo archrival Excite for $6
billion in a deal designed to deliver bring TV-like images and
sound to Excite.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NBC's Snap.com introduced a lightning-quick online
service rich with voice and sound earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for Yahoo, if it goes through, would represent its
second major acquisition this year. In January, it paid $4.6
billion in stock for Internet community GeoCities.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo currently has a $1.35 million stake in Broadcast.com.

 PG&AMP;E Resolves Tree-Trimming Accusations
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Suddenly dropping its uncompromising posture, Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. yesterday agreed to settle charges it endangered the
public by failing to trim trees away from high-voltage power lines.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face came in the form of a memorandum of understanding
reached yesterday with enforcement staff at the state Public
Utilities Commission. The terms were not made public, but such
agreements generally include payment of money by the accused and a
commitment to take corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the memorandum will be made public in a week or so
when it is put out for public comment.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came one week into hearings at the PUC in which
the utility stood accused of more than 500,000 counts of violating
state laws requiring utilities to keep trees pruned a safe distance
from electric wires. Until now, the utility had insisted it would
fight the case through the PUC and on into the courts, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Had the utility been found guilty and the case reached the
penalty phase, PG&AMP;E could have been fined an astronomical sum. Each
count could have resulted in a fine of $500 to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty _ a whopping $10 billion _ could not have
been levied because it clearly would have violated state
prohibitions of ``excessive fines,'' but a lesser fine, still in
the millions, was considered a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Leonard Anderson said the company believes it
could have won the case but decided instead to negotiate a
settlement since it represented ``a mutually acceptable outcome on
all issues raised in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schulte, head of the enforcement division at the PUC that
reached the agreement, said he's confident ``the agreement we've
reached will make the system safe and allow both sides to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the incriminating information cited by PUC investigators
was culled from the electric utility's own records.
</P>
<P>
   Company records show PG&AMP;E took money from its ratepayer-funded
tree-trimming budgets from the late 1980s to early 1990s to fund
other programs and boost profits. Managers received bonuses for
cost cutting.
</P>
<P>
   The utility diverted $77.6 million from its tree-trimming budget
to other uses from 1987 and 1994. During that same period, it
under-spent authorized budgets for maintenance of its distribution
system by $495 million, according to PUC staff research.
</P>
<P>
   That information, backed by supporting documents, compelled the
commission to open an investigation of PG&AMP;E's tree-trimming
practices last September that culminated in this week's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may surprise customers, it's legal for a utility to
take money from ratepayers for one purpose and spend it on another
use, even manager bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The utility is presumed to know how best to manage its business.
But whatever the spending level, the law requires utilities to
protect the public by operating its business safely.
</P>
<P>
   They must keep trees trimmed a minimum of four feet from power
lines in state-controlled areas during fire season and no less than
18 inches from trees in urban areas.

SENATE VOTES TO SUPPORT AIR STRIKES AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Badly divided, the Senate voted on Tuesday night to
support NATO air strikes against Yugoslav military targets.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 58 to 41, approved a one-sentence resolution
authorizing President Clinton to launch American bombing and
missile attacks as part of NATO's efforts to end the crisis in the
Serbian province of Kosovo. Sixteen Republicans joined all but 3 of
the Senate's 45 Democrats in support of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators wrote the resolution's spare
language on Tuesday afternoon after it became clear from meetings
with Clinton's top national security advisers that an aerial
assault was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, senators from both parties expressed
reservations about, or outright opposition to putting American
pilots at risk and bombing a sovereign European nation. But with
NATO's air attack seemingly inevitable, many Senate critics muted
their protests and reluctantly closed ranks behind the
administration's policy, which aims to halt a Yugoslav army
offensive in Kosovo and force the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, back to the peace table.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who backed the resolution, summed up
the ambivalence of many senators: ``Congress and the American
people have good reason to fear that we are heading toward another
permanent garrison of Americans in a Balkan country where our
mission is confused and our exit strategy a complete mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   But inaction would be worse, McCain said. ``Our adversaries
around the globe will take heart from our inability to act in
concert to defend our interests and values.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats insisted that air strikes were necessary and
inevitable to stop the killing in Kosovo, maintain NATO and
American credibility and prevent the violence from spreading
through southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As a last-ditch diplomatic effort failed in Belgrade on Tuesday,
the White House sought to marshal support for NATO's bombing
campaign, and Clinton met with about 45 Senate and House members
for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense
William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, then briefed Democratic and Republican senators.
Finally, the president wrote Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, for the Senate's support.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were sharply divided, with critics warning of
American casualties in an operation the Pentagon has termed very
risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``American lives are being put in jeopardy because of a civil
war in Kosovo,'' said Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H.

 Inventive Inventory Management   By Peter Sinton 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Longs Drug Stores had a big inventory problem. The cost of stocking
a typical pharmacy was getting out of hand, soaring to $200,000 a
year from $28,000 two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Roath, president of the Walnut Creek chain, was looking
for ways to curb the costs when he stumbled on a San Francisco
startup called Nonstop Solutions at a technology conference a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting proved profitable. Longs became the first company to
test the firm's novel service that allows pharmacies to cut
delivery costs without hurting customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Since last April, Longs has cut the time that inventory sits in
its central warehouse by 58 percent (from 24.3 days to 10.2 days)
and cut the time prescription medications sit at 362 stores by 25
percent (from 41.6 days to 31 days). Despite the changes, Longs
pharmacies are still able to fill 98 percent of prescriptions from
stock on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Nonstop has helped Longs cut inventory financing
costs by about &LR;   &LR; $60 million, which freed enough capital to buy a
20-store drug chain.
</P>
<P>
   The software is the brainchild of Nonstop co-founder Hau Lee,
who teaches business and industrial engineering at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of academics and entrepreneurs have focused on
``just-in-time'' inventory practices and other methods to maximize
use of materials and lower costs on the manufacturing side of
business.
</P>
<P>
   But comparatively few have studied what happens to products once
they leave the factory and wend their way to wholesalers, retailers
and eventually customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonstop and its venture capital investors, who have plowed $9.5
million into the company over the past two years, believe Lee's
methodology is the first breakthrough in managing inventory flow
for wholesalers and retailers in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The worst fear for many merchants is that their customers will
go to a store, ask for an item and it won't be in stock. To play it
safe, wholesalers and retailers inflate their inventory forecasts
and overstock goods at every step of the process.
</P>
<P>
   To solve this dilemma, Lee came up with a new approach called
``demand chain optimization'' that is based on more than 100 pages
of proprietary algorithms. Nonstop's software-based service uses
data supplied by its customers to analyze the relationship of
critical costs, including inventory, transportation, handling and
administration.
</P>
<P>
   It then tailors a daily report that spells out how to deliver
thousands of products to hundreds of stores in a way that maximizes
profits and meets customer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a very detailed analysis of the characteristics of every
item one is managing,'' said Lee. ``No drug is the same. We look at
demand variables like whether consumers buy at a certain time each
week, month or season. We then massage the data to find the best
way to replenish each product, location by location, at the lowest
overall cost at a targeted level of service.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Nonstop may suggest delivering an expensive drug
like Prozac a few times a week because the cost of stocking the
pills is higher than the additional shipping costs. Conversely, it
might make sense to keep a larger inventory of inexpensive generic
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonstop Solutions is so confident in its prescription for
helping drug wholesalers and retailers slash inventory and reduce
distribution costs that it guarantees major savings before it
charges clients a monthly fee. While Lee provided the technological
know-how, Nonstop's other co-founder, Homer Dunn, provided
managerial expertise. Dunn started out in marketing at IBM and
subsequently helped start three other high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Better inventory management is important in the pharmaceutical
industry. It typically takes a drug 150 days to reach the customer
from the time it is manufactured, with the financial cost of
keeping inventory accounting for 71 percent of the total delivery
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nonstop does not sell or license its sophisticated
software, but offers its service on a five-year contract, clients
do not have to hire experts. And beyond a $100,000 ``opportunity
assessment'' charge that Nonstop bills new clients to identify
areas of improvement, customers don't pay a dime until they get
results.
</P>
<P>
   Roath said Longs is happy to pay Nonstop around $45,000 a month
in fees since that is only a small fraction of what the drug store
chain has realized in savings.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nonstop's start was hardly auspicious. The first
incarnation of the business as Nonstop Logistics in 1995 was a
flop.
</P>
<P>
   The company initially planned to serve supermarket suppliers. It
raised about $6 million from major trucking and warehousing
companies with the aim of creating a Federal Express-type
hub-and-spoke distribution center that would send trucks loaded
with just the right mix of goods to stores.
</P>
<P>
   That approach ran aground when existing wholesalers who deliver
goods from individual suppliers felt seriously threatened by this
new service model and persuaded several supermarket chains to
withdraw their support of Nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   For Dunn, the setback meant having to shrink the company from 80
to 10 employees, go back to the drawing board to develop a new
business model, and find new financing.
</P>
<P>
   The company resurfaced as Nonstop Solutions in 1997,
specifically to work with wholesalers and retailers in the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Altos Ventures, a 3-year-old Menlo Park venture capital firm
started by Stanford MBA grads familiar with Professor Lee, and REI,
another local venture capital firm, put up the first $3 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, one of the best-known venture
capital firms in the country, invested $5 million last April after
hiring a UCLA professor who could understand Lee's math to confirm
its commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner Perkins partner Ted Schlein said Nonstop scores high in
all categories. ``In the field of demand chain optimization, all
roads lead to Hau Lee,'' he said. ``Nonstop's `special sauce'
really is special as shown by Longs' success. It's rare that a new
technology provides such immediate, quantifiable cost savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Longs, the company has landed seven other major
customers, including three of the largest pharmaceutical
wholesalers and three of the largest retail drug store chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is to hit a home run in the pharmaceutical
industry to prove what Hau Lee's science can do,'' said Dunn.
``Then we will move to other industries from auto supplies to
department stores to electronics as well as mail order, catalog and
online retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Nonstop hired Jeff Galt, former chief executive of
Knight Ridder's online information service company, as CEO to
manage its fast-growing business. Galt said revenues are likely to
jump from about $1 million last year to $5 million this year and
$25 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to expand its workforce from 60 to more than
100 by the end of 1999. It anticipates a public stock offering
sometime next year.

 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of the managed care revolution,
health-policy analysts have long suspected that financial pressures
would threaten care for the poor and prevent academic health
centers from financing their own biomedical research. Now, two new
studies provide the first evidence that those suspicions are
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, paid for by nonprofit health-care research
organizations, found that in regions of the country where managed
care competition is most intense, doctors are less likely to
provide free care to the indigent, and academic institutions are
significantly less likely to use their own money for scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which appear in the current issue of The Journal
of the American Medical Association, are based on surveys of more
than 10,000 physicians and more than 2,000 faculty members of
medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the studies suggest that as managed care takes
hold, doctors and academic researchers are losing their ability to
provide for ``the common good,'' said Dr. David Blumenthal,
director of the Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts
General Hospital who is an author of the medical school study.
</P>
<P>
   Health care economists, however, said society, not managed care,
was to blame. Now that ``cross-subsidies'' _ the practice of
shifting profits from patient care to pay for unreimbursed work _
have been squeezed out of the system, they said, Americans must
confront the questions of how to finance research and how to care
for the growing number of uninsured, now estimated at 43 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any economist would have predicted this,'' said Uwe Reinhardt,
professor of economics at Princeton University. ``I see in the
medical establishment all this hand wringing of saying the managed
care industry is destroying all the good things in American health
care. That's bull shine. Do we want this research? Yes? Then let's
pay for it. Do we want to provide the uninsured care? Yes? Then
let's pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In their analysis of charity care, researchers at the Center for
Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit organization in
Washington, surveyed 10,881 physicians in 60 randomly selected
communities in 1996 and 1997, asking them about the amount of free
care they provided in the month prior to being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The study, paid for by the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, found that doctors who depend on managed care plans for
85 percent or more of their income spent, on average, 5.2 hours a
month caring for indigent patients, while doctors who derived no
income from managed care spent nearly twice that amount of time, 10
hours a month. Even so, more than three-fourths of the doctors
provided some charity care.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that a climate of intense managed care
competition had an effect on the behavior of doctors, even when
they did not accept managed care plans themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In communities with the most competition, the researchers found,
doctors on the whole provided about 25 percent less charity care
than their counterparts elsewhere. In addition, doctors who did not
own their own practices were also less likely to provide charity
care.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not compare the amount of indigent care today to
what has been provided in the past. Nonetheless, Peter J.
Cunningham, the lead author of the research, said: ``The evidence
suggests that the holes in the safety net are getting bigger. In
areas where managed care is more highly developed, it is more
difficult for uninsured persons to get care.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of academic research spending was paid for by the
Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based nonprofit organization that in
1995 established a task force to examine how the marketplace
affects academic health centers.
</P>
<P>
   In surveying 2,336 faculty members at 117 of the nation's
medical schools, Blumenthal and his colleagues tried to assess the
amount of ``unsponsored research'' _ studies financed by faculty
members themselves or by their institutions, as opposed to the
pharmaceutical industry or the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that nearly three-fourths of those surveyed
conducted some unsponsored research, and about 4.4 percent of the
total cost of research was paid for by institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of institutional financing declined, the authors
found, in communities where managed care competition was most
pronounced. In the least competitive markets, including Chicago and
Atlanta, financing for unsponsored research was more than twice as
high _ 6.1 percent of the total _ as it was in more competitive
markets like San Diego or Minneapolis-St. Paul.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the budget for the National Institutes of Health is
scheduled to increase by 15 percent this year, Blumenthal said that
would not solve the problem. To make use of additional grant money,
many academic health centers would have to build more laboratory
space. But in an era when revenue from patient care is declining,
Blumenthal said, the centers might not want to invest money in
building new labs.
</P>
<P>
   If money for unsponsored research shrinks, Blumenthal warned,
the training of young scientists will be compromised and creative
work that is too nascent to warrant industry or federal support
will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the study found that unsponsored research is generally
productive; almost four-fifths of it led to publications in
peer-reviewed journals, and about 12 percent resulted in patent
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very uncertain time,'' Blumenthal said. ``You won't see
holes in the ground where academic medical centers used to be. You
will see a great erosion of a capability which has been built up
over many decades.''

TENNESSEAN GIVES UP GIMMICKS, BUT STAYS IN THE PACK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ A funny thing has happened to Lamar Alexander on
his way to the White House, again. He's lost the red-and-black
plaid shirt that was his Tennessee good ol' boy trademark in the
failed 1996 campaign. He won't go near a piano, though his talent
was part of the act four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And no more walks across New Hampshire. This time, Alexander, a
Republican candidate for president, has traded up to a sports
utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really such a funny thing at all. In fact, giving up
the gimmicks that marked Alexander and overshadowed his message in
1996 now threatens to make the former GOP governor, already
renowned for his lack of charisma, downright dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not dull,'' Alexander, 58, earnestly protested after a St.
Patrick's Day political roast in which each speaker poked fun at
him for being boring. Even Pat Griffin, a Manchester publicist who
works for Alexander, quipped, ``In college, Lamar actually
experimented with having a personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's got a dilemma, and it isn't that he doesn't have a
compelling issue (improve education), a sterling resume (a two-term
governor, a Cabinet secretary, a university president, a successful
businessman), and loyal organizers in key states like Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   It's that Alexander looks about as dynamic as his worn-out
workshirt in a race where two Republicans who are as moderate as he
but untested in presidential politics _ Texas Governor George W.
Bush and former Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole _ have all the star
power.
</P>
<P>
   The situation would frustrate, even anger some politicians. To
an overachiever like Alexander, however, the competition is an
incentive to run harder, get up earlier, shake more hands, raise
more money, and stand before more microphones. He officially
announced his candidacy for president on March 9, but in truth,
Alexander has been running for the GOP nomination since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little amused that I get the reputation of working so
hard to do this, when so far as I can tell, it's the only way that
anyone who has wanted to be president has ever done it,'' said
Alexander, noting that since Dwight D. Eisenhower, no GOP president
has won his party's nomination on the first try. ``It's a big
country, it's a big job, and this is how you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush minds his official business in Texas and Dole steps
gingerly onto the campaign trail, Alexander is in full-candidate
mode: One day he's in North Dakota, defining an education policy.
Another day it's Iowa, where the subject is agriculture. On a busy
day in New Hampshire, the first primary state, he greets guests in
Nashua before the breakfast roast, holds a news conference, hosts a
corned-beef-and-cabbage luncheon, and fields an evening of
questions at a town meeting at Manchester's WMUR-TV. The next day,
Alexander flies to Florida for fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met him before,'' said Eileen Dawe, a GOP state
representative in Nashua who, along with more than 2,000 other
Granite Staters, was a guest at Alexander's lobster bake last
summer. Dawe still isn't ready to support Alexander, though she
calls him ``a charming gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was here for the 1996 GOP primary, and polls showed
that despite his earlier third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses,
he was gaining ground on front-runner Bob Dole. Senator Dole
launched attack ads _ not against commentator Patrick J. Buchanan,
who eventually won the New Hampshire primary _ but aimed at
Alexander, who Dole deemed a bigger threat to the nomination.
Alexander failed to rebut the ads and came in third, 3,800 votes
behind Dole. Shortly after, Alexander dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was infuriating and illuminating for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go through that pass a second time without
being armed,'' Alexander said, adding that he was ``mad at myself''
for not being ready for the attacks in 1996. ``The advantage you
have from being around the track once is that you know how to get
around it now, and it is a very fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander learned other lessons that, he asserts, are making him
more polished and prepared for the presidential contest in 2000.
Foremost, he's gone formal, embracing his last name instead of his
first (``Lamar!'' said the 1996 bumper stickers), and giving up the
plaid flannel for a gray suit, white shirt, and solid-hue silk tie
(green in the morning, red at night).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people thought I'd just gone out and bought the shirt for
the presidential race,'' said Alexander, insisting the plaid shirt
was no phony prop but rather his comfortable uniform when he walked
across Tennessee in a successful quest for the governorship in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also thought, `Lamar Alexander? He's the guy with the
shirt,''' he said. ``I'd like them to think Alexander's the guy who
is going to fix the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, the GOP committeeman in New Hamsphire who is
Alexander's chief adviser and strategist, said it was even worse
than that. ``Voters here knew he had two names,'' Rath said. ``They
just didn't know which one came first.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the last election, Alexander has also disciplined himself
to adhere to a few simple campaign themes aimed at ``bringing out
the best in America,'' he said, and to have answers so fine tuned
that they sound almost rehearsed. His mainstream, GOP mantra is to
fix public education, improve family incomes by lowering taxes and
repairing Social Security, and strengthening the national defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more comfortable with the issues and with my
presentation than I was four years ago,'' Alexander said. ``And
there is no better way to introduce yourself as someone who wants
to be president than to be confident of yourself and your beliefs
and to be tested on them day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, of all the GOP hopefuls, should be in the best
position to capitalize on education as today's No. 1 issue on most
voter polls. As Tennessee's governor from 1979 to 1986, he is
credited with improving the state's mediocre schools and he
instituted merit pay for teachers. He also prodded the nation's
governors into making education their priority issue. He got a
close-up look at higher education as president of the University of
Tennessee from 1988 to 1990. And from 1990 to 1992, he served as
President George Bush's secretary at the Education Department, an
agency Alexander proposed abolishing in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal is gone this time, replaced by Alexander's more
family-friendly plan for moving education policy and funds into the
hands of local districts and parents. He doesn't use the word
``voucher,'' but Alexander does propose $1,500 scholarships for the
children of middle- and low-income parents to be used at public or
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamar is no Johnny-come-lately to education,'' said former
Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, who is the national chairman of
Alexander's campaign and his top grass-roots organizer in the
state. ``He's a visionary, he's someone who was ahead of his time
in realizing the importance of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that while Alexander may be the visionary, Bush
also is expected to make education the centerpiece of his campaign.
And Dole is poised to make a special appeal to Republican women
voters, the same constituency Alexander is wooing with his promise
and proposals to be ``on the side of parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just hear the fizzle go out of Alexander's campaign
when Mrs. Dole got into the race,'' said Paul Young of Exeter, who
is working for GOP candidate Steve Forbes. ``Alexander is a
non-factor in New Hampshire. After Bush and Dole, we worry more
about Dan Quayle than we do about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Alexander hardly registers in the polls 11 months before
the first presidential caucus, it's premature to underestimate an
experienced candidate with well-oiled organizations in both New
Hampshire and Iowa and a Tennessee fund-raiser named Ted Welch, who
raised more than $17 million for Alexander in 1996 and expects to
have as much as $15 million in the bank for him by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Alexander's investments have made him wealthy. He and
his wife, Honey, have four grown children, and, as the candidate
says, ``I guarantee you, there are a lot duller things to do'' than
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very big privilege to be one of a handful of
people to say `this is where the country ought to be going' and to
be the one person to set our new agenda in the year 2000,''
Alexander said. ``Why am I running? It may sound schmaltzy, it may
sound old-fashioned, but who wouldn't want to be the first
president of the new century?''

MANAGER COMMITS HARA-KIRI TO PROTEST CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Moments before he slashed his stomach with a 14-inch
fish-slicing knife on Tuesday, a 58-year-old manager in a business
suit was in heated talks over corporate restructuring with the
president of one of the world's largest tire makers and said he
would commit ritual suicide. Masaharu Nonaka, who was a manager at
Bridgestone Corp. until 1992, was working at an affiliate and had
been asked to step down as manager in charge of purchasing golf
equipment, according to Japanese news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone, based in Japan, has been in the process of
corporate restructuring, and since 1993, it has nudged more than
2,000 employees off the payrolls, leaving 13,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nonaka's case strikes a strong chord in Japan, which is
suffering from record unemployment and recession. Few workers have
vented their frustrations by taking their own lives, and Nonaka,
who leaves a wife and two grown daughters, is certainly an extreme
case.
</P>
<P>
   But his suicide underscores the psychological distress that
workers, managers and their families are undergoing as the country
struggles to revive and restructure its economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of performance,'' said Hiroyoshi Ishikawa, a
professor of social psychology at Seijo University. ``It's a kind
of protest to the company policy of restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   In modern Japan, hara-kiri, or seppuku, is almost entirely the
stuff of Kabuki drama, and Nonaka's violent suicide is not seen as
a sign of a grisly trend. But ritual disembowelment was part of a
rigid code in which samurai warriors killed themselves by sinking
their swords diagonally across their stomachs to avoid disgrace,
dishonor and the indignity of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   When the Meiji emperor died in 1912, Gen. Maresuke Nogi, a hero
in the Russo-Japanese war, committed seppuku, killing his wife
along with himself. On Tuesday, in a discussion that lasted about
an hour in the executive offices with Yoichiro Kaizaki,
Bridgestone's president, Nonaka had submitted a letter of complaint
about the company's policies on retirement and resignation, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Nonaka became very agitated. He stripped off his
clothes to the waist, took out a pair of knives and screamed that
he was going to commit hara-kiri.
</P>
<P>
   Kaizaki escaped from the room, where at least two other
Bridgestone employees remained. At least 40 local police officers
were sent to Bridgestone, along with riot policemen and other
patrolmen, a police spokesman said. Kaizaki returned, and along
with police officers, he tried to dissuade Nonaka from doing
anything rash. But Nonaka suddenly stabbed himself.He died later in
the afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last celebrated case of seppuku was in 1970, when Yukio
Mishima, a famous writer known for his psychologically violent
novels, killed himself in samurai style after he failed to take
over a command post to protest Japan's military policies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a cook was found dead by his family's cemetery plot. In
a will left near his car, he said he had committed suicide because
of the death of the Emperor Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
   Nonaka, whom officials at both Bridgestone and its affiliate,
described as ``normal,'' sincere and serious, was two years short
of retiring from the affiliate, Bridgestone Sports Co. He had no
record of prior disturbance, and Osamu Tezuka, a spokesman at the
affiliate, insisted that the company had no intention of forcing
him into early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago, Nonaka was demoted, and his pay was cut, and
in October, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun, a national daily, he
was told by the company to step aside. On Tuesday morning, Nonaka
sent an e-mail to all employees in his company, but it was erased
before employees could read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be frustrated at his early retirement, even
though this happens at other companies,'' said a Bridgestone
spokeswoman, referring to his leaving the main company in 1992.

A DIVISIVE STEEL-QUOTA DEBATE MOVES TO THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Mich., N.Y., Texas)  (lb) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a wave of protectionist sentiment, two top
trade officials argued Tuesday that a House measure to impose
quotas on steel imports would hurt the U.S. economy and lead to
raw-material shortages and rising prices, and could set off a trade
war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, steelmakers and some senators vowed to
push for quotas that they argue are needed to save a basic U.S.
industry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, speaking before
the Senate Finance Committee, said the quota bill, while ``well
intentioned,'' would be ``neither in the national interest nor in
the interest of the steel industry.'' She was joined in testimony
by Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which swept through the House this month by a vote
of 289-141, would roll back amounts of imported steel to levels
from the mid-1990s. That vote came in response to a surge of
low-cost imports from Asia and Russia late last year that brought
down steel prices, which have just begun to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our economy continues to grow, demand for steel products
remains strong,'' said Ms. Barshefsky, who repeated the Clinton
administration's intention to veto any quota measure. ``Imposing
quotes at this stage, when it looks like the market is beginning to
stabilize, could have the unintended effect of disrupting the
market, with effects that could reverberate throughout the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and the administration are wary of alienating
organized labor, which is lobbying hard for the measure. Though it
would violate World Trade Organization rules, and though it faces a
tough reception in the Senate, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., its
sponsor, said: ``Over the next two weeks, the United Steelworkers
Union will unleash a terrific lobbying campaign in every member's
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure the House passed, steel imports would be
limited to volumes based on monthly averages gleaned from a
three-year period before July 1997. The economic crises in Asia,
Brazil and Russia shut down demand in the home country; moreover,
massive devaluations of their currencies made the steel inexpensive
for markets here.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. steelmakers have brought anti-dumping suits against many
countries, which have since cut steel exports to the United States.
Russia, for example, has voluntarily agreed to reduce its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in testimony pitting protectionists against free-traders
and the steel industry against the administration, the bill's
supporters said quotas were needed to protect a shrinking U.S.
steel industry from ``illegal foreign predators.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of quotas, including Ms. Barshefsky and Daley, said they
supported an alternative proposed in the House that would make it
easier for the industry to seek remedies under existing trade law
when faced with sudden surges in imports. This measure, sponsored
by Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., would
lower the standards for taking such cases to the International
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Steel industry leaders, however, insist quotas are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is: Do we want a steel industry in the
United States?'' George Becker, the United Steelworkers Union
president, said. ``We know there's an overcapacity of steel in the
world. If we do not act decisively in the present crisis, there
will be no American steel industry in the 21st century.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His views were echoed by Curtis Barnette, chief executive of
Bethlehem Steel Corp., who said: ``We are in a period of record
demand, and we are experiencing widespread losses in our industry.
There is only one cause: imports.''
</P>
<P>
   But several users of raw steel criticized quotas, saying they
would cut off the supply of specialty products that U.S.
steelmakers do not produce and could lead to retaliation against
their own products.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Porter, chief procurement officer for Caterpillar Inc., a
maker of heavy equipment, said his company ``strongly opposes the
steel-quota legislation.'' He added that it ``could lead to direct
retaliation against our exports and undermine the international
trading system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sharply criticized the bill, calling
it ``a prosperity killer that would send the Dow down 2,500 points.
It would be a move to protectionism. We're a prosperous country
right now, and if we start a trade war, we will be the great
loser.''

SAMPRAS FALLS TO KRAJICEK IN QUARTERFINALS OF LIPTON
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ The shoulders were sunken, the head was
bowed, the racquet spewed sour notes like an out-of-tune piano.
Though Pete Sampras is back again in his accustomed perch as the
men's No. 1 player in the world, he and his game have not yet
caught up to his numeral.
</P>
<P>
   The bludgeoned backhand volley that missed the court and set up
his adversary's second match point Tuesday was visible proof of his
current shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who entered the 1999 race belatedly after opting for a
Hawaiian vacation instead of the Australian Open, was gaining the
momentum to match his restored ranking here at the Lipton
Championships. But he was treated like a doormat Tuesday in the
quarterfinals by his nemesis, Richard Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   A day after regaining the top spot, the second-seeded Sampras
played the shrinking violet against the seventh-seeded Krajicek and
made a 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) exit that was exceptional for its meekness.
And for its many flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Along with giving away a 4-1 lead in the tie breaker, where he
double faulted at 4-3, Sampras undermined his nine aces with eight
double faults. And he undercut his 30 winners with 32 unforced
errors, 22 more than Krajicek, now the highest remaining seeded
player here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, as long as I can live up to it,'' Krajicek said,
electing to take it as a positive omen that the last time he
defeated Sampras in a high-stakes quarterfinal, he captured his
only major championship, at Wimbledon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras followed last week's No. 1, Carlos Moya to the
sidelines, the women's portion of the draw remained truer to form.
</P>
<P>
   But the defending champion Venus Williams was forced to fend off
a surprisingly tenacious 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4) twilight challenge
from 27th-ranked Anke Huber to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a mutually brutal exchange of baseline ballistics in
which Huber pinned the sixth-seeded Williams to the backcourt by
design. Searing returns from the German, whose forehand repeatedly
provoked last-gasp backhand mistakes from Williams, twice denied
Williams when she served for the match in the third set. But once
in the tie-breaker, Williams charged to a 4-1 lead and nailed her
first match point when Huber soared a forehand wide.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of 13th-seeded Anna Kournikova, who failed to
survive an erratic outing against Austria's Barbara Schett, 6-1,
1-6, 6-1, Tuesday in the fourth round, the favorites kept
themselves in contention. Top-seeded Martina Hingis eliminated
Marlene Weingartner, 6-0, 6-2; second-seeded Lindsay Davenport
ousted Elena Likhovsetva, 6-2, 6-0, and seventh-seeded Steffi Graf
trampled Natasha Zvereva, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek's latest subjugation of Sampras, whose exit leaves the
Lipton men's draw without an American semifinalist for the first
time in a decade, marked his fourth consecutive victory over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got my number for the time being,'' Sampras said. ``The
guys that give me problems are the guys that serve big. When his
serve comes down, it's coming down from a crane.''

STEPFATHER'S SUICIDE PUTS APPARENT END TO CASE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a dramatic ending to a case already steeped in
tragedy, Richard Allen Lackey admitted in a note that he murdered
his 17-year-old stepdaughter, Nancy Ann Lackey Launt, whose bones
were found last October behind a Chelmsford car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hanged himself in his Kentucky apartment, Middlesex
District Attorney Martha Coakley announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scrawled in Lackey's handwriting in the note found in his
Hopkinsville, Ky., apartment Monday was a terse confession of his
crime and the circumstances that led to it, but no indication of
how he killed his stepdaughter, or what his motive was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right. I did it. I have no excuse. Drinking did it,''
said the note, addressed to Sergeant Timothy O'Connor, who headed
the investigation into Nancy's death for Chelmsford police.
</P>
<P>
   Lackey's wife, Marie, 48, discovered his body when she came home
from work at about 4 p.m. Monday. Richard, 51, had hanged himself
with his bathrobe belt on the back of his bathroom door, Coakley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorris Lamb, coroner in Christian County, Ky., confirmed Tuesday
that Lackey ``died from asphyxiation due to hanging.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nancy's adoptive parents, Donna and Richard Launt of Fort
Washington, Md., the confession brought a shocking, unsatisfying
end to their need to understand their daughter's death. ``This is
not what I wanted,'' said Donna Launt. ``This wasn't a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy had lived with the Launts for 12 years before coming to
Massachusetts, in a fatal quest to know and be loved by her birth
mother and stepfather, who also was her uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that someone took my daughter's life, and I did not
want him to get away with it. But I thought in terms of jail, not
this kind of death,'' Donna Launt said. ``This is just an end, with
many unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the questions are how Nancy was killed and what
role, if any, Marie Lackey played in Nancy's death and the
subsequent cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insofar as our investigation led us to consider family and
friends, there's nothing to single her out,'' Coakley said. ``It
appears that Richard is taking responsibility. There's nothing in
the note that would implicate Marie.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley stressed that the investigation is still open. She said
Nancy was last seen in Billerica on New Year's Day, 1990. ``Unless
a witness comes forward, we may never know how or where or exactly
when she was killed,'' Coakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Launt said her strongest emotion now is deep sympathy for
Nancy's three siblings, particularly her brother Paul, the Lackeys'
son. ``Once again, it'sa shame on his family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy is the second young woman Richard Lackey has admitted
killing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Lackey, a Massachusetts native, pleaded guilty to
manslaughter in the death of his fiancee, Janeal L. Bason of
Tewksbury. In court testimony, Lackey said he and Janeal were en
route to Marie's wedding to his brother, Arthur, when they got into
an argument.
</P>
<P>
   The argument escalated. In a violent rage, Richard grabbed his
fiance around the throat and strangled her. He served eight years
in prison for second-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   After Arthur died, Richard lived with Marie for several years.
They married in 1990. For a time, Richard managed the car wash
where Nancy's remains were found.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Paul left their Billerica home and moved to
Hopkinsville, hoping to get away from their alcoholic storms.
``They were nice people when they weren't drinking,'' he said.
``But when they were drunk, they were ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Marie and Richard moved to Hopkinsville,
too, but did not live with Paul. Richard was familiar with the
area, having owned the Playboy Lounge Social Club in Newport, Ky.,
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, Richard worked as a housepainter, while Marie found
employment at a sewing factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have wanted nicer people around me,'' said Ruth
Edwards, 84, who rented an apartment to the Lackeys.
</P>
<P>
   But police say the Lackeys' fights got rough. In November 1996,
``he started a fight with her, she retaliated, he was injured by
her, and both were arrested,'' said Hopkinsville Oficer Terry
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Both were convicted of spousal abuse and given 30-day suspended
sentences, provided that they got therapy for anger control and
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Nancy had been abused by the Lackeys and removed
from their home at age 4 by state social workers. She was raised by
her adoptive parents, Donna and Richard Launt, until she became
obsessed with a desire to live with her birth mother, her paternal
uncle, and her oldest brother, Paul, in a Billerica apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to believe they had surmounted their troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   Without telling the Launts, she abruptly left their Maryland
home in 1989 and moved in with Marie and Richard, who then lived in
an old industrial section of Billerica.
</P>
<P>
   Her remains were found last October in a shallow grave behind
the Chelmsford car wash, after a car wash employee accidentally
noticed a jawbone in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is so sad because Nancy had a bright future
in front of her and she could have created the type of life she
wanted,'' Donna Launt mused Tuesday. ``She just never got the
chance.''

JESSE JACKSON WILL SKIP 2000 RACE, ADVISERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has strongly signaled
recently that he does not intend to run a third time for the
Democratic presidential nomination, plans to announce his
intentions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson would be a long, long shot for the nomination, he
commands a loyal following among liberal Democrats and would
complicate the campaign of Vice President Al Gore, the leading
Democratic hopeful. Gore has devoted years to cultivating a
friendship with Jackson in the hope that he would sit out the race.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast over the weekend on Black
Entertainment Television, Jackson, asked whether he would run,
said: ``I'm inclined not to. I'm not very motivated to at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining that he wanted to concentrate on efforts outside
government, such as pressing Wall Street to offer more start-up
capital to minority groups, Jackson said, ``Beyond politics is a
private sector challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, speaking to reporters in Chicago, where he will make
his announcement, Jackson, ever mindful of the suspense factor,
said: ``You can rest assured that tomorrow we will share with you
what we intend to do and how. We intend to impact public policy in
a major way in 1999 and 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also plans to announce his decision on Wednesday on the
Web page of his son, Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. of Illinois. His son
has publicly urged the elder Jackson to run.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson does not enter the race, former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey is left as Gore's only rival so far. Other Democrats who
seriously toyed with running but bowed out are Sens. Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, John Kerry of Massachusetts,
and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 57, is one of the most prominent black political
leaders in the nation. He ran for the Democratic nomination in 1984
and again in 1988, and has weighed seeking the nomination in
subsequent elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaves a big gaping hole _ and the other candidates are
going to scurry to fill it in,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic
strategist in Chicago who is not affiliated with any candidate.
``He is a natural spokesperson for a large number of Democrats _
not just minority Democrats but poor, white working-class voters _
who feel disenfrachised. And it's a base that would be there for
him any time he stepped into the race. Now those voters are up for
grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson had insisted for months that he was still
contemplating entering the race, many leading Democrats had not
expected him to run. He had not established even a bare-bones
campaign structure and had not begun soliciting donations, which is
particularly crucial this year because the condensed schedule of
primaries and caucuses puts a premium on early fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Jackson drew attention for his role as a
spiritual adviser to the Clinton family during the impeachment of
President Clinton. Jackson founded Operation PUSH more than 25
years ago and is president of the now-merged Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, a nonprofit organization that seeks economic and
political power for minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is also Clinton's special envoy to Africa and host of
the CNN program ``Both Sides With Jesse Jackson.''

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ When John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco
Systems Inc., walks into his windowless, cubicle-like office here
each morning, he sees a dinosaur on his desk that he is intent on
driving to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   It sits to the left of his laptop computer's docking station: a
standard office telephone made by Lucent Technologies Inc., the
former equipment arm of AT&AMP;T Corp. and North America's largest
maker of traditional telephone gear.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers likes to think of Cisco, the No. 1 maker of equipment
for data networks, as the Anti-Lucent; his favorite two expressions
are ``new world'' (read Cisco and the Internet) and ``old world''
(read Lucent and traditional communications). So just about every
time he uses that phone he bristles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinosaur on my desk, or at home, I want gone in the next
12 months,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What he means is that by this time next year he wants Cisco to
be deploying phone systems based on Internet technology rather than
on traditional communications systems. If nothing else, he wants
almost all of Cisco's 17,000 employees using them.
</P>
<P>
   While Chambers may exaggerate the gap for effect, there
certainly are new and old worlds in the communications equipment
business, and they are locked in a struggle to control the networks
of the future and the tens, perhaps hundreds, of billions of
dollars that will be spent to build them.
</P>
<P>
   No part of that battle is more intense than the fight to control
how standard voice telephone calls will be transmitted using the
technology known variously as Internet telephony or voice-over-IP.
The IP stands for Internet protocol, the language of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of that battle are clearly evident right there on
Chambers' desk. After all, Internet phones do exist today _ Cisco
makes them _ but for now, Chambers uses the dinosaur. It is a
battle between the reliable, pin-drop quality of today's
telecommunications technology and the largely experimental, often
garbled but fantastically promising Internet-based technology of
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the hearts and minds of the network,'' said
Howard Anderson, managing director of Yankee Group, a leading
high-technology consulting firm based in Boston. ``For consumers,
it's probably going to mean cheaper costs. The consumer is going to
be using voice-over-IP without even knowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all of the promise, most of the communications industry
agrees that Internet phone calls are not quite ready for prime
time. While IP systems are selling well in niche phone markets,
they are still too unreliable, often deliver low sound quality and
are perhaps even too expensive to become the underlying network
language for mainstream phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hype,'' said Howard McNally, president of the
AT&AMP;T unit that includes the company's small Internet telephony
operation. ``It's just not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. and MCI Worldcom Inc. are not offering
voice-over-IP calls at all.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to suggest that the long-distance giants are happily
stuck in the old world. Each of the major carriers is getting set
to upgrade the core of its network to use a technology called
asynchronous transfer mode, which, like Internet protocol,
increases efficiency by breaking communications down into small
pieces. But while it sometimes may not be as efficient as IP, it
has the advantage of being more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   One strength of IP, in addition to the allure of being the
language of the Internet, is that it is relatively simple to
deploy. But what makes it even more appealing is that it can be
used on the millions of existing corporate and institutional
networks based on Internet protocol and with the tens of millions
of personal computers and other consumer devices for which Internet
protocol is already a lingua franca.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, the belief in many parts of the
communications industry that Internet phone calls are not ready for
the mainstream right now is matched by an equally strong conviction
that if Internet phone calls do not move to the mainstream, the
mainstream will eventually come to Internet phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Internet phone calls often require the use of prepaid
calling cards. And generally their primary purpose is to avoid high
international charges for conventional phone calls as well as the
fees imposed by local phone companies for beginning and ending
long-distance calls. But companies are also starting to embrace
Internet technology as a way to save money by transmitting calls
among branch offices using the computer networks they already have.
</P>
<P>
   And if Chambers is ever to feel that his entire office has
migrated to the new world, Cisco will have to come up with IP-based
office phone systems that offer conference calling, call waiting,
voice mail, call transferring and other features office workers
take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, Internet-based phone systems could offer
services that no one takes for granted today, like easy integration
with personal computer applications. Users could easily manage
voice and e-mail messages or, where legal, digitally record and
transcribe phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that IP telephony services, as they develop multimedia
and other capabilities that IP enables, are going to be the clear
winner in the next two to three years,'' said David Greenblatt,
chief operating officer of Net2Phone, the Internet telephone
subsidiary of IDT Corp., one of the pioneers in Internet phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   By no means alone in trying to develop Internet phone
technology, Cisco faces competition from three kinds of companies:
traditional equipment makers like Lucent, Ericsson AB, Siemens AG
and Northern Telecom; data networking companies like 3Com Corp. and
Ascend Communications Inc. (which has agreed to be acquired by
Lucent); and upstarts like Vocaltec Communications Ltd. and Clarent
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, Cisco's biggest and most important competitor, is also
hard at work developing Internet telephony products, but its
executives naturally have a different view of traditional phone
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything in the industry that provides the
reliability, the scalability and the feature functions'' of the
traditional office phone system, said William O'Shea, who runs
Lucent's office systems group. ``There plain isn't another answer
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But right now the bigger carriers are appearing to lean toward
equipment made by the smaller companies vying for Internet
telephony leadership.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T is testing Lucent's IP enhancement for existing
telephone switches, the biggest carrier using Lucent's stand-alone
Internet phone system is probably Vocall Communications, a private
company based in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Cisco's biggest Internet
telephony client is ICG Communications Inc., a medium-sized
communications carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three that were considered actively were Lucent, Ascend
and Cisco,'' said J. Shelby Bryan, ICG's chief executive. ``Cisco
seemed to be able to satisfy our needs more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many carriers believe the traditional telephone equipment
companies will continue to have an advantage simply because they
have more experience designing reliability into their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Among that group is Noam Bardin, chief technology officer for
Delta 3, the Internet telephone unit of RSL Communications, one of
the world's biggest Internet telephony carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, he said, has ``a huge hurdle to conquer when you think
about how people pick up the phone and expect to get a dial tone no
matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The telecom companies,'' he added, ``already have experience
in those challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta 3 mostly uses equipment from Ericsson, while IDT,
tellingly perhaps, mostly designs its own equipment. IDT has also
evaluated equipment from Siemens, which in turn has also worked
closely with a small carrier called USA Global Link.
</P>
<P>
   But the German giant Deutsche Telekom is among the international
phone companies that have used equipment from tiny Vocaltec, and
when Sprint wanted to evaluate an Internet phone system, it tried
products from Clarent, a private company based in Redwood City,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint decided against introducing a voice-over Internet
product, but Neil Grenfell, an engineering vice president at
Sprint, said the decision would not have been different if another
company's technology had been used.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has been perhaps the most eclectic carrier of all. The
company refused to discuss its suppliers, but senior data
networking executives and executives close to AT&AMP;T said the company
initially used modems from U.S. Robotics and other equipment from
3Com, the company that acquired U.S. Robotics. AT&AMP;T has also,
however, used significant amounts of Internet telephony equipment
from Clarent, the executives said, adding that 3Com is attempting
to negotiate a new Internet telephony deal with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest roadblock for Internet telephony is that
different companies' systems almost never work with one another.
Each wants to dictate the standard and is hoping the others will
blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``In ideal conditions it's acceptable,'' Sprint's Grenfell said
of IP telephony. ``But I think it's just going to be a novelty for
a while. We're really looking for a total integrated solution that
is interoperable between vendors and works with what we already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even with dinosaurs.

KNUCKLEBALLER PROVING TO BE INVALUABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ In the world where baseball players drive
Mercedes Benzes, Angels pitcher Steve Sparks is more of a minivan
guy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Sparks can't afford a Mercedes _ he signed a
one-year contract during the offseason for $1.35 million. It's just
that Sparks, his wife Michelle and their two children (Alexa and
Blake and another on the way) have learned to live a frugal
lifestyle out of necessity.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you spend nine years in the minor
leagues, in places like Helena, Mont., and Beloit, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks has spent winters working odd jobs, including one as a
substitute teacher near his home in Sugarland, Texas. As recently
as the fall and winter before the 1998 season, Sparks would wait
for that 5:30 a.m. phone call from the school-district office for
the invitation to teach.
</P>
<P>
   This past offseason, Sparks was ``Mr. Mom,'' shuttling the kids
to and from school and taking care of household duties while
Michelle went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She takes care of everything during the season, so it's my
turn to help out,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the way of life in the Sparks family. It has
worked in the tough times so there's no reason to change, Sparks
believes, now that he's making good money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll change anything,'' said Sparks, 33.
``We're pretty much grounded in what we want to do with our lives.
I'm never not going to work. . . . Neither of us grew up with much.
So we appreciate and are thankful for the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might super-size at McDonald's, or buy two-ply toilet
paper, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks earned this year's salary because of last year's
performance. After joining the club in June, Sparks went 9-4 with a
4.34 ERA in 22 games (20 starts). He had a six-game winning streak
from June 29 to Sept. 2 and pitched into the seventh inning or
later 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   He was about as reliable as a knuckeballer can be, even though
there was no reason to expect anything from him.
</P>
<P>
   After eight full seasons in the minors, Sparks thought he had
arrived in 1995 when he went 9-11 with a 4.63 ERA with the
Milwaukee Brewers. Instead, Sparks found himself back in the minors
for much of 1996, then blew out his elbow in the spring of 1997
when he tried to halt his throw on a relay tothe plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subconsciously, after that year (1995) I felt I could pitch
there for a while,'' Sparks said. ``I didn't take it for granted,
but subconsciously I felt I belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks had reconstructive surgery on his right (pitching) elbow
after his injury in '97. He didn't pitch at all that year, then
went job hunting after the Brewers released him. He called team
after team but found no takers until getting Angels general manager
Bill Bavasi on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we had some pretty good hitting clubs, and I
noticed if knuckleballers are on, there was really no defense
against them,'' Bavasi explained. ``And the hitters would be a
little off in the next game too. They'll give you a lot of innings
and a completely different look.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi agreed to give Sparks a shot, but Sparks didn't exactly
set the world on fire. He was 0-4 at Double-A Midland and 0-4 at
Triple-A Vancouver. The win-loss record was deceiving, though. It
wasn't an indication of how he was throwing and the Angels called
him up on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a weapon not a lot of people have,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``And when it's working, he wins games. Right
now the challenge is making sure we have a guy who can catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Molitor said it was the best knuckleball he ever faced.
Coming from Paul Molitor, that was good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he finally has another opportunity to pitch in the
big leagues, Sparks takes the mound with a do-or-die attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally felt every start I was pitching for my job,'' he
said. ``I put a lot of pressure on myself. I'll do the same this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this year, who knows? Sparks is well-aware that
knuckleball pitchers have a history of pitching into their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if I can stay in shape, I can stay for a while,'' he
said. ``Some of those guys (knuckleballers) leave because of a knee
or a hip, not their arm.''

CURTAIN UP ON A LONDON WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 28)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some things I love about London theater: The curtain
is often at 7:30, so you can eat afterward at a sane hour. Tickets
cost less, on the whole, than in New York. You can take your drink
(or your ice cream) back to your seat without fear of reprisal.
Some bathrooms are right next door to the auditorium, not through
winding corridors and down dangerously steep stairs. The theater
names are grand (the Royal Court, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess,
Her Majesty's). And later you get to toss your head and say, ``Oh,
I saw it in London.''
</P>
<P>
   And although it hurts me to let everyone know this, the
trans-Atlantic theater weekend, once the province of the rich and
social, is now well within the reach of any slightly profligate
American.
</P>
<P>
   Mine began when a friend saw Virgin Atlantic's $99 one-way
winter air fares between London and New York (it's actually $135.50
each way after taxes and whatever). Then she told me about a Web
site she had discovered for ordering theater tickets:
www.albemarle-london.com. It included not only all the relevant
information on each play and musical on the West End but also
excerpts from major reviews of each production and seating charts
for each theater. This was too easy.
</P>
<P>
   I asked a colleague who works in London for her recommendations,
and she faxed back five pages of listings from Time Out London,
with circles, checks, stars and handwritten comments.
</P>
<P>
   I chose ``Copenhagen,'' a wartime drama about physicists that
came highly recommended; ``The Weir,'' an Irish drama set in a pub
(previews were to start in New York last week), and a revival of
``Betrayal,'' my favorite bleak Harold Pinter love story. I
regretted not having time for ``An Inspector Calls,'' which I'd
missed in New York; Tom Stoppard's ``Invention of Love'' or
``Oklahoma!'' People I respect swear that the British production
captures the dark side of Laurey, Curly and Jud's homespun
triangle. And it would have been a hoot (the most Oklahoman word I
can think of) to hear proper Londoners twanging about tall corn and
fringed surreys. But weekends are short.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering through the Internet, which I hadn't tried before, was
a snap. I filled in the form with the name of the show, the date,
the seat location, (the stalls, of course, being the British
equivalent of the orchestra) and ticket price, typed in my credit
card number and hit ``send.'' By the next day, I had confirmation
by e-mail and notification that the tickets would be waiting at the
theater. And in every case, they were. Of course, the 23 percent
booking fee pretty much negated the price advantage for London
theater. I paid about $61, $51 and $36.
</P>
<P>
   Not that buying West End theater tickets at the last minute
isn't a possibility. A friend and I had done it on my last visit to
London, three years ago, when we strolled by the box office of the
theater where an extremely well-reviewed revival of ``Company'' was
playing. We asked for two good seats in the stalls that night and
got them. And on this trip, when one of my traveling companions
decided at the last minute to join me for ``Copenhagen,'' she was
able to pick up a single ticket for that evening's performance _
saving about $13 over what I had paid.
</P>
<P>
   But I was in the mood for certainty. I would have better things
to do on my first day in London than wander from theater to theater
buying tickets. Better things, like taking a nap.
</P>
<P>
   And not doing that was my first mistake. We arrived in London on
a mild Friday morning in February, a flight that was short on
legroom but long on entertainment options. There were around 15
movies, most of them current, available on our tiny seat-back video
screens. On the flight back, I saw, among other things,
``Elizabeth.'' I had been persuaded, by the friend organizing the
trip (there were four of us), to stay in a small hotel near Russell
Square that she knew. I do not generally enjoy hotels for which the
most favorable description is ``clean,'' but I couldn't argue that
it was affordable. For this reason, when my companions announced
that they intended to skip the post-flight nap, I did the same.
Going back to our sanitary but unglamorous accommodations just
wasn't as appealing as settling in under Frette sheets and a fluffy
down comforter at the Berkeley. I stayed awake. I came to regret
it.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began about halfway through the first act of
``Copenhagen'' that night. Yes, this is a play about Niels Bohr,
the Danish physicist; his wife, Margrethe; and Werner Heisenberg,
the German physicist who was author of the uncertainty principle,
standing around talking one weekend in 1941. This is the ``My
Dinner With Andre'' of the West End. It is not, as many critics
have already noted, in any way boring. The characters seem to be
rattling on about physics and war and Nazi occupation, but they're
really talking about morality and the unknowability of just about
everything. It would not do to nod off.
</P>
<P>
   At the interval (a k a intermission), my friend Joan confessed
that she was having the same problem. We strolled into the stalls
bar (each section of the theater has its own bar; I love
class-consciousness!) and ordered red wine, which turned out to be
the temporary alertness boost we needed.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else around us, we were reluctant to go back into
the theater before finishing our wine. But when the bells began
ringing to summon us back to our seats, we, unlike New York
audiences in the same situation, had an alternative. A nice man
came around and offered to pour our wine into plastic glasses so we
could take it back to our seats.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of thing that I always remember about London
but think I must have imagined the last time. That and the
necessity of buying one's program (2 to 2.50 pounds, as it turns
out, or $3.25 to $4).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the play, we looked up the block and saw Taste of India, a
restaurant recommended by a friend. We had a delicious, mildly
spicy light supper (shared appetizer, main course and bread, plus
one more glass of wine) for about $15 each.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I headed for the Royal National Theater complex
and the Saturday matinee of ``Betrayal.'' Never having been to the
National or any of its sister institutions, I was horrified by what
I saw on the map. It was actually on the other side of the Thames
at an Underground stop with the daunting name of Waterloo. It was
as if Manhattan's Lincoln Center had been moved to Queens County.
</P>
<P>
   Reality turned out to be much less frightening. Waterloo was
three tube stops from Leicester Square, in whose general
neighborhood I had had lunch (a gorgeous cheese omelet in the
downstairs wine bar of Cafe des Amis du Vin), and it is impossible
to get lost between the station and the theaters. Since then, I've
learned that lots of people prefer the stroll over Waterloo Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betrayal,'' which I had known only from the film version with
Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley and Patricia Hodge, is about an
extramarital affair, told in reverse chronology (it begins with
their meeting years after the breakup and ends with their first
kiss). It was so well done that I barely thought about Jeremy Irons
all afternoon, which is something of a feat. It was a jolt _ but
oddly reassuring _ when, as the lovers embraced, an elderly woman
in my row announced in her loudest voice, ``This is the end, I
think.'' And I had believed that all the annoying audience members
were in New York.
</P>
<P>
   All this theatergoing meant that very little time was spent at
our hotel, St. Margaret's, although I had come to admit that it was
very pleasant. It was on a quiet, pretty street of white row
houses, an invigorating but not tiring stroll (15 to 20 minutes)
from the West End. The breakfast room was cheerful. The people at
the front desk were friendly and helpful. But I don't know what we
were thinking when we reserved not a double, not a triple, but a
quadruple room.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do. We were thinking that there would be three of us, so
rather than having one person suffer financially, we had looked
into triple-room rates. When our fourth, Karen, found out that
she'd be able to join us after all, we lost our heads and asked for
a room that would accommodate us all. Yes, it was a lot like
college revisited, this huge room with four single beds, two tiny
closets, one drawer apiece, a minuscule black-and-white TV and the
smallest bathroom I've ever seen on land. Now I remember why I
couldn't wait to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   That night, our all-woman travel party (two art directors, an
editor and a divorce lawyer, who had left behind varying
combinations of husbands, children and pets) went to see ``The
Weir.'' For the first two plays, I had had fabulous seats (sixth
row center, in both cases). At this theater, we were in the second
row center, which seemed a little too up close and personal. But
``The Weir,'' by Conor McPherson (the hot young Irish playwright of
the moment, now that Martin McDonagh has had his season of American
fame), is a five-character play in which scary stories are told
while vast amounts of ale are consumed, so we began to feel as if
we were just the customers at the next table.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Barbara suggested we go to Rules, which is billed as
the oldest restaurant in London (two centuries or so). The future
Edward VII and Lillie Langtry used to meet here _ in a private
room, of course. But Rules was full, so we took the recommendation
of an employee there and went to Porters, around the block, where
we had a perfectly nice selection of English specialties from
Cumberland pie to trifle. The following night, we made reservations
and went back to Rules for a fabulous, elegant dinner. With wine
and beer, appetizers, Dover sole for two, roast pheasant for two
and dessert, the meal came to about $60 each and was well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much theater on Sundays in London, but there are a
few matinees and I was determined to find something worthwhile.
According to the listings, I had a choice of ``Annie'' (saw it when
Sarah Jessica Parker was a little girl), ``Buddy'' (the Buddy Holly
story, now in its ``10th triumphant year'') and ``The Street of
Crocodiles.'' I went with the crocodiles. This was the same
production, from the Theatre de Complicite, that had received
glowing reviews at the Lincoln Center Festival last year. Inspired
by the work of the Polish writer Bruno Schulz, the play (which has
since closed in London) tells its stories in a largely nonverbal
style that one critic described as ``perceptual anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was spoiled by the preceding three examples of verbal
brilliance, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for people turning into
birds, maybe I was distracted by the particularly young, rowdy
crowd; whatever the case, I was a little disappointed. But being
thrilled with three out of four shows seen within 48 hours is not a
bad record.
</P>
<P>
   There was time, between Friday morning and our departure for the
airport on Monday afternoon, for a few things other than theater. I
made the obligatory shopper's homage to Harrods, which on the
ground floor seems more and more like a theme park every year. But
on the upper floors, accidentally passing through the riding habit
and accessories section, I was reassured that I was indeed in a
foreign land. I spent some time at my other favorite store, Harvey
Nichols, beginning with a pile of evening bags on sale on the
ground floor and ending with a superb decaf cappuccino on the
groceries floor.
</P>
<P>
   I even managed to fit in a short visit to the British Museum,
two blocks from our hotel, and one to Dickens House. Charles
Dickens was quite a theater type himself, and one room consists
mainly of 19th-century theater programs and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet if he were around now, he'd order his tickets on the
Internet.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization authorized
airstrikes against Yugoslavia on Tuesday as President Clinton
declared that force was necessary to halt the aggression of the
Serbs against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign, using primarily American aircraft and cruise
missiles, was poised to begin over southern Serbia and targets in
Kosovo under the cover of night Wednesday, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It would come almost a year after the conflict in Kosovo began
and more than six months after NATO, backed by the Clinton
administration, first threatened the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full explanation of why the administration had
decided NATO should strike, Clinton said in a speech to a union
group here on Tuesday: ``If President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war on the
Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing concerns in the Pentagon about the possible loss of
pilots as they deal with the air defense systems of the Yugoslav
Army, Clinton said: ``I want to level with you. This is like any
other military action. There are risks in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that not acting against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would ``discredit'' NATO by showing that ``we
didn't keep our word.''
</P>
<P>
   The President said that he was acting after lessons learned from
the five-year war in Bosnia. ``We learned that if you don't stand
up to brutality and the killing of innocent people, you invite the
people who do it to do more of it,'' he said. ``We learned that
firmness can save lives, and stop armies.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO military plans accelerated, Milosevic's forces in
Kosovo continued to set fire to houses, sending ethnic Albanians
fleeing into the countryside. Serbian artillery targeted villages
in the central Drenica region, the traditional heartland of the
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 senators and congressmen met with Clinton at the
White House Tuesday morning, and after hearing his arguments for
intervention, rallied around him by canceling a planned Senate
debate on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a debate for another time. We are at a critical
hour,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the near certainty of air strikes, the Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned his aircraft around over the
Atlantic Ocean as it was heading for Washington and postponed a
planned three-day visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, adamantly against NATO air strikes, had made clear that
Primakov would take it as a personal slap in the face if Serbia, a
traditional if frayed ally of Russia, was attacked during
Primakov's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization of the airstrikes by NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana occurred at NATO headquarters in Brussels Tuesday
night after Clinton's envoy, Richard Holbrooke, failed to persuade
Milosevic to agree to a ceasefire in Kosovo that would pave the way
for talks on a peace settlement already agreed to by the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has negotiated many times in the past with
Milosevic, talked with the Yugoslav leader for about six hours in
Belgrade. Lt. Gen. Edward Anderson, accompanying Holbrooke, spelled
out to Milosevic that NATO was planning a heavy air campaign that
would crush his forces in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But while Holbrooke was trying to induce Milosevic toward the
path of peace, the Serbian parliament, apparently under orders from
the authoritarian leader, railed on Tuesday against foreign forces
in Kosovo. ``This was the ultimate two-finger salute by Milosevic
to his friend Holbrooke,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of what administration officials called a
``last chance'' for Milosevic, a subdued Holbrooke flew to NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where he briefed Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Solana gave the go ahead to NATO's Supreme Commander
Gen. Wesley Clark to go ahead with an air campaign. The Secretary
General called Holbrooke a ``great diplomat'' but said that NATO
was taking over.
</P>
<P>
   The planned air attacks would come after a series of diplomatic
efforts by the Clinton administration in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after the massacre of more than 20 ethnic Albanian
civilians by Serb forces, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to agree to
a ceasefire in Kosovo, accept more than 1,000 unarmed monitors and
reduce the number of troops. But within two months Milosevic
violated the agreement by increasing the number of troops and
unleashing them in attacks against civilians and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   After another massacre in January at Rajak, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright orchestrated a diplomatic effort that
culminated in peace talks in France. But while the ethnic
Albanians, including the Kosovo Liberation Army, signed on to an
agreement that gave Kosovo autonomy rather than independence,
Milosevic treated the talks with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   When Holbrooke presented the settlement to Milosevic on Monday
and argued that it suited the Yugoslav leader because it called for
the disarming of the guerrillas, Milosevic was equally dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   As the last minute diplomatic efforts gave way to military
action, Milosevic's forces in Kosovo showed no sign in letting up
in their effort to wipe out the guerrillas of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian offensive, which intensified Saturday as
international monitors left, continued on Tuesday , humanitarian
officials still in Kosovo said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday
that 25,000 ethnic Albanians had been forced to flee their homes
since last Friday and that another 85,000 had become refugees since
the end of peace talks in Rambouillet, France, last month. In all,
there were about 460,000 ethnic Albanian refugees, the United
Nations agency said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since NATO has threatened force against
Milosevic, the State Department said it was suspending all
activities at the American embassy in Belgrade and the remaining
core staff, including the charge d'affaires, Richard Miles, were
leaving Wednesday morning. Other Western embassies, concerned about
being targets of Serb anger, said they were also closing.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO geared up for the final showdown Wednesday night,
administration and NATO officials said they saw only a remote
chance that Milosevic would back down. ``For Milosevic to change
his mind _ I'd say that's very remote,'' said a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and Pentagon planners said that the air campaign would
target Yugoslav military bases, lines of communication, fuel
supplies and ammunition dumps. The idea was to crimp the ability of
the Serbian police units and Yugoslav soldiers to wage war in
Kosovo where they have been burning homes and hitting at KLA
positions.
</P>
<P>
   After a briefing by the Pentagon on Tuesday, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., said: `Unfortunately it's going to be a
devastating series of attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing how the air attack would unfold, a NATO official said
that once the air defense systems had been taken out, and supply
dumps and radar attacked, mobile missiles would be tracked down.
``If they concentrate in one place, we smash them, if they move, we
find them,'' said the official. In this way, Milosevic's ground
force would be ``left without protection,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The risks to everyone _ civilians on the ground and the pilots
in the air _ were much higher than in the desert warfare that the
Pentagon has waged against Iraq, planners said.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the sophisticated air defense systems of the Yugoslav
Army was also less inviting in another respect. ``There won't be
the impressive hits of a desert war and there may not only be
misses but also collateral damage,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   There was also some nervousness about whether air power would be
enough to persuade Milosevic to give up. ``What do we do then?''
asked a Pentagon official, repeating a concern expressed last week
at a congressional hearing by Gen. Charles Krulak, commandant of
the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said Tuesday there was mounting concern about
the need for prolonged attacks against Milosevic's forces. This
could provoke a slaughter in Kosovo by Serbs against ethnic
Albanians and in turn retaliation by ethnic Albanians against
Serbs, said a European diplomat who was about to depart Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If pictures emerge from Kosovo of a slaughter, then there will
be a lot of pressure for the intervention of ground troops,'' the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials said there were no plans for intervening with
the NATO soldiers who have been stationed in Macedonia in
preparation for entry to Kosovo as a peacekeeping force. ``Nobody
is putting together an invasion force, it has never been part of
the discussion,'' said an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   For some diplomats and officials at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, where Clark has made no secret of his judgment that an
air campaign was justified against Milosevic long ago, the mood
this evening was almost jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's accelerating and exhilarating,'' said one official.

   WASHINGTON _ In spring 1997, Los Alamos National Laboratory
chose a scientist who was already under investigation as a
suspected spy for China to run a sensitive new nuclear weapons
program, according to several senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, eager for the new post, asked that he
be allowed to hire a research assistant, the officials said. Once
in the new position, in charge of updating computer software for
nuclear weapons, he hired a post-doctoral researcher who was a
citizen of the People's Republic of China, intelligence and
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FBI had said a wiretap on Lee, a Taiwan-born
computer expert who is an American citizen, would allow it to keep
close tabs on him in the new position, the bureau never won
approval for the electronic monitoring, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, Lee has been fired for security breaches
at Los Alamos and senior government officials say he remains a
suspect in the FBI's ongoing investigation of allegations that
China stole nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   And the research assistant has disappeared. Even as the bureau
tries to find him to question him in connection with the Los Alamos
spy case, government officials say they are wondering whether he
played a role in a Chinese intelligence operation at the heart of
the U.S. nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied receiving stolen information, and Lee has
denied the accusations against him.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the furor over the Clinton administration's
handling of evidence of Chinese atomic espionage, the decisions to
appoint Lee to the new post in 1997 and to allow him to hire a
Chinese assistant have underscored doubts about the procedures
followed by laboratory officials and the FBI in the Los Alamos
case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which opened a criminal investigation into the spy case
in June 1996, gave its approval when Los Alamos officials decided
to give Lee the new position, intelligence and law-enforcement
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that Lee's new posting was
approved in part because they believed his access to information
would be ``controlled.'' In the new job ``he only had access to
material he already had in his head,'' said one official. ``He
couldn't see the latest stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also assured lab officials and the Department of
Energy, which owns the weapons labs, that it would keep close watch
on Lee in his new job, and would seek approval for a secret wiretap
to monitor his telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But officials now say that the bureau's requests for a secret
wiretap were repeatedly turned down by Justice Department officials
who did not believe they had sufficient evidence to take to a
federal court to obtain the authorization for the wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of the research assistant was not cleared with the
bureau, however, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about the hiring of the research assistant
until after the fact,'' said a senior law enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   Once the FBI found out, bureau agents investigated the
postdoctoral assistant, officials said. The FBI did not conclude
that the student, whom officials declined to identify, had any
intelligence connection. Los Alamos officials assured the bureau
that the assistant, who had studied at the University of
Pittsburgh, would be restricted to unclassified work,
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant worked with Lee from approximately May through
September 1997, when he returned to complete his studies at the
University of Pittsburgh, officials said. They said they are not
sure whether the assistant, who was in the United States on a
student visa, is still in the United States. The FBI is still not
sure whether the postgraduate assistant is significant to their
investigation of the Los Alamos spy case, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos lab director, John Browne, told The Washington
Post this month that in April 1997, Lee's classified computer code
was taken away under the guise of the job change so he would not be
tipped off that he was under investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But other law-enforcement and intelligence officials say that
the new job did give Lee continued access to classified as well as
unclassified information. Some officials add that he retained
access to nuclear test data as well as to other classified
information relating to nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The job given Lee in the spring of 1997 was to update nuclear
weapons computer programming used to evaluate weapon performance.
He was to update the programming codes for the weapons labs'
``stockpile stewardship'' initiative. That effort was part of a
broad push by the national labs and the Energy Department to insure
that the American nuclear weapons inventory could be safely
maintained without further nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials decided to give Lee the job because he had
the most expertise in that speciality of any scientist at the lab.
Officials also say they believed that passing him over for a job
for which he was obviously the most experienced candidate would
have aroused his suspicions that he was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But in September 1997, just a few months after Lee was moved to
the new post, FBI Director Louis Freeh told senior Energy
Department officials that the bureau did not have enough evidence
to arrest Lee, law-enforcement officials said
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said there was no longer any investigative reason for the
Energy Department to keep him in a sensitive position. The Energy
Department did not move Lee out of his post, or remove his security
clearance, for another year, however, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, in late 1998, a select House committee investigating
unauthorized transfers of American military technology to China,
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., had been informed about
the spy case. The senior Democratic member on the panel, Rep. Norm
Dix of Washington, complained to Richardson about the lack of
action on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   After that congressional prodding, Lee was given a polygraph, or
lie detector test, by the Energy Department in December 1998, and
he appeared to pass. Dissatisfied with the results, the FBI
administered a second test in February, and officials said the
suspect was found to be deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of questioning by the FBI earlier this month,
Lee was fired by Richardson on March 8 for a series of security
violations, including unauthorized contacts with Chinese
scientists.

TROLLING `LOW' CULTURE FOR HIGH-FLYING IDEAS: A SPORT OF
INTELLECTUALS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, the literary critic Roland Barthes described
some of the quirky French wrestlers who were then attracting
attention: one had ``an obese and sagging body'' and an ``asexual
hideousness''; another was ``short and arrogant like a cock''; a
third possessed an ``arrogant and ridiculous character.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barthes was not interested in just describing these
bizarrely costumed musclemen. When he looked at wrestlers throwing
each other out of the ring or torturing each other in excruciating
holds that inspired grotesque grimaces, he saw figures out of
Racine and Moliere. He saw the gods of Greek drama. He compared
wrestling to a ``triumphant classical art'' offering an ``ideal
understanding of things.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he considered the very excess of wrestling _ its
overwrought gestures, exaggerated physical types, obvious role
playing, and cavalier approach to rules and manners _ to be the
keys to wrestling's meanings. Boxing, he explained, told a story,
but wrestling was a succession of sensations. It was a spectacle,
not a sport. And its great subjects, displayed with ornate
iconography, were Justice and Suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Barthes, who was often both brilliant and
iconoclastic, saw wrestling the way intellectuals see everything,
as a reflection of Big Ideas. And Big Ideas loom even larger if
they are found in Low Things. Which is where, since Barthes, many
intellectuals, writers and academics have been searching for them.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, Barthes could have had very little inkling of
how far this immersion in the Low could go. Norman Mailer once
provided a paean to the ``white Negro'' and celebrated the
street-level artfulness of graffiti; now academics go further,
turning out elaborate studies of cross-dressing, peep shows and
cockfights.
</P>
<P>
   The Beat writers showed a certain appreciation for the frisson
of criminality; now the excess, the shocking, the disgusting and
the pornographic have inspired scholarly disquisitions. There is
nothing these days that is too Low for High thought: trailer parks,
snuff films, Mickey Mouse. Some of this is because of the
unparalleled power of American popular culture, its extraordinary
influence with world audiences and its aggressively democratic
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Boundaries are dissolving so fast that even the lowly life of a
cultural critic is swept up in the maelstrom: in recent months I
have written about swimming pools, video games and lingerie as well
as Arnold Schoenberg, Isaiah Berlin and Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But high-toned discussion of the Low is also the preoccupation
of a new university discipline known as ``cultural studies,'' in
which everything is fodder for anthropological and political
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   In contemporary analyses, any distinctions between, say, a drama
by Racine and a wrestling match with Hulk Hogan might be considered
accidents of taste and class; graffiti and Rembrandt etchings might
be seen as different primarily in their means of production and the
marketing forces affecting their value, and peep shows and horror
films might have as much significance as any cineaste's
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   One intellectual force behind this change has been a form of
Marxism. While in traditional criticism esthetic distinctions are
central, Marxist analysis of culture tries to discern social or
political meanings, the particular interests that various works
serve and their usefulness in revolutionary projects. For a while,
writers like the esthetician Theodor Adorno and the intellectuals
that gathered around Partisan Review tried to reconcile Marxism
with high achievement in the arts. But no longer. Advocates of
university-centered cultural studies tend to argue that any
distinctions between high and low are themselves merely political.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal is to reveal the deeper political meanings latent
in all cultural activity. In this view it may even be that
wrestling matches reveal more about society than elaborately
disguised ``higher'' activities.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from this neo-Marxist view, there is another influence
on these intellectual preoccupations: a Western fascination with
cultures believed to have a closer connection with Nature. Such
cultures may possess forms of knowledge ignored by the rationally
structured sciences of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau is often named as this tradition's godfather, but this
view, which combines a romance about a lost world with a
dissatisfaction with the high culture of the West, has had
important consequences for the interpretation of world cultures.
The anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss has shown, for example, that
even the notion of the ``primitive'' has to be revised: myths of
so-called primitive societies display sophisticated systems of
thought. Contemporary multiculturalism taps into similar
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   This romance remains potent even within Western culture, in
which intellectuals _ who have presumably been exquisitely trained
in rational analysis _ look to more ``primitive'' activities with a
certain amount of envy. Those who have mastered their bodies and
use their bodies for power have certainly tapped into a kind of
knowledge not usually associated with intellectual life;
intellectual envy mounts when the physical mastery also comes from
a culture that is deemed more ``natural.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a dark side here: this envy has helped inspire
disastrous intellectual devotion to various forms of criminality as
well as to German fascism and Third World terrorism. The envy,
however, also has an influence on intellectual considerations of
Low culture, in which admiration can end up tempering any left-over
sense of condescension.
</P>
<P>
   But the strange thing about the ideologies of Marxism and
Romanticism, which have had such an impact on university and
intellectual life, is that it is possible to reject their
prepackaged views about Good and Evil and find something revealing
about their approaches.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to go as far as the cultural-studies radicals
to argue that there are meanings latent in mass culture; one
doesn't have to be a Romantic to attend to aspects of human
existence other than the rational, and one doesn't have to accept
either view that there are no other distinctions worth making. Such
issues may now be worth wrestling over.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ With remarkable speed and unity, OPEC clinched
a far-reaching agreement with four independent oil-producing
nations on Tuesday to cut world output by 2.1 million barrels a
day. The move, if carried out, would significantly reduce the
supply of crude oil and drive up the price of gasoline and other
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, announced here, is to take effect on April 1 and last
for a year. It would reduce daily world oil production of 70
million barrels a day by about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reached despite resilient skepticism about the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' ability to stop
cheating by its own members. On the contrary, there is now
considerable optimism that the cutbacks will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy to see a new spirit in OPEC,'' said the
Algerian oil minister, Youcef Yousfi, after the group completed the
deal at the ANA Hotel. Yousfi, who is OPEC's president, added: ``To
those who doubted our resolve, we have proven with our solidarity
we can exceed expectations. To people who predicted the imminent
demise of OPEC, I say `Not yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 11-nation producers group no longer has the same
grip on the global petroleum markets that it commanded in the 1970s
and early '80s, it still provides almost 40 percent of the world's
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread anticipation of the production cutbacks, which were
negotiated in advance, had already pushed oil and gasoline prices
up in the United States, the world's biggest user of petroleum
products. In the last few weeks, gasoline prices for U.S. consumers
have risen more than 8 cents a gallon and are back over $1 a gallon
on average nationwide for the first time in four months.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers predicted that the cuts announced Tuesday would
push up oil prices to $17 or $18 a barrel from the current $14- to
$15-a-barrel range by this summer. That could translate into a
further 10-cent-a-gallon retail increase for gasoline in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement presented an extraordinary show of solidarity,
with Norway, Mexico, Russia and Oman joining OPEC in promising to
shut down 388,000 barrels a day of their production. The deal
suggested that producers in and out of the cartel are intent on
reversing a slide in prices that has lasted for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, these independent oil nations rejected any
serious collaboration with OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new spirit of cooperation between oil-exporting countries
has brought clear results,'' said Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil
minister, who led the effort. He pointedly noted that the agreement
had strong political underpinning. ``Several heads of state
directly participated in these negotiations by telephone,'' Naimi
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials said that Crown Prince Abdullah, the effective
ruler of Saudi Arabia, which is the world's largest oil producer,
had joined President Mohammad Khatami of Iran and the heads of
state of Venezuela, Algeria and Mexico and smaller Persian Gulf
countries to support the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the care that OPEC took in orchestrating its
announcement for maximum effect, the accord was adopted in minutes
and announced in one of the shortest OPEC meetings in the group's
40-year-history, lasting less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually took 10 minutes from the moment the resolution was
proposed to the moment it was unanimously adopted,'' said Abdallah
al-Attiyah, Qatar's oil minister, at a lunch immediately following
the deliberations. ``The message to world oil markets from oil
producers is solidarity, unanimity and resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   As always with OPEC, it remains to be seen if the discipline and
resolve displayed here on Tuesday will last. As prices creep up,
temptation increases among producers to cheat by pumping more oil
to get more revenue. That is part of the reason that oil prices
have fallen so steeply in the last few years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members of OPEC such as Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela are
suffering severe budget deficits partly because crude oil is
selling at so low a price. This has only increased the pressure on
them to grab any additional income that increased sales would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the pact was signed Tuesday, there was widespread
skepticism about the commitment of Russia to cut 100,000 barrels a
day from its exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A barrel cut by Saudi Arabia is not the same as a barrel cut
by Russia,'' said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, Algeria's former oil
minister. ``When the Saudis say they will cut, they do cut. The
Russians are another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest commitment to reduce output came from Saudi Arabia,
which said it would cut back by 585,000 barrels of crude oil a day,
or 7 percent of its daily production of 8 million barrels. Under
the agreement, 10 members of OPEC will reduce output by a total of
1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, an OPEC member and once a leading producer, is not being
asked to reduce its output of 2.6 million barrels a day. It needs
to pump as much oil as possible under the oil-for-food progra

OAHU, BEYOND PEARL HARBOR AND WAIKIKI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 28)  
 (bl)  
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As visitors from even the nearest cities on the mainland United
States know, any trip to Oahu takes at least six hours of air
travel. From the East Coast, the trip can be twice that, or more.
Such is the price of getting to the island that is home to
Honolulu, and of seeing the sights and enjoying all that makes Oahu
the favorite island of those who know Hawaii well.
</P>
<P>
   Oahu offers a multitude of virtues: from the natural beauty of
its mountains and beaches, to the easily-worn East-meets-West
cosmopolitanism of Honolulu, Hawaii's capital and only big city.
And for an island that can seem almost overrun with tourists _
especially the first-time visitors who haunt Waikiki Beach _ many
of Oahu's charms are, if not exactly undiscovered, still very much
unspoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are virtues, there is often a vice, however: Oahu's
ever more burdensome traffic. Much of the morning and afternoon
here resembles a nonstop rush hour. Still, almost any ride of any
distance on this island, no matter how routine, is studded with
spectacular views.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Pali Highway, for example. One of three main
expressways that snake over the impressive, jagged peaks of the
island's mountainous backbone, the Koolau Range, it links the
bedroom communities of the northern side of the island with
Honolulu's business district. It winds gently up into the heavily
forested heights overlooking the capital, before cresting near a
major landmark in the islands' history: the spot where King
Kamehameha defeated his last major rival in 1795, unifying the
island chain for the first time under one man's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at the Pali Lookout, great gray slabs of clouds bank up
against the sheer cliffs where the victorious king is said to have
disposed of his enemies, casting them to their deaths hundreds of
feet below.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning hours, and especially in the magical light
of late afternoon, the lookout is a world of soothing quiet and
luminous green. From the Pali Lookout, you can easily lose yourself
gazing at the lush and peaceful Kaneohe Plain below, with the
shocking blue of the Pacific just beyond. In the opposite
direction, lies the bone white skyline of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing on the Pali Highway to the windward northeast coast
of Oahu, one first enters Kaneohe, originally a small farming
community that has grown up a good bit, but somehow still retains
much of the feel of 1950s America, with its orderly quiet,
low-slung buildings and Main Street feel. Just beyond Kaneohe lies
an even smaller and quieter community, Kailua, where you'll find
Kailua Beach Park, one of Oahu's best public answers to the
exclusive resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on one of the more beguiling beaches in the world,
tourists are relatively few. Generously shaded by the long-needled
ironwood pines that sway gracefully in the breeze, the park has
well-kept public showers, and tables and benches for the weekend
picnickers who congregate here. On weekends, pickup games of
volleyball run pretty much continuously, and the air is filled with
the aroma of small charcoal barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond the fringe of shaded park land lies a white sand
beach that sweeps crescentlike to enclose a picture perfect
blue-green bay. The waters are gentle year-round and the beach's
incline very shallow, making it an ideal place for small children.
</P>
<P>
   A mile or so the southeast is a swimming spot that some say is
even more beautiful _ Lanikai Beach, blessed not only with same
lovely white sand and warm waters but also with the Mokulua islets,
two small and picturesque atolls a short distance offshore. This
milelong beach is more exclusive, only because it is hidden from
easy view behind private waterfront homes of Kailua.
</P>
<P>
   But no beach in Hawaii can be privately owned, and access must
be free to all. To reach Lanikai Beach, all one needs to do is walk
down one of the sandy alleys that separate private property every
50 yards or so. Because of the atolls, this beach is especially
popular among kayakers and canoers.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people drive straight through the Kaneohe area on
their way to somewhere else, it has several interesting sites
worthy of a close look. Among them is the Byodo-In Temple, a 1968
replica of a famous temple of the same name in Japan, which attests
in its majestic way to the cultural influence of the Japanese, who
have been immigrating to Hawaii for over 100 years. Kaneohe is also
home to the 400-acre Hoomaluhia Botanical Garden, which includes a
trail that winds past a 32-acre lake, and the private Haiku
Gardens, one of Hawaii's most beautiful and a popular place for
outdoor weddings.
</P>
<P>
   From this corner of the island, the Kamehameha Highway follows
the coast north to the North Shore of Oahu, made famous by the
surfing culture and competitions that abound there. Places like
Sunset Beach, the nearby Ehukai Beach, home of the so-called Banzai
Pipeline, and Waimea Bay are spots where surfing legends are made
in front of large crowds of onlookers during the winter surfing
season.
</P>
<P>
   Less well-known to the hordes of visitors drawn by the spectacle
of daredevil surfers wiping out in 15-foot waves is one of the most
peaceful places on Oahu: Puu O Mahuka Heiau State Monument. The
site, overlooking Waimea Bay, is accessible after a modest hike or
short drive into cool and forested hills from Kamehameha Highway.
</P>
<P>
   This is the site of one of a number of heiau, traditional
Hawaiian places of worship, that can be seen throughout the
islands, many devoted to healing through herbs, meditation and
ritual sacrifice. This one, with its Zen-like simplicity, broad
open space _ enclosed only by waist-high walls of hand-laid
volcanic stone _ and sacrificial altar, is my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even though visitors will usually find themselves alone here,
people still come to pray and make wishes at the temple, offering
to the spirits small gifts, like coins or stones, often wrapped in
the long leaves of the Ti plant. Given the serenity of the
monument, it is a bit difficult to imagine that it was a place of
worship for the Hawaiian god of war, Ku, in whose name human
sacrifices were once made.
</P>
<P>
   Below the gentle slope of the temple plateau lies a placid
network of tidal pools. The mountains and ocean, with its swells
reduced by the distance to seeming playfulness, form the backdrop
to one of Hawaii's most bewitching places to watch the sun set.
</P>
<P>
   Oahu offers any number of other antidotes to the ordinary
tourist circuit. While Pearl Harbor is a prime stop for sightseers,
another way to see it is from the mountains above, and one is far
less likely to face crowds there. The Aiea Loop Trail, a 4.5-mile
walk in the magnificent eucalyptus-forested cool of the Koolau
Range is the way to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Another hike in the mountains just north of downtown Honolulu is
the two-and-a-half-mile Makiki Loop Trail , which affords some of
the best views of the capital. During the steep ride up the
mountain be sure to keep the windows down to appreciate the
fragrance of wild ginger, mango, guava, eucalyptus and bamboo.
Generations of Hawaiians have told stories of teen-age and other
loves sealed or celebrated in the roadside scenic view spots.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal spot to stop for lunch on the way up or down is the
terrace cafe of the Contemporary Museum, a mountainside estate
whose rolling, immaculate gardens were converted into a showcase
for large and abstract outdoor sculpture. An indoor gallery houses
rotating collections of painting and other art.
</P>
<P>
   To the east of Honolulu lie suburbs like Koko Head and Hawaii
Kai, and farther along, around the tip of the island, Waimanalo, a
farming community. Rugged Hanauma Bay, where surf crashes
incessantly onto the steep, volcanic shoreline, is a highlight of a
drive along this road. At the Halona Blowhole, every few minutes
the waves force great spouts of water to erupt through an old
volcanic lava tube. In winter, humpback whales can be spotted on
their way from the North Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the left of the blowhole, hidden by the craggy volcanic
cliffs but accessible through a short climb down to the shore, is
Halona Cove, the small spit of sand where Burt Lancaster and
Deborah Kerr embraced in ``From Here to Eternity.'' Chances are
good that, given the popularity of Hanauma Bay and the famous Sandy
Beach, close by at the eastern tip of the island, you could enjoy
this spot all alone, too.

   U.S. TRADE OFFICIALS WARN OF DANGER OF STEEL QUOTAS
</P>
<P>
   Facing a wave of protectionist sentiment, two top trade
officials contended that a House-passed measure to impose quotas on
steel imports would hurt the American economy, lead to raw material
shortages and rising prices and could set off a trade war. Speaking
before the Senate Finance Committee, United States Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce Secretary William
Daley said the quotas could disrupt the steel market. In spite of
these warnings, the steel industry and some Senators vowed to push
for quotas.

   The Bank of New York agreed to buy the trust bank of the Royal
Bank of Scotland for an undisclosed sum, making the Bank of New
York the world's largest custodian of investor assets. The Bank of
New York said the purchase would raise its total of assets under

   SBC-AMERITECH DEAL CLEARS HURDLE
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department gave conditional approval to the planned
takeover of Ameritech by SBC Communications, a deal that would
create the nation's largest local telephone company. The deal,
valued at $60 billion when it was announced last May, still
requires the approval of the Federal Communications Commission,
which is reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   POWER PLANT UNITS TO COMBINE
</P>
<P>
   ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's leading
electrical-engineering company, and Alstom of France have agreed to
combine their power plant manufacturing units as recessions in Asia
reduce profits. The joint venture, with $11 billion in annual
sales, will leapfrog General Electric to become the world's biggest
maker of generating equipment. Goeran Lindahl, the chief executive
of ABB, said the company planned to use a $1.5 billion payment from
Alstom to make acquisitions.

<P>
   Edison International, California's second-biggest utility,
agreed to buy 16 power plants in Illinois from Unicom for $4.8
billion in cash as it expands into the Midwest.

   BRITISH TRUCKERS MOVING ABROAD
</P>
<P>
   Faced with far higher license fees and diesel fuel costs than
their Continental rivals, British truck drivers are losing
business, even within Britain. So some are ``flagging out'' _

   TWO NISSAN PARTS UNITS TO MERGE

   Nissan Motor said two parts supplier subsidiaries, Calsonic and
Kansei, would merge, furthering the troubled auto maker's efforts
to simplify its sprawling operations, as it considers Renault's bid
for a 35 percent stake.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Potential GOP presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole visited the home state of possible rival Gov. George
W. Bush on Tuesday, warning that Americans must return to a time of
responsibility and values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual and national character are what we need,'' Dole
said in a speech to the National Petrochemical and Refiners
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has become too bloated and too
bureaucratic, Dole said, and some federal money, particularly in
education, should be turned over to state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must restore our public schools to greatness, returning
discipline and parental involvement to every school in America,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the presidency also should be used in the battle
against illegal drugs, Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need leadership on this issue, and certainly the
bully pulpit of the White House is one place where leadership must
be provided,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole didn't mention the other Republicans who may seek the
presidential nomination in 2000. But she did speak of her decision
to form a presidential exploratory committee to study a possible
run. Bush has also formed such a committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, wife of former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the GOP
nominee for president in 1996, said her qualifications for the job
include Cabinet posts she held in the Reagan and Bush
administrations and her work as head of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the fact that this would be her first run for a
public office, Dole said: ``Well, I was president of my student
government at Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   On a serious note, she cited her Cabinet posts as secretary of
labor and secretary of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact that I've had thirty-plus years in
service to the public. This has been my passion,'' she said.

RELUCTANT SENATE SUPPORTS NATO AIRSTRIKES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate gave reluctant support Tuesday to NATO
airstrikes against the forces of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic
as a bipartisan group of lawmakers backed President Clinton's
effort to stop the killing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-41 vote, however, was hardly a unified statement of
support for Clinton's policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the resolution were 38 of 55 Republicans,
including Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, and
three of 45 Democrats, because they fear all-out war in the region.
Republican Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi was not present for the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if we're not coming close to starting World War
III, we're starting a protracted involvement,'' declared Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-New Hampshire, also voiced opposition, warning
his colleagues that authorizing force against Milosevic ``is a
mistake ... and we're going to regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after Republican leaders agreed to shelve
amendments offered by Hutchison and others that would have blocked
funding for U.S. involvement in a NATO mission unless Clinton
submitted a detailed plan to Congress, complete with a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to set aside those amendments was made after 30
members of the House and Senate met with Clinton at the White
House. He told them that although he hoped for their support, he
planned to go ahead with military action anyway. He said the NATO
air campaign would be aimed at forcing Milosevic back to the
negotiating table, or failing that, degrading his ability to
continue war on ethnic Albanian separatists fighting for
independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed by the Kosovo Albanians two weeks ago,
28,000 NATO troops, including up to 4,000 Americans, would be sent
to Kosovo as peacekeepers. But Milosevic has rejected the plan,
vowing to fight any attempt to insert foreign forces into Serbian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who voted against the authorization
of force, continued to insist that unless NATO forces are invited
in, any attempt to interfere in the situation in Kosovo militarily
would amount to ``an act of war'' on a sovereign nation, as
Milosevic contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, if we conduct airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
we're going to war,'' Nickles said, adding that he believes the air
campaign will escalate to commitment of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., also questioned why the Clinton
administration considers Kosovo more important to U.S. interests
than other countries where ethnic conflicts rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are far greater slaughters taking place in the Sudan and
elsewhere around the world,'' he said, calling it ``highly unwise
and not worth'' the investment of U.S. lives and money to tangle
with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the Vietnam War, he called the measure
authorizing use of military force ``this Senate's Gulf of Tonkin
resolution,'' the passage of which triggered the long U.S.
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's comparison of Kosovo to Vietnam and other conflicts
drew an angry and blunt response from Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
who rejected the contention that the United States has no interests
to protect in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Europe, not Africa or Asia,'' Biden shot back. ``The
loss of life in Somalia and the loss of life in Kosovo ... have
totally different consequences for the interests of the United
States ... What happens if the flood of refugees goes rolling into
Macedonia,'' he said, insisting that the failure of NATO to act now
would damage its credibility and allow the conflict to spread to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice but to deal with this genocidal maniac,''
Biden said, referring to Milosevic. ``We have 365,000 (NATO) troops
in Europe right now to preserve the stability in Europe. ... If
that is a bad idea, then we shouldn't have anybody in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate in the Senate raged Tuesday as U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke's 11th-hour attempt to convince Milosevic to
accept a Washington-brokered peace deal was ending in failure.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison told reporters as she left the White House meeting
that she was convinced that NATO aerial assaults were ``imminent.''
When asked if she would support a resolution authorizing the NATO
bombings, she indicated that she would likely vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While many people may disagree with the president's policies,
I would not want Mr. Milosevic to get the impression that the
troops would not have the full support, and that the president
wouldn't have the support he needs, if we have troops in harm's
way,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hutchison, who has been a leading critic of the
administration's policies in Kosovo and Bosnia, called on Clinton
to provide Congress with a more comprehensive mission plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing a sovereign country that has not threatened the United
States is a very serious step,'' she said. She later voted against
the resolution, an aide said, because the administration had not
made a convincing case for it.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and other Republicans had been prepared to withhold
funding for U.S. involvement in the NATO operation. But vocal
opposition from within Republican ranks to blocking U.S. action
also worked in the president's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is considering a run for the
Republican presidential nomination, took the Senate floor to oppose
amendments offered by Hutchison and others to block U.S.
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Milosevic as a ``remorseless, bloodthirsty''
dictator determined to wipe out the ethnic Albanian population in
Kosovo, McCain pointedly disputed claims by some GOP colleagues
that the killings in Kosovo have not been significant enough to
warrant NATO action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atrocities are the signature of the Serbian Army. They've been
carrying out atrocities since 1992,'' McCain said in remarks that
were highly critical of the Clinton administration for not
following through on two previous threats to stop the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not permit the genocide that Milosevic has in mind for
Kosovo to continue ... We are at a critical hour,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi during
the Vietnam War and held prisoner for six years, also used his
speech to warn Americans about the risks of U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not, in all probability, be a casualty-free
operation,'' he said, adding that the nation would ``likely witness
some heartbreaking moments at Dover Air Force Base'' in Delaware if
Americans are killed in action and brought home for burial.

AID LEADER REFUSES TO LEAVE UNTIL WORKERS ARE EVACUATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of operations for a Northwest-based aid agency in
Kosovo refused to abandon his Albanian staff Tuesday despite fears
of imminent NATO air strikes and massive Serbian retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Heselius, a 66-year-old great-grandfather who has worked
in Kosovo for Mercy Corps International since 1993, said in a
telephone interview Tuesday night that he made two round-trips from
the Kosovo capital of Pristina to the Macedonian border that day to
evacuate several of his Albanian staff. He was able to get most of
them safely across the frontier, but a few were denied entry
because they lacked the proper paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of crossing the border to safety, Heselius and an
American colleague, Scott Charlesworth, twice returned to the
increasingly tense Kosovo capital to help their local staffers
obtain the required exit documents. Tuesday night, the two
Americans were among the last foreigners remaining in the
strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty lonely around here,'' an exhausted Heselius said
after arriving back in Pristina for the second time. ``You get a
little bit of a strange feeling now, when the streets are nearly
empty and you can see the fear in people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Braving Serb checkpoints and the promised threat of NATO air
strikes, Heselius, Charlesworth and their Albanian colleagues who
were unable to get into Macedonia returned to Pristina in two Mercy
Corps vehicles shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Heselius said the group, including four Albanian adults and
seven children, would gather again at 8 a.m. Wednesday. They will
try to obtain the necessary exit documents for the Albanians and
then head straight for the border, about an hour's drive from
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Heselius said he understood the dangers and wanted to get out of
Kosovo as soon as possible. But he said he could not abandon
Albanian Mercy Corps staff and their families who desparately want
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leading these convoys today and feel I'm responsible for
getting these people out,'' said Heselius, a former businessman who
lived in Kirkland, Wash., from 1991 until 1993, when he joined
Mercy Corps and was sent to Kosovo. ``I feel it is necessary to
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a NATO air strike, most analysts predict massive
Serbian retaliation against the Albanian population as well as any
foreigners remaining in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, it will happen if the bombs fall,'' Heselius said
of Serb retaliation. ``There will be a lot of problems here. That's
why we've got to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Heselius is Kosovo country director for Portland-based Mercy
Corps, overseeing some $25 million in aid programs provided by the
agency in Kosovo since 1993. The agency's 49 staff, including nine
expatriates, have provided food, winter gear, stoves, clothing,
seeds and other help to more than 250,000 people, about 10 percent
of the province's total population, Mercy Corps president and
co-founder Dan O'Neill said in the agency's Redmond, Wash., office.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill described the bearded, silver-haired Heselius as man of
``strong Christian faith who is able to get along with most
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's keeping his wits about him in a very difficult
situation,'' O'Neill said. ``He has a very strong sense of
commitment to our staff _ which is our policy everywhere we work.''
</P>
<P>
   Heselius said he decided to evacuate staff Tuesday after the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the main humanitarian
organization in Kosovo, decided to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Heselius said he also felt obligated to accompany those denied
entry to Macedonia back to Pristina because of the increasing Serb
military presence in Kosovo. Military checkpoints have been the
scene of numerous abuses throughout the war-torn Balkans. The
presence of foreigners can sometimes alleviate the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one incident tonight when we were stopped by an armed
soldier who made some nasty remarks about us and NATO,'' Heselius
said. ``He just wanted to see what kind of reaction he could get
out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Heselius' first trip to the Macedonian border Tuesday, he led
a convoy of 22 vehicles, from Mercy Corps as well as other
humanitarian agencies. He then led some of the vehicles back to
Pristina after some of the Albanians were denied entry. At
nightfall, he led a second convoy back to the border, but again
some of the Albanians needed more documents and had to be taken
back to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Heselius said Pristina was extremely tense Tuesday afternoon and
evening, with the sound of gunfire echoing through surrounding
suburbs and people displaced by fighting wandering the roads with
nowhere to go. One Albanian staff member of the International
Rescue Committee, a U.S. aid agency, was killed in a grenade attack
on a cafe. Another IRC staffer was wounded, Heselius said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of incidents are just going to increase, I'm
afraid,'' Heselius said. ``The Serb military presence is
increasing. We had tanks driving past here the other day, about 50
of them coming right up our road. We've seen a lot of troop convoys
and planes and helicopters overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Heselius said he's looking forward to joining his wife in
Florida, where the couple recently bought a home. They have four
children, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

 &HT;    Dole takes stage at state oil convention
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects tagline to credit Palm Beach Post.)
 &HT;    By Kelley Shannon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Potential GOP presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole visited the home state of possible rival Gov. George
W. Bush on Tuesday, warning that Americans must return to a time of
responsibility and values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual and national character are what we need,'' Dole
said in a speech to the National Petrochemical and Refiners
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has become too bloated and too
bureaucratic, Dole said, and some federal money, particularly in
education, should be turned over to state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must restore our public schools to greatness, returning
discipline and parental involvement to every school in America,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the presidency also should be used in the battle
against illegal drugs, Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need leadership on this issue, and certainly the
bully pulpit of the White House is one place where leadership must
be provided,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole didn't mention the other Republicans who may seek the
presidential nomination in 2000. But she did speak of her decision
to form a presidential exploratory committee to study a possible
run. Bush has also formed such a committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, wife of former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the GOP
nominee for president in 1996, said her qualifications for the job
include Cabinet posts she held in the Reagan and Bush
administrations and her work as head of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the fact that this would be her first run for a
public office, Dole said: ``Well, I was president of my student
government at Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   On a serious note, she cited her Cabinet posts as secretary of
labor and secretary of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact that I've had thirty-plus years in
service to the public. This has been my passion,'' she said.

 &HT;    State burns canker-infected citrus trees
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With a spray of diesel fuel and the
flick of a cigarette lighter, state contractors began torching
grapefruit trees Tuesday in a Hendry County grove infected with
citrus canker bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The burning was the first step in the planned destruction of
about 280 acres of orange and grapefruit trees at two commercial
groves in the state's largest citrus-growing county.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were just right,'' said Wendell Bowman, a
senior management analyst who is supervising the fires for the
state Department of Agriculture's Division of Plant Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Crews burned about 10 acres of red grapefruit trees Tuesday at
Siboney Citrus Inc., where 260 acres of orange trees and grapefruit
trees are to be destroyed in the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, state inspectors found evidence of the disease at
the Siboney grove _ about 500 acres just west of the Palm Beach
County line. A few weeks later, they saw it at a nearby grove owned
by the Seminole tribe of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results last week confirmed what state pathologists were
sure of: The groves are infected with Asian citrus canker, which
kills citrus trees, but is harmless to people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to stop the canker bacteria, which can be carried
on clothes and equipment and spread by wind and rain, is to destroy
infected trees.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors uproot the trees and let them sit in 15-foot piles
to dry for several days before setting them on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those trees ignite very easily,'' said Jack Neitzke, director
of the Division of Plant Industry's Immokalee Canker Project.
</P>
<P>
   The fires must be put out an hour before sundown. Once the
burning is complete, contractors turn the soil to cut roots and
bury the remaining plant material, Neitzke said.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of 260 acres _ about 43,000 trees _ at Siboney
is expected to cost the state about $70,000. In addition, the state
will pay to burn about 21 acres of grapefruit trees at the Seminole
grove, Neitzke said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government this month pledged $25 million to battle
canker in Florida. The state legislature still is working on a plan
to find an additional $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The objective is to stamp out the disease before it devastates
Florida's $8.5 billion commercial citrus industry, which employs
more than 121,000.
</P>
<P>
   Grove owners, who will not be reimbursed for the lost trees, are
required to wait at least one year before replanting in the burned
areas, Neitzke said.
</P>
<P>
   Once state inspectors complete surveys of land surrounding the
infected groves, possibly as early as next week, quarantine
boundaries will be established.
</P>
<P>
   Any grove operating within or handling fruit from the quarantine
area will have to comply with state guidelines on sanitation,
decontamination and transportation of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a quarantine,'' Neitzke said. ``It's just a
matter of where.''

 &HT;    Arson hits Delray developer's ski retreat
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Developer and philanthropist Thomas Worrell
was welcomed with open arms by city officials and other investors
when he began buying and restoring old historic buildings downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But after Worrell undertook a similar venture in Taos, a ski
town in New Mexico's high desert country, a mountainside mansion he
was renovating as a family home was destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the New Mexico fire marshal's office and Taos
Fire Department concluded the Feb. 12 fire, which caused $1.8
million to $2.4 million in damage, was arson. Fire officials
estimated the 14,000-square-foot, two-story home would have been
worth about $4.5 million when completed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more than two dozen buildings Worrell has bought in
Taos have been covered with graffiti, with messages such as ``Go
home, get out'' and ``Watch your back.'' On March 15, three shots
were fired at a security guard outside Worrell's 150-year-old
adobe-style home, which he plans to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern New Mexico has always been suspicious of outsiders,''
said Taos District Attorney John Paternoster, whose office is
conducting the arson investigation with the state police.
</P>
<P>
   But Paternoster also said the arson investigation is focusing on
``disgruntled former employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Worrell, 53, was not available for comment Tuesday, but his
representatives said some in Taos view him as an outsider trying to
take over the town.
</P>
<P>
   Taos Mayor Fred Peralta said a few folks who ``were used to
things the way they were'' did not take a liking to Worrell and the
way he flaunted his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time somebody comes in and does the things he has done, it
always raises questions about why he's doing it,'' Peralta said.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell, who made his multimillion-dollar fortune selling
newspapers, discovered Taos a couple of years ago when he was
looking for a special place to take his wife, Odette, for her
birthday, his Delray Beach attorney, Rodney Romano, said.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled between the massive adobe landmarks of St. Francis of
Assisi Church on the south and the Taos Indian Pueblo on the north,
the town of about 10,000 permanent residents attracts an influx of
winter visitors for some of the nation's finest skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Taos also is known as an arts center, with more than 80
galleries featuring paintings, pottery, sculpture and other art
with a Southwestern flavor. The blend of Indian, Spanish and Anglo
cultures gives the community its distinctive character.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell ran into trouble early on in Taos for not following
historic preservation rules, Peralta said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Worrell has hired a historian and architect to
restore the buildings as much as possible to their original
condition. ``He's trying to be sensitive to local customs,'' Romano
said.
</P>
<P>
   In both Delray Beach and Taos, Worrell has drawn criticism for
the bright colors and flashy features he uses in his redevelopment
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell converted one of Delray's oldest houses, a 1905
Methodist rectory, into his real estate development office and gave
it a pink and turquoise paint job. His buildings in the first block
of South Swinton Avenue and near the city's railroad tracks are
bright yellow, green and peach.
</P>
<P>
   In Taos, some think Worrell's taste is sinful, Peralta said.
Others think it gives downtown a much fresher face.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell has no plans to leave Taos, despite the threats and
violence, Romano said. To show his commitment, he has opened a home
school for children from poor families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been very good to the community and supported a
number of activities and organizations he didn't have to,'' Peralta
said. ``He's trying to become a productive member of the
community.''

`IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW ...': L.A. TAKES A BEATING IN SHARP
NEW  SITCOM

<P>
   ``It's Like, You Know ...'' is the worst show title on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd ever admit to watching ``It's Like, You Know ...''? You
might say, ``I caught `Frasier' last night,'' or ``I stayed home
and watched `Homicide.''' But, ``I saw `It's Like, You Know ...'''?
Huh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   A shame, because ``It's Like, You Know ...'' could be the
season's best new comedy. Not counting ``The Sopranos'' on HBO, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of two diverting new comedies on ABC Wednesday night.
The other, ``The Norm Show,'' catches Norm Macdonald on a quick
rebound after his dishonorable discharge from ``Saturday Night
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``It's Like, You Know ...'' is the attention-getter because
it dabs a vague ``Seinfeld'' fragrance onto a cheeky satire of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The show's creator is Peter Mehlman, a writing and producing
veteran of ``Seinfeld.'' His New Yorkish take on L.A. is revealed
through the character of Arthur (Chris Eigeman), an East Coast
magazine writer who has agreed to experience L.A. so that he can
harpoon it in a book.
</P>
<P>
   (It's Eigeman's first TV series, but you'll recognize him as the
Pac Bell man in the commercials from a few years ago, or as the
actor who stretched his vowels and his neuroses in the Whit
Stillman movies ``Metropolitan,'' ``Barcelona'' and ``The Last Days
of Disco.'')
</P>
<P>
   As Arthur, Eigeman stays in L.A. with his college roommate,
Robbie (Steven Eckholdt), who is occupying a guest house belonging
to his buddy Shrug (Evan Handler). Shrug is rich _ trust-fund rich
_ idle, slightly guilty about it all, and bald.
</P>
<P>
   There are your three guys. The show's two women may be more of
an inspiration. Lauren (A.J. Langer) is a masseuse and a legal
process server. Better still is Jennifer Grey, of ``Dirty Dancing''
and ``Red Dawn'' notoriety, as herself, the friendly neighborhood
actress living next door to the guest house.
</P>
<P>
   The show's short scenes, quirky characters in roles big and
small, and lack of potent plot turns all seem to reflect Mehlman's
``Seinfeld'' background. But the emphasis on satirizing Southern
California gives ``It's Like, You Know ...'' its own reason to
exist.
</P>
<P>
   The city's dominant car culture figures in the first two shows.
Tonight, Robbie is a hero, and is introduced to a fashion model,
simply because his car horn is broken. And much is made of the fact
that Robbie and Shrug spot Elliott Gould driving a Honda. Next
week, the five characters spend an entire day watching a high-speed
freeway chase on TV. It's the L.A. equivalent of a ``snow day.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is L.A. so ripe for biting? If you need to know, here's
Robbie:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take a drive to take a walk. The houses are ugly,
the clothes are loud, the bagels are doughy, the pizza sucks, the
murder trials last two years, the marriages last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you throw in earthquakes, aftershocks, mudslides, road
rage, race riots, guns, tasers, pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as your head's about to explode, boom, one warm afternoon
you play softball and you think to yourself, my God, it's January.
Next day you wake up, it's two years later, you've sold out every
belief you hold sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   About then, he might have added, you find yourself eating Dodger
dogs and figuring you could beat the traffic if you left in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``The Norm Show,'' it has a perfect picture of who its
star is and what qualities, or lack of qualities, Macdonald
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald's exasperated boss on the show (Bruce Jarchow) says
it: ``You know, I can never tell if you're joking or you're just
plain stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it, Norm Macdonald in 14 words. He's a bit old
for a slacker, but you get the impression that he started early in
life.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald plays Norm Henderson, a former professional hockey
player who was banned from the sport for gambling and tax evasion,
and who is employed as a social worker as his community-service
penance. One misstep and he's off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The humor is in a character who cares not a whit about other
people _ accentuated by that joking or just plain stupid attitude _
and finds himself in a job that's all about other people's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   When a client goes bad, Macdonald shrugs and says to a
colleague, ``I lost one, so what?'' But TV is TV, so in due course
the viewer learns that ol' Norm is rotten and lazy on the outside
but tender inside.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his nonchalance drives his closest work companion nuts.
That would be Laurie Metcalf, late of ``Roseanne,'' as a
rule-conscious social worker who is appalled, and maybe a bit
intrigued, by Norm.
</P>
<P>
   The show seems to be as loose-jointed and insouciant as its
star. But the writing, at least on the pilot, can abruptly kick and
rear itself to a point.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Norm adopts a dog tonight, and then the original
owner wants it back. Norm won't give it back. Hey, says the guy,
you can't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're social workers, pal,'' Norm tells him. ``We can take
(set ital)children.(end ital)''

WATER RIDE SURVIVORS SAY RAFT FILLED WITH WATER BEFORE IT CAPSIZED

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Before their boat flipped over and trapped
them underwater Sunday evening at Six Flags Over Texas, passengers
on the Roaring Rapids Ride said they noticed water rising above
their ankles, followed by a crashing sound.
</P>
<P>
   Ride inspectors gathered around the site of the tragedy on
Tuesday, examining a series of pipes designed to sit underwater and
create the rides' white-water effects. The pool area, just 200 feet
from the end of the ride, marks the approximate spot where
passengers recalled the raft striking something or becoming jammed
on an object beneath the churning water.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after feeling the impact, the 12-seat raft dipped below
the water surface on the downstream side, causing the current to
push the rear up and over, survivor Courtney Hanks and others said
on Tuesday. During the ordeal, survivors and park officials said,
the raft had become separated from its doughnut-shaped inflatable
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I thought it would go back down. When I saw we
weren't going down, I took the seat belt and ripped it off of us,''
said Hanks, 18. ``I saw it happening. I thought, `I'm going to
die.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve people were strapped in their seats when the boat tipped
over about 5:20 p.m. Visitors and park security workers jumped in
the water to help rescue the passengers but were unable to save
28-year-old Valeria Cartwright of West Helena, Ark. Ten passengers
were treated for injuries, and two remained hospitalized last
night.
</P>
<P>
   The park will reopen as scheduled on Saturday, but the ride will
remain closed until the investigation is complete and a Texas
Department of Insurance inspection is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials said they are investigating several different
situations that could have caused the deadly accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're casting a wide net,'' said park spokeswoman Nancy St.
Pierre. ``We're not going in with blinders on.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre said the ride had been shut down earlier Sunday to
inspect a problem that was discovered by the park's computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our maintenance people came out, inspected the ride, reset the
ride and tested the ride before letting people back on it,'' she
said. ``That was in the conveyor belt area. It had nothing to do
with the accident on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre would not comment on any theories by passengers about
what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with TIG Insurance, the Irving-based insurance company
of Six Flags' parent, Premier Parks Inc., also declined comment on
possible causes of the fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still investigating and it's too early to draw any kind
of conclusion,'' a TIG spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Park maintenance and safety officials are investigating the
accident along with Premier's safety engineer. Investigations are
also being conducted by the ride's manufacturer, Intamin AG, and
officials with Canyon Manufacturing, which made the inner-tube
base.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Insurance oversees ride safety and
requires the operator to perform annual inspections, carry at least
$1 million in liability insurance on each ride and file quarterly
injury reports for each ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring Rapids ride has been a popular attraction since it
was installed in 1983. The 1 1/2 to 2 minute ride sends passengers
in rafts through a series of rapids. Water flows over pipes
installed laterally along the course to create turbulance and move
water through the course.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said they felt something was wrong before the boat
capsized. Ginny Venneberg, 40, was sitting on the upstream side of
the raft and noticed that the downstream end of raft hit what
looked like a platform and came to a stop before it capsized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see something there,'' said Venneberg from her home in
Lawrence, Kan. ``It looked like a platform. Maybe it was made of
wood. I don't know what it was, but it was like it didn't have
enough water for the boat to go over it. I don't remember hearing a
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Venneberg, like several other passengers on the ride, also said
there was ankle- to calf-deep water inside the raft before it
capsized. Venneberg said she recalled commenting, almost in a
joking way, to another passenger that the raft was going to sink if
the water continued to build up.
</P>
<P>
   She said she's been on the water ride and similar rides many
times before, and that she had ``never seen it fill up that much''
with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was higher than I've ever seen it in those boats,'' she
said. ``Usually it splashes in and runs out, but this didn't and it
began it to worry me.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Wilson, 23, of Everman, Texas, said that many of the
passengers were commenting about how the raft was going to sink if
more water accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were half serious and half joking,'' she said. ``We were
not consciously thinking that something was seriously wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then ``it felt like it hit something,'' she said. ``It felt as
though it jammed against something and came to a dead stop.
Everybody was looking like, `Why have we stopped and the farthest
end away from me began to sink. My end was at the top and it began
to lift straight up in the air, almost perpendicular. The water was
pushing so hard, it pushed us straight over.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Martin, an associate professor of civil and environmental
engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington, said that
based on the reports from the passengers, extra water in the raft
could have caused it to capsize if there was a wave of water coming
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wave lifts up the raft, the water inside rushes up front,
changing the center of gravity and further destabilzes the raft,
possibly toppling over,'' Spindler said.
</P>
<P>
   Spindler added that he would need to know the size of the raft,
the weight of the people inside the raft and the distribution of
weight to determine exactly what effect the extra water inside may
have had. He said the excess water may not have drained properly
from the raft if the tubes surrounding the raft were underinflated
or improperly attached to the raft.
</P>
<P>
   But Spindler said there is a point that if there is too much
water in the raft, it won't tip over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a critical point at which the water has to be to have
that effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, a theme park in Tampa, Florida, that
has a ride similar to Roaring Rapids, employees are required to
follow and observe rafts from the banks throughout the ride, said
Margaret Norquist, public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They follow them for safety reasons,'' she said. ``We have
cameras that allow us to monitor the raft as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafts for the Busch Gardens ride, which is called the Congo
River Rapids, have never taken in water, other than the normal
amount that comes in over the sides during the ride, Norquist said.
There have been no injuries reported since the ride was introduced
in 1982, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Gardens will not change its safety procedures and the
Congo River Rapids will continue to operate despite the Arlington
accident, Norquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very thorough safety feature in place and all of our
rides are inspected every day,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Miniland, with its stunning Lego-built reconstruction of New
York, Washington and New Orleans, among other places, is the
LEGOLAND masterpiece. But several other attractions combine to
create an interactive atmosphere of wonder:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Legoland band, whose jaunty tunes can be heard in most
corners of the park, is not your usual group of strolling
minstrels. The orchestra consists of brightly colored instruments
placed in a row near the park's entrance. Stand on the colored
circle corresponding to an instrument and water begins shooting up,
music begins to play. When enough people stand on enough circles,
the whole fountain band, called Stepping Tones, kicks in, and
oompah fills the California air.
</P>
<P>
   _ An elevated monorail provides the best views of the park and
surrounding hills, and riders have plenty of time to look, for the
Sky Cycle will never be confused with a roller coaster. The cars
are pedal-powered, for one thing. Only if young (or old) legs tire
do the electric motors in the Lego-themed vehicles kick in.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the ground, the most comprehensive look at the park comes
from the seat of a boat inching its way along the moatlike lake
that traverses the park. The pace of the trip reminds one of barge
rides on San Antonio's River Walk, with Legoland riders treated to
Lego-rendered shore attractions like Mount Rushmore and the Taj
Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legoland has the stated aim of raising America's expectations
of theme-park cuisine. The Fun Town Market offers a massive salad
bar, pastries, fresh bread and fruit, but the hot entrees set the
place apart. My Swiss stir-fry, potatoes and vegetables, was
prepared while I waited. It was delicious, as was my wife's
ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legoland devotes 13,000 square feet to its youngest visitors,
kids ages 2 through 6. It's called Playtown, with a colorful maze
for kids to crawl, hide and swing on, a miniature train, and
interactive adventures _ talking to the Lego fire chief on the
telephone, listening to a heartbeat through a stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legoland more or less insists on occasional rest. For that,
the Enchanted Walk is as fine a place as any. The path leads
through a forest, with Lego fish leaping from a real brook, gray
Lego rabbits, Lego deer, Lego fox, Lego owls and squirrels in real
trees. The peace and quiet is real, too.

COMMENTARY: SAVING PRIVATE GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore could do worse than to take a lesson from
the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitability can be insufferable.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president could turn out to be the ``Saving Private
Ryan'' of presidential candidates. Last summer, Steven Spielberg's
World War II movie was proclaimed all but certain to win best
picture. It was worthy. It was good. It was dutiful. There was
nothing flashy or sexy about it. It was, in short, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of hearing about the front-runner's
invincibility, Academy voters couldn't wait to overturn it _
preferring to make love, not war _ and give the statuette to a
sassy Elizabethan upstart with a biting political campaign and a
clever message.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Al might do well to nudge aside his Dreamworks team and
lend an ear to Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax big shot who toppled
``Ryan'' with his ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has all the classic trappings of the front-runner. He has
bulldozed endorsements from the Democratic chieftains, Dick
Gephardt and Tom Daschle, and scooped up money from Wall Street to
Hollywood. He recycles small, poll-tested policies and bite-sized
issues, like creating a special telephone number for commuters in
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   His itsy-bitsy ``livability'' issues echo Dick Morris, who
brought President Clinton back from the brink of political
extinction by having him cater to the worries of self-centered
boomers. But some Gore supporters wonder if it's wise to repeat the
trick.
</P>
<P>
   There's a weird syndrome kicking in. The more the vice president
hugs his mantle of inevitability _ the closer he moves to the prize
he has wanted his whole life _ the more skittish he gets about
taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   His Hollywood gurus want to rush in with some speech coaching.
His old friends see the pressure building and tell him to loosen
up.
</P>
<P>
   The more afraid he is to make mistakes, the more mistakes he
makes. The more the coast looks clear, the more Gore throws
impediments in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has the background and accomplishments to be
president, he takes no Clintonesque joy in campaigning and seems
insecure, giving curiously flat and airless speeches and needlessly
inflating his feats and his history.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the vice president has repeated the mistake he made
with ``Love Story'' and drawn ridicule by boasting that he was the
father of the Internet and a master at cleaning hog waste and
plowing farmland with a team of mules.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so afraid to make mistakes,'' said one Democrat who has
worked with him and likes him. ``You hold everything in and hold
everything in and hold everything in and then all of a sudden,
stuff pops out.''
</P>
<P>
   He first played the Good Son to his father, the legendary
Tennessee senator and populist stemwinder. He then played the Good
Brother to the wayward and sweet-talking Bill Clinton, in a sort of
West Wing version of ``East of Eden.'' Now he seems tongue-tied and
timid.
</P>
<P>
   The closer he gets to the crown, the less Prince Albert is able
to integrate the two sides of his personality. He shows the more
appealing side to reporters and friends in private. But get him on
a podium and he coils and clinches, reading even the simplest
greeting or expression of gratitude in a dead-zone voice.
</P>
<P>
   At a Gore 2000 fund-raiser at a Washington hotel, one prominent
Democratic supporter derided Gore's freeze-dried remarks with a
sardonic aside, saying, ``Gee, he should think about bottling
that.'' Tipper Gore didn't help the sizzle factor by introducing
her husband as ``a fine fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton doesn't even bother to recover from mistakes. He
just keeps going. Al Gore spends a week plotting a strategy to fix
his mistake and finally comes up with a self-deprecating joke at
just the moment everyone has started forgetting the original gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 2000 race is between two dauphins born at third
base. Al and George are the sons of famous politicians named Al and
George. While they both may suffer from famous-father syndrome,
they are reacting against their dads in different ways. Gore's
supporters worry that he is too controlled and zombielike. George
W.'s supporters fear he isn't controlled enough and in the heat of
a campaign may become hotheaded.
</P>
<P>
   One has yet to articulate in a fetching way. One has yet to
articulate at all. It won't be long before we look back
nostalgically to the days when politics was entertainment.

 KIWI AIRLINES FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; TAKEOVER BY PAN AM EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story is a late substitute for DAIMLER-CHRYSLER on the
Business Day front page.) 
(mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kiwi International Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection
Tuesday, stipulating that it had a commitment from Pan American
Airlines Inc. of $3 million in new financing to pay off Kiwi's
debts.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives of both airlines, the Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing in New Jersey was structured to lay groundwork
for a takeover of Kiwi by Pan American, which itself was acquired
while under bankruptcy court protection in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Kiwi said there would be no interruptions in
flights.
</P>
<P>
   For Kiwi, a once-innovative, employee-owned carrier best known
for its budget-fare flights from Newark, N.J., International
Airport, the move Tuesday promised a financial reprieve only hours
after the Transportation Department threatened to revoke its
operating certificate.
</P>
<P>
   The department, saying it was no longer confident of Kiwi's
management, cited large financial losses by the airline and its
failure to pay fees at airports from which it operates, which
officials said have accumulated into an unpaid debt of $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department said Kiwi, based in Newark, had an
operating loss of $19.8 million in 1998 and a net loss of $20.6
million for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an acceptable financial revamping plan is submitted by
Kiwi within two weeks, the government said it may withdraw the
airline's authority to fly, perhaps leading to disruption and
losses for passengers who have booked tickets on Kiwi flights weeks
or months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department rarely revokes airline certificates,'' said
Rodney Slater, the transportation secretary, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said one reason to publicize the threat against Kiwi was to
``prevent potential harm and inconvenience to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, a takeover of Kiwi by Pan American would combine
two of the nation's most beleaguered airlines. Both carriers, now
privately held, have emerged from bankruptcies. A Kiwi spokesman,
Robert Kulat, said Tuesday night that any final takeover
discussions would not take place until after Kiwi had satisfied its
debts and emerged from bankruptcy court protection. But he added
that Pan American would have a leg up on any other potential
suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Pan American, which for decades was among the nation's largest
airlines before it sought bankruptcy protection in 1998, was
acquired that year by Timothy Mellon, a descendant of the
Pittsburgh Mellon dynasty, and David Fink, a partner and co-owner
of Guilford Transportation Industries, a rail freight company in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   The two investors have since operated Pan American as a charter
airline, expanding their fleet to seven jets from only two when it
was acquired. By acquiring Kiwi, Pan American could gain regularly
scheduled access to the airports used by Kiwi in Newark; Orlando,
Palm Beach and Miami in Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly interested,'' said Fink in an interview
Tuesday from Pan American's headquarters at the former Pease Air
Force Base in Portsmouth, N.H. Asked if the company would keep a
budget rate fare strategy, using Newark as a hub for a combined
airline, he said, ``We would like to do the best that is possible
along those lines but would try to avoid the problems that Kiwi has
encountered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such problems have plagued both Kiwi and its passengers in
recent years. The airline, founded by pilots from several bankrupt
airlines in 1992, had been instantly popular with New York area
customers because of its low-rate flights, including a $99 ticket
from Newark to Orlando, before running out of money and filing for
bankruptcy protection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was rescued by an outside investor new to the airline
industry, Dr. Charles Edwards, a Baltimore physician who bought
Kiwi and has retained his position as its chairman while continuing
a regular practice in spinal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hopes that Edward's infusion of cash, known to be
more than $5 million, would reverse its decline, Kiwi encountered a
rash of customer complaints the last two years about things like
erratic service and canceled flights. It was forced to cancel its
service to Boston last year after it fell behind in payments to
Logan International Airport, which threatened it with eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Using only leased aircraft, Kiwi has seen a sharp erosion in its
fleet, which fell to only six planes in February after two were
repossessed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, Kiwi said it had named Gene
Gillespie, a lawyer who has had much day-to-day authority over its
operations, as its chief executive. It said Edwards would remain as
chairman, but in an interview, Kulat, the company spokesman, said
the Transportation Department had made clear that it wanted Edwards
removed from day-to-day management authority.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to speculate on financial terms of a takeover by
Pan American, Kulat said Kiwi was confident that its fresh infusion
of cash would suffice to appease its creditors and meet the demands
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's threat that it could be shut down by the
government _ perhaps in less than a month _ Kulat said Kiwi
employees were continuing to encourage people to book flights far
in advance. ``We are telling people we will be here for them,'' he
said.

UNDER FIRE, GIULIANI SOFTENS TONE TOWARD CRITICS OF THE POLICE
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While protesters chanted outside police headquarters
a few hundred yards away, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani delivered a
measured defense on Tuesday of his administration's response to the
Amadou Diallo shooting, praising the overall efforts of the New
York City Police Department but avoiding the caustic tone he has
often turned on his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were the dismissive comments that have prompted so much
criticism in recent weeks _ his references to acts of civil
disobedience as ``silly,'' to the various investigations into
police misconduct as ``piling on.'' Instead, the mayor asserted
that he was sensitive to the concerns of black New Yorkers and
acknowledged that some police officers may have problems with race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there is a feeling in the minority community
that police officers are unfair to them,'' Giuliani said at his
daily news conference in City Hall. ``I think there is a reality to
that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In another shift, Giuliani later confirmed that he had finally
agreed to meet this week with Manhattan Borough President Virginia
Fields, one of several black elected officials who have complained
about being repeatedly rebuffed by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But if the tenor of the mayor's comments was free of the vitriol
he has sometimes injected into the public discourse, the substance
remained essentially the same: The city's police department is the
best in the country. Some people are taking political advantage of
a tragedy. And he remains committed to being a leader who is guided
by facts, not emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my reaction to this, for me, represents the kind of
leadership that I want to give the city,'' he said, adding: ``I
think that my handling of this has been sensitive. It's been
sensitive to the concerns of the family. It's been sensitive to the
concerns of the community. It's also been sensitive to the concerns
of the police department and police officers, and ultimately will
be seen as a sensible way to guide the city through a crisis like
this, when in the past other people have wavered.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was shot to death in the
Bronx last month by four white police officers assigned to an elite
street crimes unit. As the Bronx grand jury investigating the
circumstances of Diallo's death draws to a close, lawyers for the
four officers who shot the street peddler announced Tuesday that
their clients had decided not to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday marked the 11th day of civil disobedience outside police
headquarters in lower Manhattan; 71 people were arrested, including
the actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. The married couple join a
diverse and ever-growing list of arrested protesters, including
former Mayor David Dinkins, former Manhattan Borough President Ruth
Messinger, and Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a difficult week for Giuliani. Black and Latino
leaders continued to charge that the mayor fails to appreciate how
the Diallo case crystallized, for them, the police department's
aggressive approach in minority neighborhoods. A New York Times
poll indicated that his approval rating had plummeted. And Gov.
George Pataki, his fellow New York Republican and political rival,
suggested that the case warranted more sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the criminal investigation by the Bronx district
attorney, the state attorney general, the U.S. attorney's office
for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn and the U.S.
attorney's office for the Southern District of New York in
Manhattan are also conducting inquiries into police practices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Public Advocate Mark Green _ who last week called
on Police Commissioner Howard Safir to resign _ and other elected
officials from the city met Monday afternoon to discuss how to
transform street protests into legislative reform on the issue of
police brutality and misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has routinely responded to these criticisms with the
pugnacity for which he is sometimes known. But given the delicate
nature of the Diallo case, some have found his comments wanting,
even inflammatory. On Monday, for example, Jesse Jackson called on
Attorney General Janet Reno to visit New York, where, he said, the
mayor ``has set a very explosive climate.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks on Tuesday, the mayor repeatedly tiptoed toward
the conciliatory, but always with enough room to take a step back
for what he called ``perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged the distrust that many minority residents
harbor for the police, he quickly added that this realization ``is
not something new,'' and that the city had grappled with
allegations of prejudice within the police force for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I have a sense of perspective about it,'' he said. ``Just
as there is reality to that, there is also reality to excessive
stereotyping and bashing of the police department, and a very
similar kind of prejudice against police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that his responsibility was to find the balance
between two ``extreme prejudices'': those he described as
inveterate ``police bashers'' and those who think that the police
can commit no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and Safir had been vigilant in weeding out bad
police officers from the force, and have tried to address the
concerns raised by the Diallo case and others. They have begun yet
another, more ambitious minority recruitment drive, and have
brought back every member of the street crimes unit _ to which the
four implicated officers belong _ for retraining ``on how to deal
with people, how to be more careful, how to be more respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   But he asserted that the police department, whose tactics have
helped to dramatically reduce the city's crime and homicide rates,
``is the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean they don't make terrible mistakes,'' the mayor
said. ``It doesn't mean they can't improve. But they have got to be
given credit for the things they achieve, including in the area of
dealing with minorities respectfully and exercising restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a two-way street,'' he added. ``We have spent two and
a half months excessively on one side of that street. Somebody's
got to spend a little time on the other side of the street.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani also said that he would resist any attempt by the
federal government to oversee the police force _ a possible, if
unlikely, outgrowth of the federal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This police department, for all of its problems and
imperfections, stands up very very well as against other urban
police departments,'' he said. ``And before you come to New York
City, you better start going to look at those police departments.
Otherwise, then, I will not only listen to the suggestions that
there is a political aim here but it will be quite apparent that
there is.''
</P>
<P>
   In pleading for understanding, however, the mayor's failure to
develop any rapport with the city's black elected leaders came back
to haunt him. During his news conference, he said that if State
Controller Carl McCall ``asks for a meeting about this or any other
subject, I'll meet with him.''
</P>
<P>
   This came as news to McCall, who was one of the 141 people
arrested outside police headquarters on Monday. The controller
immediately dashed off a letter to the Mayor _ copies of which were
also faxed to the news media _ saying that he too welcomed such a
meeting. He also noted that ``since our last meeting at City Hall
at 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 30, 1994, you have rejected every
request for a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the conclusion of his news conference, the mayor
flew to Syracuse to receive a ``Citizen of the Year'' award from a
Jewish organization. Speaking to reporters there, he confirmed that
he planned to meet with Ms. Fields, a meeting that was brokered by
Peter Vallone, the speaker of the City Council. But he was clearly
annoyed that Vallone's aides had publicized the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also sought to play down any upstate impression that
the Diallo case had the city in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no unrest,'' he said, using a word introduced by a
reporter. ``The city of New York is safer than it's been in a very,
very long time. The sense of crisis does not extend in the city. I
know what unrest is. There is no unrest going on in the city.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an 11th-hour diplomatic effort failed,
President Clinton on Tuesday set the stage for almost immediate
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, warning Americans that US
involvement in the conflict would not be a ``a slam-dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bombing campaign against Serbian targets now apparently
just a matter of timing and tactics, congressional leaders who had
opposed US military involvement reversed course, saying they wanted
to support the troops.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was on his way to
Washington when he responded to the escalating crisis by directing
his pilot to return to Russia. Vice President Al Gore had told
Primakov he could not guarantee that airstrikes would not take
place during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Airstrikes quickly gained an appearance of inevitability after
US special envoy Richard Holbrooke left Belgrade Tuesday morning
without getting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to sign a
peace agreement. Holbrooke described the situation with the Serbian
leader as ``the bleakest since we began this effort almost four
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The envoy then flew to Brussels to brief NATO leaders on his
failed talks with Milosevic. Afterward, NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana announced he was directing US General Wesley Clark,
the alliance's military commander, to launch airstrikes in
Yugoslavia. Solana said he made the decision after extensive
consultations with the allies and after it had become clear that
all attempts to achieve a negotiated political settlement had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said Yugoslavia had failed to heed the demands of the
international community to accept an interim peace agreement and
end the use of force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert invited Clinton to appear before a
joint House-Senate session after the attack begins to explain his
decision. Clinton, who sent a letter to Congress explicitly asking
for congressional support for airstrikes, said he would consider
it.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the first phase of a NATO-led bombing
campaign is aimed at ``blinding'' Serbia's substantial air defense
radar and missile systems with an attack by Air Force bombers and
cruise missiles launched from US Navy ships and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plans for a swift and severe air campaign,'' said
Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman. ``We believe this will be
painful for the Serbs. We hope that relatively quickly'' they
``will realize they have made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has eight B-52 bombers based in England that could
fly to the Adriatic and launch cruise missiles without having to
enter Yugoslav airspace, Bacon said. The Navy also has four
warships and two attack submarines in the Adriatic armed with
Tomahawk cruise missiles. Of the roughly 400 allied aircraft,
almost half are American.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the B-2 Spirit bomber, whose stealth technology is
designed to make it almost invisible to enemy air defense systems,
could be deployed. It has never been used in combat before.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton briefed about 40 key members of Congress in the White
House residence for the second time in four days on the imminent
strikes. Then he used a speech at a labor conference to offer his
most detailed rationale for the US policy in the Balkans, even
invoking the history of conflict in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He said America's involvement in Kosovo is about ``our values.''
He asked, ``What if someone had listened to Winston Churchill and
stood up to Adolf Hitler earlier? How many peoples' lives might
have been saved?''
</P>
<P>
   The president said military action would limit Milosevic's
ability to carry out ethnic cleansing against the Albanians, as
well as prevent a refugee crisis and a wider war that could spread
beyond the Balkans to neighboring Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do it now, we'll have to do it later, and more
people will die, and it will cost more money,'' Clinton said. He
also suggested a long-term strategic reason for US involvement.
``Our children need a stable, free Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to level with you. . . . This is like any other
military action. There are risks in it,'' Clinton told the
convention of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a slam-dunk,'' he added. ``This is a difficult
issue. . . . I believe that the position I have taken is the best
of a lot of bad alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   As events swiftly spiraled toward a showdown in Kosovo, Primakov
abruptly postponed his visit to discuss economic and scientific
cooperation between the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long opposed any attack on the Serbs but joined the
United States and four European nations to formulate the self-rule
plan for Kosovo that Milosevic rejected.
</P>
<P>
   According to administration officials, Gore spoke twice to
Primakov _ when his plane was on the ground at Shannon, Ireland,
and then over the Atlantic. One official said Gore was firm about
the possibility of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of airstrikes appeared temporarily to blunt
congressional criticism of the administration's overall policy in
the Balkans, as well as opposition to the use of US forces in the
region. In his meeting with congressional leaders, Clinton told
them airstrikes would proceed with or without their support.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than consider a measure to block funding for American
military action, as scheduled, the Senate on Tuesday night voted
58-to-41 to approve a resolution supporting US troops, despite some
members' concerns that the mission was ill-defined and lacked an
exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a different issue when action becomes imminent,''
said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, after the
White House meeting. ``While many people may disagree with the
president's policies, I would not want Mr. Milosevic to get the
impression'' that US forces were not fully supported.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Senator John F. Kerry said, ``I think the way
we got here is less than ideal, but I believe that we need to
follow through on the effort to reduce Milosevic's military
capacity as the lesser of bad choices, and I hope that it can lead
to adherence to a legitimate peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said he strongly supported Clinton's
efforts in the Balkans and felt the president ``has clearly gone
many extra miles for peace. Unfortunately, it now appears that the
only language the leaders of Serbia understand is force.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the Senate floor, Senator John McCain, an Arizona
Republican, said now was the time to support the commander in
chief, but he pointed out there are widespread concerns on Capitol
Hill about what could be ``our most challenging and perilous
military action since President Clinton took office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress and the American people have good reason to fear that
we are heading toward another permanent garrison of Americans in a
Balkan country where our mission is confused and our exit strategy
a complete mystery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton said his natural tendency was to ``do
everything I can to avoid'' war, but Holbrooke ``got nowhere'' in
his two days of talks with Milosevic and ``NATO is now united and
prepared to carry out its warning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic is not willing to make peace, we are
willing to limit his ability to make war on the Kosovars,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Americans to note that the latest Balkan conflict has
no natural boundaries. He also urged people to ``say a prayer for
the young men and women in uniform, who are going to be there to do
what I, as their commander in chief, order them to do.''

bc-LADN-S24MUNSON
regretted forsaking more than half a million dollars to attend USC.
It was shortly after Eric's freshman year, and he had returned home
to San Diego for the summer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He said he was looking forward to going back to school,''
Steve said. ``I asked him if he wanted to go back to play baseball?
He said, no, what he really missed was his friends and going to
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Munson figures to become a millionaire in less than three
months. The USC catcher is projected by some scouting services as
the No. 1 pick in the amateur draft but for sure a top-five pick.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of falling into any of the trappings associated with
being perhaps the most-hyped college baseball player in the nation,
Munson has made a point of making himself just another college
student in his three years as a Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   Munson lives with three teammates at USC, none of whom are
starters, when he could easily have his own apartment. When he
rides his bike around campus, wearing his floppy hat, he's as
anonymous as anyone else. And he never yells at his teammates,
although he could certainly get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way I am. No matter what happens,'' Munson
said. ``You can never get too excited. You can never get high or
low.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's one reason Munson refused to become too giddy when
the Atlanta Braves offered $585,000 to sign him straight out of
Mount Carmel High in San Diego. Instead, Munson went to USC, a move
that seems a master stroke based on what teams will have to pay him
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a major-league catcher waiting to happen,'' USC coach
Mike Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   But Munson insists he never got caught up in the financial
possibilities while making his decision to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned it down. Money's never been a problem,'' Munson said.
``College is a tough act to follow. Growing up from the age of 18
to 21, maturing and growing up. It's made me a better person. I
would have missed out on so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is `Are you glad you went to
college?' I am.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue that point because college has been an almost
ideal experience for Munson. He was The Sporting News' Freshman of
the Year in 1997 after hitting .336 with 13 home runs and 56 RBI.
Last season, he led USC to the College World Series title in Omaha,
hitting .392 with 16 home runs and 56 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Omaha and winning a national championship, you can't
put a price tag on that,'' Munson said.
</P>
<P>
   This year he was named Collegiate Baseball's preseason National
Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good a hitter as there is,'' said Loyola Marymount
coach Frank Sanchez, a former USC assistant. ``He's left-handed,
hits with power and can hit to all fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Munson has shied away from focusing much on his
accolades, preferring to talk about the Trojans instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to pay attention to that stuff,'' Munson
said. ``It doesn't get you any wins. I've never put any pressure on
myself or the team.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not even worried about having a big junior season to ensure
his draft status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have seen me play for four years now, since my
junior year of high school. They know what I can do,'' Munson said.
``I don't have to go out and hit five home runs every game. It's
based on projectability.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't all been perfect for Munson. Last year he suffered a
stress fracture in his foot that caused him to miss 16 games. He
returned to the lineup just before the playoffs but did not receive
medical clearance to do anything other than hit. By the time USC
reached the College World Series, Munson decided to make an
executive decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My foot wasn't completely healed,'' Munson said. ``I went
against doctors orders and caught.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up hitting .476 in the World Series and catching every
game. The decision to play full-time was a no-brainer in Munson's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unbelievable feat,'' Munson said. ``We lost our
first game to LSU, the defending champions, and then we won five
straight games, including beating LSU twice.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Series was extra special for Munson because he had
about 30 friends and relatives at each game. His uncle, Bob Munson,
was an All-American pitcher at the University of Nebraska, and his
father played on the Cornhuskers' basketball team for one season.
</P>
<P>
   Munson's parents have attended every home and away USC baseball
game the past three seasons, except for a trip to Hawaii during
Eric's freshman year. This weekend, the Trojans probably won't have
many fans on their road trip to Washington State, but Steve will be
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm afraid to add it up,'' Steve said of the money
spent following his son. ``It's just something my wife and I have
enjoyed doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of Munson's final season also didn't go quite as
planned after USC got off to a rocky start, losing 11 of its first
15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough. We were in every ballgame we played. We lost a
lot of one-run games,'' Munson said. ``We're kind of young. We had
some people playing out of position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have regrouped, however, evening their record at
14-14, and are 5-1 in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a whole new season,'' Munson said.

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ On a hot morning in late November, the
dry season in Ethiopia, women lined up outside the Federal High
Court building carrying umbrellas or wearing cotton scarves over
their head to block the sun. Men stood on the opposite side of a
small dirt road by a row of trees. Under the watchful eye of
soldiers carrying Kalashnikov rifles, they submitted to frisking,
then filed up several steps into the one-story courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to witness what are known here as the Red Terror
Trials, an attempt by the government to prosecute those accused of
the killings and atrocities that occurred during the 17-year
struggle for political power following the Ethiopian revolution in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women were friends or relatives of either the
victims or the people charged with killing them, and they sat
placidly on one side of a wooden barrier as two groups of
prisoners, totaling about 200, were brought before the court. The
room was spare, with a few formal trappings _ a purple cloth
backdrop, three dark wood judges' chairs and Ethiopian flags with
bright silver spear points.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners stood as a prosecutor read the charges. Most of
the prisoners were obscure, some sickly or destitute. But one man,
wiry and dignified-looking in a blue suit, white shirt and striped
tie, drew whispers _ ``that's him'' _ as he stood with his head up,
looking straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Degaga ``Mamo'' Wolde, and more than 30 years ago,
in October 1968, he stood on a victory stand in Mexico City,
smiling and waving. With a victory in the marathon, he had become
the second Ethiopian, after Abebe Bikila, to win an Olympic gold
medal. Wolde became a national hero and a vital link in the rich
tradition of distance running that has distinguished Ethiopian
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was on trial on charges of genocide and illegal detention
of prisoners during the reign of terror that followed the overthrow
of Emperor Haile Selaisse in 1974. Wolde is accused of shooting and
killing a young boy as a member of an urban precinct group known as
a kebele; he denies doing it, and his lawyer's defense in court is
that the government can produce no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The trial that day in November was put off until December. It
was later rescheduled for March 29. Wolde, now either 67 or 68
years old, remains in the prison he entered in 1993, protesting his
innocence and waiting for a deliverance he believes will come.
</P>
<P>
   Wolde's guilt or innocence may be unknowable, but truth and
guilt remain murky concepts in post-revolutionary Ethiopia. And as
the government sifts through the horrors of the past two decades
and tries to form a path to the future, Mamo Wolde has discovered
that there is no shield strong enough to prevent prosecution, not
even Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   On a dusty street outside the courthouse, Atnafu Bogale, Wolde's
lawyer, stood by his old, white Volkswagen. Bogale was hired by the
International Olympic Committee in 1996 to represent Wolde, and
indeed the former runner has some high-powered people watching his
case, including the IOC's humanitarian division and Amnesty
International. So far, they have failed to secure any special
treatment from the Ethiopian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamo and the others are charged with killing 12 to 14 young
people sometime between March 1978 and March 1979,'' Bogale said.
``He is also charged with illegally detaining, or imprisoning, 12
to 13 teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogale said there was no mention in the prosecution's case of
place, weapons or a specific date, all of which the law required.
He said he objected to this, and to the form and content of the
charges, in July 1996, three years after Wolde was imprisoned, when
his case came to court and he pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a year for the special prosecutor to respond,'' Bogale
said. ``The court did not accept our objections.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, following a famine in the north and unrest in the
Eritrea region of Ethiopia, more than 100 young military officers,
known as the Dergue (pronounced DERG), deposed the 700-year-old
Christian monarchy headed by Emperor Selaisse and instituted a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   By 1975, Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam had assumed power, and
for parts of the next 16 years the Dergue waged a conflict both to
preserve its own power and to defeat its primary political
opponent, the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Party, or EPRP.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International, tens of thousands were
killed during the civil war. Some say the figure could be as high
as 300,000. The years 1977 and 1978 were particularly brutal, and
designated by the term Red Terror.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dark time, many of those who lived through it said in
interviews. Civil war ravaged the country, and those living in
Addis Ababa often awoke to blood in the streets. Food was scarce
and schools were closed. Neighbors fought and spied on each other.
It is taken almost as fact here that there was not a family in the
capital that did not lose at least one member.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, Bogale contended, there was no nobility of
purpose. The line blurred, he said, between deliberate killing and
the horrors that arise out of an armed struggle for power.
</P>
<P>
   Girma Wakjira, chief special prosecutor for the government, said
there was no such gray area. ``Mamo Wolde executed one of these
people, which we will make clear in open court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wakjira's office, which he said was independent, was established
in 1992 to prosecute crimes committed by the Dergue. He said that
Wolde was vice chairman of his kebele and head of its revolutionary
guard. ``He led an armed unit that picked up counterrevolutionaries
when ordered to by the government, and executed them,'' Wakjira
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One night, Wakjira said, Wolde and his men took 12 young
students and teachers, members of the EPRP, from their prison
cells, divided them into small groups and shot them to death by
firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in his office in the Supreme Court Building, with
stacks of paper and video cassettes on his desk, Wakjira, 49, was
resolute in his conviction that the government's mission was a
noble one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my neck that Mamo Wolde's case is based upon nothing
but the facts,'' he said. ``For the first time in our history we
are holding our leaders accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a small contemporary office across town, Selome Taddesse, the
official government spokeswoman, drew on an American cigarette as
she voiced support for Wakjira's prosecution. Yes, she
acknowledged, Wolde had brought great pride to Ethiopia; but the
Red Terror left young people lying dead in the streets every
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dergue targeted the youth,'' she said. ``They came for me
at 5 a.m., when I was 13.'' She was eventually freed and later went
to the United States and attended Mount Holyoke College.
</P>
<P>
   Taddesse said the trials the Ethiopian government was holding
were the only ones of their kind in Africa. ``The IOC has hired a
lawyer for Wolde,'' she said. ``What about the mothers who lost
three or four children. Where is their lawyer? It has to do with
being rich and poor.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the civil war, many factions in Ethiopia were vying for
political power and independence, a situation that continues to
this day. But by 1991, the Dergue had been defeated, and emerging
out of the war was a coalition government headed by the Ethiopian
Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, Wolde, like thousands of others, was
imprisoned by the government. According the Wakjira, there are
currently about 5,400 charged with crimes that include torture and
murder; about 3,200 of them are in prison, and the rest are either
dead or in hiding. Those on trial have been denied bail because of
fears that they would flee.
</P>
<P>
   The government is in the early stages of trying these cases, and
there have been no convictions yet.
</P>
<P>
   Aberash Wolde Semiate, Wolde's 27-year-old wife, sat in the
living room of their small house in Addis Ababa. Like most
dwellings in Ethiopia, it is made of baked mud and straw, built
with money given to Wolde by Selaisse after winning his gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Against one wall was a low cabinet with a few trophies and a
small television. She and Wolde have two children, a boy, 6, and a
girl, 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers came and got him in September of 1992,'' she said.
``He was released three months later and given a paper saying that
he was free of Red Terror charges. Then they took the paper back,
saying he was free only because he had bronchitis and a liver
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolde was imprisoned a second time, released and then imprisoned
again in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The incident in question remains a tangle of conflicting
accounts. But everyone agrees that Wolde was an active member of
Kebele 11, a large concrete block compound on a dirt road a few
hundred yards from Wolde's house. The kebeles were set up by the
Dergue to serve as community centers, to help organize the
disparate sections of the city and to take responsibility for tax
collection and other administration.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was required to belong to one or face arrest. There are
currently about 328 kebeles in Addis Ababa, a sprawling city of 3.5
million at 8,000 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wolde denies being a member of the Revolutionary Guard,
the prosecution says he was. As a member of the military, Wolde
acknowledged in an interview, he was authorized to carry a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Semaite, who married Wolde in 1988 after his first wife died,
said her husband was very secretive; it was not until much later
that she questioned him about that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamo told me that one night during the Dergue he was called to
the kebele,'' she said. ``A boy was there tied on the ground. Mamo
asked why the boy was there. He was told to be quiet or that he
would be taken away as a counterrevolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the kebele were there. One was asked to shoot
the young man. He did. After that, the chairman of the kebele told
Mamo to shoot him to be sure that he was dead. Mamo and the
chairman argued. Mamo shot, but did not shoot the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The body was found the next day 200 yards away, at a busy
intersection, in front of the walled compound of Miruts Yifter,
Wolde's successor as a national running hero. Yifter, who won the
1980 Olympic gold medals in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters, now lives
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Legusse Zelle, who was a guard at Kebele 11, said that he later
talked to Wolde about the incident. ``He told me that he
sympathized with the boy and that with tears in his eyes he shot
the ground,'' Zelle said. He pointed to a large walled dirt-brown
compound across the road, where the boy had lived. The family has
moved away.
</P>
<P>
   The Addis Ababa Central Prison, holding about 2,000 prisoners,
is at the end of a cracked, paved road, in the heart of the city,
with concrete guard towers and corrugated metal roofs. Male and
female guards, in drab olive sweaters and jackets representing
their military status, sit in the shade holding rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Down a dirt path and through another steel door is a section of
the prison called Alem Bekagne or ``No More the World'' _ meaning
they would not see the outside world again _ where Wolde and 400
other prisoners are kept.

ARCO TO ANNOUNCE CLEANER-BURNING DIESEL FUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a development that could further scrub deadly
pollutants from Southern California's air, Atlantic Richfield Co.
is expected to announce it has created a cleaner-burning diesel
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary testing found that the new fuel, which Arco calls EC
(or emission control) diesel, reduces soot by 15 percent and
nitrogen oxide emissions by 5 percent without compromising fuel
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It was developed at ARCO's Engineering &AMP; Technology Center in
Anaheim during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Arco will recruit a fleet of trucks and buses to conduct an
extensive road test of the fuel, which will be produced in small
batches at the company's Carson refinery this spring. The test
should start sometime in the summer, said Roger Truitt, president
of Arco products, the company's marketing and refining unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope people will want to get in on this test. We are
confident that our demonstration program will show an immediate and
significant reduction in particulates and (nitrogen oxide)
emissions from diesel engines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fine particle pollution, the foul-smelling black clouds belched
from diesel powered trucks, buses and automobiles as well as
industrial sources, are a bigger health hazard than ozone, the main
component of smog. Last year, after a decade-long debate, a panel
of state scientists agreed that diesel exhaust poses a serious
cancer danger and urged state environmental regulators to initiate
steps to protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Campbell, a policy associate with the West Los
Angeles-based Coalition for Clean Air, said that the toxic quality
of diesel fuel is a concern. And he wants government agencies
involved in any test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course any improvement in fuel reformulation is a step
forward. We should really be concerned and start thinking about
moving away from petroleum-based fuels and more toward cleaner if
not zero-emission fuels like electricity and natural gas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Air Resources Board expects 738,900
diesel-powered vehicles on the road in California by the year 2000.
That's only 2 percent of all vehicles, but those diesel engines
will produce about 30 percent of the nitrogen oxides and 65 percent
of particulates fouling California's air, said board spokesman
Allan Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very interested in what Arco comes up with. Anything you
can do to reduce diesel emissions has a significant beneficial
effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the state agency and the South Coast Air Quality Management
District are expected to participate in Arco's test. In the late
1980s, Arco developed reformulated gasolines that are in widespread
use today and have led to some improvements in the air quality of
the state's biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
   EC Diesel will have a higher cetane rating, which is similar to
the octane rating of gasoline, and contain less sulfur and
aromatics than the diesel used today. Arco officials hope to start
production once the demonstration program is completed but that
decision will rest with the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   Truitt said that the fuel costs about 15 cents a gallon more to
make than regular diesel fuel, but production expenses would
probably drop when it is made in larger quantities. But the company
would also have to make an undetermined investment in its refinery
to make the fuel, something that could be a costly proposition. For
example, Arco spent about $500 million in upgrades to make the
reformulated gasoline in use today.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the amount of sulphur in diesel could make it possible
to fit buses, trucks and cars with new catalytic converters and
achieve an even bigger reduction in emissions, Arco officials said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Arco is working with Ford Motor Co. and catalytic
converter manufacturers to design new engines and converters that
will produce even lower emissions with the new fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important milestone, and Ford ... is glad to be
part of this program,'' said Neil Ressler, chief technical officer
and vice president of research and vehicle technology at Ford.

 ADDIS ABABA: are kept.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wolde arrived for an interview in a small room with yellow
plaster walls and a single light bulb. He was wearing a T-shirt and
a red-green-and-white warm-up suit. A prison administrator and two
guards holding rifles stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I am accused of torturing and killing
people and that I am innocent,'' he said. ``I am a victim of
hatred, but I don't know who is behind it.'' He was small and thin,
his forehead deeply lined and his eyes watery. He has bronchitis,
and throughout a 90-minute interview exhibited a deep cough.
</P>
<P>
   Wolde said he was elected by the kebele to serve the people and
denied being a member of the revolutionary guard. He said he did
not know anything about the boy and denied being there on the night
he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the guards around him, he appeared nervous and chose
his words carefully. ``There was a war going on between the Dergue
and the EPRP at that time,'' he said. ``I was not on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know really why I'm here,'' he added. ``There is
nothing I know about that incident.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, guards came and went, stopping to listen
if they heard him talking about his athletic career, smiling as he
told old tales. Wolde said he joined the army when he was 18 or 19.
Like most Ethiopians, he is not sure of his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a soldier,'' he said. ``I became a runner and was half
runner-half military, later full military. My job was to guard his
majesty and his palaces and to travel with him.'' He said that in
1978 and 1979 his job was to be an assistant coach of the national
track team and to attend sports events. Nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Wolde was born in the small village of Dirre Jille, 40 miles
south of Addis Ababa. His father, a peasant farmer, died when Wolde
was a boy, and so did his mother. He lived with his godfather and
went to school until the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually joined the army and participated in sports matches
among the government ministries. He wanted to be like his hero,
Bikila, the winner of the Olympic marathon in 1960 and 1964, who
was also a member of Selaisse's palace guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abebe Bikila made me want to run,'' Wolde said. ``He was my
guiding light.'' Together, they would train at an air force base
near the town of Debre Zeit.
</P>
<P>
   Wolde's first Olympics were the 1956 Games in Melbourne,
Australia, where he ran the 1,500 and 800 meters and did not medal.
``We flew there in DC-3's,'' he said, shaking his head and
laughing. ``It took eight days to get there. We were practically
dead when we arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   He ran the 10,000 meters and the marathon in the 1964 Olympics
in Tokyo without winning a medal. By the mid-1960s, however,
African distance runners were distinguishing themselves on the
world's athletic stage, among them Bikila; Kenya's Kip Keino and
Wilson Kiprugut, and Tunisia's Mohamed Gammoudi.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase came in the high-altitude setting of Mexico City,
providing an advantage to East Africans who had grown up running on
their hilly native terrain. Wolde won the marathon and finished
second in the 10,000 meters. Keino won the 1,500, beating the
favored American, Jim Ryun. African runners swept the 5,000- and
10,000-meter races and finished 1-2 in the steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Wolde won the bronze medal in the marathon at
the Olympics in Munich, a race Frank Shorter won.
</P>
<P>
   To be an Olympic champion in Ethiopia is to have songs written
about you and parades given in your honor, as Wolde and other
athletes have had. After Mexico City, Wolde became a national hero,
like Bikila before him and Yifter afterward, and today Haile
Gebreselaisse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our names will ever die,'' Wolde said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolde shares a cell in Addis Ababa Central Prison with six
others. He is allowed to see his wife and children only on
weekends, when prisoners stand in small groups on one side of a
fence and families on the other, three feet apart. His wife brings
him extra food four other days, but cannot see him then. ``Every
week my family comes and I can shake my children's hands,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the prosecutor will present witnesses
against Wolde when the trial resumes. The death penalty exists in
Ethiopia and can be applied in Wolde's case, but that is unlikely.
``I swear in the name of Jesus that I did not commit these
crimes,'' Wolde said. ``It is better to kill me than accuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogale was asked about Wolde's contention that he was not even
present when the killing took place. He shrugged. There were prison
guards all around him, Bogale pointed out. ``What do you expect him
to say?''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Wolde was present. Even his wife said Wolde
was called to the kebele that night. What Mamo Wolde did that night
is a question in the hands of a judicial system trying to pluck
answers from the complexities of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bogale's first line of defense is legal: how can Wolde be
convicted if no one comes forward to say he saw it happen? The
lawyer seemed to indicate a fallback position. The circumstances
matter, he said. Politics should be taken into account. So should
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my information is concerned, Mamo was not
involved,'' Bogale said. ``Even if he is found to have committed
the crime, it was not voluntary. He might have been forced to do
it. That is the position we are taking.''

RUDDER FLAW CITED IN BOEING 737 CRASHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Colo., Va.)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ The Boeing 737 is vulnerable to extremely
rare rudder malfunctions that come and go and leave no trace, but
have caused two crashes and several other close calls, the staff of
the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. The staff
said that the airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration, and
the Boeing Co. had not learned what they should have from those
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The staff presented those conclusions and other highlights of a
1,000-page report on the crash of USAir 427 near Pittsburgh in 1994
to four members of the board at a meeting that was supposed to
establish the probable cause of that accident, and present a new
evaluation of the crash of United Flight 585 in Colorado Springs,
Colo., in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The board intends to complete work on the report, and 10
recommendations, on Wednesday. One of those, a proposal to make the
rudder mechanism of the plane more ``reliably redundant,'' could
have enormous financial implications for Boeing, which has produced
more than 3,000 737s, and for the airlines that fly them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the airplane is trying to tell us something,'' said
Dr. Bernard Loeb, the board's chief aviation safety official. ``We
believe it has been for a while,'' he added, describing a history
of ``bumps, kicks, pulsations and so forth,'' in addition to the
two crashes and a malfunction in flight that threatened the pilots'
control of an Eastwind Airlines 737 near Richmond, Va., in 1996.
But he said, ``We do not know right now what is causing these.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff argued Tuesday that a hydraulic valve in the rudder
system can jam so that a pilot tapping a pedal to move the rudder
slightly in one direction, will actually swing the rudder all the
way in the opposite direction, where it sticks. The Eastwind pilots
said that they responded by stomping hard on the pedal to try to
move the rudder the other way. Investigators, who said they
believed the crews of the crashed planes behaved the same way, said
that such an action only maintains the jam.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator on Tuesday called the flaw ``insidious.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no physical evidence, the staff members acknowledged,
and they resorted to weaving together the recorded grunts of the
crew members in the last few moments of flight, together with other
scanty evidence preserved on relatively primitive flight-data
recorders.
</P>
<P>
   All 132 passengers and crew members were killed on the USAir
crash. The United crash killed all 25 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Malcolm Brenner, a specialist with the board on how people
interact with machinery and one another, said this ``rudder
reversal'' was the only scenario that tied all the factors together
plausibly, the pilots struggling with a rudder that moved on its
own, grunting with exertion.
</P>
<P>
   Board investigators brought in specialists from as far away as
Russia to analyze the grunts of the first officer in the USAir
plane, and then integrated the timing of those sounds with the
plane's movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we recognize this is circumstantial evidence, this may
be some of the most direct evidence we have,'' said Brenner, a
medical doctor and human-factors specialist.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of Tuesday's meeting, Boeing called in reporters to
present its view that there was no evidence for mechanical
malfunction. On Tuesday the company distributed a statement
stressing numerous improvements that have been made or are being
made, without abandoning its idea that all the problems could be a
result of pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   In pointed questions, though, James Hall, the chairman of the
safety board, established that of all the parties to the
investigation, including the airline, the valve manufacturer and
others, only Boeing held this view.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members said Boeing's argument would require a pilot to
hold the rudder pedal in the wrong position for more than 10
seconds, and for the other pilot to ignore this.
</P>
<P>
   The company emphasized that the Boeing 737 had carried 5 billion
passengers on 77 million flights, and that ``somewhere in the world
there is a 737 taking off every six seconds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The four members of the board who are expected to vote on
Wednesday expressed disappointment that the FAA had responded
slowly or not at all to recommendations the board had already made.
</P>
<P>
   One recommendation was for better flight-data recorders. Hall
complained that investigators had to go to Europe to find 737s,
which are built in the United States, equipped with data recorders
that could capture the details of rudder malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   The United Airlines plane had five parameters, or categories of
data; the USAir plane had 11. Some planes built in the same era
have more than 100 parameters.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the FAA's response to recommendations that better
flight-data recorders on 737s be installed immediately, George
Black Jr., one of the board members, said, ``I fail to understand
how something so good can be so sluggishly responded to.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members blame a lack of data for the long investigation,
which has been going on for four and a half years and is the
longest in the board's history.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization authorized
airstrikes against Yugoslavia on Tuesday as President Clinton
declared that force was necessary to halt the aggression of the
Serbs against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign, using primarily American aircraft and cruise
missiles, was poised to begin over southern Serbia and targets in
Kosovo under the cover of night Wednesday, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It would come almost a year after the conflict in Kosovo began
and more than six months after NATO, backed by the Clinton
administration, first threatened the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full explanation of why the administration had
decided NATO should strike, Clinton said in a speech to a union
group here on Tuesday: ``If President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war on the
Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing concerns in the Pentagon about the possible loss of
pilots as they deal with the air defense systems of the Yugoslav
Army, Clinton said: ``I want to level with you. This is like any
other military action. There are risks in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that not acting against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would ``discredit'' NATO by showing that ``we
didn't keep our word.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he was acting after lessons learned from
the four-year war in Bosnia. ``We learned that if you don't stand
up to brutality and the killing of innocent people, you invite the
people who do it to do more of it,'' he said. ``We learned that
firmness can save lives, and stop armies.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO military plans accelerated, Milosevic's forces in
Kosovo continued to set fire to houses, sending ethnic Albanians
fleeing into the countryside. Serbian artillery targeted villages
in the central Drenica region, the traditional heartland of the
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 senators and congressmen met with Clinton at the
White House Tuesday morning, and after hearing his arguments for
intervention, rallied around him by canceling a planned Senate
debate on Kosovo. The Senate voted tonight 58 to 41 in support of a
one-sentence resolution authorizing President Clinton to launch
bombing and missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a debate for another time. We are at a critical
hour,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the near certainty of air strikes, the Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned his aircraft around over the
Atlantic Ocean as it was heading for Washington and postponed a
planned three-day visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, adamantly against NATO air strikes, had made clear that
Primakov would take it as a personal slap in the face if Serbia, a
traditional if frayed ally of Russia, was attacked during
Primakov's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization of the airstrikes by NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana occurred at NATO headquarters in Brussels Tuesday
night after Clinton's envoy, Richard Holbrooke, failed to persuade
Milosevic to agree to a ceasefire in Kosovo that would pave the way
for talks on a peace settlement already agreed to by the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has negotiated many times in the past with
Milosevic, talked with the Yugoslav leader for about six hours in
Belgrade. Lt. Gen. Edward Anderson, accompanying Holbrooke, spelled
out to Milosevic that NATO was planning a heavy air campaign that
would crush his forces in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But while Holbrooke was trying to induce Milosevic toward the
path of peace, the Serbian parliament, apparently under orders from
the authoritarian leader, railed on Tuesday against foreign forces
in Kosovo. ``This was the ultimate two-finger salute by Milosevic
to his friend Holbrooke,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of what administration officials called a
``last chance'' for Milosevic, a subdued Holbrooke flew to NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where he briefed Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Solana gave the go ahead to NATO's Supreme Commander
Gen. Wesley Clark to go ahead with an air campaign. The Secretary
General called Holbrooke a ``great diplomat'' but said that NATO
was taking over.
</P>
<P>
   The planned air attacks would come after a series of diplomatic
efforts by the Clinton administration in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after the massacre of more than 20 ethnic Albanian
civilians by Serb forces, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to agree to
a ceasefire in Kosovo, accept more than 1,000 unarmed monitors and
reduce the number of troops. But within two months Milosevic
violated the agreement by increasing the number of troops and
unleashing them in attacks against civilians and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   After another massacre in January at Rajak, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright orchestrated a diplomatic effort that
culminated in peace talks in France. But while the ethnic
Albanians, including the Kosovo Liberation Army, signed on to an
agreement that gave Kosovo autonomy rather than independence,
Milosevic treated the talks with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   When Holbrooke presented the settlement to Milosevic on Monday
and argued that it suited the Yugoslav leader because it called for
the disarming of the guerrillas, Milosevic was equally dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   As the last minute diplomatic efforts gave way to military
action, Milosevic's forces in Kosovo showed no sign in letting up
in their effort to wipe out the guerrillas of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian offensive, which intensified Saturday as
international monitors left, continued on Tuesday , humanitarian
officials still in Kosovo said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday
that 25,000 ethnic Albanians had been forced to flee their homes
since last Friday and that another 85,000 had become refugees since
the end of peace talks in Rambouillet, France, last month. In all,
there were about 460,000 ethnic Albanian refugees, the United
Nations agency said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since NATO has threatened force against
Milosevic, the State Department said it was suspending all
activities at the American embassy in Belgrade and the remaining
core staff, including the charge d'affaires, Richard Miles, were
leaving Wednesday morning. Other Western embassies, concerned about
being targets of Serb anger, said they were also closing.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO geared up for the final showdown Wednesday night,
administration and NATO officials said they saw only a remote
chance that Milosevic would back down. ``For Milosevic to change
his mind _ I'd say that's very remote,'' said a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and Pentagon planners said that the air campaign would
target Yugoslav military bases, lines of communication, fuel
supplies and ammunition dumps. The idea was to crimp the ability of
the Serbian police units and Yugoslav soldiers to wage war in
Kosovo where they have been burning homes and hitting at KLA
positions.
</P>
<P>
   After a briefing by the Pentagon on Tuesday, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., said: `Unfortunately it's going to be a
devastating series of attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing how the air attack would unfold, a NATO official said
that once the air defense systems had been taken out, and supply
dumps and radar attacked, mobile missiles would be tracked down.
``If they concentrate in one place, we smash them, if they move, we
find them,'' said the official. In this way, Milosevic's ground
force would be ``left without protection,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The risks to everyone _ civilians on the ground and the pilots
in the air _ were much higher than in the desert warfare that the
Pentagon has waged against Iraq, planners said.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the sophisticated air defense systems of the Yugoslav
Army was also less inviting in another respect. ``There won't be
the impressive hits of a desert war and there may not only be
misses but also collateral damage,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   There was also some nervousness about whether air power would be
enough to persuade Milosevic to give up. ``What do we do then?''
asked a Pentagon official, repeating a concern expressed last week
at a congressional hearing by Gen. Charles Krulak, commandant of
the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said Tuesday there was mounting concern about
the need for prolonged attacks against Milosevic's forces. This
could provoke a slaughter in Kosovo by Serbs against ethnic
Albanians and in turn retaliation by ethnic Albanians against
Srbs, said a European diplomat who was about to depart Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If pictures emerge from Kosovo of a slaughter, then there will
be a lot of pressure for the intervention of ground troops,'' the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials said there were no plans for intervening with
the NATO soldiers who have been stationed in Macedonia in
preparation for entry to Kosovo as a peacekeeping force. ``Nobody
is putting together an invasion force, it has never been part of
the discussion,'' said an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   For some diplomats and officials at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, where Clark has made no secret of his judgment that an
air campaign was justified against Milosevic long ago, the mood
this evening was almost jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's accelerating and exhilarating,'' said one official.

VOTE ON BIAS MEASURE TESTS BIPARTISAN CIVILITY IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Miss., Ga., Okla., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The people watching this debate must be
scratching their heads,'' Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., said as he
took his turn on the House floor Tuesday to argue over whether
Congress should pass a resolution that condemned all bigotry and
racist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those people undoubtedly scratched over the outcome: The
resolution failed, its fate sealed by the opposition of most
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But what looked, from a distance, like an excursion into some
political ``Twilight Zone'' was an exquisite example of partisan
feuding, political maneuvering and the short shelf life of
Hershey's Kisses. On the House floor Tuesday, the fuzzy bromides
articulated by members of Congress at a bipartisan civility retreat
in Hershey, Pa., over the weekend had already begun to look stale.
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary to rewind for a bit. Last month, Rep. Robert
Wexler, D-Fla., introduced a bill that called on Congress to
condemn a white supremacist group. The rub was the specific group
he selected: the Council of Conservative Citizens, before which
both Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, and Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., had given speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, suspicious that Wexler and other Democrats were
simply trying to embarrass them, decided on a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., who also happens to be the only black
Republican in the House, introduced his own anti-bigotry bill,
calling on Congress to condemn any and all racist groups but not
mentioning the council by name. Republicans scheduled his
resolution for debate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting the measure to his colleagues Tuesday afternoon,
Watts made special note that it did not ``single out for
condemnation any one organization or individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be so particular,'' Watts said, ``would be to commit a
crime of omission by giving a pass to other groups that espouse
prejudice, in effect saying that their bigotry is not so offensive
as to be worthy of our condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both during the 40-minute debate on the floor and afterward,
Democrats and a few Republicans said that a resolution so broad was
a statement of the obvious: Of course Congress condemned racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This resolution is a ruse,'' said Rep. John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., who is the senior black House member, adding that it was
``characteristic of Republicans who want to get civil rights on the
cheap and show the country they're really not Neanderthals.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had reasoned that Democrats would be forced in the
end to vote for Watts' resolution, which was so uncontroversial on
its face. But enough Democrats voted against it that it did not
muster the two-thirds majority it needed.
</P>
<P>
   In the final tally, 254 members _ 218 Republicans and 36
Democrats _ voted for the resolution, while 152 members, mostly
Democrats, voted against it and 24 voted present. Four members did
not show up.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans proclaimed that Democrats looked petty. ``It's an
unfortunate political act,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., of
their votes. ``I truly find it inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that Republicans were trying to make Democrats
look bad, and would fail miserably. ``Most Democrats have such an
excellent record on civil rights that they do not need to worry
about being labeled anything but proponents,'' Wexler said.

BUSH UNDER ATTACK FOR STANCE ON GAY, HATE CRIMES ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's stance on sensitive
social issues has touched national nerves as gay leaders and their
allies Tuesday criticized the probable presidential candidate's
opposition to including homosexuals in a state hate crime law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently being a compassionate conservative does not include
protecting the victims of hate crime or their families,'' said
Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a
national gay rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Birch was joined in her criticism by the nephew of James Byrd
Jr., the black man from Jasper, Texas, who was violently dragged to
his death, and the mother of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man who
was tortured and left to die on a fence post in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   John William ``Bill'' King was convicted of capital murder in
the Byrd case and was sentenced to death. Two other defendants are
awaiting trial. The Shepard trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders not only were angered by Bush's stand on hate crimes
but also by his statement this week that he opposes gay adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Their harsh criticism underscores the difficulty facing Bush as
he tries to step through the quagmire of tricky social issues in
his preparation for a White House bid. He cannot win Republican
primaries without support from faith-based conservatives, but to
compete in a general election, he must win the support of moderates
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has recently been under attack from advocates on
both sides of the abortion issue for saying he did not believe the
nation was ready to overturn the Supreme Court decision legalizing
the procedure. Bush said he believed, however, that abortion was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign is pressing Congress to approve
federal hate crimes legislation. But the participants quickly
singled out Bush for criticism because of his recent remarks
regarding a hate crimes bill pending in the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush said he opposed including sexual orientation in
a measure to clarify a 1993 state hate crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the gay issue, Bush has been ambivalent about the
measure called the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, which would also
increase criminal penalties for hate crimes, provide specialized
training for police officers and provide civil remedies for
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said all crime is hate crime,'' he said. ``People
when they commit a crime have hate in their heart. And it's hard to
distinguish between one degree of hate and another.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding another bill before Texas lawmakers that would bar
gays from adopting children in the custody of the state, Bush said,
``I'm against gay adoptions. I believe children ought to be adopted
in families with a woman and a man who are married.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lack of support for hate crime legislation came under
criticism recently by Democratic presidential candidate Bill
Bradley who vowed to make it a campaign issue if he ends up facing
Bush in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday sympathetic relatives of hate crime victims weighed
in on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, said that Bush
should reconsider his opposition to including sexual orientation in
hate crimes measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stand is indefensible,'' said Shepard, who tearfully spoke
of her son's killing last fall by two suspects who professed their
hatred of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's nephew, Daryl Verrett, said he was ``disappointed'' at
Bush's position and said that any hate crimes bill approved by the
state Legislature should include sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said that the governor has not
decided whether he would sign the hate crime legislation despite
his comments about the sexual orientation provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes in tough anti-crime laws and will
carefully consider legislation proposing to rewrite the Texas hate
crimes law,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   On the bill banning gay adoptions Edwards said, ``Texas law
already forbids gay couples from adopting children. Governor Bush
is opposed to gay adoptions. He is not taking a position on
legislation that is being rewritten by committees every day. He
will take a position on legislation when it reaches his desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said they were not surprised at Bush's stands on gay
issues given his political ambitions and the need for a Republican
presidential candidate to placate the religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not being a statesman. He is being a candidate,'' said
Texas state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, the sponsor of the
hate crimes measure.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson predicted Bush would not veto the hate crimes measure,
with the sexual orientation provision, if it lands on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has the guts to veto it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hardy Garcia of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby of Texas said
that Bush's recent remarks on gay issues belie the moderate image
he has cultivated so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks that because he doesn't call names and hasn't
been ranting and raving that he is a moderate,'' she said. But
Garcia said Bush's stand on gay issues amounts to ``a kinder and
gentler form of bigotry.''

IT'S SPRING, AND NEW SCIENCE CENTERS ARE ABLOOM ON CAMPUSES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass., N.J., N.Y., Ohio)  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last great science building boom on American campuses came
in the late 1950s and early '60s, when the nation was desperate to
catch up with the Soviet Union in the race into space. (Remember
Sputnik?)
</P>
<P>
   Today, new science centers are once again sprouting like
high-tech crocuses at colleges and universities from Barnard to
Caltech.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne L. Narum, an education consultant in Washington who is an
expert on undergraduate science teaching, estimates that $2 billion
to $3 billion is being spent this year on new construction,
renovation or planning for science centers at 1,000 campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University plans to pump as much as $200 million over
the next five years into new science programs, including the
construction of a center for the study of genetics. Haverford,
Hofstra, Holy Cross, Kenyon, Macalester, Middlebury, Princeton,
Ursinus, Williams and Wooster are among the institutions large and
small that have made commitments to multimillion-dollar science
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable is the $6 million Center for
Environmental Studies scheduled to open next fall at Oberlin
College in Ohio: it will function like a tree. Constructed of
special low-maintenance materials, the building makes use of
high-tech equipment to absorb, store and conserve energy.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the building boom are many, but the most
straightforward is that old science buildings were becoming
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that if you're going to strengthen the learning
environment, you can't put new projects into old wine skins,'' Ms.
Narum said. ``Many of the post-Sputnik buildings were, to put it
mildly, inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some buildings were crumbling or unsafe, she said, and many
lacked enough space for computers. But beyond their physical
limitations, the old buildings are proving unfit for the way
science is taught today.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and administrators say science teaching has undergone
a revolution in the four decades since Sputnik. The line between
disciplines has blurred: much research involves not simply physics,
chemistry or biology, but collaboration among the three. Even
undergraduates are expected to do their own research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undergraduate students are now conducting experiments and
doing things close to the cutting edge that in the past could be
done only by practicing scientists _ like measuring levels of
pesticides found on the fruit that they buy in the local grocery
store,'' said Jim Swartz, dean of the college at Grinnell College
in Iowa, which recently opened a $15.5 million renovated science
center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Narum says the old buildings get in the way of such
teaching. ``The whole design concept was outmoded,'' she said.
``Chairs were screwed to the floor so that collaboration and
teamwork the way scientists do science was impossible, and you
couldn't solve that problem by putting wheels on the chairs because
the floors were tightly tiered. It became clear that to make a
genuine difference in the way science was being learned, there
would have to be some major capital expenditures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carla Ramas, 20, a senior who is majoring in biopsychology at
Barnard College in Manhattan, which has just opened an $8.8 million
science building, says the new emphasis on science at Barnard is
exciting because it draws attention to the frontiers of science.
``My sense is that with progress in cloning, genome mapping and
everything else,'' she said, ``we're at the breakthrough point of
something important.''
</P>
<P>
   The money for these projects is raised in a variety of ways.
State legislators in Connecticut have appropriated large sums for
science centers. The University of Connecticut's newly opened $56
million chemistry building contains 88 research laboratories
customized for specialties like biochemistry and organic chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Private institutions look to foundations, alumni and wealthy
individuals. The University of Redlands near Palm Springs, Calif.,
for example, has just completed an $18.5 million drive to finance
the first two of four buildings in a new science complex that will
begin to open in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, like Hofstra University on Long Island, have gone
deeply into debt to finance new science centers. The $8.2 million
cost of Hofstra's science building, due to open in the late spring,
was part of a $55 million bond issued last July, bringing the
university's total debt to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the high cost of these new structures, some critics
ask how much actual science will be taught in them, as opposed to
gaudy multimedia displays intended to impress alumni, donors and
prospective students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If flashy presentations in these centers allow the dumbing
down of scientific content, then students may not receive the
benefits promised,'' said Robert Pollack, a professor of biological
sciences at Columbia University and former dean of Columbia
College.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Narum, the science teaching consultant, expects the boom
to continue. In 1989, she founded Project Kaleidoscope, a network
of colleges and universities interested in improving undergraduate
science teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The group uses foundation money to organize meetings and
workshops for colleges and universities eager to pick up tips on
how to develop improved spaces for science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I bump into at these workshops and conferences,''
Ms. Narum said, ``are taking very seriously the work of shaping the
future.''

MCDOUGAL TESTIFIES, BUT ADDS LITTLE, IN CONTEMPT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf changing `charged,' to `accused') (wg) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Susan McDougal, whose steadfast refusal to
answer prosecutors' questions about President Clinton put her in
jail for 18 months, crisply and directly answered those very same
questions on Tuesday in a federal court, testifying that she had no
knowledge of any wrongdoing by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal took the witness stand in her own defense at a
trial in which prosecutors for Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, have accused her of criminal contempt and obstruction of
justice. The prosecutors contend that Mrs. McDougal's stubborn
refusal to answer questions before a grand jury on two occasions
was calculated to obstruct their investigation into the complicated
financial dealings of Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
in Arkansas in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But her answers on Tuesday did little to illuminate one of the
most puzzling aspects of the Whitewater investigation, why she
would endure a lengthy prison term if she had nothing to conceal.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from her own lawyer, Mark Geragos, Mrs.
McDougal answered three of the principal questions that prosecutors
had tried to put to her in September 1996 and April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever discuss with Clinton a loan of $300,000 made to her
in 1986 by an Arkansas businessman who testified he lent the money
at the urging of Clinton? Geragos asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discussed the loan with William Jefferson Clinton,''
she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever discuss a real estate development called Lorance
Heights with Clinton? Perhaps in a social setting, she said, but
``I certainly never discussed it in any substantive matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, did President Clinton testify truthfully at her
1996 trial in which she was convicted of fraud? ``As I sat there
that day, I did not hear anything untruthful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when Geragos completes his direct examination of
Mrs. McDougal, he is expected to ask her the fourth question she
would not answer for prosecutors: what is the meaning of her
handwritten note, ``Payoff Clinton,'' on a 1983 check for
$5,081.82.
</P>
<P>
   So why then did Mrs. McDougal refuse to answer prosecutors'
questions if she had so little information to impart?
</P>
<P>
   Because Starr, she said on Tuesday and has said in the past, was
more interested in getting the Clintons than in getting to the
truth. Indeed, much of her defense has been devoted to trying to
put Starr and his tactics on trial. The transcripts of her grand
jury appearances show that Mrs. McDougal adopted a defiant tone,
telling the grand jurors that they were being lied to by the
prosecutors who only wanted to get information harmful to the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday by Geragos why she chose the road of silence, she
replied, ``It was not an easy decision.'' She then began a long and
rambling account of her life in Arkansas starting with when she met
James McDougal, an Arkansas political fixture and sometime friend
of Bill Clinton who eventually became her husband. The McDougals
and the Clintons were partners in the failed real estate venture
known as Whitewater, which was the initial focus of Starr's
investigation before it expanded into numerous other areas,
including the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Mrs. McDougal listed several examples of what she
contended were abuses by Starr's prosecutors that led to her
defiance. In one, she said that she had received a telephone call
from the wife of Chris Wade, who was a sales manager at Whitewater.
Mrs. McDougal said that Wade's wife told her that she believed
Starr's prosecutors had seen to it that his prison conditions were
made worse because they were unsatisfied with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors who tried unsuccessfully to question her in the
grand jury may now follow up her answers with further questions.
But it is also possible that they will simply concentrate on the
straightforward facts of their contempt case: that a federal judge
gave Mrs. McDougal immunity and ordered her to testify and she
refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman Ewing, a top aide to Starr, suggested in an interview
outside the courthouse that Mrs. McDougal's information was no
longer useful or usable. ``Unfortunately, the grand jury was not
able to hear what she said,'' he said, noting that the
Arkansas-based grand jury that had tried to question her had since
disbanded. Had she given the same answers to the grand jury, he
said, it would have been subject to rigorous scrutiny ``and this
was no substitute for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing jaunty at times but also tearful when she spoke of her
late husband, who died in a federal prison last year, Mrs. McDougal
said he had once ``loved Bill Clinton very much.'' But she said
that James McDougal became deeply disappointed and angry with
Clinton when he felt that he had abandoned him during a bank fraud
trial in 1990. After McDougal was acquitted on those charges, she
said he looked for a way to get back at Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that during the 1992 presidential campaign,
McDougal, from whom she was by then divorced, told her that he had
received a considerable sum of money from Sheffield Nelson, a
Little Rock Republican and Clinton political opponent, to talk to
Jeff Gerth, a New York Times reporter, about the Clintons and
Whitewater. She said he told her that he would ``go down in
history'' and that he would ``pay back the Clintons.'' Nelson was
turkey hunting, his wife said, and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos told reporters that Mrs. McDougal believed her husband
was paid at least $10,000 to talk with Gerth. Last April, Mrs.
McDougal told a television interviewer, Charles Grodin, that her
former husband was paid to talk to The Times, but she did not make
it clear that she had been told the payment came from a third
party. McDougal was eventually convicted on new fraud charges
brought by Starr and died in jail last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's refusal to testify earned her a civil contempt
citation and the 18 months in jail. She was released after Judge
George Howard Jr. ruled that her continued imprisonment would not
force her to testify. Starr then charged her with criminal
contempt. She was also sentenced to two years in jail on a fraud
conviction but was set free by Howard, who ruled that keeping her
in jail would aggravate a serious spinal condition. The current
trial for criminal contempt is before Howard.

THE M IN MSU ISN'T FOR MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silly me. I thought Michigan State won the Big Ten title and
advanced to its first Final Four in two decades because of a superb
point guard, an exquisite bench, toughness, togetherness and solid
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last 48 hours, I've learned the real reason for
Michigan State's success: Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what he wants us to believe.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to root for your alma mater, to attend games and
support the players. It's quite another to thrust yourself into the
spotlight, box out those who deserve it and dominate the
proceedings as if it were 1979 and your Spartans were facing Larry
Bird and Indiana State.
</P>
<P>
   In his craving for attention, Johnson has stolen the moment from
Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves, coach Tom Izzo and the gang.
Johnson now refers to himself as the Spartans' ``big brother.'' He
gave pep talks to Jason Klein and A.J. Granger before the Kentucky
game. Everywhere the Spartans go, Johnson is sure to follow. In
fact, he has watched practice and proffered advice throughout the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but I don't remember him lending a hand when Michigan
State won 16 games a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Magic has done his best to overshadow them, some great
stories are emerging from East Lansing. Izzo, the fourth-year
coach, is best friends with San Francisco 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci. Cleaves has overcome a back injury, lost weight and
ascended to the nation's point guard pantheon. And don't forget the
Flintstones _ the quartet of players from Flint, Mich., who form
the Spartans' soul _ Cleaves, shooting guard Charlie Bell, power
forward Antonio Smith and super sub Morris Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Good team, great material, a showdown with Duke looming. Too bad
it all gets lost in this Magic moment.
</P>
<P>
   __ On guard: Duke, Michigan State, Connecticut and Ohio State
have nothing in common except the most important element in
tournament survival: great guards.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's Scoonie Penn is the best point guard around. He
combined with shooting guard Michael Redd to produce 42 points, 14
rebounds and 13 assists against St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping Khalid El-Amin and Richard Hamilton is the key to
stopping Connecticut. Duke's William Avery and Trajan Langdon are,
well, William Avery and Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves isn't in Avery's class as a scorer, but he's a powerful
ballhandler and effective penetrator _ which means he has the
skills to challenge Duke's pressure defense. If he keeps the
turnovers low, the Spartans have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Asked last weekend if his Huskies could beat
any of the seven teams remaining, Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun
said: ``I'm convinced six. Seven, I don't know. Can (Duke) be
beaten? Yeah, but it's going to take an A-plus game.''. . .
</P>
<P>
   If Washington coach Bob Bender takes the Vanderbilt job as
expected, the Huskies will pursue former assistant Ritchie McKay,
currently at Colorado State. If that unravels, Gonzaga's Dan Monson
and Pepperdine's Lorenzo Romar might vault to the top of the list.
(Romar played at Washington.) Athletic director Barbara Hedges
can't go wrong either way. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Like Arizona last year, St. John's fell victim to the Maryland
factor. Both teams defeated the Terps in the Sweet 16, figured
they'd survived their toughest challenge and were poorly prepared
for the Elite Eight: Arizona lost to Utah, St. John's to Ohio
State. . . .
</P>
<P>
   NCAA executive director Cedric Dempsey says $4.5 billion is
illegally wagered on the NCAA Tournament. I lost $10 of it in the
office pool. North Carolina in the Final Four? What was I thinking?
. . .
</P>
<P>
   As the coach at Tulsa, Georgia and Kentucky, Tubby Smith has
compiled a 15-4 record in NCAA Tournament play. After the loss to
Michigan State, some Wildcats fans would have you believe he's no
better than Billy Tubbs. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Each tournament host _ for the West Regional, it was Arizona
State _ receives an operations manual from the NCAA that's two
inches thick. It includes rules for number of cheerleaders, band
members, mascots, schedules for the media, concession stand and
parameters for advertising placards. Aren't there more important
matters for the NCAA to address than press hot dogs? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Preparation is coach Jim O'Brien getting Ohio State ready for
St. John's zone defense _ the same defense that stifled Indiana.
Execution is shooting 54.7 percent against it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   What does it say about New Mexico now that Lobos coach Dave
Bliss has taken the Baylor job? . . .
</P>
<P>
   CBS' Al McGuire would be a much better analyst if he never
spoke. McGuire said Sunday that Duke's Chris Burgess might leave
for a Mormon mission next year. Well, Burgess is leaving, all
right: it's called a transfer. Don't be surprised if he surfaces at
UCLA. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering why Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has lost his
courtside exuberance, he's scheduled for hip-replacement surgery in
April.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally: Gonzaga, which returns three starters and its
best reserves, visits UCLA on Dec. 11. The Bruins better start
preparing for that motion offense this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally II: Now that a federal judge has struck down the
use of minimum SAT scores to determine initial eligibility, it's
only a matter of time until a nonathlete challenges their use in
university-wide admissions.

   The airline pocket timetable is not yet a relic, but the handy
guide is becoming harder to come by. American Airlines no longer
publishes one. American, a unit of AMR, said the information _
flight numbers, departure and arrival times, stops and connections
_ was widely available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The other big airlines do not plan to follow American's lead,
though some are making changes. United Airlines, which spends about
$2 million printing some 200,000 copies of each of its six editions
yearly, has eliminated its timetables for individual cities. ``We
had about 200 cities,'' said Joe Hopkins, the spokesman for United,
a unit of UAL, ``so by eliminating them we saved quite a bit of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   U S Airways also eliminated city timetables some time ago but
has no immediate plans to do away with the pocket timetables. Delta
Air Lines also intends to keep its pocket edition, which it
publishes quarterly in printings of about 800,000. But because it
stopped listing connecting flights last September, the pocket guide
has been greatly slimmed down. And the number of individual city
timetables, which do list connecting flights, has also been trimmed
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, when Continental Airlines was operating under
bankruptcy protection, it eliminated its printed timetable except
for its most frequent fliers, but as the airline returned to
solvency, it reinstated it for everyone. These days its timetable
is compact and condensed.
</P>
<P>
   American Express and OAG Worldwide publish monthly pocket
guides, which list the flights of most airlines and are purchased
mostly by business travelers. Both companies also deliver the data
electronically, and OAG announced Tuesday that its database of
600,000 worldwide flights was available through Palm Pilot, the
electronic hand-held personal organizer, and would soon be
available on the Palm VII.

   Guess whom Silversea Cruises has added to its roster of year-end
speakers, along with Buzz Aldrin, the former Apollo XI astronaut,
and Winston S. Churchill, the grandson of the famed British prime
minister? None other than Andrew Morton, the biographer of both
Diana, princess of Wales, and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises, meanwhile, has equipped its fleet of 10 ships
with more than 65 portable defibrillators for treating heart
attacks at sea. The portable units are in addition to the larger
defibrillators in each of the ships' medical centers.

   When All Nippon Airways begins daily service between Tokyo and
Chicago in mid-April, its 747-400s will have some unusual features.
These include a self-service bar and work stations in first and
business class, complete with desks, high-back swivel chairs with
seat belts, telephones, a fax machine and electrical outlets. First
class will also have what the Japanese airline believes will be the
first on-board rice cooker.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Now that last weekend's settlement between America West and its
flight attendants appears to have averted a strike, look for travel
bargains as the airline tries to lure back passengers. That is the
usual carrot that airlines dangle before disaffected or
inconvenienced passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, for example, which is still being hurt by a
two-week pilots' strike in September, has just announced its latest
sale. For travel through Sept. 10, adults who fly in midweek and
stay over a Saturday can each take along two children aged 2 to 17
for a reduced rate. As a result, a round-trip flight between New
York and Seattle is $434, and a child's round-trip fare is $198.
Tickets must be bought by April 7.

   Warning on Turkey

   Anyone planning to travel to Turkey should be aware that Kurdish

HOUSTON LAWMAKER URGES MORE SCRUTINY OF PRIVATE UTIMCO INVESTMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Hicks and Ricks are cq) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Houston lawmaker said Tuesday he will push for
measures to increase public scrutiny of the private investments
made by the University of Texas Investment Management Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have this entity that is operating with $1.7 billion
of public money, and we are shielded from knowing how well it is
doing; who is benefiting and what, if any, conflicts might exists
as it relates to the public's tax dollars,'' said state Rep.
Sylvester Turner, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was reacting to a Houston Chronicle story published
Sunday that reported that $457 million of the $1.7 billion UTIMCO
has invested privately had been placed in funds run by major
Republican donors or associates of UTIMCO Chairman Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported that UTIMCO declined to disclose the
names of the people who managed the investment funds. Two attorney
general opinions said that even though UTIMCO functions as a
government agency, it was exempt from releasing certain information
that would publicly disclose private investment profits or losses.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he hopes to increase UTIMCO public disclosure by
adding a requirement to the University of Texas System's funding in
the state appropriations act.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said UTIMCO, which was set up under a 1995 law, is part
of a growing pattern of government and private sector joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be more and more of a push for the public and
private sectors to engage in cooperative ventures. I think that is
good, and we want to encourage that,'' Turner said. ``But that does
not mean we sacrifice the public's right to know about matters that
directly concern the public's money.``
</P>
<P>
   UTIMCO manages almost $12 billion in Permanent University Fund
and UT endowment investments. The management company invested $1.7
billion of that money privately.
</P>
<P>
   Most of UTIMCO's investments are in securities. Private
investments are high-risk funds that promise a high rate of return
through investment schemes such as leveraged buyouts, venture
capital or the restructuring of corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know if there are making wise and prudent
investments. If they are not, we should not find that out once they
have lost the $1.7 billion, and then we're raising questions about
what happened and how did we let it get to this point,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make money, there won't be a lot of questions. But
what happens if somewhere down the road they come to us and say
they've lost a significant portion of that $1.7 billion?``
</P>
<P>
   Turner said potential conflicts of interests should be revealed
in such investments. He said disclosing the names of the persons
managing investment funds should not harm any confidential
investment strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to make sure they disclose in as much detail as
possible where a conflict may exist or may arise and do it in some
form that will alert the public and the state,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the least, with the very minimum, provide us with
sufficient information that we are not kept blind,'' Turner said.
``I don't want someone turning over $1.7 billion, $2 billion or $3
billion to someone and then at that point I'm totally out of the
loop.''
</P>
<P>
   UTIMCO President Tom Ricks said the UT Board of Regents oversees
the private investments on behalf of the public. Ricks also said
the funds are audited each year by an external auditor and that
audit is posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In it we report the performance on all asset classes,
including the private investments,'' Ricks said. ``We also provide
a supplemental report for the Permanent University Fund in which we
list the asset value of every investment in the fund, including the
private investments.``
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney general's office has said that UTIMCO that it
does not have to disclose its cash flows from the individual
investments. Cash flows and ``internal rates of return'' are used
by accountants to determine whether an investment has made or lost
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide information on the portfolio on the whole as well
as by the vintage year,'' Ricks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do think we're being put at a competitive disadvantage
if we're having to report the cash flow activity for individual
partnerships where other institutional investors, corporate pension
plans, other public plans are also invested and they are subject to
confidentiality agreements much as we are,'' Ricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks said the university wants to make as much information
public as possible. But he said private investment management funds
need a level of secrecy so their competitors will not steal their
investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area where we are attempting to balance our need to
remain competitive in the private investment market place with the
need for accountability and for information by the public,'' Ricks
said. &QL;

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Initial NATO bombings of Yugoslavia will be
broader and more punishing, focusing on 60 different targets, than
the short, sharp strike that NATO military planners had originally
envisioned, European and American officials said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO diplomats said that Supreme Allied Commander Gen.
Wesley Clark would have authority to strike any targets he chose in
the first round, instead of having to go step by step or ask for
permission to hit tank or troop concentrations carrying out attacks
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials speaking on the condition of anonymity
said air and missile strikes would target more than just those army
and police units waging war against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo
province, but would attack the Yugoslav military more generally,
striking at targets inside Serbia vital to supporting the
repression. Those include military bases, lines of communication,
fuel supplies and ammunition dumps.
</P>
<P>
   French and American officials also said the second phase of the
attack would follow the first without a break.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that like the raids on Iraq in December,
the strikes would almost certainly occur at night, taking advantage
of American technological superiority. That would leave ``pauses''
during daylight hours during which Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, could agree to accept a peace agreement. ``At any time
he could say `enough,''' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana ordered the airstrikes
Tuesday night, and officials said it would take until Wednesday to
program cruise missile to strike the 60 targets.
</P>
<P>
   Officials still hope that a bombing will persuade Milosevic to
end his repression in Kosovo, but the Pentagon has not declared it
as a goal, largely because officials concede that air power alone
might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do then?'' one Pentagon official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise-missile strike _ from ships and submarines as well as
from B-52s based in Britain _ could last a day or two, followed by
an air campaign involving American and NATO jets that could last
two to four days or more, according to officials who have been
briefed on the planning.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the plan is guided more by the targets NATO
hopes to destroy than by a strict timetable. A number of factors,
including weather and the success of Yugoslavia's defense could
affect the duration. ``I don't have a clear idea how long it will
take,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
briefed senators on the scope of the planned strikes on Tuesday,
describing a devastating barrage. ``Unfortunately it's going to be
a devastating series of attacks,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav armed forces and paramilitary police units that
NATO warplanes plan to attack are regarded as tough, well-equipped,
and far more powerful than the Bosnian Serb forces that allied
warplanes bombed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 90,000 soldiers of the Yugoslav National Army are equipped
with thousands of tanks, multiple rocket launchers, heavy artillery
pieces and surface-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Before allied warplanes would attack any of these forces, allied
officers said, NATO commanders would try first to destroy as much
as possible of Serbia's sophisticated integrated air defense
system, which gives it considerable ability to shoot down planes.
</P>
<P>
   This, probably the single most formidable component of the
Serbian defenses, consists of hundreds of Soviet-era surface-to-air
missiles and 2,000 anti-aircraft artillery batteries linked to
radar and guidance systems by a fortified command and control
network. Its main command and control site is at Kopanik in
central-southwest Serbia, according to Jane's Information Group, a
leading British publisher on defense information.
</P>
<P>
   After strikes on the air defense systems, the allies would
concentrate on striking tanks, armored personnel carriers and other
heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 allied aircraft from the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, and 10 other countries stand ready to attack from
bases in Italy and England and aircraft carriers in the Adriatic
and Mediterranean Seas. Of those about 200 are American.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Pentagon quietly ordered 15 jets based in Turkey
to patrol the northern ``no flight'' zone over Iraq to bolster the
aircraft already poised to strike Yugoslavia, officials said. Those
aircraft included a number of EA-6B electronic combat jets, which
are important to attacking and evading air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also withdrew a liaison team that had been sent to Belgrade
to coordinate the reconnaissance flights permitted over Kosovo
under last October's cease-fire. A team of Yugoslav officers who
had been sent to NATO's base in Vicenza, Italy, also were sent
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train has pretty much already left the station here,''
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and his command did not disclose in advance what targets
they planned to strike first. The main Serbian military bases in
Kosovo are just north of Pristina, with army garrisons located at
Prizren near the Albanian border and Gnijilane.
</P>
<P>
   He did say, ``We know what Serbian capabilities are, we know
what Serbian vulnerabilities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders say they believe Serbia's 16,700-member air
force, with more than 60 MIG-21 fighters and 15 MIG-29s, some armed
with air-to-air missiles, according to the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London, would be no match for the American
and European armada preparing to launch strikes against them.
</P>
<P>
   They have also warned the Serbs against trying to attack the
allied troops gathered in neighboring Macedonia. Those forces were
to be the vanguard of a 28,000-member peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo if Serbia's leaders accepted a settlement providing autonomy
for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders have considerable respect for the Serbian air
defense system, which has 1,000 Russian-designed surface-to-air
missiles of different ranges, including SA-6 missiles with
relatively advanced guidance systems. Serbian defenses also include
five other types of surface-to-air missiles of various ranges.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Yugoslav Navy lost most of its bases when Croatia
became independent, Serbian forces in the Adriatic still include
four powerful frigates with surface-to-surface and surface-to-air
missiles based at Tivat on the Adriatic coast that could pose a
threat to allied warplanes and navy ships, the London institute's
latest handbook, ``The Military Balance 1998/99,'' reports.
</P>
<P>
   All allied nations have emphasized that they have no intention
of fighting their way into Kosovo to install the peacekeeping force
envisioned in the peace agreement that Milosevic rejected.
</P>
<P>
   So the question before allied commanders is how effective air
power alone, without ground-based spotters to guide planes closer
to their targets, would be in terrain that is every bit as rugged
and mountainous as it was in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the kind of laser- and infrared-guided
``smart'' bombs and air-to-ground missiles the United States used
against Iraq, particularly in the desert operations vividly shown
on videotapes taken during the war in the Persian Gulf, would not
necessarily be as effective in the Balkans, if only because clouds
frequently cover the terrain there.
</P>
<P>
   Picking out individual tanks and artillery pieces from 10,000
feet can be like looking for a needle in a haystack, experienced
pilots say, and the 30,000 Yugoslav soldiers and paramilitary
police now operating in Kosovo could draw from an arsenal of
thousands of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And if allied planes descend to lower altitudes to try to spot
these targets more effectively, the Serbian forces have nearly
2,000 air defense guns they could bring to bear. The tank forces
alone include 239 modernized 1970s-vintage Soviet-designed T-72s
that the Yugoslavs designate as M-84s, brought into action in
Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav forces also have about 1,000 older tanks, according
to ``The Military Balance,'' and close to 1,000 long-range heavy
artillery pieces as well as hundreds of multiple rocket launchers
capable of firing heavy barrages into targets on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this weaponry is in Kosovo, by any means. The allies
threatened earlier this year to bomb military targets inside Serbia
proper if attacks did not cease. Whether the allied target lists
include such major military installations as the main Serbian
airbase at Batajnica, 10 miles west of Belgrade, or Krusevac, the
main tank base in central Serbia, commanders would not say.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has long made most of its own weaponry in Kragujevac,
also in central Serbia, according to Jane's. And if the allies
think that a spectacular demonstration of air power close to home
might be all it took to get Milosevic to change his mind, they
could strike at missile and radar sites on the hills surrounding
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance headquarters here provided no information in advance
about what would be hit, saying that could endanger the safety of
allied pilots.

SCIENTIST SUSPECTED IN SPY CASE LED KEY LOS ALAMOS PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 6th graf to fix response from China and spy suspect.) (wg) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In spring 1997, Los Alamos National Laboratory
chose a scientist who was already under investigation as a
suspected spy for China to run a sensitive new nuclear weapons
program, according to several senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, eager for the new post, asked that he
be allowed to hire a research assistant, the officials said. Once
in the new position, in charge of updating computer software for
nuclear weapons, he hired a post-doctoral researcher who was a
citizen of the People's Republic of China, intelligence and
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FBI had said a wiretap on Lee, a Taiwan-born
computer expert who is an American citizen, would allow it to keep
close tabs on him in the new position, the bureau never won
approval for the electronic monitoring, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, Lee has been fired for security breaches
at Los Alamos and senior government officials say he remains a
suspect in the FBI's ongoing investigation of allegations that
China stole nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   And the research assistant has disappeared. Even as the bureau
tries to find him to question him in connection with the Los Alamos
spy case, government officials say they are wondering whether he
played a role in a Chinese intelligence operation at the heart of
the U.S. nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is under suspicion of having stolen the data for one of
America's most avanced nuclear warheads. China has denied that it
engaged in nuclear espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the furor over the Clinton administration's
handling of evidence of Chinese atomic espionage, the decisions to
appoint Lee to the new post in 1997 and to allow him to hire a
Chinese assistant have underscored doubts about the procedures
followed by laboratory officials and the FBI in the Los Alamos
case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which opened a criminal investigation into the spy case
in June 1996, gave its approval when Los Alamos officials decided
to give Lee the new position, intelligence and law-enforcement
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that Lee's new posting was
approved in part because they believed his access to information
would be ``controlled.'' In the new job ``he only had access to
material he already had in his head,'' said one official. ``He
couldn't see the latest stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also assured lab officials and the Department of
Energy, which owns the weapons labs, that it would keep close watch
on Lee in his new job, and would seek approval for a secret wiretap
to monitor his telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But officials now say that the bureau's requests for a secret
wiretap were repeatedly turned down by Justice Department officials
who did not believe they had sufficient evidence to take to a
federal court to obtain the authorization for the wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of the research assistant was not cleared with the
bureau, however, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about the hiring of the research assistant
until after the fact,'' said a senior law enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   Once the FBI found out, bureau agents investigated the
postdoctoral assistant, officials said. The FBI did not conclude
that the student, whom officials declined to identify, had any
intelligence connection. Los Alamos officials assured the bureau
that the assistant, who had studied at the University of
Pittsburgh, would be restricted to unclassified work,
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant worked with Lee from approximately May through
September 1997, when he returned to complete his studies at the
University of Pittsburgh, officials said. They said they are not
sure whether the assistant, who was in the United States on a
student visa, is still in the United States. The FBI is still not
sure whether the postgraduate assistant is significant to their
investigation of the Los Alamos spy case, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos lab director, John Browne, told The Washington
Post this month that in April 1997, Lee's classified computer code
was taken away under the guise of the job change so he would not be
tipped off that he was under investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But other law-enforcement and intelligence officials say that
the new job did give Lee continued access to classified as well as
unclassified information. Some officials add that he retained
access to nuclear test data as well as to other classified
information relating to nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The job given Lee in the spring of 1997 was to update nuclear
weapons computer programming used to evaluate weapon performance.
He was to update the programming codes for the weapons labs'
``stockpile stewardship'' initiative. That effort was part of a
broad push by the national labs and the Energy Department to insure
that the American nuclear weapons inventory could be safely
maintained without further nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials decided to give Lee the job because he had
the most expertise in that speciality of any scientist at the lab.
Officials also say they believed that passing him over for a job
for which he was obviously the most experienced candidate would
have aroused his suspicions that he was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But in September 1997, just a few months after Lee was moved to
the new post, FBI Director Louis Freeh told senior Energy
Department officials that the bureau did not have enough evidence
to arrest Lee, law-enforcement officials said
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said there was no longer any investigative reason for the
Energy Department to keep him in a sensitive position. The Energy
Department did not move Lee out of his post, or remove his security
clearance, for another year, however, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, in late 1998, a select House committee investigating
unauthorized transfers of American military technology to China,
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., had been informed about
the spy case. The senior Democratic member on the panel, Rep. Norm
Dix of Washington, complained to Richardson about the lack of
action on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   After that congressional prodding, Lee was given a polygraph, or
lie detector test, by the Energy Department in December 1998, and
he appeared to pass. Dissatisfied with the results, the FBI
administered a second test in February, and officials said the
suspect was found to be deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of questioning by the FBI earlier this month,
Lee was fired by Richardson on March 8 for a series of security
violations, including unauthorized contacts with Chinese
scientists.

QUESTIONS TO GET ANSWERED

By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Angels manager Terry Collins will meet with his
coaching staff and general manager Bill Bavasi tonight to discuss
the final roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk about our strengths and weaknesses and the options
we have,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   No cuts will be made right away because they need the bodies to
play in the remaining Cactus League games. Among the issues that
need to be discussed:
</P>
<P>
   __ Third base. Is it Troy Glaus or Dave Hollins? Glaus has had
an impressive spring (.432, 2 homers, 17 RBI). Hollins has had
hamstring problems most of camp but is coming around and playing
well now. If Hollins wins the job, Glaus goes to Triple-A and frees
up a roster spot, probably for Chris Pritchett. If Glaus wins the
job, Hollins becomes a $2.4 million utility player if the club
can't trade him.
</P>
<P>
   __ Catcher. Charlie O'Brien and Todd Greene are in, Matt Walbeck
is hurt and Phil Nevin is on the bubble. The Angels are considering
making Fausto Tejero their third catcher and trading or releasing
Nevin.
</P>
<P>
   __ Utility infielder. With shortstop Gary DiSarcina a question
mark for opening day, the utility player becomes that much more
important. Jeff Huson, Luis Rivera and Andy Stankiewicz are vying
for the job; Huson is believed to be the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Angels have four ``starting'' outfielders,
Collins said that Orlando Palmeiro will make the team as a fifth
outfielder/pinch hitter ``unless he's traded.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff looks set: Chuck Finley, Tim Belcher, Ken
Hill, Steve Sparks and Omar Olivares are the starters; Troy
Percival, Rich DeLucia, Shigetoshi Hasegawa, Mark Petkovsek, Mike
Magnante and Mike Holtz make up the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   __ Waiting game: DiSarcina had his left forearm re-examined and
X-rayed Tuesday, but the Angels will not release the results until
today. DiSarcina broke a bone in the forearm Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   __ Greene update: Greene caught six innings Tuesday in the
Angels' 14-6 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks and got the chance to
test his surgically repaired right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Arizona's Luis Gonzalez stole second,
beating Greene's throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fine, it didn't hurt,'' Greene said. ``I didn't care if
he was out, as long as it didn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he'll wait a couple of days and then let Greene
catch seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said the plan for him for this season is to able to catch
two days, then get two days off (or as DH). Under that plan, he'll
catch three or four days per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessarily important how many times a week
I catch,'' Greene said. ``Just because I feel good doesn't mean I
can catch every day. I have to be smart about it. I don't want to
get into a situation where I'm paying for it in July.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said his goal is to be catching every day by the end of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do everything I can to be an every-day catcher,
he said, ``without killing myself doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Up-Hill battle: Starter Ken Hill was knocked around by the
Diamondbacks Tuesday, giving up six runs (all earned) and four hits
in three innings. He walked four, including three in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all over the place,'' Hill said. ``My mechanics were
off. It was just one of those days for me, it's going to happen. I
tried to make adjustments, but I wasn't out there long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jim Edmonds returned from missing four games with a tight
groin. In his first at-bat he homered to left and later had a
double. Darin Erstad returned after missing two games because of
the flu and went 2 for 4.

GRIEVING FAMILIES SEARCH FOR ANSWERS TO USAIR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ USAir Flight 427 seemed to fly again Tuesday, at
least on a video screen. Relying on computer animation and the best
data available, federal aviation investigators recreated the
ill-fated Boeing 737 and the 1994 crash that killed 132 near
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families watched silently as the simulation showed the
737's tail rudder swing violently to the left. The plane pitched,
rolled over on its back, then spun headlong towards the ground,
disappearing into the blackness of a blank screen. Elapsed time:
28.13 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When that half-minute passed nearly five years ago, it began a
lifetime without a father for 18-year-old William Menarcheck III of
Hopwood, Pa., and his sister, Whitney, 11. Robert Johnson, 32, of
New Bedford, Mass., could never again seek his mother's advice or
savor her clam chowder, oatmeal cookies and perfectly light
cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hanley, of Chesapeake, Va., became a widower at 30. His
wife, Sarah, a USAir flight attendant, was 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in your late 20s, you have dreams,'' Hanley said.
``You make plans. But I don't make plans anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   These stories of lost dreams and damaged lives provided a sharp
counterpoint to arcane testimony that marked Tuesday's National
Transportation Safety Board hearing. Convened to determine the
cause of the mysterious crash, experts made their cases in
mind-numbing technical details.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed ``erratic yaw damper behavior'' and ``rudder
deflections'' and ``power control units.'' They ``extrapolated''
and ``interpolated'' mechanical data and ``human input.'' They
spoke of ``rotor issues,'' and ``vortexes'' and ``abnormal servo
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Jamison, 51, of Roanoke, Va., spoke of the father his
grandson will never know. His daughter, Kristi Gerhardt, was six
months' pregnant when Flight 427 crashed, killing her husband and
his son-in-law, Dan Lamanca, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison said it was difficult to watch the computer simulations,
but perhaps no more difficult than the years of not knowing the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a horrible feeling to know people had to go through
that,'' he said during a break in the proceedings. ``But it's
important for people to know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps it make sense,'' said Menarcheck, who was barely a
teenager when his father, William Menacheck Jr., was killed on his
way home from a business trip. ``It makes it seem real.''
</P>
<P>
   While most family members expect to finally get the answers,
many were critical of the length of the investigation, and blamed
the powerful interests involved for the delay. They expressed
frustration, but said they were determined to see it through in the
hope of sparing others their agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four-and-a-half years is an awful long time to find out how
your husband died,'' said Joanne Shortley of Pittsburgh. Her
husband, Stephen, was 37 when the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his sister, Angelina Hall, 33, of Las Vegas, wore
laminated photos of their mother, Patricia Harris-Offley, of New
Bedford, around their necks. Their hope was not only to learn the
cause of the crash, but to see someone take responsibility for
their mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   Hall choked back tears as she spoke of Harris-Offley, one of 12
children, who raised Hall and her brother alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this happened, I've put off having children,'' she said.
``I wanted to have my mother to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley demurred when asked to describe his wife. ``I can't go
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had last seen her three days before the crash, when she left
for work at the airline. She turned 28 the day before she died, and
he had planned a birthday celebration for her return.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had confidence in the (safety)'' system,'' he said. ``She
trusted the system. But the system is a bunch of suits trying to
cover their ass.''

 DUKE'S TWO TEAMS ARE SPIRITUALLY JOINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ The way it was for Seth Creger, a senior majoring
in public policy at Duke University, was typical of the cool,
sophisticated, blase approach common to the undergraduates at this
august temple of higher learning. ``We're beating Tennessee! We're
beating Tennessee!'' he shrieked as he watched the game on
television Monday night in his campus apartment. ``I can't believe
it!''
</P>
<P>
   The Duke women's basketball team was leading highly favored and
three-time defending national champion Tennessee, a team that had
beaten Duke by 16 points earlier this season, in the second half of
the East Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started calling my friends,'' Creger recalled. ```Turn it
on! Turn it on!''' He wasn't the only Dukie who was cool as a
cucumber over the occasion. ``I heard people screaming outside.
People were fired up! I mean, it was so unexpected. I won't say
that students take the men's basketball team for granted here
because of their success but, well, watching the women play
Tennessee was like, `Wow, we can really do it!'''
</P>
<P>
   And do it they did, 69-63. So for the first time in its history,
the Duke women's basketball team will be going to the Final Four,
meeting Georgia on Friday in the semifinals in San Jose, Calif. For
the 12th time in their history, the Duke men will be in the Final
Four, playing Michigan State on Saturday in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   And for only the second time in the 18 years that the NCAA has
run both basketball tournaments will the men and women from the
same school be in the Final Four at the same time; both Georgia
teams lost in the 1983 semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Though a continent apart, Duke's teams will be joined at the hip
spiritually and, surely, intellectually. After all, some of the
players on the men's team even showed up to lend support in person
at Greensboro Coliseum, about an hour's drive west of campus. There
was Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier and Trajan Langdon cheering
in a mezzanine section as the women built an 11-point lead over
Tennessee at the half, then saw it whittled down to 45-44 with
seven and a half minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But then, truly keeping their poise, the women held on gamely,
not only beating the great Tennessee team, but also stopping its
wondrous four-time all-American, Chamique Holdsclaw, who was held
to 2 for 18 from the field and only 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked real good,'' Langdon said after the game. How do
they compare to the men's team? he was asked. ``Better,'' he said
with a little smile.
</P>
<P>
   The last may have been only a gentleman's reply, but after all
these years of the women's team being just the Ella in cinders to
the basketball princes on campus, it was a term implying nothing
less than great respect. The best the women had previously done in
the NCAA tournament was a loss in the West Regional final last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of the students, the Duke men's coach, Mike
Krzyzewski, watched the Tennessee game on television at home. ``I
wasn't screaming,'' he said Tuesday, ``but there was `Yes! Yes!' _
especially when it was clear they were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't pure joy for Coach K, who has taken the Duke men
to eight of its Final Fours. He saw a cautionary tale in the
storybook victory. ``We're looked at in a way that Tennessee was,''
he said about his team. ``We're the prohibitive favorite to win.
But you saw that with a passionate attitude, and the belief you can
do it, a team at this level can beat just about any other team.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday morning Coach K walked into the office of the
women's coach, Gail Goestenkors, to congratulate her. Coach G was
already watching game film of Georgia. (By the way, the two are
generally called by their initials because, as the Duke athletic
director, Joe Alleva, said, he doesn't hire anybody whose name you
can either spell or pronounce.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be watching game films for the next game so
soon,'' Coach K said. ``Enjoy the journey and what you've
accomplished along the way. Moments like this don't happen very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that if Coach G watches any film, it should be
of the Tennessee game, to enjoy the moment, but also to see the
truth that not everything was done right. ``I really appreciated
him coming by,'' said Coach G, ``but I can't slow down. We're so
close to our goal, to be national champions. I already had Georgia
on my mind. I feel I can't take time to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach K has been at Duke for 19 seasons; Coach G for five. Both
built programs that had been foundering. ``They are two of the most
intense and competitive people I know,'' Alleva said. ``And those
qualities help make a great coach.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also able to get the best out of their players. Both
demonstrate a saving grace _ a sense of humor _ that may be
significant in relating to people. When, for example, Coach G's
players came to the bench during a timeout after Tennessee had cut
their lead to 1 point, they found, in this critical moment, that
their coach was laughing. ``I felt them getting tight,'' she
recalled. ``And we didn't need any more stress. I don't think they
knew what I was laughing about, but I just said: `We talked about
them making a run at one point in the game. This is the run. We've
been waiting for it. Now let's go back out and stop 'em.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Coach K, making a connection with a player through a laugh
may be done away from a game, or practice. On Tuesday, while Coach
K was seated and being interviewed for a television program,
Langdon came on the court for practice. He took a shot and it
resounded in the empty gym, empty but for the coach and the
television crew on the far side of the court. ``Trajan,'' called
Coach K, ``could you just visualize it for a minute?''
</P>
<P>
   On campus Tuesday morning, Georgia Schweitzer, the Duke guard
named the most valuable player in the East Regional, had a 9:10
class, U.S. Environmental Policy 149, only hours after her team's
sensational victory. ``I was up just about all night because of the
excitement,'' she said, ``and when I walked into the classroom, all
the kids started cheering. And we were all talking about the game,
even the professor. And then one person walks in and says, `Did you
guys win last night?' Unbelievable!''

SIR MICHAEL CAINE, 71, BOOKER PRIZE CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sir Michael Caine, a corporate chief with a love of
books who was the driving force behind the Booker Prize for
Fiction, Britain's most prestigious literary award, died of cancer
on Saturday in London. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on France's Prix Goncourt, the prize was founded in 1968
when Sir Michael was an executive and board member of Booker PLC,
an international group of companies involved in food distribution
and specialized agribusiness. He served as chief executive of the
company from 1975 to 1979 and then as chairman until his retirement
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For 23 years he was chairman of the Booker Prize Management
Committee and host of the annual award dinner that is now televised
live and ranks as London's greatest and most glamorous literary
event. He drew admiration for his command of the evening because he
had to overcome both a persistent stutter in his speech and a
tendency of honorees to behave badly.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl Bainbridge once spent the entire ceremony lying on the
floor because she said she was most comfortable there. Philip
Larkin, a judge in 1977, threatened to throw himself out of a
window if a particular book he favored was not short-listed, and a
presenter once stilled the proceedings with anti-Semitic jokes.
</P>
<P>
   John Berger, the 1972 winner, used his acceptance speech at the
Cafe Royal to denounce Booker's colonial past as an owner of West
Indian sugar plantations and to threaten to give his prize money to
the Black Panthers. The next year, J.G. Farrell used the occasion
to denounce ``fat cat'' corporate officers and attack the royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   A voracious reader himself, Sir Michael was not interested in
creating best sellers and was oblivious to criticism that the
Booker sometimes went to writers who were obscure. ``If that were
all we wanted, there would be no need for judges, and the Jeffrey
Archers would win,'' he remarked. His view of British literature
before the creation of the prize was that it was ``a bit peaky and
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Booker,'' he said, ``has cheered it up, made it more
vibrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harris Caine was born in Hong Kong on June 17, 1927, the
son of Sir Sydney Caine, a high-ranking civil servant who was to
become the head of the London School of Economics. He received his
bachelor's degree from Oxford where his thesis was on slavery and
secession in the United States, and he went on to obtain a master's
degree at George Washington University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His early work for Booker in places like Guyana, Trinidad and
southern Africa in the 1950s kindled a lifelong interest in
activities intended to encourage education in developing societies
and foster greater understanding in Europe of Third World problems.
The $35,000 Booker prize was founded to encourage writing
throughout the Commonwealth as well as in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted in 1988, and among the organizations he served
as chairman were the Royal African Society, the Africa Center in
London, the African Emerging Markets Fund and the United Kingdom
Council for Overseas Students. Five years ago he organized Africa
'95, a Britain-wide celebration of African music, art, dance and
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   He divorced Janice Mercer, his first wife and the mother of his
son and daughter, in 1987 and the same year married Emma Nicholson,
a high-profile Conservative member of Parliament who crossed the
Commons floor in 1996 to join the Liberal Democratic Party. A year
later she became a member of the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a telephone interview Tuesday if there were moments
when people confused Sir Michael with the more famous Michael
Caine, Baroness Nicholson said: ``An enormous number of times. The
phone would ring in the middle of the night, and there would be
these inebriated women calling from Los Angeles saying, `I'm coming
over, I'm on the next plane, get my room ready.'''

OHIO STATE COACH IS FAMILIAR WITH NEXT ROADBLOCK: UCONN`S CALHOUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ohio State Coach Jim O'Brien, clutching the net from the South
Regional, had barely descended the ladder last Saturday night when
a question about the Buckeyes' opponent in the Final Four brought a
wistful grin to his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably feeling pretty good right now,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun, who got his
job in Storrs just a few weeks after O'Brien became the head coach
at Boston College in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, O'Brien is delighted to discuss his abysmal 3-20
record against Calhoun during his 11 seasons in the Big East, and
the fact that he has not won in his last 18 games against
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is willing to explain some of the terribly close losses,
how every time he had a good team at Boston College, Calhoun would
show up with a Ray Allen and a Donyell Marshall, how the losses and
the competitiveness took a toll on his friendship with Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   It all plays back now with a laugh because, after all, O'Brien
began this season talking about a far more ignominious record. Last
season, O'Brien's first at Ohio State, the Buckeyes were 8-22 and
last in the Big Ten at 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Buckeyes are 27-8, and their 16{-game
turnaround ties two schools for the greatest improvement in
National Collegiate Athletic Association history. But neither of
those two teams _ North Carolina A&AMP;T in 1978 and Liberty in 1992 _
made the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, O'Brien hoped only to finish with more
victories than losses and maybe make the National Invitation
Tournament. Instead, Ohio State _ riding one of the best backcourts
in the nation _ began a slow climb up the polls to No. 10, beating
four conference teams when they were in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes' remarkable NCAA run, which included upsets of
top-seeded Auburn and third-seeded St. John's in Knoxville, Tenn.,
left even the soft-spoken O'Brien so jubilant that he did an
arms-flapping, legs-flailing dance with his players at center court
after beating the Red Storm last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact we found ourselves in the tournament right away
indicates we have done very well in comparison to what had gone
on,'' O'Brien, 48, said in a conference call Tuesday. ``The general
feeling was that regardless of what happened, it's all gravy that
we're in the tournament. Then you say you want to win one in the
tournament. It's unbelievable to me that we're in the Final Four,
but what we keep talking about is not settling for this.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, a Brooklyn native who was an honorable mention
all-American at St. Francis Prep, marvels at the turn his career
has taken. After playing in the American Basketball Association
from 1971 to 1975, O'Brien sold computer forms in Boston. In 1977,
with no coaching experience, he was hired as an assistant coach at
Connecticut. He got his first head coaching job in 1982 at St.
Bonaventure and left for Boston College four years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had won the Big East tournament in 1997. But O'Brien,
who had played for Bob Cousy and Chuck Daly at Chestnut Hill,
Mass., and who had taken Boston College to an NCAA regional final
in 1994, was on his way out. The administration, citing toughened
standards, denied admission to two recruits who had met NCAA
requirements and four others backed out of their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College's future was gutted, local high school coaches
were incensed and a bitter O'Brien headed to Ohio State, which had
won a national title in 1960 but had not been in the NCAA
tournament in six seasons. A lawsuit O'Brien filed against Boston
College, in which he alleged breach of contract, was settled out of
court last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no apprehension,'' O'Brien said. ``From Day 1,
before I even made the decision to come, everybody I talked to all
talked in glowing terms about Ohio State.''
</P>
<P>
   But six months into his job, before the season had even started,
O'Brien threw three players off the team for ``failure to live up
to their obligations as student athletes.'' Two others left the
program. O'Brien had just seven scholarship players, three of whom
had never played a college game. The players were used to losing
and did little else, dropping 17 straight games. The Buckeyes' best
player, point guard Scoonie Penn, sat out the season because he had
transferred from Boston College when O'Brien left.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Brien arrived in Columbus, he was asked if he understood
the pressure the Buckeyes' rabid fans would place on him. O'Brien's
response to the expectations was simple and searing: nothing in
basketball would matter as much as the death of his wife,
Christine, after a long battle with Hodgkin's disease just one day
after Boston College finished the 1990-91 season at 1-15. O'Brien
was left to raise two teen-age daughters, Erin, now 23, and Amy,
22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris was one of the greatest people you could imagine,''
Calhoun said. ``How he handled that, going through a tumultuous
time, and raising two daughters, speaks to what kind of man he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is expected to lose his 19th straight game to Calhoun's
Huskies on Saturday night. But, of course, he has already won.

OPPONENTS SAY TOWER WILL SPOIL SCHUYLKILL RIVER SITE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Tucked away in the northwest corner of the city
is the largest piece of privately owned land in Philadelphia, more
than 600 acres high above the Schuylkill River that were once
Indian sites and farmland. On one parcel, a scruffy plateau of
reeds and underbrush, only gusting winds break the silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the serenity is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year local residents and a tower company have been
engaged in a spirited fight over the company's plans to erect a
1,289-foot steel tower on the plateau to send out the
high-definition signals that will be needed for the next generation
of television sets. A tower of that size would rank as one of the
tallest structures in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With federal law requiring affiliates of the leading networks _
ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC _ in the top 30 markets to replace outmoded
analog transmitters with digital models by Nov. 1, and with the
rest of the country's 1,600 local stations required to change by
2002, most stations are building new towers or updating old ones
without problems.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, however, community opposition based on concerns
over health, safety, property values and aesthetics is slowing the
change. Neighborhood groups in Denver, for example, have delayed
construction of a new tower for the ABC and NBC affiliates by
complaining that it was being erected too close to property lines.
In Newton, Mass., zoning approval for a tower for Fox and other
stations is being challenged in court over safety and health
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Stark, a vice president of the American Tower Corp. of
Boston, which is planning the towers in Newton and Philadelphia,
said as many as a quarter of the company's 57 tower projects could
be delayed by challenges from community groups.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere, he said, has the opposition been so strong as in
Philadelphia. ``On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 the most
opposition,'' he said, ``Philadelphia is right up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The plateau site lies about six miles up the Schuylkill from
downtown and falls within acreage that is zoned residential. It
contains just a few houses, several of them made of stone and built
more than a century ago. The remainder is mostly rolling fields and
woodlands, 500 acres of which are part of a nature preserve that
attracts thousands of hikers, birders and photographers each year.
In the 1940s, the site was considered for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the tower, which would rise about as high as the
Empire State Building, say it does not belong in such a rustic
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides spoiling views, they say, it would cause health problems
through electromagnetic radiation, lower property values and _
worst of all, to many residents _ spur commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   Siting tall towers in many big cities is not easy. In addition
to zoning laws, planners have to consider land contour _ the higher
the better _ indigenous wildlife, air traffic patterns and the
archeological significance of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Here, these considerations led a number of local stations to
build towers at a site above the river, closer to the Roxborough
section of town that nearby residents call ``the antenna farm.'' It
now includes 10 towers, most of them taller than 1,000 feet.
American Tower considered the farm but rejected it after three
brothers _ Rocco, Joseph and Louis Del Monte _ made available 27
acres less than a mile away that includes the plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said this location assures greater safety
because it is farther from houses than the antenna farm and is not
accessible by public roads.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 acres are owned by a former Philadelphian, Rodman Barker,
69, whose family acquired the property more than 100 years ago and
worked it as a fruit and vegetable farm through the 1950s. Barker,
who now lives in Council, Idaho, sold the Del Montes an option last
year to develop the land.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, a retired forest ranger, said he was well aware of fears
by local residents that a tower would spoil the landscape and bring
on development. But he insisted that was why he sold the brothers
the option. He said they promised him that they intended to live on
the Barker property after the tower was erected. The Del Montes,
who own a landscaping business near the Barker farm, did not
respond to several telephone messages, seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep it as pristine as possible,'' said Barker, who
would not divulge the terms of his deal with the brothers. ``A
tower is the best option: everything else stays the same. The deer
stay. The pheasants stay. If you develop the property, it's
bye-bye.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the project have said commercial sprawl is
inevitable if the Philadelphia Zoning Board changes the designation
of the Barker farm from residential to commercial to accommodate
American Tower.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Neil, an urban developer who is leading the opposition
to the project, said that if prohibitions against commercial
development are lifted, other nearby landowners would be tempted to
sell their properties and move away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is an enormous need to site these things about
the country,'' O'Neil said of the tall towers, which also provide
signals for radio stations and wireless telephones. ``But without
proper planning, it will be a sorry day for America the beautiful.
This is a residential area. Why sack it for industrial use if they
can put the tower in the existing farm? They want to put it here
because it's cheaper, easier and they'll make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   American Tower's initial request for a zoning change was denied,
but it appealed the ruling and has another date with the zoning
board next month. Opponents said they would raise concerns over
development and also argue that the tower would pose health risks,
even though studies of radiation levels from tall towers, which
must comply with federal standards, are contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil said growing community opposition to the tower was
strengthening the resolve to fight. In addition to an increasing
number of individuals and groups who have complained to the zoning
board, Mayor Edward G. Rendell in January rescinded his support.
</P>
<P>
   Some local groups are trying to buy up property next to the
Barker farm and the nature preserve as buffers against development.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hadden, who lives near the site, said letting the tower go
up would persuade her to sell and move, at a time when the city is
trying to reverse years of migration to outlying counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia is trying to bring residents back to the city,''
she said. ``To do that, they should be preserving what's good.
Places like this are made to order. But once they're gone, they're
gone forever.''  &QL;

ADVERTISING: LEE REVIVES AN OLD PAL TO ENTICE THE YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When Lee Co. was looking for a new way to appeal to young
consumers, it simply dusted off an old icon.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the bluejeans maker, pulled its decades-old Buddy Lee doll
out of the archives last year and tossed him into new ads using the
tag line ``Can't bust 'em.'' Even the slogan, now aimed at the
hip-hop set, was recycled from a 1940s Lee campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nike may have Tiger Woods, but Lee insists that Buddy sells,
too. Since the Buddy Lee ads were introduced, consumer awareness of
the Lee brand has increased, prompting Lee to update the campaign
with even newer spots and commercials that will be introduced next
month and throughout the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key goals of the brand was to make sure we were
getting credit for the messages, as opposed to larger brands like
Levi's,'' said Bruce Tait, who works on the account at Fallon
McElligott, the Minneapolis agency that created the new campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, awareness of the Lee brand among teen-agers
and young adults who have seen the commercials has increased to 70
percent from 20 percent, the company said. And retail sales at
Lee's top accounts increased 12 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy Lee has been a big part of that,'' said Gordon Harton,
president of Lee, which is based in Kansas City, Kan. ``They do
relate it back to the Lee brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some retail experts contend that using old images to
push a message of durability and authenticity may not create
long-term appeal among fashion-conscious young consumers who often
favor trendier brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Lee ads and the tag line ``imply sturdiness, and sturdiness
is fine, but you somehow kind of already expect that from Lee,''
said Kurt Barnard, editor of the trade publication Barnard's Retail
Trend Report. ``But it is inconsistent with the image of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-line jeans makers like Lee and its bigger competitor, Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co., which recently announced that it would close nearly
a dozen plants and lay off thousands of workers because of sagging
sales, have been struggling for ways to reach younger consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Harton said that before the reintroduced Buddy Lee campaign, Lee
was using ads that consumers found funny but did not relate to the
Lee brand.
</P>
<P>
   Besides reinforcing the Lee name, the Buddy Lee character is
also meant to remind consumers that the 110-year-old brand
represents ``things that have been around, survived and persevered
over the years,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But will that message also make them want to be seen wearing the
pants on a date?
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have to do is present themselves fashionably,''
Barnard said. ``They need to make it a little more hip _ maybe more
than a little more hip.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its commercials, Lee is pushing its marketing
message by placing the Buddy Lee image in scenes on popular
television shows. For instance, it put the doll's image on walls
during scenes of ``NYPD Blue'' and on T-shirts worn by actors
during episodes of shows that appeal to young viewers, like
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Dharma and Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Fallon McElligott say that the manufacturer is playing
to a strength that newer competitors cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand that this is not some little gimmick Lee
made up in 1997,'' said Tera Small, a spokeswoman for Fallon
McElligott. ``He comes from our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee introduced the doll in the 1920s to promote its products in
department-store window displays. Demand for the character soon
became so great that the company began selling the Buddy Lee doll,
for $2.50. Today, collectors pay as much as $500 for an authentic
doll; interest in the originals has increased since the character
was brought back to pitch Lee apparel.
</P>
<P>
   In the quirky new spots, hip actors and singers portray
themselves and talk about Buddy's impact on their lives and the
world in general. In one spot, Sarah Michelle Gellar, who plays
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, discusses how Buddy Lee pushes her to be
a better actress, and they are shown working together in a scene
from a modern adaptation of the Ibsen play ``A Doll's House.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots, as well as print ads, are being used to promote new
Lee lines, including popular cargo-style pants as well as loose,
straight-leg jeans and low-rise, boot-cut jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The TV spots will begin broadcasting next month on ESPN and
ESPN2, and will run through the back-to-school shopping season. The
print ads, which will begin running in May in national magazines
like Rolling Stone, Vibe and Mademoiselle, center on Buddy Lee's
life lessons and show various items from the new product line.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a division of VF Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., will also be
showing Buddy Lee commercials this summer at theaters showing
movies aimed at teen-agers and young adults.

KNICKS PICKED WRONG SEASON FOR A REMAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never mind Patrick Ewing missing from the free-throw
line, Allan Houston missing from the perimeter and Marcus Camby
missing, well, everything. The main problem with the Knicks? It's a
franchise that became so consumed with moving beyond its hard-nosed
past and toward its young, athletic future, that it somehow forgot
the present.
</P>
<P>
   In a season with an asterisk that provided a grand opportunity
for a veteran team to win a title, Ernie Grunfeld tried to concoct
a championship team from his imagination. Without much vision, it
is resembling a lab experiment about to combust.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld, among others, is feeling the heat for this
underachieving, 15-12 team. As the Knicks fail to find any
consistency, Grunfeld, the team president and general manager, has
been criticized for not bringing in the right players.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans are incensed he didn't pluck Stephon Marbury from
Minnesota at the trading deadline, as if a young point guard could
solve this team's problems. Others wonder why he and Knick
management committed so much money to role players such as Marcus
Camby, Charlie Ward and Chris Dudley, but the truth is other teams
were eventually going to pay those players similar money.
</P>
<P>
   What you can hold Grunfeld to the fire for: miscalculating the
effects of a ruptured National Basketball Association season. In a
year that cried for stability, he dealt for potential, youth and
talent. At a time when he and the organization should have stayed
with proven veterans and experience, he changed the engine on a car
that needed a tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   Staying put worked for Utah, Indiana, Miami and Portland, teams
who lead their respective divisions. Not one of those franchises
made major alterations to its roster in the off season, preferring
instead to rely on the players that got them to the playoffs last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had known what a short season was going to be like, we
may have handled things a bit differently,'' said Dave Checketts,
the Madison Square Garden president, before Monday's embarrassing
loss to Atlanta at home. ``The clubs that have kept things pretty
much intact are the clubs that have done the best out of the shoot.
We decided to make some changes. We made some changes. We've had
some injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld admits it was a gamble, but it was one he said the
Knicks had to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got knocked out four years in a row in the second round and
our team wasn't getting any younger,'' he said yesterday. ``Also,
we weren't sure exactly how Patrick would come back after being off
for almost a year. We wanted to make an effort to get younger but
remain competitive at the same time. All I can say is, we're hoping
to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have just finished 9 games in 12 days _ en route to
50 games in 89 days. They alternate between inconsistent and awful,
with an occasional solid effort sandwiched in between. Too often,
they are 12 bodies with no symmetry or cohesion on the floor,
trying to do what they did for some other franchise they used to
play for in some other city. After the Hawks game, in which the
Knicks made 2 of 18 shots in the fourth quarter and were booed loud
and often, the players did not talk about watching Ewing and
standing around on offense or not rotating on defense. They talked
about the effects of the jeering on their ability to play well.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a good sign when your players spend as much energy
blocking the booing out from their minds as they do blocking their
man out under the boards. But then, this is not a mentally strong
team, a group of players who summon resolve when the game is in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Those Knicks have come and gone: To Golden State (John Starks).
To Toronto (Charles Oakley). To the Lakers (Derek Harper).
</P>
<P>
   It is not even about heart or desire anymore, not about a
lethargic team that cannot motivate itself and certainly not about
a coach who can't get his team to play. At 15-12, the Knicks as
comprised are simply not that good.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, playing in immense pain in his right knee, could
not jump high enough to tip the ball to himself while going after a
rebound on Monday. Ewing, proud as he is old, tipped in a missed
shot in the second half and ended up in a heap on the floor. He
rose, only to lope up the court so awkwardly it was as if a
restraining harness was holding him back. On consecutive
possessions midway through the the fourth quarter, Camby missed a
dunk attempt and lofted an air ball. Houston cannot find a rhythm
to his shot and his game that lasts more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to knock the Latrell Sprewell trade which cost
the team Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings because he is a
special talent. But after the nice numbers on offense, you wonder
if Sprewell can knock down a 3-pointer at the buzzer, or even get
to the free throw line with the game in the balance. It has yet to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld has made his share of mistakes, from locking up
hard-to-trade players for untold millions to failing to build
through the draft. Yet his biggest blunder may be failing to
realize this: That if the Knicks genuinely wanted a shot at the
title in this Jordan-less season, shuffling the deck and giving
into the pressure of change was not the way to go about it.  &QL;

HEROIN USE IS UNABATED, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heroin use in New York City remains high, with more
young people trying heroin and more users now snorting the drug
than injecting it, often under the misconception that snorting will
not lead to addiction, according to a new report on drug trends
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House's director of national
drug control policy, visited St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center
on Manhattan's West Side to release his office's latest Pulse
Check, a semiannual report on national trends in drug abuse
gathered from 200 treatment centers and law enforcement officials
in 16 cities, including New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which gave no specific numbers, also said that
combining heroin with cocaine, a practice known as
``speedballing,'' was becoming more popular in New York. But Pulse
Check noted that the use of crack and powder cocaine declined in
the Northeast, which includes New York. It described the market for
crack in New York as ``not expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that 13 million Americans used illegal drugs
nationwide in the last month. Of these, 4.1 million are chronically
addicted, he said, ``and they're just a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the report were confirmed by emergency room doctors
at Roosevelt Hospital, who talked about the cases they had handled
recently. ``We're seeing a lot of snorting and we're seeing it with
young people,'' said Dr. David Pigott, a senior resident.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We had a beautiful 23-year-old girl who snorted
cocaine at a party, seven times on the hour. She awoke the next
morning and fell out of bed. Her left side was paralyzed from a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was devastated for the rest of her life, and there wasn't
anything we could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulse Check also reported that marijuana use in New York and
elsewhere was stable but that the age of people undergoing
treatment for marijuana was dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elaine Josephson, another doctor in the emergency room, said
she was finding more marijuana abuse among school-age children in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are being brought from their schools because they
were irrational and hurting other people,'' she said. ``They will
tell you that they smoked some bad weed. The youngest I've
personally seen was 10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said there were also more bad reactions from
so-called designer drugs consumed by young people at clubs or
parties, such as Ecstasy; ketamine, an animal anesthetic, and a
sedative called GHB.
</P>
<P>
   The use of such drugs pose serious health risks for the young,
Pulse Check said.

 &HT;    Two recall horror of attack by rapist
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The two women looked at each other and thought
for certain they were both going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Tied together on the bed by the man who had broken into the
house they shared, the women watched as he paced back and forth
with the hunting knife in his hand. The man had raped them once and
was threatening to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least three different times that night, I thought we were
not going to make it,'' one of the victims testified Tuesday in
district court.
</P>
<P>
   The man sexually assaulted the women three times that night last
April and then stole jewelry and other valuables from their
Northeast Austin home, leaving the women bound on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   The women later discovered that the man who was charged with
assaulting them, Joseph Massingill, has been HIV positive since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Massingill, of North Austin, pleaded guilty Monday to two counts
of aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon and two counts of
aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Tuesday, the two women
testified during a pre-sentencing hearing about the horror of being
raped and the fear of exposure to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Upon learning that Massingill was HIV positive, one of his victims
said she was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the emotions of the crime came back,'' the woman said.
``There was nothing I could do but wait and see what would happen.
. . . I feel very angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, both women have tested negative for HIV, but they could
still have the virus. They will take another HIV test next month.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Mike Lynch will sentence Massingill on April 14,
the one-year anniversary of the attack on the two women. Massingill
facesfive years to life in prison for each count of aggravated
sexual assault and aggravated robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Massingill, a painter, declined to comment for this article. His
attorney, Walter Prentice, said it was Massingill's idea to plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to accept responsibility for these very serious
offenses,'' Prentice said. ``He didn't want to put the state
through a trial, and so he stepped up and admitted to what he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of Massingill's fingerprints were found in the house,
according to police. One of the women identified him in a police
lineup, and a DNA sample taken from the women's sheets also linked
Massingill to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When police charged him with the sexual assaults, Massingill was
already in custody on robbery and theft charges for breaking into
residences near his home and stealing cash and other valuables.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Massingill was addicted to crack
cocaine at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Massingill was married at the time. His wife, Deeanna
Massingill, who was in court Tuesday, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The two sexual assault victims testified Tuesday that they had
little warning of the intruder. It was just after the weather
report on the 10 o'clock news when one of the women said she heard
the dog growl and then bark.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing she knew, a strange man was standing in her
bedroom with a three- to four-inch knife. Later, she would find out
that the man had undone the bolt on the door by reaching up through
a swinging doggie door.
</P>
<P>
   The man, she said, demanded sex and told the women to be quiet.
He ordered them to light a candle and to dim the lights.
</P>
<P>
   He raped both of them, and then he bound their hands together
with a cord he cut from a sewing machine. He cut all the phone
cords so that the women could not call for help. Then he attacked
them twice more.
</P>
<P>
   The two women said he later rummaged through their drawers and
closets looking for valuables. He used their restroom and drank
from a milk carton in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   After he left, the women freed themselves and used a mobile
phone to call police.
</P>
<P>
   Since the attacks, the women said they have armed their home
with a burglar alarm and installed bars on the windows. Both women
have concealed handgun permits and own handguns. But, both say,
they still live in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that anything can make you feel safe again,'' one
of the women said.

 &HT;    Senators debate curb on gun lawsuits
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sen. Jon Lindsay says a growing national trend
to sue gun makers for the misuse of their products doesn't make
sense and he wants lawmakers to help block such lawsuits in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay on Tuesday asked fellow senators to consider Senate Bill
717, aimed at preventing the state, cities, counties or other
government agencies from suing gun and ammunition manufacturers
without legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Republican said the bill would prevent guns from
being regulated at local levels. He added that if there is a
lawsuit to be filed against gun makers, state lawmakers should have
a say in it and it should be done on behalf of all Texans, not just
those in one city or county.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy debate, Lindsay withdrew his request for the
bill's approval, agreeing to work on amendments. The bill is
expected to be debated again today.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's bill comes on the heels of a multistate legal attack
on the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid expenses for people who
suffered from smoking-related illnesses. Texas reached a $17.3
billion settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The successes of the attack on tobacco spurred jurisdictions
across the country, beleaguered by gun-related violence, to apply
similar legal principles to wage war on gun manufacturers. So far,
cities such as Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago and Miami have filed
lawsuits to force the gun industry to ensure that guns are used
properly and aren't distributed to criminals. Many cities are
seeking reimbursement for police and health-related costs
associated with shootings.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark verdict in New York in February, a jury found gun
makers guilty of negligent marketing in a case in which the
relatives of gunshot victims argued that gun manufacturers
intentionally oversupplied dealers in states with weak gun laws,
and those guns were then resold in states, such as New York, with
stronger laws.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the powerful gun industry has prevailed on
state legislatures to prevent such lawsuits. Georgia state
legislators, for example, have already approved a law to prohibit
local governments from suing gun manufacturers and distributors,
and other states are considering similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of Senate Bill 717 is to stop the questionable
lawsuit and ensure that local gun control does not become an issue
in Texas,'' Lindsay said. ``The idea of suing a gun manufacturer
for misuse of its product is frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay said allowing lawsuits against gun makers, ammunition
makers and their trade groups could open the door to lawsuits
against auto makers and knife manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a statewide issue, and, like the tobacco issue, it
should be handled on a statewide basis,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress say it's a national issue and should be
handled by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., earlier this month led a bipartisan
group of lawmakers who introduced legislation to block cities and
states from filing lawsuits against gun makers and distributors
because of misuse of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's bill would allow individuals to sue gun makers for
misuse of their products and would allow government agencies to sue
the companies for breach of contact or warrant defects.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers spoke against the proposal before Lindsay
agreed to delay further debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it not the job of the judges and the courts and the people
we elect to decide which cases have merit?'' Sen. Gonzalo
Barrientos, D-Austin, asked Lindsay. ``Certainly there are
frivolous lawsuits, but I think we're setting a dangerous precedent
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, has written major bills in the past
to curtail lawsuits in Texas. But he said Lindsay's bill would
treat gun makers as a special group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in many ways a special protection for gun companies,''
said Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston.

 &HT;    Women at UT less likely to get tenure, high pay, report says
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Men who teach at the University of Texas are
more likely to be awarded tenure and be placed in prestigious,
higher-paying jobs than women faculty members, a disparity
administrators say they want to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Although UT is making substantial progress, ``women are not
breaking the glass ceiling when it comes to being promoted to full
professor and getting endowed professorships,'' said Janet Staiger,
a professor of radio, television and film who co-chairs the
Committee for the Support of Women with UT Vice President Patricia
Ohlendorf.
</P>
<P>
   She shared data compiled by the committee that shows 406 men
held endowed professorships and endowed chairs this year, compared
with just 43 women.
</P>
<P>
   Although UT has added more women faculty in the past 15 years,
boosting the faculty from 22 percent women to 32 percent, the
number of those winning tenure, a protected job status, has not
grown so dramatically. Fifteen years ago, 13 percent of the tenured
faculty were women; today, it's 19 percent, UT data show.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the gender disparities among faculty members are
complex. They reflect long-standing discrimination against women in
academia, problems with attracting and retaining women in certain
fields, a lack of women mentors and a society in which women still
bear the brunt of child-rearing _ sometimes at the expense of their
careers, women faculty members said.
</P>
<P>
   The gender differences echo problems reported Tuesday at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT officials acknowledged
in a report on the World Wide Web on Friday that bias against
female professors in the School of Science, while not deliberate,
is pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all universities have these problems,'' said Gretchen
Ritter, an associate professor of government at UT.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, who earned a doctorate from MIT in 1992, said the
climate is far worse for women there than here.
</P>
<P>
   UT has approved a policy allowing faculty members on the tenure
track to stop the six-year tenure clock for a year, giving women
time off to have a baby. Administrators also are considering a
policy to allow women having children in the midst of a semester to
be assigned to nonteaching duties, Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   Because MIT is a science and engineering university with fewer
women faculty members than UT, change is more difficult, said
Jeanne Freeland-Graves, a professor of human ecology and chairwoman
of the Faculty Women's Organization. ``When you have more women at
a university, things improve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Brodbelt, an associate professor of chemistry, said she
has not detected any bias against women in her department. About
three of 40 tenured faculty in her department are women, she said,
but UT is taking pains to recruit more women chemists, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think UT is biting the bullet and moving forward,''
said Lucia Gilbert, director of the Center for Women's Studies and
a professor of educational psychology. ``Engineering has made a lot
of efforts to improve the climate for women and female students,
and the College of Natural Sciences is definitely working on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's center offers an interdisciplinary seminar for women
graduate students and seniors to help them ``understand the biases
and stereotypes so they don't buy into them.''
</P>
<P>
   The UT System has directed each campus to form committees to
evaluate the status of women on campus. A study is under way to see
if there are disparities in pay for comparable jobs and rank.
</P>
<P>
   Data provided Tuesday by UT show that the average female
professor at UT's highest rank is paid $74,336, compared with
$85,845 for males. The averages do not take into account
differences in the professors' fields or time in the upper echelon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to hire fairly and provide a working environment
where everyone on this faculty can succeed as well they can,'' UT
President Larry Faulkner said.

 &HT;    Ex-funeral agency director sues over firing
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's office tried to thwart a
high-profile investigation into the embalming practices of the
world's largest funeral company after the governor received $35,000
in campaign donations, a whistle-blower lawsuit filed Tuesday
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted director of the Texas Funeral Service Commission, who
had supervised the controversial embalming investigation, contends
she was fired on Feb. 8 for speaking out about interference from
Bush aides and several state lawmakers who also received money from
a funeral home megacorporation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the allegations about Bush and the legislators are
central to the lawsuit filed by Eliza May, the state officials are
not named as defendants. A Bush aide denies that his office did
anything improper.
</P>
<P>
   May sued the Texas Funeral Service Commission and Service
Corporation International (SCI), a Houston-based company that owns
3,700 funeral homes and cemeteries around the world. She also sued
SCI chairman Robert Waltrip, who visited Bush's office last year to
complain that May was leading a ``storm trooper'' investigation
into his company and to seek her termination.
</P>
<P>
   SCI, which had revenues of $2.5 billion in 1997, is appealing
nearly $450,000 in regulatory fines that were recommended by a
Texas funeral commission panel after the 1998 investigation
overseen by May turned up evidence of bodies being embalmed by
unsupervised apprentices in unlicensed locations. The recommended
fines would be the largest ever imposed by the Texas Funeral
Service Commission, but the commission in January decided to
conduct an internal review of the embalming investigation that led
to the proposed penalties.
</P>
<P>
   May is seeking reinstatement as director of the 10-person
funeral agency, which is governed by nine commissioners _ four
funeral directors and five public members. Commission members in
February said they had lost trust and confidence in May's ability
to lead the funeral agency, where her base salary was $42,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   From SCI, she seeks unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit claims that SCI company officials illegally
interfered with her state job duties, conspired to undermine her
and inflicted emotional distress, including hiring a detective to
investigate her political and civic activities. Until last summer,
May was treasurer of the Texas Democratic Party and is a former
member of its statewide executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit will show the Texas Funeral Service Commission to
be a state agency that is completely out of control, epitomizing
the very worst that state government has to offer,'' said Derek
Howard, one of May's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it would appear that the governor's office and
other politicians encouraged this dysfunctional behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   May's lawsuit lists several state lawmakers who wrote letters to
the funeral service commission or made phone calls on SCI's behalf
after the embalming investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   May also contends she was subjected to an unpleasant and
inappropriate grilling during a May 1998 meeting in the office of
Joe Allbaugh, the governor's chief of staff. The meeting was called
by Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, whose district includes SCI.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmire and Allbaugh were hostile and threatening to May and
Funeral Commission chairman Dick McNeil in front of SCI chairman
Waltrip and his lawyer, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, denied that the
governor's staff took sides at the meeting or showed favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role was simply to listen and make sure the parties were
communicating effectively,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's office acts based on what is best for Texas,
not based on campaign contributions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Richards, general counsel for the funeral service
commission, said he could not comment on May's lawsuit because he
did not have a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Miller, an Austin lobbyist who represents SCI, said May's
lawsuit has no merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally fabricated; it's totally false with respect to
us,'' he said. ``There's no truth to it.''

tours through the trees and spectacular vistas of wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shi Shi and Bai Yun, a pair of giant pandas, have taken up
residence at the San Diego Zoo, among the country's finest, even
before the bears arrived. Shamu remains the star at SeaWorld. At
the San Diego Wild Animal Park, a monorail tram takes visitors on a
50-minute safari into land where 3,500 animals roam freely in
native habitats.
</P>

NISSAN IS SET TO COMBINE PARTS UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nissan Motor Co. said Tuesday that two parts-supplier
subsidiaries would merge, furthering an effort by the troubled
automaker to simplify its sprawling operations even while
considering Renault SA's offer to buy a 35 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The parts suppliers, Calsonic Corp. and Kansei Corp., are facing
sharp drops in their pretax profit for the fiscal year that ends
March 31, because of deep cuts in Nissan's domestic production. As
part of an extensive overhaul, Nissan is trying to wean its
suppliers from their overwhelming dependence on its business.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan said the two subsidiaries decided on their own to merge.
Although the deal will not be complete until April 2000, the parent
company no doubt welcomed their efforts to combine operations and
share costs of developing new technologies and products.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan will be the biggest shareholder in the merged company,
however, so its links to the suppliers will still be strong.
Calsonic is a major maker of air-conditioning systems and has made
strides independently toward lessening its reliance on Nissan.
Kansei makes auto display systems like sensors and meters.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement did little to resolve the debate among
investors and analysts about the extent of Nissan's obligations to
companies like Calsonic and Kansei. Japanese accounting rules do
not require the fortunes of some of Nissan's suppliers and other
affiliates to be reflected in its consolidated financial
statements, even though the company is responsible for portions of
their debts, pension liabilities, loans and other so-called
contingent liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler Chrysler AG, which considered taking a stake in Nissan
only to walk away from a possible deal after six months of research
into the Japanese company's financial condition and operations, has
been telling investors and fund managers that Nissan's contingent
liabilities are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become important for investors trying to evaluate
the impact of a potential deal between Nissan and Renault.
</P>
<P>
   Many contingent liabilities must be disclosed under
accounting-rule changes that begin to take effect April 1. But in
the meantime, investors are trying to determine how great Nissan's
exposure is, as well as the potential impact on Renault.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report covering the fiscal year that ended March
31, 1998, Nissan documents liabilities totaling 4.3 trillion yen,
or $36.5 billion at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, Daimler Chrysler has been telling some
investors and fund management companies that Nissan's
off-balance-sheet liabilities make its actual obligations much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Of the liabilities detailed by Nissan, $21.2 billion are related
to its core car-manufacturing business. Of the remainder,
auto-financing-related liabilities account for $11.8 billion, and
the rest is in loans it obtained to help insulate itself and its
group companies from Japan's credit shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts regard auto-financing-related liabilities as less
worrisome than other forms of debt, as they are secured by
collateral, namely Nissan cars.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler Chrysler has suggested that Nissan's actual obligations
are much higher, according to investors, substantiating suspicions
long harbored by many analysts who follow Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   One said Daimler Chrysler's research suggests that Nissan's
liabilities _ not just its industrial debt and auto-leasing-related
liabilities but other potential liabilities like pension
contributions and loan guarantees to affiliates _ could be as much
as twice the $21.2 billion in core debt that the company has on its
books.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say they do not believe Nissan's so-called
off-balance sheet risks run so high. Steve Usher, an auto analyst
at Jardine Fleming, put such liabilities at ``$6 billion to $10
billion on the absolute outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has said it does not consider its off-balance sheet
liabilities to be significant.
</P>
<P>
   Its board of directors plans to meet on March 27 to consider
Renault's offer.

IN ALBANY, GOP IN SENATE MAKES 3RD VERSION OF BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ All three of the Capitol's power players have now
staked out their positions on the state budget, as the Republicans
who control the Senate announced their package Tuesday. But with
eight days left in the fiscal year, the Legislature appears little
closer to a budget accord than it was a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The state appears headed for a late budget for the 15th year in
a row; there was no progress Tuesday, but there was no lack of
carping.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to release the proposed budget, Joseph
Bruno, the Senate majority leader, vented his frustration with the
Democratic majority in the Assembly, blaming them for the lack of
movement. ``It's their fault, totally and completely,'' he said.
``They are spending and trying to be heroes to every interest group
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver noted that his house passed its
own budget resolution a week ago and made public its most important
elements a week before that. ``If they had done it last week, like
we did, we would be that much closer to resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's spokeswoman, Patricia Lynch, pointed out that Gov.
George Pataki had not become directly involved in the budget
process, despite entreaties from the Legislature. ``So far, the
governor has been silent and unavailable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office, which has sharply derided the Assembly's
budget plans, declined to comment Tuesday on the charges being
exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Senate Republicans took the middle ground
between the governor and the Assembly, with a budget more than $600
million larger than the $72.66 billion plan Pataki announced in
January. Most of the additions are in health care and education,
areas the governor proposed to cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats say their budget is $2 billion more than
the governor's, but the Republicans accuse them of underestimating
their expenses. The governor's budget office says the gap is closer
to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two houses have been unable to agree on how much money is
available to spend, the usual starting point for serious budget
negotiations, and Bruno said that without such agreement, there was
no point in going to conference committees.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the two sides are not far apart on that point.
Everyone agrees that the state is awash in money. The disagreement
is not so much over what is available as over how much of that
bounty to spend and how much to salt away for future needs. The
Assembly Democrats want to set aside $1 billion of the current
surplus as a reserve during the coming fiscal year, though they
would earmark nearly half of it for specific expenses in 2001 and
later. The Senate Republicans would set aside $2 billion, with no
earmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Silver is struggling to find a strategy that would avoid a rerun
of last year, when the governor simply vetoed most of the
Legislature's budget additions championed by Democrats. Bruno,
meanwhile, is trying to strike a balance between the speaker and
the governor, who are barely on speaking terms.
</P>
<P>
   And both leaders have a pressing reason to conclude a budget
quickly this year: For the first time, legislators' pay will be
withheld as long as the budget is overdue.

OFFICERS IN DIALLO SHOOTING WON'T TESTIFY FOR GRAND JURY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All four police officers involved in the fatal
shooting of Amadou Diallo have decided not to testify before the
Bronx grand jury investigating the case, their lawyers said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for one of the officers, Sean Carroll, announced a
month ago that his client would not testify, but the other three
officers had remained undecided until Tuesday. Their lawyers said
that even though the officers wanted to tell the grand jury their
version of events, they should not testify, in part because of the
case's charged political atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have yet to explain their actions in the Feb. 4
incident to the police or to prosecutors. They fired a total of 41
shots at Diallo, an unarmed West African street peddler, in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. Their lawyers have said
that the officers believed Diallo had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury's term ends on Monday, and several lawyers
connected to the case said they expected the jurors to decide
before then whether to bring criminal charges against the four
officers. But it could take a few days before the decision is made
public. And if there are indictments, the charges will be kept
under seal until the officers are brought into court and read the
charges at their arraignments.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Carroll's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, said he
believed that the political pressures surrounding the case made it
a foregone conclusion that the officers would be indicted, and that
therefore his client would not testify.
</P>
<P>
   The other defense lawyers expressed similar reservations
Tuesday, and some expressed concerns that federal prosecutors who
are monitoring the investigation might take over the case.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer representing Edward McMellon, said
the unfavorable atmosphere surrounding the case made testifying
inadvisable.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brounstein, who is representing Officer Kenneth Boss,
said, ``My client was anxious to testify, but on my advice he's not
testifying.''
</P>
<P>
   And James J. Culleton, who is representing Richard Murphy, said:
``I don't think it's in my client's best interest to testify,
despite the fact that I would love for his story to get out.
There's been too much negative publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers were invited by Bronx prosecutors to have their
clients testify Wednesday. Some seriously entertained the proposal;
as recently as last week at least one of the lawyers talked with
prosecutors about security arrangements at the courthouse, said a
lawyer connected to the case who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg said he was pleased that the other officers had decided
not to testify. ``I think it's a very wise choice on the part of
the other defendants,'' he said. ``It would be useless. Why tell
your story to a grand jury where it's going to fall on deaf ears?''

<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ On a cool, cloudy day in New York City, a
businessman in a gray suit dashes from the tan-brick Helmsley
Palace, a cell phone pressed to his ear. Two limos are parked out
front. Taxis clog the street.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the city, nuns wait on benches inside Grand Central
Station; four girls jump rope on a sidewalk; in-line skaters rush
by street musicians in the urban panoply unfolding beneath the
familiar skyline. The only element missing from this New York
experience, it seems, is the smell of exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after a few minutes of looking, it's easy to forget that
everything in ``this'' New York is made of Lego bricks _ 100,000
bricks for the 25-foot-high Empire State Building, tens of
thousands more for the Statue of Liberty towering above a
mini-harbor; a handful of the smallest bricks for Lilliputian cops
busting a young guy in a plaza. There's Times Square, too, and the
Chrysler Building, the Guggenheim Museum and Essex House, all made
of Legos, sci-fi movielike.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable replica of Gotham, and found only in one
place, and only since last week. A magical new attraction called
Legoland California debuted Saturday in the oceanside community of
Carlsbad about 30 miles north of downtown San Diego. Boiled down,
the new theme park owned by the Denmark-based LEGO Group combines
Wizard of Oz wonder with the technical wizardry of Frank Lloyd
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional literature insists that the sprawling park, only the
third of its kind in the world, is designed for kids ages 2 to 12.
After a sneak preview a few weeks back, it's unlikely any child
will leave disappointed. My 7-year-old son, who came along as
guinea pig, now wants to move to California. He liked the more
conventional stuff, the electric cars and the squirt guns, and the
more unconventional, like the towering T-rex made of Legos.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'll take New York.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders whether Ole Kirk Christiansen could have imagined
such a place. Christiansen began making small wooden toys in his
Billund, Denmark, workshop in 1932. Two years later, he dubbed his
toys and his workshop LEGO, a contraction of the Danish words ``leg
godt,'' which in English means ``play well.'' It was only
coincidence that in Latin, ``lego'' translates to ``I assemble.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the forerunner to the Lego brick was introduced. Bricks
with the familiar fastening agents called inner tubes were created
in 1958. LEGOLAND literature boasts that bricks built in 1958 are
compatible with bricks of 1999. Since 1949, the company has
produced 189 billion Lego elements, 30 Lego bricks for every man,
woman and child in the world. Several billion bricks are on the
floor in my son's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland Billund opened in 1968, Legoland Windsor in England
only three years ago. Legoland California has been under
construction for two years in the hills above the Pacific. It's a
128-acre park that consists of 30 million Lego bricks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Carlsbad park, ($32 for adults, $25 for children and
senior citizens) visitors are greeted by the largest Lego retail
shop in the United States. Across the way, leaning over the
Legoland lake, is a 9-foot-tall red dinosaur built of Lego bricks,
and huge elephants with long white tusks, and a pride of Lego
lions, Lego alligators and a Lego vulture or two.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you stroll, there's the life-size Lego fireman.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Bambi and her Lego mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lego Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   You get the Lego idea.
</P>
<P>
   Early in our visit, we watched a young man make animals from
skinny balloons. Turns out he was one of the few park attractions
not made from Legos. That guy and the jugglers, and the nice lady
who made our lunch.
</P>
<P>
   At Legoland, I soon realized that this amusement park is
different from any other in one crucial respect: Though laid out
like a Six Flags Over Texas, Legoland is a quiet, gentle place made
for wonder, much like spending an afternoon with the bricks at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland is not about amusement-park adrenalin and head rushes.
There is one genuine roller coaster in Legoland, and it is docile
by Texas Giant standards. Instead there are squirt guns, boat
rides, electric cars, a chairlift of sorts where kids can pull
themselves up a 30-foot tower, pulleylike, to get a peak at the
Pacific to the west, then drift gently back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland restaurants serve exceptional food _ great pizza or
Swedish stir-fry cooked while you wait, and some of the best
Chinese food I've ever eaten. In one corner of the park, near the
15-foot-tall face of Albert Einstein (made of gray Legos) are large
play areas well-stocked with bricks _ where inspired Lego lovers
can attempt their own creations.
</P>
<P>
   But all roads at Legoland lead to New York, or to an equally
impressive depiction of Washington, D.C., nearby, (380,792 bricks
for the U.S. Capitol, 70,000 for the Lincoln Memorial); or San
Francisco; or Bourbon Street at its rowdiest; or a Midwest farm; or
a New England harbor scene, all of them rendered in Legos to the
richest detail.
</P>
<P>
   In aggregate, the models make up a part of the park called
Miniland, where a person can spend all day, in a Lego trance. What
makes Miniland doubly spectacular, of course, is a universal frame
of reference. My son has spent hundreds of hours with Legos over
the years, building space shuttles and airliners and race cars.
I've joined him on occasion, fiddling with the bricks to make a
crude building or two, (how ``do'' you make the roof?) or a bridge
for his train set. Neither of us could have imagined the
possibilities of the art.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has ever fiddled with a Lego brick, Legoland
California is a new national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, that makes most of us, doesn't it?

   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ On a cool, cloudy day in New York City, a
businessman in a gray suit dashes from the tan-brick Helmsley
Palace, a cell phone pressed to his ear. Two limos are parked out
front. Taxis clog the street.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the city, nuns wait on benches inside Grand Central
Station; four girls jump rope on a sidewalk; in-line skaters rush
by street musicians in the urban panoply unfolding beneath the
familiar skyline. The only element missing from this New York
experience, it seems, is the smell of exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after a few minutes of looking, it's easy to forget that
everything in ``this'' New York is made of Lego bricks _ 100,000
bricks for the 25-foot-high Empire State Building, tens of
thousands more for the Statue of Liberty towering above a
mini-harbor; a handful of the smallest bricks for Lilliputian cops
busting a young guy in a plaza. There's Times Square, too, and the
Chrysler Building, the Guggenheim Museum and Essex House, all made
of Legos, sci-fi movielike.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable replica of Gotham, and found only in one
place, and only since last week. A magical new attraction called
Legoland California debuted Saturday in the oceanside community of
Carlsbad about 30 miles north of downtown San Diego. Boiled down,
the new theme park owned by the Denmark-based LEGO Group combines
Wizard of Oz wonder with the technical wizardry of Frank Lloyd
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional literature insists that the sprawling park, only the
third of its kind in the world, is designed for kids ages 2 to 12.
After a sneak preview a few weeks back, it's unlikely any child
will leave disappointed. My 7-year-old son, who came along as
guinea pig, now wants to move to California. He liked the more
conventional stuff, the electric cars and the squirt guns, and the
more unconventional, like the towering T-rex made of Legos.
</P>

<P>
   Beginning with Saturday's opening, Legoland California shoulders
its way in among southernmost California's top tourist attractions.
It was already a crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   _ Torrey Pine State Preserve ranks among the Pacific Coast's
most spectacular destinations. The visitor center at the top of a
mountain offers views of sandstone cliffs and the ocean hundreds of
feet below. On a clear day, Dana Point is visible, miles up the
coast in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The park is named for the rarest pine in the United States. More
than 6,000 of them grow on 17 acres. Eight hiking trails offer
tours through the trees and spectacular vistas of wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shi Shi and Bai Yun, a pair of giant pandas, have taken up
residence at the San Diego Zoo, among the country's finest, even
before the bears arrived. Shamu remains the star at SeaWorld. At
the San Diego Wild Animal Park, a monorail tram takes visitors on a
50-minute safari into land where 3,500 animals roam freely in
native habitats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cabrillo National Monument offers the best views of San Diego,
tours of the historic lighthouse, and hiking down to tide pools
below. In winter, the monument is also a prime vantage point for
whale watching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several charter yacht companies offer more intimate glimpses
of the gray whales as they migrate from Alaskan seas to the
warm-water breeding lagoons of Baja California. The migration
season lasts from mid-December to mid-March, peaking in January.
</P>
<P>

FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN VIEWS ISLAND PARENTS FLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I woke up this morning in Havana, an alluring city I have
dreamed about all my life for one special reason _ if not for a
matter of days, it would have been my birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, I might still be there if not for my parents'
courageous journey in 1962 to the United States. The country opened
its arms to any oppressed Cuban during the early 1960s, a time when
communism was engulfing the island.
</P>
<P>
   My father and mother told me about their neighbor in Havana, the
one who had declared himself a member of the Communist Party. The
old man, as they remember him, mockingly asked my young parents,
``Why are you leaving Cuba?''
</P>
<P>
   My mother, then pregnant with me, scornfully told him,
```Because I want this baby inside of me to know what it is to live
in a land that is free.'' The neighbor then told my mother that by
the time I reached kindergarten the world would be dominated by
communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget how I cried the day you went off to
kindergarten,'' my mother, Marta Elena, has told me often. ``I
remember every detail of that man's face and the exchange we had.
Leaving was absolutely the right decision, one we never looked back
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Miami, I often fantasized about what it would be
like to visit the land where my parents were born and one I came
within three weeks of seeing as my homeland. Now I will know.
</P>
<P>
   My parents and grandparents spoke so glowingly of Cuba's beauty
that it always seemed like an unreachable utopia. The luster of
what they recalled from the pre-Fidel Castro days of 1959 is no
doubt far different from its current state.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I come to visit the land of my heritage, which sits
only 90 miles from U.S. soil, with an open mind and open eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I will always consider Cuba my homeland along with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   My parents and I flew over Cuba on a trip from Miami to Panama
when I was 14. When the pilot told us over the loudspeaker that our
plane was flying directly over Cuba's interior, I remember how my
father and mother were brought to tears as they gazed out the
window and saw their homeland for the first time in 14 years. The
emotional pull was too much for them to contain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   My parents left for Miami after waiting nearly a year for their
visa waiver from the U.S. government. My father arrived just before
midnight at the local police station to stand in line for a call at
3 p.m. the next day. He was third in line when my mother joined him
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 500 people pressing against the doors, my parents
were among the fortunate 30 allowed entry to begin the final
processing for their departure from Cuba. Many Cubans repeated the
process, which took place five days a week for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   My parents have told me of the overwhelming emotions they
experienced July 25, 1962, the day the government official showed
up honking the horn on his Czechoslovakian-made motorcycle to
deliver the paperwork they had waited 11 months to receive.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcyclist, well known in all Cuban neighborhoods as the
sign of impending freedom back then, provided one of the final
obstacles for them to leave Cuba: The mandatory inventory of the
items in their home had to match the one taken 11 months earlier
when they applied for their exit.
</P>
<P>
   One missing item, and the request would have been denied. All
property was now owned by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, like all who were leaving Cuba in those times, were
ridiculed by party members in their own neighborhood, being called
``gusanos,'' or worms.
</P>
<P>
   My father and mother, simultaneously awaiting their exit papers
and my birth, went to Mount Carmel Catholic Church, where they had
married July 15, 1961, nearly every day to pray that I would not be
born in Cuba. If so, it would have meant applying for another visa
and passport, either of which could take up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that if I was not born in Cuba my middle name would
be Jude, after the patron saint of lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   For their Pan Am flight from Havana to Miami, they acquired a
falsified letter from a doctor stating my mother was only six
months pregnant, not in her final month, when she would not have
been allowed to fly.
</P>
<P>
   She has often reminded me of how fellow countrymen harassed her
for not allowing her child to be born in Cuba, where they said he
could be raised and decide for himself if he should live there or
in the imperialist West.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment the U.S. government granting you permission
to leave your land but not before threatening that if you do not
return within 27 days you would be forever considered a traitor of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For a then-impressionable young couple with a baby on the way,
the torture of hearing those words resonates to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the types of things a person can never forget,'' my
father, Pedro, told me last week. ``Even the tiniest details live
in my mind forever.''
</P>
<P>
   My parents' DC-6 arrived in Miami on July 29. They had exactly
three changes of clothing (including socks and undergarments) and
nothing else. They were not allowed to take money, jewelry or
photos out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived in a foreign country, unable to speak the language.
My father, then 22, made 80 cents an hour putting together window
screens in a Miami warehouse, trying to support his 16-year-old
pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two days after they landed in the United States, I was
born at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   My younger brother, Ricardo, and I know all of these things
because our parents made certain we knew our heritage.
</P>
<P>
   While other first-generation Americans have made similar
journeys to the birthplace of their parents, there is something
unique and riveting when that country is only 90 miles away and has
hidden behind the cloak of communism for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   So, while it is baseball that brings me to Cuba, it is human
drama that will generate my stories from here. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   My father and mother, simultaneously awaiting their exit papers
and my birth, went to Mount Carmel Catholic Church, where they had
married July 15, 1961, nearly every day to pray that I would not be
born in Cuba. If so, it would have meant applying for another visa
and passport, either of which could take up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that if I was not born in Cuba my middle name would
be Jude, after the patron saint of lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   For their Pan Am flight from Havana to Miami, they acquired a
falsified letter from a doctor stating my mother was only six
months pregnant, not in her final month, when she would not have
been allowed to fly.
</P>
<P>
   She has often reminded me of how fellow countrymen harassed her
for not allowing her child to be born in Cuba, where they said he
could be raised and decide for himself if he should live there or
in the imperialist West.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment the U.S. government granting you permission
to leave your land but not before threatening that if you do not
return within 27 days you would be forever considered a traitor of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For a then-impressionable young couple with a baby on the way,
the torture of hearing those words resonates to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the types of things a person can never forget,'' my
father, Pedro, told me last week. ``Even the tiniest details live
in my mind forever.''
</P>
<P>
   My parents' DC-6 arrived in Miami on July 29. They had exactly
three changes of clothing (including socks and undergarments) and
nothing else. They were not allowed to take money, jewelry or
photos out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived in a foreign country, unable to speak the language.
My father, then 22, made 80 cents an hour putting together window
screens in a Miami warehouse, trying to support his 16-year-old
pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two days after they landed in the United States, I was
born at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   My younger brother, Ricardo, and I know all of these things
because our parents made certain we knew our heritage.
</P>
<P>
   While other first-generation Americans have made similar
journeys to the birthplace of their parents, there is something
unique and riveting when that country is only 90 miles away and has
hidden behind the cloak of communism for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   So, while it is baseball that brings me to Cuba, it is human
drama that will generate my stories from here. &QL;

RED WINGS MAKE MOVES, BUT DO THEY MAKE PROGRESS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the tunnel vision world of Detroit Red Wings hockey,
yesterday undoubtedly was viewed as another banner day _ third
banner of a series, if you're scoring along at home.
</P>
<P>
   This was deja vu, all over again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   This was like getting Larry Murphy from Toronto two years ago _
only better.
</P>
<P>
   This was like getting Jamie Macoun and Dmitri Mironov last year
_ only better.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, the heretofore fluttering Red Wings again struck
at the trade deadline and armed themselves with three tough, solid
and experienced hands for the upcoming playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They're as good as the rival Stars now, Red Wings fans will
chirp, after being conspicuously quiet all season.
</P>
<P>
   As good, maybe _ but better?
</P>
<P>
   First, let me see defenseman Ulf Samuelsson play. Samuelsson,
acquired from the New York Rangers, has a broken foot and will be
out at least another two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Let me see how Chris Chelios, a nine-time All-Star and perennial
top dog in Chicago, fits in on a team already brimming with
pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Let me see how the defending champion Wings handle this, this
sudden infusion of ... of ... slow, old guys _ or are they wily,
hungry veterans?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, up in Detroit, they were worried. They had pondered
that disappointing 34-30-6 record and concluded that the Red Wings
were swimming upstream. Coach Scotty Bowman's team has been giving
away third-period leads like dinner mints.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings had a 3-2 lead in the third period against Phoenix a
week ago and ended up losing, 4-3. They had a 4-2 lead on national
TV Sunday against Philadelphia and ended up losing, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Their goaltending has been erratic. Their record away from Joe
Louis Arena (15-19-4) has been less than modest.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. These were deals designed to shake up the
complacent Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   But shake the Stars? The assumption would be that the Stars
weren't wary of the three-time champs to begin with. Their recent
words have suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had expressed more than a passing interest in
Samuelsson and in Wendel Clark, whom the Red Wings acquired from
Tampa Bay. The former is injured and also becomes an expensive,
unrestricted free agent on July 1. The latter was the Lightning's
leading scorer, but didn't yesterday's transactions suggest that
the Stars rated Buffalo's quicker Derek Plante as a better fit?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars needed more team speed, and that concern was amply
addressed by dealing for Plante and Benoit Hogue. The price for
winger Clark was not lavish _ a backup goalie and two draft picks.
And given that Stars general manager Bob Gainey had already talked
with Tampa Bay GM Jacques Demers over the Hogue deal, it doesn't
sound like a Clark trade simply slipped through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The other two Detroit trades _ for Chelios and for Samuelsson _
are more interesting from Stars fans' standpoints. The deals were
consummated for a talented young defenseman, Anders Eriksson, and a
bunch of high draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   To the Stars, who know the echo that can come from a President's
Trophy, draft choices are not exactly currency to be coveted.
Surely, they had as much to offer to the Blackhawks and Rangers
that the Red Wings did.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit immediately extended Chelios' contract by two years to
2002, when the defenseman will be 40 years old. Already deep and
young in that position, the Stars couldn't promise Chelios
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock says the team discovered that it takes
time to blend in new faces, new personalities. ``Six weeks _ one
and a half months _ seems to be the pattern,'' Hitchcock had said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chelios and Clark also would have taken playing time from ...
who? Some adjustments would have had to be made. The fragile
chemistry _ it's all fragile at NHL playoff time _ would have had
to be tinkered with.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings clearly felt it was worth rolling the dice. Now,
they will be in the hunt, Detroit fans were saying yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Stars already figured that.

ARCO TO TEST A CLEANER DIESEL FUEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. says it has developed a cleaner diesel
fuel for trucks and other large vehicles that will soon be tested
on the road in California, the state that has led the nation in
pushing oil companies to develop cleaner-burning fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The new fuel, developed by an ARCO research unit, has reduced
sulfur, nitrogen oxides and soot by substantial amounts in limited
tests, which are to be broadened in the spring, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Except in California, only modest steps have been taken so far
to clean up the emissions from the nation's truck fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Cars have long had catalytic converters, which have made huge
cuts in emissions. And in recent years, the introduction of
cleaner-burning fuels have further reduced pollution. Yet,
diesel-powered trucks have so far seen few controls.
</P>
<P>
   California, which has had worse pollution problems than most
other regions of the country, required the use of less-polluting
diesel fuel in 1993. The Environmental Protection Agency has
required lower sulfur content since 1996 in diesel fuels
nationwide, though the federal regulations are less stringent than
California's.
</P>
<P>
   However, California may seek to further reduce emissions in
diesel fuel of sulfur, particulates commonly known as soot and
nitrogen oxides that are believed to contribute to the formation of
smog.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating moves by the state, ARCO developed the new fuel on
its own. In early testing on a small number of vehicles, the fuel
reduced particulates by 13 percent, nitrogen oxides by 3 percent
and sulfates, the end product from burning sulfur in fuel, by 97
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, about 7 million gallons of the fuel will be
produced at its refinery in Carson, Calif., south of Los Angeles.
It will be tested by a fleet of 150 trucks, school buses and other
vehicles with diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, California is projected to have 740,000
diesel-powered vehicles on the road. While these will make up no
more than 3 percent of the overall number of vehicles in the state,
they emit roughly 25 percent of the nitrogen oxide and 70 percent
of the particulates produced, according to the California Air
Resources Board.

IN TENNIS, BEAUTY IS NO LONGER SLEEPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boosters of women's professional tennis could deny up and down
that the future of their sport depends on the glamour of the game's
biggest stars. These are the best female athletes in the world,
they could argue, then go on to cite their grace, their power,
their speed.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want to watch, especially with several intriguing
rivalries budding and the caliber of play rising?
</P>
<P>
   So, OK, Anna (Kournikova) stirred the passions of young men
around the world with her model-like looks. And, OK, Venus and
Serena (Williams) were seen stylin' in ``Vogue'' and popping off
like Charles Barkley to the media. But, ah, the game, that was the
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that was, last year. Right there on the cover of ``GQ'',
wearing a flashy, form-fitting white dress, was the world's No. 1
player and the sweetheart of the women's game, Martina Hingis,
smiling under the headline: ``The Champ is a Vamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the girl was loving it. And so, too, perhaps, were
those involved in the business side of women's tennis, the
companies and promoters who hope to use the personality and appeal
of Hingis, Kournikova, the Williams sisters and other stars to
create a mega-marketing machine for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, sports has to be viewed as
entertainment,'' explained WTA vice president Joe Favorito. ``These
are women who look pretty good and who are products of their
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In women's tennis, Favorito added, glamour ``was overlooked and
under used for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   The WTA bills itself as the largest and most lucrative women's
professional sport and cites $40 million-plus in yearly tournament
prize money, 3.7 million annual tournament attendance and expanding
worldwide television coverage to make its case.
</P>
<P>
   One of its premier events, the $1.95 million Lipton
Championships concludes this weekend in Key Biscayne, Fla., where
last year's final may have showed off the future of the sport with
Venus Williams defeating Kournikova in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   But the sport, while more popular internationally, remains a
sporting afterthought in America. The WTA visits only a few U.S.
markets each year, including Oklahoma City last month, and its
events generally earn mediocre, at best, TV ratings. Further, the
WTA still lacks a major tour title sponsor, its secondary
sponsorships are not up to par compared to other sports, and many
of its events aren't even on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a marketing standpoint, we are at ground zero of a five-
to seven-year plan,'' Favorito acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, relying on the glamour of the game's stars
only makes sense, said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports, a
Chicago sports marketing company that brings athletes and sponsors
together in endorsement deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early stages of revamping women's tennis \Rthe emphasis
on glamour\S is the right move, and the only move,'' Bob Williams
said. ``They've got to recapture sports fans' attention, and this
is the quickest way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glamour, observed CBS Sports executive Rob Correa, ``gets tennis
exposure in places it hasn't been seen before.'' But, he added,
``it's not a cure.'' Instead, Correa said, the women's game will
grow because of the strength of its personalities, the presence of
American stars and the depth of competition on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The WTA took a major step forward in the glamorization of the
game last year when it sold for $120 million its worldwide TV
rights for the next nine years to Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.
The man behind ``Pretty Woman,'' Milchan hopes to use tennis'
pretty women as the lure to attract rich broadcast deals across the
world and bring viewers to their sets.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-promoting tennis' stars by having them make cameo
appearances in movies is just one possibility. So is running tennis
promotional clips called ``trailers'' in movie theaters before film
showings, or attaching them to videocassette movies sold or rented
for home use. Also, movie scenes now set in basketball arenas might
be written to take place on tennis courts. There may even be the
equivalent of golf's successful Skins Game, or some sort of
All-Star Weekend competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the connections to Hollywood,'' said Favorito of
Milchan. ``This will be a great promotional vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Amanda Coetzer and Lori McNeil said they
generally are on board with the changing Hollywood image of their
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a product of the times,'' said McNeil, a Texan and
a veteran of the women's tour. ``You're seeing this in all sports,
like the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   There are concerns, however, that the glamorization has gotten
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   One case in point: Monique Viele, a promising 14-year-old
player, was described in a press release this way: ``Looks more
like a supermodel than a tennis player. Her long, lean, tanned
muscular legs are both an attribute to her great looks and her
speed on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach incites some observers, including Mary Carillo, a
former professional player who is the top women's tennis analyst on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This glamour girl stuff, it's almost kiddie porn,'' Carillo
states. ``I hate it and I think it's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she adds, ``it's unnecessary. The best part of the
women's game is the tennis itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players also are uneasy with certain elements of the
marketing push.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skirts are getting shorter all the time,'' Monica Seles
said. ``As long as women's tennis doesn't become all about who's
wearing the shortest skirt, I'm OK with it. But this isn't
Hollywood.''

FOOD STAMP ERROR NOT TIED TO YEAR 2000, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A multimillion-dollar error in distributing food-stamp benefits
throughout New Jersey was not rooted in reprogramming computers to
fix a year 2000 flaw, as was first believed, but stemmed from an
overburdened computer memory, state officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the State Department of Human Services said it had
initially overestimated the amount of money involved and the number
of people whose accounts were credited with extra benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The computer error spat out $23 million in unexpected credits,
not $30 million, for 140,000 households, about 30,000 fewer than
first reported, said Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Food stamp recipients spent $5 million in benefits on Sunday and
Monday in a shopping rush before the problem was reversed about
3:30 p.m. on Monday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   State and Federal officials are weighing whether those who
collected their premature benefits will have to pay them back,
either by not getting any more payments until May or through future
deductions, or whether they will be allowed to keep the
computer-generated benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Most food-stamp recipients in New Jersey get their benefits by
sliding a magnetic card at the cash registers of grocery stores,
deducting each purchase from their monthly benefits. The cards are
administered by a private contractor in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the problem started on Saturday, when a state
analyst started the monthly run of the program that tells the
contractor how much credit to issue to each card.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that changes last year in the welfare
eligibility rules, including a five-year limit on receiving
benefits, and enhancements being developed by programmers on the
mainframe computer had required more memory.
</P>
<P>
   Adel Ebeid, chief technology officer for New Jersey, said the
mainframe usually runs at 89 percent of capacity, but on Saturday
was running at 92 percent, leaving insufficient memory to run the
food-stamp program.
</P>
<P>
   Since this had never happened before, the analyst decided to run
the program on a backup mainframe instead, Ebeid said. But in
transferring the files to the second computer, the analyst left off
the last digit of the date, typing in 03/20/199.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, not finding the last digit, automatically put in a
zero, reading the date as 1990, and credited April's food-stamp
benefits immediately, as if they were for April 1, 1990. Ebeid said
the regular mainframe would have caught the mistake but the backup
was not programmed to do that.
</P>
<P>
   State officials had recently made year 2000-related changes to
the main computer, and that was why they first suspected that that
was the cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   State officials refused to identify the analyst who left off the
9 or even to say whether the person remained on the payroll. ``We
consider it to be a terrible human mistake,'' said Ebeid, who said
the analyst involved had a reputation as a hard worker. ``I think
if you were in his shoes you would feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebeid said the mainframe computer had been reprogrammed so its
capacity could constantly be monitored and that there would be
enough memory on the third week of each month for the food-stamp
program to run.

FIRST GENERATION AMERI
 CAN VIEWS ISLAND PARENTS
 FLED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By PEDRO GOMEZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I woke up this morning in Havana, an alluring city I have
dreamed about all my life for one special reason _ if not for a
matter of days, it would have been my birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, I might still be there if not for my parents'
courageous journey in 1962 to the United States. The country opened
its arms to any oppressed Cuban during the early 1960s, a time when
communism was engulfing the island.
</P>
<P>
   My father and mother told me about their neighbor in Havana, the
one who had declared himself a member of the Communist Party. The
old man, as they remember him, mock ingly asked my young parents,
``Why are you leaving Cuba?''
</P>
<P>
   My mother, then pregnant with me, scornfully told him,
```Because I want this baby inside of me to know what it is to live
in a land that is free.'' The neighbor then told my mother that by
the time I reached kindergarten the world would be dominated by
communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget how I cried the day you went off to
kindergarten,'' my mother, Marta Elena, has told me often. ``I
remember every detail of that man's face and the exchange we had.
Leaving was absolutely the right decision, one we never looked back
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Miami, I often fantasized about what it would be
like to visit the land where my parents were born and one I came
within three weeks of seeing as my homeland. Now I will know.
</P>
<P>
   My parents and grandparents spoke so glowingly of Cuba's beauty
that it always seemed like an unreachable utopia. The luster of
what they recalled from the pre-Fidel Castro days of 1959 is no
doubt far different from its current state.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I come to visit the land of my heritage, which sits
only 90 miles from U.S. soil, with an open mind and open eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I will always consider Cuba my homeland along with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   My parents and I flew over Cuba on a trip from Miami to Panama
when I was 14. When the pilot told us over the loudspeaker that our
plane was flying directly over Cuba's interior, I remember how my
father and mother were brought to tears as they gazed out the
window and saw their homeland for the first time in 14 years. The
emotional pull was too much for them to contain them selves.
</P>
<P>
   My parents left for Miami after waiting nearly a year for their
visa waiver from the U.S. government. My father arrived just before
mid night at the local police station to stand in line for a call
at 3 p.m. the next day. He was third in line when my mother joined
him in the morn ing.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 500 people pressing against the doors, my parents
were among the fortunate 30 allowed entry to begin the final
processing for their departure from Cuba. Many Cubans repeated the
process, which took place five days a week for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   My parents have told me of the overwhelming emotions they experi
enced July 25, 1962, the day the government official showed up honk
ing the horn on his Czechoslovakian-made motorcycle to deliver the
pa perwork they had waited 11 months to receive.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcyclist, well known in all Cuban neighborhoods as the
sign of impending freedom back then, pro vided one of the final
obstacles for them to leave Cuba: The mandatory inventory of the
items in their home had to match the one taken 11 months earlier
when they applied for their exit.
</P>
<P>
   One missing item, and the request would have been denied. All
prop erty was now owned by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, like all who were leaving Cuba in those times, were
ridiculed by party members in their own neighborhood, being called
``gusa nos,'' or worms.
</P>
<P>
   My father and mother, simulta neously awaiting their exit papers
and my birth, went to Mount Carmel Catholic Church, where they had
married July 15, 1961, nearly every day to pray that I would not be
born in Cuba. If so, it would have meant applying for another visa
and pass port, either of which could take up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that if I was not born in Cuba my middle name would
be Jude, after the patron saint of lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   For their Pan Am flight from Havana to Miami, they acquired a
falsified letter from a doctor stating my mother was only six
months pregnant, not in her final month, when she would not have
been allowed to fly.
</P>
<P>
   She has often reminded me of how fellow countrymen harassed her
for not allowing her child to be born in Cuba, where they said he
could be raised and decide for himself if he should live there or
in the imperialist West.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment the U.S. government granting you permission
to leave your land but not before threatening that if you do not
return within 27 days you would be forever considered a traitor of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For a then-impressionable young couple with a baby on the way,
the torture of hearing those words reso nates to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the types of things a person can never forget,'' my
father, Pedro, told me last week. ``Even the tiniest details live
in my mind forever.''
</P>
<P>
   My parents' DC-6 arrived in Miami on July 29. They had exactly
three changes of clothing (including socks and undergarments) and
nothing else. They were not allowed to take money, jewelry or
photos out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived in a foreign country, unable to speak the language.
My father, then 22, made 80 cents an hour putting together window
screens in a Miami warehouse, trying to support his 16-year-old
pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two days after they landed in the United States, I was
born at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   My younger brother, Ricardo, and I know all of these things
because our parents made certain we knew our heritage.
</P>
<P>
   While other first-generation Ameri cans have made similar
journeys to the birthplace of their parents, there is something
unique and riveting when that country is only 90 miles away and has
hidden behind the cloak of communism for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   So, while it is baseball that brings me to Cuba, it is human
drama that will generate my stories from here. Pedro Gomez can be

<P>
   The long and short of it:
</P>
<P>
   __ I go on vacation and what do I miss? Corruption in boxing,
uncertainty for Los Angeles' NFL prospects, a wig-out by Dennis
Rodman, a first-round loss for UCLA, hotheaded behavior by Kevin
Brown and an Angels pitcher's arm injury. In other words, no news.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Dodgers have problems _ left-handed relief, Todd
Hundley's elbow, Gary Sheffield's head. Only about 29 other teams
have worse.
</P>
<P>
   __ Twelve different major-league franchises (out of 30) have
played in the past 10 World Series. Twelve different Division I
universities (out of 300-plus) have played in the past 10 NCAA
basketball finals. Since baseball's economic structure is roundly
criticized for allowing only a few fat cats to win, why does
everybody say the NCAA tournament is great because ``the
Cinderellas have a chance''?
</P>
<P>
   __ The little guys do have a chance to win a couple of games,
just not to go all the way. Gonzaga's enrollment: 3,950. Smallest
school to win the NCAA title in the post-Wooden era: Villanova
(1985), enrollment 10,019.
</P>
<P>
   __ If sports fans have a ``so-what'' attitude about the Olympic
payoffs scandal, one reason is that the Games' wholesome image
faded long ago, gone the way of true amateurism and competing for
the love of sport.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last year when I walked into the main hallway at Dodgertown
in Vero Beach, Fla., the first people I saw were Peter O'Malley and
Bill Russell. This year it was a guy carrying a tray of soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Besides that, none of the Dodgertown magic was missing in the
first full spring training with Fox in charge. Maybe it really is
the place that's special, and the baseball people are
interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   __ Happiest line in the Dodgers' 1999 media guide: ``Organist .
. . Nancy Bea Hefley.'' We Foxophobes thought she'd be replaced
with a rock 'n' roll deejay by now.
</P>
<P>
   __ Here's why it's ludicrous to base your MVP vote on whose team
made the playoffs: If Kerry Wood's arm injury had occurred a year
ago, then Sammy Sosa's Cubs would have been .500, and Mark McGwire
would have been the MVP. Right?
</P>
<P>
   __ Wood, Matt Morris, Paul Wilson, Nomar Garciaparra . . . How
many more elbow injuries would there have been this spring WITHOUT
the stupendous advances in the fields of athletic training and
medicine in recent decades?
</P>
<P>
   __ Then there's Jason Dickson's shoulder: If the Angels can't
overcome this, they weren't going to win anyway. In two
major-league seasons, Jason's opponents are hitting .294.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hope this guy has sense of humor: The Cubs' executive vice
president of business operations is Mark McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   __ What does it mean when the Galaxy draws just 17,000 fans for
its season opener, while soccer fans apparently are forking over
$19.95 for the cablecast of an England-Poland European Championship
qualifying match Saturday at 7 a.m.? It means quality and
significance still matter.
</P>
<P>
   __ The cable sports expansion has created the phenomenon of the
timeless event. A NASCAR race, a Forum boxing card and a USC
baseball game were on TV Tuesday afternoon. I'm guessing they
weren't shown live. Why not an occasional graphic explaining when
and where the events took place and what was at stake? I'd be more
likely to keep watching.
</P>
<P>
   __ How many of the movie stars who sat on their hands when Elia
Kazan received his lifetime-achievement Oscar also believe Pete
Rose should be in the Baseball Hall of Fame? It's the same debate,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   __ The Lakers are 5-0 in a revealing statistical category that I
just made up: They've won five road games against teams with
better-than-.500 records, and they've yet to blow a home game
against a team that came in at .500 or worse. Here's how some other
NBA teams fared: Utah, 4-0; Sacramento, 3-0 (!); Indiana, Miami and
Milwaukee, 3-1; Clippers, 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   __ A connection between $1 million in late bets on Evander
Holyfield and the inaccurate judging in his fight with Lennox
Lewis? Sounds far-fetched. Gamblers would have received higher odds
by betting on Lewis. And if the men in the white ties really knew
how the evening would turn out, they could have got 30-1 by
wagering it would be a draw.
</P>
<P>
   __ If you're not interested in the Kentucky Derby this year, it
won't be for lack of intrigue. The May 1 race is likely to be the
first Derby since 1984 to include more than one filly. It could be
the first ever to include more than two. The mystery horse is
Worldly Manner, who's being trained in unorthodox fashion in his
owner's native Dubai. Worldly Manner won a 1[-mile ``trial race'
there Sunday in a reported 1:46.59 _ almost too fast to be
believed.
</P>
<P>
   __ Errant-cliche watch: AP says Joe Torre ``could be sidelined
as long as 12 weeks.'' Isn't a manager SUPPOSED to be on the
sideline?
</P>
<P>
   __ Sports that could use more extensive media coverage: Soccer,
horse racing, judo, water skiing, archery, pie-eating, field
hockey, cricket, Frisbee, checkers, demolition derby, darts, frog
jumping, phone-booth stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sports that couldn't: women's college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   __ OK if Roberto Benigni makes himself at home in Hollywood, but
please say he won't become a Lakers fan.

KOURNIKOVA IS ENAMORED WITH TENNIS, NOT ADORATION 
WITH WTA GLAMOUR
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY - Joseph Gulikers, brother David, and two teen-age
buddies were standing in line at a local indoor tennis court late
last month waiting for a chance to play with Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-born teen sensation was hitting balls with
schoolkids as part of a free tennis clinic associated with the
women's pro tournament being held up the road. Anybody in the
gathering of about 200 who showed up with a racket and a pair of
court shoes might get to hit a few with her.
</P>
<P>
   The boys had it all taken care of _ except for the racket and
shoes part.
</P>
<P>
   Doh!
</P>
<P>
   One of Anna's caretakers, hip to their clothes and perhaps
suspicious of their intentions, made sure they didn't get near the
ponytailed blonde in the turquoise and black Adidas warmups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, we got run off,'' moaned a sheepish Travis Gaken, 18, one
of Gulikers' accomplices. ``There goes that.''
</P>
<P>
   As four enamored young Oklahomans could tell you, it's not easy
getting close to Anna Kournikova. And when you're 17, with looks,
wealth, talent and fame like Kournikova, you tend to question most
everyone's motives.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as the leading glamour girl of women's tennis,
everybody wants something from you, don't they? An autographed
ball, an interview soundbite, the precious memory of a brush with
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Kournikova's Oklahoma fans were left with a
practiced smile and a flitting glimpse, as by a Hollywood starlet
making her way into the theater at an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' a tour official said, sympathizing with Kournikova's
famed reticence, ``you can only smile so much. But she's a lot
better than she was six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City, at least, Kournikova smiled plenty, signed
dozens of autographs and made her appearances. She also played what
she called some ``A-plus'' quality tennis before taking ill and
being eliminated from the IGA Superthrift Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis, she suggested, is a lot more fun for her than the
fawning that follows her from tour stop to tour stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebrity status is something that comes with my job,''
Kournikova stated dryly when asked if she had had enough of this
fame thing. ``If I were wishing really really hard, I don't think I
could change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova lost yesterday in The Lipton Championships, a major
tournament where, last year, she registered her best tournament
finish ever in singles, making it to the finals before losing to
Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her protestations, Kournikova has hardly shied from
media or fan attention, whether by playing up her much-discussed
relationship with Detroit Red Wings star Sergei Fedorov, or by
wearing on-court outfits that some tennis insiders suggest are too
risque.
</P>
<P>
   She is defensive on this point of her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the women's tour,'' she said of the WTA. ``So women
should look like women. It doesn't mean because we are playing
sports we shouldn't look like women. It's a normal side of young
girls to want to be attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the criticism, Kournikova is wary of being
pinned down or penned in, even when the question is strictly about
tennis: What are your goals in the game, she is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't program anything,'' she said. ``If I say tomorrow I'm
going to be number one, and that doesn't happen, I look bad. My
goal is always to improve, to win a tournament \Rshe won the
Australian Open doubles this year, but never a WTA singles title\S.
To continue enjoying playing and having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Her approach to the game, under coach Pavel Slozil, is also more
polished. She might even be ready to translate her immense athletic
talent into a top 10 ranking, perhaps a singles championship.
</P>
<P>
   She has displayed a powerful serve, the speed to run down most
balls and tactical awareness. The shotmaking ability and the
quickness that allow her to blast winners from anywhere on the
court are in ample evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a terrific player,'' assesses Mary Carillo, a former
pro, now a TV tennis analyst. ``She wants to win very badly. She's
very hungry. I just wish people would spend more time talking about
her tennis.''

Mavericks guard Robert Pack endures injuries 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ One of the snazziest dressers on the Mavericks team is
point guard Robert Pack. Unfortunately for Pack, he has been
wearing suits during games more times than he cares to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, Pack had missed 179 of a possible 328
games over the previous four years because of an assortment of
injuries and surgeries. Now he's facing the drudgery of
rehabilitation once again.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview since slightly tearing his right
hamstring during a March 13 home game against Vancouver, Pack said
yesterday that he actually injured his hamstring during a March 10
practice session at the Tom Landry Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting and didn't get to go through our regular
routine where we stretch and warm up,'' Pack said. ``We stretched
and kind of jumped into our practice, and throughout that practice
I wasn't completely warm, and I kind of tweaked it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the injury, Pack played 16 minutes the next night against
Orlando and contributed six points and five assists while
responding to treatment by the Mavericks' medical staff. Two days
later against Vancouver, however, his hamstring gave way, and Pack
has now missed the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   For Pack, going through rehabilitation period is becoming too
common. But the eight-year veteran takes solace in the fact that,
unlike in three of his past four injury-riddled seasons, he should
return to action before this season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think it's strange to you for me to be hurt, it's even
stranger to me to have to go through this,'' Pack said. ``I'm just
happy that it's not a season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier for me to go through this rehab and work
hard, knowing that I have a chance to come back. That's the way I'm
keeping myself positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pack missed the final 44 games after surgery to
repair a torn ligament in his right thumb. Three years ago, he was
sidelined for the final 51 games of the season after damaging the
peroneal nerve in his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   And during the 1994-95 season, Pack was forced to the bench for
the last 30 games after having arthroscopic surgery to remove loose
cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Before his latest injury two weeks ago, Pack was in the middle
of one of the best seasons in a Mavericks uniform. As the backup to
starting point guard Steve Nash, Pack was averaging 9.4 points and
3.3 assists per game in only 19.6 minutes while speeding up the
offense with his high-octane way of pushing the ball up the court.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Michael Finley said the Mavericks miss Pack's ability to
change the game's tempo by driving for easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a guy like Robert who has been playing well,
for him to go down it's definitely going to hurt our team,'' Finley
said. ``We now only have one true point guard on the team in
Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pack said he doesn't sit around saying `why me?' Neither does he
feel sorry for himself that injuries continue to interrupt his
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed me with this talent and the ability to play
this game and do something I love, and I do love the game of
basketball,'' Pack said. ``If injuries happens, I know He won't
give me anything that I can't handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another thing I'm faced with, and I'll handle it
and get over it, and I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pack longs for the day when he can play an entire season
without an injury. He also longs for the day when he can shed his
suit for a Mavericks uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of wearing those suits,'' Pack said. ``The coaching
staff is supposed to be wearing suits and I'm supposed to be in a
uniform.''

AIR CRASHES BLAMED ON RUDDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ Two horrifying plane crashes and a
disturbingly close call were caused by a rudder malfunction that
suddenly turned Boeing 737s in the wrong direction from that
commanded by the pilots, air crash investigators argued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board investigators
painstakingly dismantled suggestions by The Boeing Co. that pilot
error was the most likely cause of the 1994 crash of USAir Flight
427 near Pittsburgh, and that a freakish meteorological phenomenon
caused the 1991 crash of United Airlines Flight 585 as it
approached the Colorado Springs airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the NTSB investigators will urge the board to
adopt a 500-page report containing 34 proposed findings about what
caused the crash of Flight 427, and 10 proposed changes to the 737
_ the world's most-used commercial jet.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations call for improved flight data recorders on
planes, additional pilot training and ask that changes to the 737
rudder design be considered. It would be up to the Federal Aviation
Administration to make any recommendations mandatory for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the FAA defended their past efforts to improve the
safety of the 737 and said they will weigh any recommendations
after the meeting concludes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NTSB's analysis presents anything we did not already
know, or have overlooked, we will assess the safety benefits of
taking further action, and make our decisions accordingly,'' said
Charles Higgins, Boeing vice president of airplane safety and
airworthiness. ``Boeing's commitment to the 737, and all of our
other airplanes, remains the same: when the facts show us an
opportunity to make it even safer, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said Boeing has already made design improvements, added
maintenance checks and helped develop pilot training in an effort
to prevent future 737 accidents.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has also maintained that its airplanes were not
to blame in the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, NTSB staff investigators outlined the evidence
that the two crashes were caused by a rudder problem on the 737,
and that the accidents could not have been caused by pilot error or
weather.
</P>
<P>
   And the investigators criticized the airline industry's top
regulator, the FAA, for not following all of the board's previous
recommendations for changes to the 737.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust that when we finish, you and all the American people
will believe that everything possible has been done to determine
what caused this tragedy,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall told an audience
that included 100 friends and relatives of the 132 people killed
when USAir Flight 427 crashed near Aliquippa, Penn., on Sept. 8,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of Boeing's pilot error theory delighted some
relatives of the Flight 427 crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are appreciative of what the board is trying to
accomplish,'' said Ernest Germano of Elmira, N.Y., brother of the
pilot of Flight 427. ``They've come to see what Pete Germano was.
... We feel better now than we did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Germano's 737-300 was approaching the Pittsburgh airport at
6,000 feet in clear skies when the rudder mysteriously deflected to
the left, causing the plane to corkscrew into the ground at 300
miles per hour. It exploded into tiny bits. The rudder is the
moveable part on a plane's tail and is used to control side to side
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to understand what happened that day, the
investigators have linked the USAir crash to two other incidents
involving older model 737s.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1991, United Airlines Flight 585 was approaching
Colorado Springs for landing when the plane suddenly rolled and
crashed, killing all 25 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   And in June 1996, Eastwind Flight 517 _ a 737-200 just like the
Colorado Springs jet _ was approaching the Richmond, Va., airport
when it began to roll. The rudder did not respond normally. In that
case, the pilots were able to regain control of the plane and land
safely.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's hearing, NTSB staff laid the blame for all three
incidents on a rare phenomenon called ``rudder reversal,'' in which
the rudder on the Boeing 737 swings in a direction opposite that
commanded by the pilot. The phenomenon, while first observed in the
1960s by manufacturers of a rudder valve, was not recognized by
regulators until the crashes of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has offered alternate theories for the two crashes and
the Eastiwind incident.
</P>
<P>
   The company suggested that the USAir crash and the Eastwind
problem were caused when pilots incorrectly pushed on the wrong
rudder pedal, while the United crash was caused by an extraordinary
atmospheric disturbance known as a wind rotor.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's theories were rejected by NTSB staff.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that in the case of the United crash, the weather
event cited by Boeing would have had to have been 36 times stronger
than any similar ``wind rotor'' ever recorded in that Rocky
Mountain city.
</P>
<P>
   United Flight 585 is one of only four crashes that the
30-year-old safety board has not been able to find a probable cause
for. It may decide in its final report to be adopted Wednesday that
the probable cause of the crash of the United plane was the 737
rudder.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastwind incident, Boeing's theory would have required
the pilot to step lightly on the right rudder pedal. But both the
pilot and the first officer insist that in reality the pilot placed
the entire weight of his body on the left pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Brenner, the chairman of the NTSB Human Performance
Group, said Boeing's theory defies common sense in the USAir crash.
It would have meant the pilot pushed on the left rudder and held it
down for 20 seconds as the plane plunged to the ground. Brenner
said normal pilot response to the incident would have been to step
on the right rudder, and then to remove the foot while grappling
with the wheel in an effort to save the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why (would the pilot) enter a full rudder in the wrong
direction, why (would he) maintain full rudder when control was
being visibly lost, and why does the other pilot allow it?''
Brenner asked.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of its 4{-year investigation, the NTSB has
made 20 safety recommendations for the 737, and the FAA has ordered
a variety of changes to the plane. The NTSB believes it discovered
the technical cause of the rudder reversal in 1996, and the FAA
ordered a redesign of a hydraulic valve that moves the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about the 737 rudder remain. The NTSB staff said
there have been more than 100 incidents of flight control problem
caused by the rudder. In many of those incidents, pilots reported a
mysterious pulsing or kicking sensation in the rudder pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a Metrojet 737 experienced an unintended rudder
movement last month and made an emergency landing after the pilots
regained control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crashes of USAir Flight 427 and United Airlines Flight 585
in Colorado Springs have raised questions in many minds about the
design and operation of the 737's rudder system,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these concerns, NTSB officials took pains to defend the
safety of the Boeing 737, which is the world's most popular
jetliner, with more than 3,000 now in service.
</P>
<P>
   The 737 has been in use since the 1967, and is expected to be
used well into the next century, Hall said. Hall said he plans to
hold hearings in Seattle to scrutinize how the 737 is certified for
flight by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB staff outlined some, but not all, of the recommendations
the board will consider Wednesday.
</P>

   The staff and board were most exercised about changes they want
in the flight data recorders aboard the 737. They said better data
would help them solve future accidents, and they criticized the FAA
for not requiring faster action on this issue. The flight data
recorders on the USAir, United, Eastwind and Metrojet planes were
too primitive to measure rudder movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fail to understand how something so good can be so
sluggishly responded to,'' said NTSB board member George Black Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The staff also said it will recommend further specialized pilot
training for dealing with rare flight control malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   The staff also suggested that perhaps the FAA should require
that planes travel slightly faster when certain maneuvers are being
performed to prevent a loss of control that was experienced in the
USAir flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of design changes to the rudder, the staff was vague
about its recommendations, but several staffers hinted that they
would like to see a system in which the plane might have two of the
hydraulic power control units that translate the pilot's pedal
action into actual movement of the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a need for greater redundancy in the
system,''said Bernard Loeb, director of the NTSB's office of
aviation safety. ``Despite a lot of the good things that have been
done, more needs to be done.''

DOG

   LOS ANGELES _ A pit bull attacked an 85-year-old woman and her
Lhasa apso Tuesday before an off-duty LAPD detective shot the dog
to death, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose identity was not released, was treated for
bites to her hand, police said. Her dog was treated for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 a.m. pit bull attack in the Panorama City community of Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley was the latest in a series citywide
that has prompted widespread abandonment of the pets at animal
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to cut the number of stray dogs, Los Angeles City
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas proposed that all dog and cat owners
be required to spay or neuter their pets or pay a higher fee to be
listed as animal breeders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now common to see stray dogs roaming the streets, many
of which are injured, sick, hungry or running (in) packs,''
Ridley-Thomas said. ``They frighten residents, attack humans and
other dogs and pose a threat to the public safety of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for the Board of Animal Service Commissioners
to report back in 45 days with proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The department killed nearly 60,000 cats and dogs in 1997, an
estimated 44,000 of which were strays.
</P>
<P>
   The humane community generally agrees with the proposal, said
Gini Barrett, a member of the Animal Services Commission and
director of the Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is cutting-edge thinking,'' Barrett said. ``This really
says the city is going to take pet overpopulation and animal safety
very seriously. There are a number of responsible pet owners who
will object to this, but it will be up to them to make their
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Panorama City attack, police said shooting the dog was
the only way to stop the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times officers try to use pepper spray on a dog
first, and resort to deadly force later,'' said Foothill Division
Capt. Ken Garner. ``In a situation of life or death like this could
have been, the deadly force was warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie David, Animal Regulation spokeswoman, said the northeast
San Fernando Valley gets a special enforcement twice a week,
catching about 28 dogs each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several packs of dogs there that feed on small
animals and discarded food. It's springtime; we'll see them a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Phongmai, 25, who lives near where the woman was mauled,
said other attacks have occurred recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I keep my dog in the back,'' Phongmai said. ``They
are very dangerous. Two pit bulls attacked another neighbor of mine
last year, and my dad and I tried to help get them apart.''
