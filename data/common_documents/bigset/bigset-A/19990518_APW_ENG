<HEADLINE> Imus Withdraws Water Bid for Ranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M.(AP) -- Don Imus has withdrawn an application to  
transfer water rights to his proposed ranch for sick children. 
</P>
<P>
	The shock jock had wanted to transfer rights to 32.5 million  
gallons a year from a parcel in the village of San Miguel to his 
ranch near Ribera, 40 miles from Santa Fe. But the state rejected 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Imus said last week the ranch would go forward with or without  
the water, which he had hoped would allow the children to grow 
alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch already has the right to drill wells on the property,  
and Imus said that should provide all the water he needs.

<HEADLINE> Dell Profits Jump 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- First-quarter profits for Dell Computer Corp., the  
nation's largest direct seller of computers, increased 42 percent 
on an expected rise in sales, meeting analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell said Tuesday it earned $434 million, or 16 cents per  
diluted share, in the quarter ended April 30, up from $305 million, 
or 11 cents per diluted share in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits met analysts' expectations, according to a survey by  
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell made its announcement after the close of the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, where shares rose 81 1/4 cents to $44.06 1/4. In after-hours 
trading, the shares fell to $41.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in stock price was likely due to Dell's meeting  
expectations, instead of exceeding them, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not like Dell,'' said Cody Acree, who follows the  
computer seller for Southwest Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, which sells a majority of its computers to businesses,  
governments and other public institutions, said sales through the 
company's Web site surpassed $18 million per day during the 
quarter, accounting for 30 percent of overall revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue exceeded $5.5 billion, up 41 percent from the year-ago  
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growth rates are a little better, but they're definitely at  
the low end of the range Michael Dell was trying to get back to,'' 
said Acree of earlier goals sat by the company's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	According to CEO Dell, prospects for computer system demand  
remain strong for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``For companies with effective, efficient business models, this  
industry remains healthy,'' said Dell. ``We continue to see 
significant opportunity for expanding our business profitably.''

<HEADLINE> Researcher: Depression Is Treatable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A combination of a special psychotherapy and  
an antidepressant was effective against long-standing depression, a 
condition generally considered difficult to treat, a researcher 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were stunned'' that 85 percent of patients who completed 12  
weeks of treatment showed a good response or even remission, said 
Dr. Martin B. Keller of the Brown University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The work shows ``chronic depressive disorders are treatable,''  
he told a news conference. Keller is to report the initial findings 
of the study Wednesday at the American Psychiatric Association's 
annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, carried out at a dozen medical centers, was paid for  
by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The company makes Serzone, the 
antidepressant used in the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said it would be reasonable to study whether a drug other  
than Serzone would work as well in combination with the 
psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert C. Schulberg, a psychologist at the University of  
Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was familiar with the results, 
called them impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does point to a direction to be pursued,'' he said in a  
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are continuing the study to determine the long-term  
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The study began with 681 people who had depression for at least  
two years. Half the participants had been ill for more than 20 
years, and most had never had an adequate attempt at treatment, 
Keller said. Their average age was the early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:  
Serzone only, psychotherapy only, or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychotherapy, called the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis  
System of Psychotherapy, was developed especially for chronic 
depression but is not widely used. Patients focus on specific 
troublesome situations, learn how to solve their problems in 
relating to other people and take responsibility for the 
consequences of their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants assigned to the psychotherapy got 16 to 20 sessions  
over the 12-week treatment period. Those assigned to Serzone, also 
called nefazodone, took it twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 12 weeks, about 25 percent of patients dropped out of  
each of the three treatment groups, a low loss for such studies. Of 
those who remained in the study after 12 weeks, 55 percent who'd 
taken Serzone alone and 52 percent of those who'd gotten 
psychotherapy alone showed a response on a standard scale measuring 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who received the combined treatment showed an 85 percent  
response rate. 
</P>
<P>
	A response meant a remission or a big enough improvement on the  
scale to be considered satisfactory. In this latter group, ``by no 
means are they all better,'' Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three treatment groups, about half the responders showed  
a remission. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulberg, the psychologist, said that to get results like those  
in the study, mental health providers would have to learn to do the 
special psychotherapy or otherwise make it available, monitor 
patient progress closely and alter the medication dose or course of 
psychotherapy accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Senate Salutes Late Admiral Nance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- James W. ``Bud'' Nance, a former rear admiral  
who left retirement to serve as a top aide to boyhood friend Sen. 
Jesse Helms, was remembered on the Senate floor Tuesday for his 
long career of public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., said Nance was ``a giant of a man fallen.'' Nance  
died last week at age 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance retired from the Navy in 1979 and served in the early  
1980s as assistant national security adviser in President Reagan's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, he served with a token salary of $4.53 a week as  
staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He had 
worked for the committee since 1991 and became its staff director 
after Republicans gained control of the chamber in 1994 and Helms 
took the chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates of both Helms and Nance suggested the retired admiral  
was a calming influence over the stubborn, sometimes unpredictable 
chairman. Helms, also 77, grew up a few blocks from Nance in 
Monroe, N.C., were elementary school classmates and remained 
lifelong friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance was the only one other than Helms' wife Dorothy ``who has  
ever been able to tell the chairman, `Enough, Jess. Slow down, 
Jess,''' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the committee's senior 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a decorated Navy pilot, noted that  
his father and grandfather -- both admirals -- worked with and 
respected Nance. ``He was unfailingly courteous, always considerate 
to others,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., former Navy secretary, noted ``a direct  
parallel between what he performed in the Navy and performed in the 
United States Senate. ... He was an officer and a gentleman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nance, who died May 11 from a form of leukemia, was to be buried  
Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice choked, Helms said ``a thousand memories crowded their  
way into my consciousness'' in the moments after he learned of 
Nance's death ``as I sat at my desk in silence and alone.''

<HEADLINE> Cancer Drug Urged for At-Risk Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The nation's largest group of cancer specialists  
suggested Tuesday that doctors consider prescribing the breast 
cancer drug tamoxifen to tens of millions of healthy women to help 
prevent the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation was issued by the American Society of  
Clinical Oncology at its annual medical meeting in Atlanta. It was 
based largely on earlier research showing that tamoxifen -- 
available since 1978 as a treatment for breast cancer -- can also 
cut women's risk of developing the disease almost in half. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said tamoxifen ``may be offered'' to women who  
have at least a 1.7 percent risk of getting breast cancer over the 
next five years. That is considered a modestly increased risk. 
</P>
<P>
	About 29 million women, or 20 percent of the U.S. female  
population, are in this category, including all women over age 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The cautiously worded statement was immediately criticized by  
some advocates for breast cancer patients. They said tamoxifen's 
health risks are too high for it to be routinely taken by healthy 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamoxifen can trigger hot flashes and increase the risk of other  
rare but more serious side effects, including uterine cancer and 
potentially fatal blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead authors of the statement said a woman's personal fear  
of breast cancer is perhaps the most important consideration in 
deciding whether to take the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not recommending that women take it. We are  
recommending that women be offered it,'' said Dr. Rowan T. 
Chlebowski of the University of California at Los Angeles. Even 
then, he said, the decision to use tamoxifen ``depends on a woman's 
actual risk and the importance of that risk to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Food and Drug Administration said tamoxifen could  
be promoted as a way to prevent the disease in those at elevated 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The hazardous side effects of tamoxifen have increased interest  
in a similar drug -- the osteoporosis medicine raloxifene, or Evista 
-- which also triggers blood clots but does not cause uterine 
cancer. At the meeting Tuesday, Dr. Jane Cauley of the University 
of Pittsburgh presented data on a follow-up of 7,705 women who took 
raloxifene or dummy pills in a bone fracture study. 
</P>
<P>
	After 40 months of follow-up, there were 54 cases of breast  
cancer. The risk was two-thirds lower in those getting raloxifene. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effectiveness and safety of longer-term use are  
uncertain,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chlebowski said the number of cancer cases in this and eight  
other raloxifene studies is too small to draw definite conclusions 
about the drug's effect on breast cancer. Although together they 
suggest that raloxifene cuts the risk about in half, he said more 
data are needed before the drug can be recommended routinely to 
prevent cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging a woman's breast cancer risk involves a complex formula  
that considers her age, race, history of breast abnormalities and 
biopsies and family history of the disease, as well as her age at 
first menstruation and first childbirth. The National Cancer 
Institute has already sent computer software for making this 
calculation to thousands of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinical oncology society committee that issued the new  
guidelines included four patient advocates. One of them, Helen 
Schiff of New York City, said she does not believe its 
recommendations are in women's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving a powerful drug to so many healthy women is a dangerous  
undertaking,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Susan Braun of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer  
Foundation in Dallas said women should, as a start, learn what 
their actual risk is. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actively encouraging women go to their physicians and  
have their risk level assessed,'' she said. ``Women both 
overestimate it and underestimate it.''

<HEADLINE> NATO: Serbs May Be Hiding Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO said Tuesday there is growing  
evidence that the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan 
Milosevic is digging up mass graves and trying to hide the evidence 
of war crimes against Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now indications that the Belgrade authorities are  
taking the international war crimes tribunal seriously,'' NATO 
spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters, 
referring to the U.N. court in The Hague, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO has reports that the Serbs have dug up mass graves  
near the Kosovo towns of Glogovac and Lipljan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The villagers of the locality were obliged to rebury the  
bodies in individual graves,'' Shea said. ``We also have reports of 
efforts to rebury bodies from mass graves at sites where NATO 
bombing has occurred, and also to rebury bodies in areas formerly 
controlled by the Kosovo Liberation Army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs, he said, are creating as many new mass graves as they  
are trying to destroy old ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Serbs really want to destroy the evidence, all of the  
evidence, then they are going to have to accumulate a lot of 
overtime,'' Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Scheffer, a U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes  
issues, also said the evidence was increasing that the Serbs have 
used ethnic Albanians as human shields during the NATO air campaign 
that began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``It complicates our military mission,'' added Maj. Gen. Walter  
Jertz, a NATO military spokesman who briefed reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said NATO continues to build up his forces in the region.  
He said 18 U.S. A-10 ``tankbusters'' were due to be deployed in 
Italy by Thursday, and that 72 F-15s and F-16s to be operational in 
Turkey by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have  
fled the country in the face of a military offensive by Serb army 
and special police forces since March. Others have been chased from 
their homes but remain in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the conflict, 90 percent of the 2.1 million Kosovo  
population was ethnic Albanian.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Lawyers Back in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet will be back in  
court next week to challenge the decision by Britain's top law 
enforcement official not to block Spain's attempt to extradite the 
former Chilean dictator. 
</P>
<P>
	A single High Court judge will hear arguments May 27 on whether  
to allow the 83-year-old general to challenge British Home 
Secretary Jack Straw's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain is trying to extradite Pinochet on charges he tortured  
opponents during his 17-year regime, which began after the Chilean 
armed forces overthrow the country's elected Marxist president, 
Salvador Allende, in a bloody 1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw ruled April 15 that even though the House of Lords had  
thrown out most of Spain's case against Pinochet, the remaining 
charges against the former dictator were serious enough to keep the 
extradition request alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers have submitted a 1,000-page document  
challenging Straw's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	It is thought that a key issue is whether any extraditable  
charges -- alleged offenses that could be prosecuted in both Spain 
and Britain -- survive from the original extradition request. 
</P>
<P>
	The law lords' ruling limited the alleged crimes for which the  
general could be extradited to torture charges dating from after 
December 1988, when Britain ratified the International Convention 
Against Torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that ruling, however, the Spanish judge leading the  
attempt to extradite Pinochet has added dozens of new torture 
allegations since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested on the Spanish warrant Oct. 16 in London  
while recuperating from back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	His case has crept slowly through the British legal system, with  
aspects considered and reconsidered by both the High Court and the 
House of Lords, Britain's top court of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The general remains confined to a rented mansion southwest of  
London under 24-hour police guard. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, a Chilean official said Tuesday that  
Spain's attempts to extradite Pinochet have not affected bilateral 
economic relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Chile the rules of the game for foreign investment are  
clear. ... There is no discrimination against any country,'' said 
Patricio Leiva, director of economic studies at the Chilean Foreign 
Ministry. He made his comments at a conference in Madrid, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain is the second most important foreign investor in Chile,  
after the United States, with leading companies in 
telecommunications, energy and the financial sector.

<HEADLINE> Student-Built Satellite in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A newly launched satellite built by Boston  
University students to create 3-D images of the outer part of the 
Earth's atmosphere was in danger of running out of power Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terriers satellite failed to fully orient its solar panel to  
face the sun and was relying on batteries that can last eight hours 
without recharging. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was ``potentially serious,'' the National  
Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers and an unrelated small defense communications satellite  
were launched late Monday on an Orbital Sciences Corp. Pegasus 
rocket dropped from a jumbo jet flying off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	All seemed well when the 274-pound Terriers made its first pass  
over the Boston University ground station at 7:07 a.m. EDT Tuesday. 
On the second pass about 1 1/2 hours later controllers noticed it was 
not properly oriented to the sun, NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third pass controllers sent commands to reorient the  
spacecraft. Whether the commands worked was not expected to be 
known until Wednesday morning, university spokeswoman Shauna 
LaFauci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers was developed under a NASA program to increase  
students' access to space. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the work on the satellite was done at Boston University  
and a ground station was established there so students could 
control the craft as it gathered data on the ionosphere, the region 
of electrically charged gases in the upper atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Penney To Outsource Credit Card Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J. C. Penney Company, Inc.'s stock shot up  
more than 14 percent today after the retailer announced plans to 
outsource its credit card business and to offer a separate stock 
for its Eckerd drugstore business. 
</P>
<P>
	Both moves, to be completed by the fourth quarter, are expected  
to reduce debt and strengthen the balance sheet of the Plano, 
Texas-based retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Penney reported that it first-quarter earnings  
topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. The company, however, 
acknowledged that its department store business still needs further 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Penney's stock was up $.6.56 1/4 at $52.25 in morning trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive James Oesterreicher said Penney  
already has begun discussions with a number of third-party credit 
card providers that are interested in running its credit card 
operations and buying its credit card receivables portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its Eckerd stock initiative, the company will have an  
initial public offering of about 20 percent of a tracking stock for 
the drugstore business. The new stock will specifically reflect the 
performance of Eckerd and will not include Penney's other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drugstore tracking stock keeps our businesses together,  
with a single existing JCPenney Board, while giving us the ability 
to tap the cross-marketing opportunities and other synergies that 
exist among the customer base of our various retailing formats,'' 
Penney chairman and chief executive James Oesterreicher said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In its earnings report issued today, Penney reported net income  
of $167 million, or 61 cents a share, in the first quarter, 
compared with $174 million, or 64 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $7.57 billion, up from $7.05 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	While its profits were better-than-expected, the moderately  
priced department store continues to lose shoppers to discount 
chains, which offer a wider selection and better prices, and the 
trendier, lower-priced specialty stores such as Old Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	Penney operates nearly 1,150 department stores in the U.S.,  
Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Chile. In addition, the company operates 
21 Renner department stores in Brazil. Eckerd Drugstores is 
comprised of nearly 2,900 drugstores.

<HEADLINE> Bank One Bets on Internet for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Banks expect someday the walls will come tumbling  
down as they move to become virtual institutions offering an array 
of services over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Bank One Corp., the nation's fifth-largest bank,  
took the bold step Tuesday of announcing that they're placing their 
bets on the Web as the surest future source of profits, giving up 
the industrywide practice of mergers and consolidation for growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow your customer,'' Bank One chief executive  
John McCoy said. ``I've always loved this business for the last 20 
years, but we aren't going to be like that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related announcement, First Union Corp., the sixth-largest  
bank, announced it is realigning its senior executive team and 
appointing an 18-year bank veteran to take charge of its electronic 
commerce businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	David Carroll, now president of First Union of Florida, will  
become executive vice president in charge of Internet and 
``alternative delivery channels'' -- businesses that the bank called 
a key corporate priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll has been credited with leading First Union's ``Future  
Bank'' strategy that offers banking by telephone, computer and 
automatic tellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to fully leverage the various skills we have  
throughout First Union to build an Internet strategy and capability 
second to none in the financial services arena,'' said John 
Georgius, First Union president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking executives across the nation are tentatively exploring  
their options for virtual banking. The explosion of Internet use 
and the rise of such Wall Street darlings as the retailer 
Amazon.com and Charles Schwab Corp.'s online brokerage has many 
re-examining whether the concept of acquiring more branches, 
automated teller machines and banking satellites is the way to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	One Internet bank, Netbank Inc. of Alpharetta, Ga., has become a  
major player in just a year. With just 42 employees, the company 
had profits last year of $4.5 million on sales of $18.8 million. 
Because of its low overhead, it has signed up thousands of 
customers by offering higher interest rates on CDs and other 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Bank One was created last year through the  
combination of First Chicago NBD Corp. and Banc One Corp. It has 
about 2,000 branches in 14 states, mostly in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	It recently launched www.bankone.com, a site offering customers  
the chance to open and review accounts, receive and pay bills 
online, apply for credit cards and loans, invest online, buy 
insurance and get news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The features make it one of the most comprehensive banking sites  
in the nation, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers them the opportunity to provide their services  
anywhere (in the world),'' Salomon Smith Barney analyst Henry 
Dickson said. ``Right now, that might not be the most profitable 
way of doing things, but it's something they have to offer because 
it's another way to reach customers who want convenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One is betting it can vault into national consciousness by  
signing long-term agreements with Internet portal companies such as 
Yahoo! and Excite Inc. Portals are the entry points for users to 
venture onto the Internet. The agreements guarantee that Web 
surfers looking for Internet banking on those sites will be 
directed to Bank One. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One also expects to sign up additional credit card  
customers online. It will generate additional revenue from customer 
fees for online banking. And it will collect fees from companies 
that will sell insurance and other products on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bank One merger was completed late last year, McCoy  
said it would be at least 18 months before he considered acquiring 
another bank. Even after that period is up, an acquisition may not 
be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what is happening on the Internet, I'm not sure that we  
will ever have to buy another bank,'' he said. ``There may come a 
time where we don't need to provide the brick and mortar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under First Union's ``Future Bank'' program, for example,  
customers use a telephone or computer to get information about 
account balances, advise whether checks have cleared, or transfer 
money between accounts. Customers also can apply for loans by phone 
or get help with investments. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union has about 2,400 branches in 12 states, mostly on the  
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it's too early to tell just how much banks can  
profit from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot will depend on how efficiently they offer products and  
whether increased competition will cause fees to fall and thereby 
lower profits, they say. Most predicted, however, that banks will 
need to maintain some branches for those customers who want to do 
their business face-to-face.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen at  
midafternoon Tuesday on dollar-negative comments from a top 
International Monetary Fund official. The key Tokyo index slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.02 yen at midafternoon, down 0.12 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
123.49 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 42.40 points,  
or 0.26 percent, ending the day at 16,378.62. On Monday, the 
average shed 389.37 points, or 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar faced selling following  
comments by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus that the U.S. 
current account deficit could affect the currency. Camdessus also 
cautioned that the imbalance could increase U.S. protectionist 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese trust bank dealer said the dollar selling emerged  
immediately after the comment, made at a luncheon in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also faced selling against the Japanese currency as  
players waited to see if the Fed would signal any bias Tuesday 
toward tightening monetary policy in its Open Market Committee 
meeting, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.44 yen at  
midafternoon, up from 131.27 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei fell as most investors were  
retreating to the sidelines as they waited for the outcome of the 
Fed committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.72 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,324.15. The 
TOPIX closed down 25.02 points, or 1.9 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.275 percent from Monday's finish of 1.230 percent, 
driving its price down to 102.01 yen from 102.42 yen.

<HEADLINE> `Star Wars' To Premier at Midnight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arriving in a meteor shower of hype and  
dodging reviews from the Dark Side, the new ``Star Wars'' movie was 
set to open, appropriately, when the stars are out, at midnight 
screenings around the country early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best place to be right now in the whole world,''  
said Chris Chaplin, 30, who had a ticket to the midnight show at 
Mann's Chinese Theater but was waiting in line hours before the 
doors swung open to get a good seat. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time. The 
only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to 
approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge,  
unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box 
office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But beyond that you're in 
a very competitive release period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than  
$100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through 
Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' 
for the film-opener crown. ``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 
million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, for No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star  
Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof. 
Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. The 
reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious. 
</P>
<P>
	The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who  
likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who  
called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' 
movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle. Roger  
Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an 
astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the  
entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the 
back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a generation earlier, when 
Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who 
would grow up to become Luke's absentee father. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so  
far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and 
video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons 
beyond recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead  
for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese, where the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22  
years ago, more than 100 people were lined up at midmorning 
Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Torture Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A teen-ager on Tuesday told jurors hearing a  
police brutality case that screams came from the direction of a 
precinct bathroom right after officers led a Haitian immigrant down 
a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrant, Abner Louima, claims an officer sodomized him  
with a broom handle in a case that shocked the city due to the 
brutal nature of the charges and has raised tensions between 
minorities and the police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-ager Connelle Lugg testified he was sitting in a holding  
cell adjacent to the bathroom in the 70th Precinct in August 1997 
when he spotted a police officer leading a rear-handcuffed 
prisoner, Louima, down a hallway. He said Louima's pants were down 
around his knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, ``I heard banging against a wall and I heard  
somebody screaming,'' he testified. 
</P>
<P>
	During the federal trial of five white officers, jurors also  
heard from a desk sergeant who said he didn't hear -- or see -- any 
sign of the alleged attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Officer Justin Volpe -- mistakenly thinking  
Louima sucker-punched him in a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub -- 
rammed a stick into Louima's rectum and mouth while Officer Charles 
Schwarz held him on the bathroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, Schwarz and two other officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas  
Wiese, also are charged with violating Louima's civil rights by 
beating him in a patrol car en route to the precinct. A fifth 
defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with covering up the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	A multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed on Louima's behalf alleges  
that the cops were shielded by a police code of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugg, then 16, had been arrested in an unrelated incident on  
weapons and menacing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugg said that after hearing the racket in the bathroom, an  
officer he identified as Volpe threw Louima onto his knees in the 
same cell. He said Louima was moaning and saying he needed to go to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	When Louima asked for help, Volpe told him to shut up, Lugg  
said. Other officers eventually summoned an ambulance.

<HEADLINE>  Kafelnikov, Hingis Are Top Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov will be the top seed for the  
French Open despite a recent run of six consecutive first-round 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis, the Australian Open winner, was made the No. 1  
women's seed on Tuesday, ahead of Lindsay Davenport and Monica 
Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Open, the clay-court major that begins May 24, bases  
its seedings on the current rankings of the ATP and WTA tours. 
</P>
<P>
	That accounts for Kafelnikov, who ascended to No. 1 for the  
first time in April, being the top seed, with Pete Sampras second. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a runner-up finish in last week's Italian Open,  
Patrick Rafter moves up to No. 3, with French Open champion Carlos 
Moya at No. 4 and Richard Karjicek at No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has played embarrassing tennis since winning the  
Australian Open in January and a tournament in London a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Italian Open, the Russian broke his run of six  
first-round defeats before losing in the third round to Gustavo 
Kuerten. Kuerten won the title in Rome and is seeded No. 8 for 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's draw, defending champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario  
is seeded No. 7. Jana Novotna is No. 4, Venus Williams is No. 5 and 
Steffi Graf is No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Frenchwomen are among the 16 seeds: No. 8 Mary Pierce, No.  
9 Nathalie Tauziat, No. 12 Sandrine Testud and No. 16 Julie 
Halard-Decugis. 
</P>
<P>
	Halard-Decugis, who advanced to the final of last week's Berlin  
Open, gained five ranking spots to capture her first seeding in a 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Open finalist Amelie Mauresmo and Anna Kournikova  
have slipped from the top 16 and will be unseeded at Roland Garros.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Buys Jet Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Flying back into the civilian airplane market,  
defense contractor General Dynamics Corp. will buy Gulfstream 
Aerospace Corp., the Savannah-based maker of luxury business jets 
for about $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-for-one stock swap furthers General Dynamics' goal of  
expanding beyond its core naval and armored vehicle defense 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase announced Monday also gives General Dynamics an  
immediate income source -- $4.1 billion in firm orders Gulfstream 
plans to deliver through 2007. Gulfstream controls about 60 percent 
of the world market for business jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is clearly the best brand name in the long-range business  
jet market,'' General Dynamics chairman and CEO Nicholas Chabraja 
said in a conference call with analysts. ``For my money -- and I've 
spent my own money -- it is clearly the best product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, initially priced at $5.3 billion when announced,  
dropped in value as General Dynamics stock plummeted $6.18 3/4, to 
close at $65.25 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Gulfstream 
stock was up $6.06 1/4 to $61.68 3/4 as investors took advantage of the 
premium offered while bidding General Dynamics stock down. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, Va., was blocked last  
month in a bid to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. after the 
Pentagon cited concerns about its dominance in the field. Chabraja 
said the Gulfstream acquisition was unrelated to that failed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulfstream chairman and CEO Theodore Forstmann said the merger  
was appropriate for the company because it would allow Gulfstream -- 
which he will continue to manage -- access to General Dynamics' 
larger resources and a chance to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy we've found a strong parent and a good home,''  
Forstmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulfstream was founded in 1978 by Allen E. Paulson from  
properties that were previously owned by Grumman Corp. He sold it 
to Chrysler Corp. in 1985, but teamed with Forstmann's New 
York-based investment firm, Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., to buy it back 
in 1990 for $825 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Forstmann Little took the company public in 1996 but still owns  
23 percent of its stock. Paulson is a director. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition moves General Dynamics back into civilian  
aircraft seven years after it sold Gulfstream rival Cessna to 
Textron for $600 million. Chabraja called that sale, which occurred 
before he was named CEO, a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a decision that I embrace as one of the great moments  
in GD history,'' he said. ``It was driven by the economics of the 
moment. ... But we've moved up, haven't we? This is really the 
market leader, and it's where I want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gulfstream's flagship is the $38 million Gulfstream V, which can  
fly nonstop from New York to Tokyo and Los Angeles to London. It 
also sells the smaller, $28 million Gulfstream IV. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have become popular among Fortune 500 company executives  
and Hollywood celebrities. Gulfstream has sold its planes in 50 
countries and to 34 governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the deal even sweeter, Gulfstream requires a $2 million  
nonrefundable deposit on airplane orders. It has 129 planes on back 
order and has had only one cancellation, Forstmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expressed some surprise at the transaction, citing  
Gulfstream's non-defense focus. In recent years, however, 
Gulfstream has begun selling to the Air Force and is exploring 
other ``special mission'' sales to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's slightly unusual, but I'm not going to bad-mouth it,''  
said Glenn Stewart, an aerospace analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. 
Louis. ``I think what the management of General Dynamics saw, 
bottom line, was a very good business at a very low price. 
Gulfstream was tremendously undervalued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the merger, though it  
is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. The companies 
expect the transaction to be completed in three to four months. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement allows either party to withdraw if General  
Dynamics' stock trades at an average close below $63 in the 15 
trading days before Gulfstream shareholders meet to vote on the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulfstream had 1998 revenues of $2.4 billion and earnings of  
$225.3 million. It employs 7,800 people at plants in Savannah, 
Oklahoma City, Long Beach, Calif., and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics has 29,000 employees and had earned $364  
million in 1998 on sales of $5 billion.

<HEADLINE> USGA Calls Golf Carts Unfair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- The U.S. Golf Association argued Tuesday  
that if a local golf pro is allowed to use a cart in a U.S. Open 
qualifier he will gain an unfair advantage and dramatically change 
the way the game is played. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers for Ford Olinger, a golf pro in Warsaw, Ind.,  
responded that the USGA's claims were based more on fear than fact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any proof that a cart gives a disabled person  
any advantage,'' lawyer John Hamilton said. ``If an individual like 
Ford can make it through 36 holes, certainly the USGA won't say he 
has an unfair advantage. In fact, he will have run a gantlet far 
more difficult than any of these individuals did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger successfully sued the USGA last year for a temporary  
injunction allowing him to ride in an Open qualifier under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. Olinger, who didn't advance beyond 
the local qualifier last year, has a degenerative hip disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to make that exemption permanent in a case USGA lawyers  
had speculated could affect Casey Martin's status for the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the USGA on Tuesday said Martin, a member of the Nike  
tour who has played on the PGA Tour, will be allowed to use a cart 
in the Open and its qualifying rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that  
makes it painful for him to walk long distances, won the right last 
year to ride on tour under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	His case is on appeal before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals. Oral arguments were heard this month, and a decision isn't 
expected for months. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Miller said he would rule on  
Olinger's case by Monday morning, when the local qualifier is to 
begin in South Bend. 
</P>
<P>
	To support their claims that carts would be an unfair advantage,  
especially in heat and humidity, USGA lawyers called Ken Venturi to 
testify about how he had to play in searing heat when he won the 
1964 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about the World Series. You're talking about  
the marathon,'' he said. ``You're talking about only the best, 
physically and mentally, being able to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi said those who can't live up to those standards  
shouldn't be allowed to compete professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	He said carts are detrimental to the course during U.S. Open  
play, especially to the long rough required for the annual 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also testified the fatigue golfers feel from walking the  
course doesn't adversely affect their games but is simply one of 
the many factors they have to deal with to win championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way for things to be equal is to play by the same  
rules,'' Venturi said. ``Where do you draw the line? It's simple: 
Play by the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers on both sides focused much of their final arguments on  
whether a golf cart would be a reasonable accommodation, as 
outlined in the ADA. 
</P>
<P>
	USGA lawyer Lee Abrams argued the U.S. Open has been played for  
more than 100 years with the rules applied to all competitors 
equally, disability or not, and making an exception could open the 
floodgates to countless baseless claims. 
</P>
<P>
	During Venturi's testimony, Abrams asked him about Ben Hogan's  
1950 win at the U.S. Open, just a year after he was in automobile 
accident and doctors predicted he'd never walk again. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never thought about carts,'' Venturi said. ``Knowing Ben  
Hogan as well as I did, he wouldn't have taken one.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Put on Back Burner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite prodding from some GOP rank and file  
lawmakers, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Tuesday campaign 
finance legislation isn't likely to reach the House floor before 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get the appropriations process done sooner, if we get a  
lot of things off our table and there's an empty spot there, it 
could be sooner. But it doesn't look like it right now,'' the 
Illinois Republican said in an interview in his Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other changes, the legislation would eliminate so-called  
soft money -- large, unregulated donations that political parties 
and others solicit to finance political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have been seeking support for a petition to force the  
issue to the floor, but no Republican has signed it, and without at 
least some GOP support, it cannot prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP advocates of campaign finance overhaul legislation  
met with Hastert recently to urge him to move up his schedule for 
floor action, but came away without a commitment. Some referred to 
the petition at the meeting, and one, Rep. Zach Wamp of Tennessee, 
said afterward he had told Hastert, ``Please don't put me in the 
position of having to sign the discharge petition. But I would like 
to stay consistent, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Hastert said it was the right of any advocate  
of campaign finance legislation to sign the so-called discharge 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Because they deal with the flow of legislation to the House  
floor, such petitions are customarily organized by members of the 
minority party, and lawmakers from the majority party who sign them 
are viewed with displeasure by their own leadership and most party 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is, I've given folks a promise that they will  
have their legislation on the floor in September. ... If that's not 
soon enough for them, then they have a right to do something 
else,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've given them a commitment and my word to do it, and I  
intend to stand by that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and other Republicans have expressed concern that  
outlawing soft money could cause serious damage to Republicans in 
political campaigns, since labor unions would still be permitted to 
provide assistance to Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., a prominent supporter of campaign  
finance legislation, wrote Hastert during the day to urge him to 
allow votes on the bill before the Memorial Day recess at the end 
of this month or early next month.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen at  
midafternoon Tuesday on dollar-negative comments from a top 
International Monetary Fund official. The key Tokyo index slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.02 yen at midafternoon, down 0.12 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
123.49 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 42.40 points,  
or 0.26 percent, ending the day at 16,378.62. On Monday, the 
average shed 389.37 points, or 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar faced selling following  
comments by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus that the U.S. 
current account deficit could affect the currency. Camdessus also 
cautioned that the imbalance could increase U.S. protectionist 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese trust bank dealer said the dollar selling emerged  
immediately after the comment, made at a luncheon in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also faced selling against the Japanese currency as  
players waited to see if the Fed would signal any bias Tuesday 
toward tightening monetary policy in its Open Market Committee 
meeting, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.44 yen at  
midafternoon, up from 131.27 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei fell as most investors were  
retreating to the sidelines as they waited for the outcome of the 
Fed committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.72 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,324.15. The 
TOPIX closed down 25.02 points, or 1.9 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.275 percent from Monday's finish of 1.230 percent, 
driving its price down to 102.01 yen from 102.42 yen.

<HEADLINE> Riley Says He Won't Revamp Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat practice court was empty, and the  
players headed for home after meeting with their coach one final 
time. Pat Riley leaned back against the bleachers and surveyed the 
silent gymnasium, a long offseason staring him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 48 hours earlier, Riley was shouting to be heard above  
the din at Miami Arena. Now his words reverberated off the gym 
walls, and he sounded angry, arrogant, defiant and determined. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no need to revamp the roster, Riley said, and no need to  
sulk. He characterized the Heat's season-ending Game 5 loss Sunday 
to the New York Knicks as a temporary setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not despondent, because I don't want the players to be  
that way,'' Riley said Tuesday. ``It's the end of a year, but I've 
recovered. I am full of spit and vinegar today. I'm ready to 
roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Riley actually laughed. But he frowned when discussing  
criticism that the team has underachieved and should be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	``While you're looking for heads to roll, there will be nobody's  
hide and there will be nobody's head rolling,'' he said. ``I have 
incredible faith in my personnel, period. To win a championship? 
Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley defended Tim Hardaway and Jamal Mashburn, who played  
poorly in the first-round series that saw the eighth-seeded Knicks 
knock off the top-seeded Heat. He said he wants aging free agents 
Dan Majerle and Terry Porter to return next season. And he noted 
that the Heat would still be playing if not for Allan Houston's 
last-second basket Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One bounce of the ball with eight-tenths of a second left in a  
game is not going to deter me from staying with these guys,'' Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will augment the talent we have on this team. Somewhere  
along the way we may make one deal that helps us. We might. But I 
will not give away core players to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley passed up a chance to acquire Latrell Sprewell this year  
and Mitch Richmond last season, both times because of his 
reluctance to trade power forward P.J. Brown. Now, there's 
speculation that only center Alonzo Mourning will be off limits in 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Considerable criticism has been directed at Hardaway, who shot  
27 percent against the Knicks and was shut out in the second half 
of the final game. But Riley said he wants the 32-year-old point 
guard back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a bad series. That doesn't mean he should go to  
Siberia,'' Riley said. ``You've got to be realistic about what 
Tim's done for this team over the last 3 1/2 years. He had a bad 
series. Instead of burning him at the stake, you should have more 
compassion for one of our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said the Heat need better leadership and more maturity,  
but it can come from the current roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think our players police each other enough. It's been  
left to me, and I do a good job of it. But that isn't the way it 
works in an ideal situation,'' he said. ``When it comes to being a 
great team, there's a rite of passage when a coach can look at his 
guys and know they'll take care of business on their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, notorious for his demanding training regimen, said  
offseason workouts will be the most strenuous yet. He noted that 
because of the NBA lockout, his team has played in only four of the 
past 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This summer is going to be unlike any they've ever had,''  
Riley said. ``We will make this team better. We will find something 
to help. But I think we have enough right here.''

<HEADLINE>  Years Later, McEnroe's Still at It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a few riveting moments, John McEnroe was  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered him on in a passion-filled tiebreaker. He  
threw his racket. He questioned calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this time, the distant flashes of Grand Slams past came  
before 1,925 fans in the final of the Sprint PCS Champions seniors 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have Wimbledon or the U.S. Open,'' the gray-templed,  
40-year-old McEnroe said after parading the trophy around the court 
with a big grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a good crowd, good place, to me it's a big event. Is  
it a bigger event in Qatar? We're going over there in April. I'd 
rather win here, with all due respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a tour that sometimes seems as much show as competition --  
with players playing as much to the crowd as against each other -- 
McEnroe's 6-4, 4-6, (11-9) victory over Mats Wilander was a gem 
between two former No. 1s. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe served well, allowing just four points on his service  
games in the first set, and Wilander looked like a youngster as he 
chased balls in the corners. McEnroe won after saving two match 
points in the extended tiebreaker, which takes the place of the 
third set on the seniors tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``To raise the intensity of a match like today wasn't a  
problem,'' said Wilander, who is 34 and admits he sometimes has 
trouble motivating himself in seniors play. ``Once you get to this 
point, you can find something that's reminiscent of before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good match because I played well. I realized that  
John plays well pretty much all the time. He has such talent. His 
game is so fluid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In six years, the Worldwide Senior Tennis Circuit has become a  
yearlong tour, with 20 tournaments scheduled for the 1999-2000 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a long way from seniors golf -- ticket sales in  
Washington were disappointing despite heavy advance publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it is that we're sort of icing on the  
cake,'' said McEnroe, who has 16 seniors singles titles. ``The main 
tour has got to get going. If the cake isn't baked, then no icing 
is going to do any good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American stops on the tour are heavily dependent on two  
players, McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, who not only can still play a 
good game but will stay and talk about it afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors tore an abdominal muscle and had to retire against  
Jose-Luis Clerc on Friday night. Clerc said it was ``really bad for 
the tournament because everybody wants to see Jimmy Connors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, who won 32 of his 35 matches on the tour last year, is  
still the outspoken, unpredictable character of his ATP days. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to the umpire as the ``clown in the chair,'' said he  
should be considered for the Davis Cup doubles team because he at 
least ``cares about it,'' and otherwise offered his opinions on 
anything and everything about tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be the commissioner of tennis,'' McEnroe said.  
``It would be sort of a liaison. Someone who has a sense of the 
future of the game and who can do something about it as well. 
Someone who can walk out on a tennis court and excite some young 
kid into playing as well as has a good idea of what would allow the 
professional players to play their best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'd be a good candidate, but whether or not it's me, I  
think there should be someone like that.''

<HEADLINE> Testimony Names Trie at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A woman who worked for President  
Clinton friend and restaurant owner Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie said 
Tuesday she was told by her boss to get rid of documents sought by 
a Senate committee investigating questionable campaign 
fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying at Trie's trial on obstruction of justice charges,  
Maria ``Dia'' Mapili said she spoke to Trie by telephone after a 
U.S. marshal served a subpoena for records from one of Trie's 
companies in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read part of the subpoena to him. He told me to get rid of  
the documents,'' she testified. ``I throw out some documents. At 
some point I stopped. I was nervous and scared. I hid some 
documents in a credenza and under his bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she acknowledged under cross-examination that she may have  
been confused about the conversation, and it may have happened 
months earlier or later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mapili, the prosecution's chief witness, testified on the  
second day of what was expected to be a weeklong trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, a central figure in the controversy over foreign-linked  
campaign donations to Democrats, could face up to five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of impeding the Senate 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	He would face even stiffer penalties if convicted in Washington  
of charges that he made and arranged illegal contributions from 
foreigners to the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie is accused of making illegal contributions to buy access to  
Clinton and other top officials for himself and the likes of 
Chinese arms dealer Wang Jun. Wang is an adviser to the Chinese 
government whose company, Poly Technologies, has been implicated in 
the smuggling of arms into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC has returned $640,000 that Trie raised. Clinton's legal  
defense fund has returned another $460,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, Trie, 49, operated a  
Chinese restaurant in Little Rock, where he was befriended by 
then-Gov. Clinton, a frequent patron. 
</P>
<P>
	After Clinton became president, Trie moved to Washington and  
began raising money for Democrats, becoming known for entertaining 
visiting Asian business people at his apartment in the Watergate 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee  
subpoenaed documents from one of Trie's companies -- Daihatsu 
International Trading Corp., based at his Little Rock home. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mapili worked at Trie's restaurant before becoming the  
manager of Trie's home office. She testified under defense 
cross-examination that she routinely threw out old documents and 
often stored papers in the trunk of Trie's car because of cramped 
quarters in the garage he converted into an office. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the documents Trie told her to withhold may have  
regarded failed business deals that had nothing to do with the 
subject of the Senate inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Renaldo, testified Tuesday that he had a  
conversation with Trie in which Trie accused Republicans of 
involving him in a political witch hunt against Clinton.

<HEADLINE> TV Land Offers a Different Universe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On this, the week that big broadcast networks  
announce their new fall schedules, TV Land trumpets its ``new'' 
shows: ``Maude,'' ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' and ``The 
Honeymooners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the folks at TV Land are living in some sort of  
parallel universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three years old, TV Land is one of the fastest growing  
cable networks, its very existence a confirmation that everything 
old will someday be new again. 
</P>
<P>
	It presents a steady diet of vintage reruns, even classic  
commercials, with an irreverent love for television history. TV 
Land is a refuge for people who want to revisit the past, either 
out of nostalgia or boredom with their other television choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old executive who runs TV Land willingly immerses  
himself in that other universe. Larry Jones looks across his desk 
at a wall of framed, autographed pictures of smiling TV icons: 
Jackie Gleason, Paul Lynde, Fred MacMurray, Col. Sanders and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sonny &AMP; Cher Christmas tree ball decorates his desk, along  
with a Morey Amsterdam ashtray. Even Jones' cufflinks are a picture 
of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the target audience,'' he said. ``I'm part of the  
hard-core boomer generation, what we refer to as the TV generation, 
who grew up watching these shows. I lucked out. My personal passion 
merged with my career. I watched a lot of TV and I'm proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a decade ago, corporate sister Nickelodeon reran  
``Lassie'' episodes in its afternoon programming for children. Its 
executives were surprised at how many adults tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon remembered this when it began airing shows in  
prime-time. It turned to vintage reruns, some old enough to be in 
black-and-white, as something that would attract parents after they 
put their kids to bed. But Nick has kept on expanding its lineup of 
children's shows, shrinking the time available for reruns. TV Land 
was spun off as a separate network in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, it is available in half the nation's 80 million homes  
with cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Many TV Land viewers are disgruntled with the state of  
television today, and complain that schedules change so much that 
they can't get to know the characters, Jones said. Some viewers are 
suspicious of the networks, not knowing when something will come on 
that they're uncomfortable watching with children. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's modern television, you just don't know how far  
they're going to take it,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's odd, then, that TV Land airs a cop show like ``Mannix''  
that in its time was rated among the most violent shows. And while 
some of today's prime-time fare would have been considered 
shockingly blue 30 years ago, TV Land's most popular show, ``All in 
the Family,'' treads ground that many modern producers avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Lear's 1970s sitcom about the bigoted Archie Bunker and  
his family was determinedly topical, plunging headlong into 
divisive social issues in a way most shows avoid today. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's TV Land's top-rated show, airing in prime time, twice  
in the morning, and once overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are watching it for different reasons,'' Jones said.  
``I don't think anybody watches anything for solely nostalgic 
reasons. I think it's about quality. It still holds up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, television executives tried to capitalize  
on ``All in the Family'' by spinning off a character for her own 
show, ``Maude.'' Now TV Land is repeating history; ``Maude'' begins 
airing in August and is the network's highest-profile acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Also coming to prime time soon are ``The A-Team,'' ``The Andy  
Griffith Show,'' and ``Gomer Pyle, USMC.'' So are ``The 
Honeymooners'' and ``Beverly Hillbillies,'' series that have aired 
relentlessly in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones believes the shows won't suffer for that familiarity  
because it has been years since they aired. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Land programming stretches now to the 1980s, with ``Hill  
Street Blues'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' The network doesn't ignore 
television of today: it recently named ABC's ``Sports Night'' as 
its best bet to become a classic. And the network went blank last 
May during the ``Seinfeld'' finale, urging its viewers to watch 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no similar strategy for ``The Nanny'' this month,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of TV Land's most enjoyable moments are the retro

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Higher; Corn Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures advanced Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn retreated after the U.S. Agriculture Department reported 77  
percent of corn acreage already has been planted, up 1 percent over 
last year and 9 percent over the five-year average. 
</P>
<P>
	The report dashed hopes that heavy recent rains would reduce the  
amount of corn acreage, at a time when global demand remains in the 
doldrums and inventories remain relatively large. Farmers typically 
have until June to get crops into the ground; later planting 
increases the risk of damage from early frost. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were pressured by National Weather Service  
forecasts for warm weather and normal to below-normal rainfall in 
Midwest growing regions over the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybean planting also were proceeding normally, the  
agency reported. But soybeans rallied on reports China was looking 
to buy two cargoes of South American or U.S. soybeans in coming 
days. Wheat moved higher in step with soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.64 a bushel; July  
corn fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.21 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 3/4 cent to 
$1.21 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to $4.75 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while pork bellies finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .95 cent to 63.10 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .58 cent to 74.50 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .03 cent to 58 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .15 cent 
to 54.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Fears Cut IRS Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- IRS enforcement actions aimed at collecting  
unpaid taxes have slowed drastically, partly because employees fear 
being fired under a new law that broadly boosted taxpayer rights, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few people are going to take the risk that if you make a  
mistake you'll be fired,'' said Robert Tobias, president of the 
National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 92,000 IRS 
workers. ``As a result, there is very little collection activity 
taking place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service seized property for overdue taxes  
108 times in the six months that ended March 31, compared with 
1,150 during the same span last year and 5,000 seizures two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnishments of wages and levies on bank accounts dropped to  
458,000 in the most recent six months from 1.8 million two years 
ago, while liens on property dropped from 272,000 to 98,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the IRS has relaxed requirements for  
installment agreements to pay off taxes and for 
``offers-in-compromise'' for taxpayers who have no hope of paying a 
large bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower enforcement statistics, first reported Tuesday in The  
New York Times, stem in part from a tight budget, complex 
procedural changes mandated by the new law that stopped some 
actions and shifting of employees temporarily to new duties, such 
as answering telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials acknowledged, however, that fear of new taxpayer  
protection laws was an equal factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interpretation of how it is actually going to work has  
been a real problem,'' said John Dalrymple, IRS chief operations 
officer. ``Initially, we were not as sensitive as to how much 
anxiety about this there was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The section of the law at issue increased penalties for 10  
offenses so that firing is immediate and cannot be appealed. 
Dismissal requires that the conduct be willful and involve such 
things as failing to obtain required approval for a property 
seizure, violating a taxpayer's constitutional rights, falsifying 
or destroying documents and concealing information from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a March memo to all IRS employees, Commissioner Charles  
Rossotti assured them they will get adequate training to adhere to 
the 1998 reform law and that their rights as workers won't be 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo from Rossotti includes ``important reminders'' for  
employees, the first of which stress the primacy of taxpayer rights 
and fair treatment of IRS workers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobias said no one has been fired under the new rules, and no  
action has been initiated that could lead to a dismissal. He gave 
the IRS credit for moving slowly so that proper training can occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, they would have rushed the regs into the field  
and called it a day,'' he said. ``One of the reasons for the delay 
is that the IRS is trying to get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dalrymple said it was too soon to tell if the IRS reform law  
will permanently reduce the agency's ability to collect unpaid 
taxes and deter cheaters. He noted that in 1970, a Supreme Court 
case led to a one-year halt in certain property seizures while the 
IRS figured out how to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a bill this large, it's real possible there  
will be consequences no one thought of,'' he said. ``It's not time 
to panic yet.''

<HEADLINE> Cancer Drug Urged for At-Risk Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The nation's largest group of cancer specialists  
is suggesting that doctors consider prescribing tamoxifen to tens 
of millions of healthy women to help prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation issued Tuesday by the American Society of  
Clinical Oncology was based largely on earlier research showing 
that tamoxifen -- available since 1978 as a treatment for breast 
cancer -- can also cut women's risk of developing the disease almost 
in half. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said tamoxifen ``may be offered'' to women who  
have at least a 1.7 percent risk of getting breast cancer over the 
next five years. That is considered a modestly increased risk. 
</P>
<P>
	About 29 million women, or 20 percent of the U.S. female  
population, are in this category -- including all women over age 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The cautiously worded statement was immediately criticized by  
some advocates for breast cancer patients. They said tamoxifen's 
health risks are too high for it to be routinely taken by healthy 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamoxifen can trigger hot flashes and increase the risk of other  
rare but more serious side effects, including uterine cancer and 
potentially fatal blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead authors of the statement said a woman's personal fear  
of breast cancer is perhaps the most important consideration in 
deciding whether to take the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not recommending that women take it. We are  
recommending that women be offered it,'' said Dr. Rowan Chlebowski 
of the University of California at Los Angeles. Even then, he said, 
the decision to use tamoxifen ``depends on a woman's actual risk 
and the importance of that risk to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Food and Drug Administration said tamoxifen could  
be promoted as a way to prevent the disease in those at elevated 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The hazardous side effects of tamoxifen have increased interest  
in a similar drug -- the osteoporosis medicine raloxifene, or Evista 
-- which also triggers blood clots but does not cause uterine 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	At the society's annual meeting Tuesday, Dr. Jane Cauley of the  
University of Pittsburgh presented data on a follow-up of 7,705 
women who took raloxifene or dummy pills in a bone fracture study. 
</P>
<P>
	After 40 months of follow-up, there were 54 cases of breast  
cancer. The risk was two-thirds lower in those getting raloxifene. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effectiveness and safety of longer-term use are  
uncertain,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chlebowski said the number of cancer cases in this and eight  
other raloxifene studies is too small to draw definite conclusions 
about the drug's effect on breast cancer. Although together they 
suggest that raloxifene cuts the risk about in half, he said more 
data are needed before the drug can be recommended routinely to 
prevent cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging a woman's breast cancer risk involves a complex formula  
that considers her age, race, history of breast abnormalities and 
biopsies and family history of the disease, as well as her age at 
first menstruation and first childbirth. The National Cancer 
Institute has sent computer software for making this calculation to 
thousands of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinical oncology society committee that issued the new  
guidelines included four patient advocates. One of them, Helen 
Schiff of New York City, said she does not believe its 
recommendations are in women's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving a powerful drug to so many healthy women is a dangerous  
undertaking,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Susan Braun of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer  
Foundation in Dallas said women should, as a start, learn what 
their actual risk is. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actively encouraging women go to their physicians and  
have their risk level assessed,'' she said. ``Women both 
overestimate it and underestimate it.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 57; Nasdaq Slips 6 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today after the Federal Reserve left  
interest rates unchanged but warned financial markets that rates 
are likely to rise in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 57.52 at 10,795.95. Before the Fed's announcement, the 
blue-chip index had risen as much as 77 points above Monday's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were all lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 10.71 at 1,328.78, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was down 6.65 at 2,555.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the announcement from the Fed's Open Market Committee  
was largely expected, stocks tumbled within moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it's an indication of how nervous the market  
is,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
``We're at lofty levels, and it doesn't take much to make people 
lose their nerve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market players had been anticipating the Fed to at least issue a  
warning about higher rates since last Friday, when a jump in the 
consumer price index fueled worries about inflation. The Fed 
typically raises rates when it wants to slow the economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates, in turn, pressure corporate earnings as  
it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, strong earnings reports from retailers and  
computer giant Hewlett-Packard helped take investors' minds off 
interest rates. Hewlett-Packard's report late Monday soundly beat 
Wall Street expectations. Its stock was up 6 1/2 today at 95 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news from Hewlett-Packard turned attention toward Dell  
Computer, an industry bellwether scheduled to report earnings this 
afternoon. Dell rose 5/8 to 43 7/8 and was the most actively traded 
issue on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers provided additional strength today. J.C. Penney rose 5  
13/16 to 51 1/2 after the company said it plans to outsource its 
credit card business and to offer a separate stock for its Eckerd 
drugstore business. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues overtook advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 591.9 million shares, 
ahead of Monday's quiet pace. Traders noted volume remained fairly 
steady after the Fed's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 5.21 at 631.71, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.32 at 782.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.26 percent.  
European indexes ended mostly higher as Germany's DAX index rose 
1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 0.7 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 ended up 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cable-Internet Regulation Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's plan to buy cable company MediaOne is  
intensifying debate over whether to regulate cable TV companies' 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned merger would turn AT&AMP;T into the nation's largest  
cable TV company and biggest provider of high-speed Internet access 
over cable TV lines and modems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is merging with GTE, wants the Federal  
Communications Commission to block the AT&AMP;T-MediaOne deal, Bell 
Atlantic chairman Ivan Seidenberg told reporters at a consumers 
conference here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which wants to be a major player in the  
high-speed Internet access market, as well as other Baby Bells' 
Internet services, are regulated. That puts them at a competitive 
disadvantage because it makes it harder for phone companies to 
quickly respond to consumer demand by adjusting prices and offering 
new service packages, Seidenberg contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a discrepancy -- there's no question about it,'' concedes  
Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, 
which will review the AT&AMP;T-MediaOne deal and has been monitoring 
the development of the small, but fast-growing cable Internet 
services market. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, in recent decisions, has declined to force cable  
companies, including AT&AMP;T through its takeover of cable giant 
Tele-Communications Inc., to share their high-speed lines with 
competitors -- something America Online, consumer groups and some 
phone companies want. But the FCC has said it would keep watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``One way or another we need to make sure it's open and  
competitive,'' said AOL chairman Steve Case. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and the cable industry oppose regulating cable's high-speed  
Internet services, preferring voluntary arrangements with 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC is monitoring to ensure cable companies providing  
high-speed Internet services aren't freezing out competitors or 
restricting consumers' options for Internet service. Beginning next 
week, the FCC is to begin holding a series of meetings on the 
issue, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do want to make clear that this is a debate that isn't over  
yet,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position in the past has been that we have to be very, very  
careful about injecting government in a marketplace like the 
Internet which has thrived quite well without a lot of government 
intervention. We need to proceed very cautiously ... before we say 
yes regulate or don't regulate.''

<HEADLINE> Open Scoring at Sydney Olympics? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The competition manager for boxing at  
the Sydney Olympics wants something the International Amateur 
Boxing Association is not likely to allow -- the public disclosure 
of the score after each round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Showing the round-by-round scores on the main scoreboard would  
give the spectators the chance to follow the fights more closely, 
and it would be fairer for the competitors,'' Paul Thompson said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The international governing body, however, has twice resisted  
pressure to allow scores to be publicly displayed. Any move to make 
it so would have to come at the organization's next meeting in 
Houston in August if it is to be in place for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The scores after each round are shown on television monitors  
available to officials and members of the media, and coaches have 
been able to get the scores and relay the information to their 
fighters' cornermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy over scoring is almost an Olympic boxing staple, but  
AIBA feels that publicly displaying the scores after each round 
would add pressure on the judges 
</P>
<P>
	Bouts at the 2000 Olympics will be fought in five two-minute  
rounds for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	AIBA made the change from three three-minute rounds last year  
after receiving medical advice that boxers used up a lot of lactic 
acid in the last minute of bouts.

<P>
	With talks faltering on China's accession to the World Trade  
Organization, the Clinton administration again faces angry attacks 
in Congress on its China policies early next month when China's 
normal trade status expires. Until last year, normal trade status 
was known as ``most-favored nation'' status. 
</P>
<P>
	The climate in Congress has been exacerbated by violent  
anti-U.S. demonstrations in Beijing to protest NATO's mistaken 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and by recent 
allegations of Chinese nuclear spying. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., a sponsor of the Senate resolution,  
said China made a strategic mistake by encouraging the protests in 
Beijing and 19 other Chinese cities, which damaged the U.S. Embassy 
and other diplomatic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time to turn up the heat because the American  
people are beginning to learn what this regime is all about,'' 
Feingold said. ``We must not let human rights take a back seat but 
examine (China's) totally unacceptable behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We should use this somber anniversary to focus on the  
tragedies occurring inside China and encourage the administration 
to re-evaluate our relationship with the Chinese,'' said Sen. Tim 
Hutchinson, R-Ark., a co-sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants the administration to realize that China is not  
a strategic Asian ally and strengthen ties with Japan, South Korea 
and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a similar measure introduced in the House by Rep. Nancy  
Pelosi, D-Calif., the resolution expresses sympathy to families of 
hundreds of people killed in the pro-democracy demonstration in 
Beijing June 4, 1989. It condemns human rights abuses by the 
Chinese government and demands release of all political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until China squarely faces the events and aftermath of June 4,  
1989, there will be no letting bygones be bygones, no end of 
remembering,'' Pelosi said. ``If we were to forget, we would betray 
our own values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pelosi said the administration had hoped to reach a WTO  
agreement with China by the time its normal trading status expires. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant U.S. trade representative, Robert Cassidy, was  
scheduled to return to Beijing this week to resume talks, but his 
visit was indefinitely delayed.

<HEADLINE> Retailers See Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The strength of the U.S. economy continued to encourage  
Americans to spend in the first quarter, boosting sales and profits 
at many of the nation's biggest retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Home Depot's net income rose 45 percent as the home-buying  
and renovation market continued to surge. Dayton Hudson Corp. saw a 
23 percent profit increase, helped by strength at its Target 
discount stores. Tiffany &AMP; Co.'s earnings rose 42 percent as demand 
for jewelry and fine household goods remained strong. 

</P>
<P>
                           *The Home Depot    	
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based home improvement giant earned $489 million or  
32 cents per share, compared with $337 million or 22 cents per 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the recent quarter totaled $8.95 billion, an increase  
of 26 percent, and comparable store sales rose 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped a consensus estimate of 28 cents by analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. Home Depot's stock closed up 68 3/4 
cents, at $59.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Home Depot continues to reap the benefits of a continued  
strong U.S. economy and its own expansion. The company reported 
strong performance in the Atlanta and Dallas areas, where it and 
rival Lowe's are highly competitive, and solid growth in the 
Midwest, its newest domestic division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fiscal 1999 is off to a very strong start,'' said Arthur M.  
Blank, president and chief executive officer. ``Our hats are off to 
all of the Home Depot associates who serve our customers every day 
and produced the exceptional financial performance for the first 
quarter. Because of their continued efforts, we remain excited 
about our prospects for the remainder of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Home Depot opened 37 new stores and relocated one during the  
quarter, ending the quarter May 2 with 797 stores. They included 
743 stores and eight Expo Design Centers in the United States, 43 
stores in Canada, two stores in Chile and one in Puerto Rico. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Dayton Hudson Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis-based retailer earned $194 million, or 41 cents  
per share, compared with $158 million, or 33 cents per share, a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose nearly 12 percent to $7.21 billion, from $6.47  
billion in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results surpassed the estimate of 39 cents per share by Wall  
Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., but Dayton shares 
were down 37.50 cents to $64.87 1/2 in midday trading on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton Hudson officials said their Target, Mervyn's and  
department store divisions all recorded profit and revenue 
increases from the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Target's pre-tax profit increased 23 percent, to $370 million,  
and total revenues increased 14.1, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pre-tax profits for the company's department store division  
increased 17 percent, to $48 million, while revenue rose 2.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mervyn's, the company's moderate-price chain of retail stores,  
recorded a slight increase in pre-tax profits -- 5 percent to $45 
million. Mervyn's total revenues increased 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton Hudson operates 1,190 stores in 41 states, including 859  
Target stores, 268 Mervyn's stores and 63 department stores.

compared with $11.12 million, or 31 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose more than 20 percent to $272 million, up from $226  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany's earnings topped Wall Street analysts' estimates of 39  
cents a share. Its stock closed down 62 1/2 cents, at $84.12 1/2, on the 
NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Tiffany said that its U.S. retail sales climbed  
22 percent and sales at stores open at least a year, an industry 
gauge of performance, were up 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at its international stores also rose 22 percent, boosted  
by strength in Japanese and European operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct marketing sales, which include its corporate and catalog  
businesses, rose 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Penney To Offer Eckerd Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- J.C. Penney Company Inc.'s stock surged as much  
as 17 percent Tuesday after the retailer announced plans to offer 
20 percent of its Eckerd drugstore business to the public and sell 
its credit-card receivables operation for about $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came as the Plano, Texas-based company reported  
first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Penney's stock closed up $4.43 3/4, or 10 percent, at $50.12 1/2 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It climbed as high as 
$53.50 in earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the strategic moves Penney announced Tuesday are  
expected to help reduce its debt and strength its balance sheet. A 
number of investment firms, including PaineWebber and Merrill 
Lynch, upgraded Penney's stock on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its Eckerd stock initiative, the company will create a  
tracking stock for the drugstore business, which has been 
outperforming the rest of Penney's portfolio. The new stock will 
specifically reflect Eckerd's financial results and will not 
include Penney's other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the move will give Eckerd more financial  
freedom and flexibility, allowing it to grow and better compete 
with rivals such as Walgreen and CVS. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drugstore tracking stock keeps our businesses together,  
with a single existing J.C. Penney board, while giving us the 
ability to tap the cross-marketing opportunities and other 
synergies that exist among the customer base of our various 
retailing formats,'' chairman and chief executive James 
Oesterreicher said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the credit-card business, Oesterreicher said Penney already  
has begun discussions with a number of third-party providers that 
are interested in running its credit card operations and buying its 
credit card receivables portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Oesterreicher said the company expects to receive about $4  
billion in proceeds from the sale of its credit card receivables. 
</P>
<P>
	``The credit initiative is important because it will allow us to  
do more with our credit cards that will be appealing to our 
customers,'' Oesterreicher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expected changes are more innovative marketing  
programs and customized offerings, and incorporate new enhancements 
in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the tracking stock initiative and the credit card deals are  
expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In its earnings report, Penney reported net income of $167  
million, or 61 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with 
$174 million, or 64 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts were 
expecting earnings of 53 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $7.57 billion, up from $7.05 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	While its profits were better-than-expected, Oesterreicher  
acknowledged that ``our performance in J.C. Penney department 
stores needs further improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The moderately priced department store continues to lose  
shoppers to discount chains, which offer a wider selection and 
better prices, and the trendier, lower-priced specialty stores such 
as Old Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	Penney operates nearly 1,150 department stores in the U.S.,  
Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Chile. In addition, the company operates 
21 Renner department stores in Brazil. Eckerd Drugstores is 
comprised of nearly 2,900 drugstores.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Tuesday, with many investors staying on the sidelines ahead of a 
meeting later in the day in the United States of the Federal Open 
Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 42.40  
points, or 0.26 percent, ending the day at 16,378.62. On Monday, 
the average shed 389.37 points, or 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei fell as most investors retreated to the sidelines to  
await the outcome of the Fed committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar faced selling following  
comments by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus that the U.S. 
current account deficit could affect the currency. Camdessus also 
cautioned that the imbalance could increase U.S. protectionist 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 122.86 yen in late afternoon trading,  
down 0.28 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New 
York level of 123.49 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed slightly higher in  
light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,  
rose 38.50 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 12,627.10. On Monday, 
the index slumped 266.92 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said many investors were awaiting the outcome of the Fed  
committee meeting, which might lead to an increase in interest 
rates because of higher-than-expected inflation in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong interest rates tend to move in line with U.S. rates  
because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices closed sharply higher amid bargain hunting  
that followed four straight days of declines. The Stock Exchange of 
Thailand, or SET, Index rose 13.93 points, or 2.9 percent, to 
481.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares also closed mostly higher, with local bank  
shares stealing the limelight. The Straits Times Index rose 37.37 
points or 2 percent, to 1,917.82. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in banking shares were largely expected following  
Monday's announcement of financial reforms, which include the 
removal of a 40 percent limit on foreign equity ownership in 
Singapore banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed sharply higher as  
investors shrugged off disappointment that Morgan Stanley Capital 
International didn't reinclude Malaysia in its indexes on Monday. 
The Composite Index rose 2.3 percent, or 17.43 points, to 780.29. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Share prices closed sharply lower on continued  
profit-taking in shares that recently posted sharp gains. The 
Composite Index fell 2.2 percent, or 12.914 points, to 577.886.

</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower as investors offloaded shares  
in response to Morgan Stanley Capital International's decision not 
to boost the local bourse's weighting in its MSCI index. The 
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 14.25 points, or 0.2 
percent, to 7,585.51. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers  
attributing the fall to a drop in the share price of market 
heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. following its 
disappointing full year earnings. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital 
Index fell 14.52 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,190.60. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks bounced back from a sharp decline the  
previous day, but the rebound was capped by anxiety over the 
outcome of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in 
the day. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 14.71 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,468.30.

	SEOUL: Share prices closed generally mixed, but the key index

<HEADLINE> NCAA Baseball Sites Selected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Six newcomers and perennial choice  
Florida State were among 16 schools selected Monday as regional 
hosts in the NCAA's expanded 64-team baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The host schools are all guaranteed invitations to the  
tournament. The entire field will be announced on May 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional hosts are: Alabama; Arkansas; Auburn; Baylor;  
Florida State; Houston; Louisiana State; Miami; Notre Dame; Ohio 
State; Southern California; Stanford; Texas A&AMP;M; Texas Tech; Wake 
Forest; and Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Baylor, Houston, Notre Dame, Ohio State and Wake  
Forest will all be serving as regional hosts for the first time. It 
will be Auburn's first since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	For perennial power Florida State it's the 15th time in 17  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the four-team, double-elimination regionals will be held  
May 28-30. The champion of each regional advances to the ``super 
regionals,'' at eight sites to be announced May 31. The winners of 
the best-of-3 super regionals will play in the College World Series 
in Omaha, Neb., beginning June 11. 
</P>
<P>
	In another new twist, the regionals will be referred to by the  
name of the city where the host school is located instead of by 
geographic designation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that two regionals will be in the Northern area  
of the country,'' said Dick Rockwell, chairman of the Division I 
baseball committee. ``One of the criticisms our committee received 
over the years is that we go South with everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell admitted the committee took note of the almost yearly  
selection of Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should a team be penalized for being (No.) 1 or 2 in the  
country? For drawing big crowds? For having good athletes? For 
running a class tournament?'' Rockwell asked. ``We realized the 
fact we send them there every year. I can honestly say we discussed 
that. But if you look at several scenarios, you'd have to make a 
good case why you wouldn't put one there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the committee urged several Northeastern schools to  
bid for a regional, none did, Rockwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set up some things to help the Northeast and nobody stepped  
forward,'' said Rockwell, athletic director at LeMoyne College in 
Syracuse, N.Y. ``I'm extremely disappointed. I personally talked to 
a lot of conferences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regionals will all be held on campus sites except at Wake  
Forest, which will use Ernie Shore Field, home of the Class-A 
Winston-Salem Warthogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament had been a 48-team format since 1987. Before  
that, it was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``College baseball over the last 3 to 4 years has gotten bigger  
and better. This is just another area where this is going to 
increase it,'' Rockwell said. ``We're extremely excited about the 
super regionals. I think it's going to market college baseball like 
it's never been marketed before.''

	Yugoslavia Says It's Ready for Deal  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A senior Yugoslav official said  
Tuesday that Belgrade is ready to ``cut a deal'' on Kosovo despite 
unspecified ``reservations'' about the formula put forward by the 
United States and its major European partners. Meanwhile, two Serb 
prisoners of war released by the United States, were handed back to 
Yugoslavia at a Hungarian border post as NATO renewed its attacks 
on Yugoslavia. Alliance missiles hit at least four cities in raids 
that Yugoslav media said killed one woman and injured 12.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House easily approved a $15 billion  
package Tuesday to pay for the bombing in Yugoslavia, and Senate

all but assured on the package, which includes $12 billion to cover 
U.S. costs of NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia.

	Senate OKs Gun Locks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted 78-20  
Tuesday to require the sale of ``secure gun storage or safety 
devices'' with handguns. The provision also includes liability 
protections for a gun owner who uses a safety lock and whose gun is 
stolen and used in a crime. The gun lock proposal was crafted by 
Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and embraced by 
Handgun Control, a gun control advocacy organization. Senate 
Republicans last week first approved a provision for voluntary 
background checks in certain instances at gun shows. They then 
backtracked and muscled through a proposal they said would require 
checks for all sales.

	'Star Wars' Makes Midnight Debuts

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Undaunted by bad reviews, thousands of fans  
lucky enough to get tickets lined up outside theaters across the 
country Tuesday to see the new ``Star Wars'' movie. In New York 
City, the film debuted early Wednesday before 1,162 moviegoers who 
paid $9.50 each for reserved seats at the Ziegfeld Theater. It's a 
foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time. The only 
question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach 
the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Britain and the Netherlands are willing to  
allow foreign oil companies to invest in Iraq if Baghdad cooperates 
with U.N. arms inspectors, diplomats said Tuesday. The revised 
British-Dutch draft resolution falls short of a Russian proposal to 
lift economic sanctions against Iraq once a system to monitor its 
weapons programs is in place. Still, the draft aims at a compromise 
between moderate members of the Security Council who want to 
improve life for Iraqis suffering under sanctions imposed in 1990 
and the United States, which has been more cautious in suggesting 
improvements to the U.N. program.

Mayor Frank Rizzo. With 81 percent of precincts reporting from all 
over the city, John Street, a former City Council president, had 
86,212 votes, or 36 percent. Political insider Marty Weinberg had 
73,036 votes, or 31 percent. The winner will face businessman Sam 
Katz, who was unopposed in the GOP primary and is seeking to become 
Philadelphia's first Republican mayor since 1952.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch: Crackdown Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch warned Tuesday his organization will continue its 
crackdown on members accepting bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very tough with members who were guilty regarding Salt  
Lake City,'' Samaranch said at a news conference. ``If a new case 
appears, we will act in the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's successful  
bid for the 2002 Winter Games resulted in 10 IOC members resigning 
or being expelled in the biggest purge in the committee's 105-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who is visiting Prague to celebrate the 100th  
anniversary of the Czech Olympic Committee, insisted that the IOC 
could not have acted sooner to head off the vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had many rumors that the behavior of some members of the  
committee was not right,'' Samaranch said. ``But we cannot act on 
rumors. We need facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however, that it takes two to bribe: ``one party who  
is offering, and the other one who is taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also dismissed concerns that sponsors might pull out  
of the games because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next year we will have the Olympic Games in Sydney, and not a  
single sponsor withdrew,'' Samaranch said. ``And yesterday, we had 
a very good news coming from Salt Lake City: new sponsors are 
coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not provide details, but on Friday the Salt Lake Olympic  
Committee announced the first new national sponsor in nearly a 
year. Marker Ltd. of Salt Lake will supply all the uniforms for 
staff at the games, a sponsorship worth at least $20 million.

<HEADLINE> Street Wins Philly Mayor Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A black politician trying to live down his  
past as a hot-tempered activist won the city's Democratic mayoral 
primary Tuesday over a white lawyer tied to controversial former 
Mayor Frank Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
	With 97 percent of precincts reporting, John Street, a former  
City Council president, had 100,597 votes, or 35 percent. Political 
insider Marty Weinberg had 88,564 votes, or 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so very grateful to be here this evening, and as most of  
you know, this has been a long and a hard-fought campaign,'' Street 
told supporters after thrusting his fist in the air. ``We have 
communicated a message of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former state welfare secretary John White Jr. had 61,425 votes,  
or 22 percent, and three lesser-known Democrats split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	They were vying to succeed popular Mayor Edward G. Rendell, a  
Democrat who is credited with bringing the nation's fifth-largest 
city back from the brink of financial ruin. He is barred from 
seeking a third consecutive term. 
</P>
<P>
	Street will face businessman Sam Katz, who was unopposed in the  
GOP primary and is seeking to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. The general election is Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a political unknown in January but raised more than  
$5.2 million and launched an unprecedented advertising blitz. 
Street raised more than $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Weinberg's TV commercials were aimed squarely at Street,  
the front-runner throughout the race. Weinberg reminded voters of 
Street's past as a community activist, showing old TV footage of 
Street shoving a reporter and throwing a cup of water on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg also played up Street's financial problems, pointing  
out that he defaulted on his student loans and declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The negative advertising led to criticism that Weinberg was  
playing to racial fears. Street mostly ignored the attacks, 
although he came out with an ad four days before the election that 
accused Weinberg of racial divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 percent of Philadelphia's 1.5 million people are  
black, and black leaders repeatedly called for at least one of the 
three black candidates to drop out of the race to give the 
remaining ones a better chance. Their pleas were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, meanwhile, had to answer questions about his long  
political relationship with Rizzo, whose administration was blamed 
for police brutality and financial mismanagement. Weinberg defended 
Rizzo as a good man who made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the issues, there was surprising consensus.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the candidates promised to focus on the neighborhoods,  
whose residents felt neglected during the city's downtown building 
boom. The candidates said the mayor should play a bigger role in 
improving city schools and promised to build on Rendell's legacy of 
economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Jordan's New King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --President Clinton warmly welcomed King Abdullah  
to the White House today and said the United States is committed to 
help fixing Jordan's troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that Jordan can receive some relief on its debt problem  
from other countries,'' Clinton said. ``The United States has 
already done about all we can on that. We've done quite a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Abdullah posed for pictures in the Oval Office. The  
king, speaking in English, expressed thanks for U.S. support for 
Jordan over the years. He also said ``we're very, very optimistic'' 
about the Mideast peace process after the election of 
soldier-turned-peacemaker Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first visit to the United States since he assumed the  
throne on the death of his father, King Hussein, three months ago, 
Abdullah walked to the White House from Blair House, the government 
guest quarters on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Any political or social chaos in Jordan after Hussein died Feb.  
7 would have quickly affected the country's economy, already 
burdened by debt, ravaged by U.N. sanctions against Iraq, its 
neighbor and biggest trading partner, and struggling to shake off 
nagging recession. So far, Abdullah's transition from obscure 
military officer to monarch has been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Monday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,  
Abdullah expressed thanks for economic support the United States 
has provided Jordan over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do our utmost to move the Jordanian economy in the right  
direction so that we can get ourselves on our own two feet again 
and be able to shoulder our responsibilities,'' the 37-year-old 
monarch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright encouraged Abdullah to seek additional American help.  
She said the Clinton administration already is encouraging trade 
and investment in the Arab kingdom and providing wheat to help 
overcome a drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's economic condition was at least as much a topic on the  
king's visit as the Arab-Israeli dispute. The peace agreement his 
father signed with Israel in 1994 has not produced the hoped-for 
economic miracle to pull the kingdom out of its doldrums, and the 
Clinton administration has its checkbook ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is urging Japan, Germany, France and other creditor  
nations to cancel or postpone payment of Jordan's debts to help the 
new king cope with his faltering economy, which is growing at 1 
percent or less a year under a foreign debt burden of $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment, officially calculated at 15 percent, is probably  
closer to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton already has forgiven Jordan's $700 million debt to the  
United States and is providing $200 million in annual aid. On top 
of that, he has asked Congress for $100 million this year with $200 
million to follow over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan is a critical ally in the region and a key part of the  
peace process,'' Martin Indyk, assistant secretary of state for the 
Near East, told reporters before Abdullah's arrival Friday from 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah also held talks Monday with Stanley Fisher, deputy  
chief of the International Monetary Fund, on completing a new 
three-year loan agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley said after meeting Abdullah at  
Blair House that the United States is committed to forging stronger 
economic links with Jordan. Daley said he would lead a trade 
mission there this year.

	Hastert Getting Tough on Gun Control  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert suggested today  
raising the age of possession from 18 to 21 for handguns and 
requiring background checks for all sales at gun shows. ``I think 
there needs to be uniformity in what they do at gun shows and what 
they do in a retail business,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said in an 
interview. Hastert made his comments shortly before the 
Republican-controlled Senate voted 78-20 to require the sale of 
``secure gun storage or safety devices'' with handguns. The 
provision also provides liability protections for a gun owner who 
uses a safety lock and whose gun is stolen and used in a crime. 

</P>
<P>
	School Victims Address Lawmakers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Students who experienced school violence spoke  
today of shootings and bomb threats that left them scared and 
feeling helpless -- and urged lawmakers to work to prevent such 
tragedies. The teen-agers made suggestions to a House subcommittee, 
including more parental involvement and more opportunities for 
students to get counseling. Lawmakers had other suggestions 
regarding school violence, such as introducing more moral teachings 
into schools and gun control.

	Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates  
unchanged today but put financial markets on notice that it is 
poised to raise rates if inflation concerns continue to build. 
Following last week's worrisome jump in consumer prices, the 
Federal Open Market Committee said it has adopted a policy stance 
that tilts toward future interest rate increases. Many economists 
viewed the announcement as a warning that rates could go up as 
early as the central bank's next meeting June 29-30. Stocks gave up 
some gains after the announcement but the Dow industrial average 
closed down just 16.52 points at 10,836.95.

	NATO Considers Larger Peace Force  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo will  
likely involve 45,000 to 50,000 soldiers, instead of the 28,000 
contemplated before the air war began, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon said today. Bacon said the force has been increased because 
of ``all the changes that have taken place in Kosovo.'' The 
peacekeeping force would maintain order after the nearly 
2-month-old NATO airstrikes end. Bacon said it is not meant to 
impose order in a hostile environment nor to serve as a ground 
army. A senior Yugoslav official said today that Belgrade is ready 
to ``cut a deal'' as long as Yugoslavia's ``territorial integrity'' 
is preserved -- meaning no independence for Kosovo.

	DALLAS (AP) -- First-quarter profits for Dell Computer Corp., the  
nation's largest direct seller of computers, increased 42 percent

said today it earned $434 million, or 16 cents per diluted share, 
in the quarter ended April 30, up from $305 million, or 11 cents 
per diluted share, in the same period last year. The profits met 
analysts' expectations. Dell shares rose 81 1/4 cents today to 
$44.06 1/4.

	Ford on Trial in $3B Fraud Suit  
</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A fraud suit against Ford Motor Co. went  
to trial today over allegations that the automaker hid a 
potentially dangerous stalling problem from government regulators 
and 3 million California customers. Ford decided in 1982 to save $4 
per vehicle by mounting an ignition device over the engine despite 
warnings that high temperatures would cause the device to fail and 
stall the engine, attorney Paul D. Nelson told a Superior Court 
jury. He said the warning was borne out by a flood of complaints 
from customers and dealers, replacement of the devices in 15 
million vehicles over 17 years, and high-level company studies 
confirming the problem.

close down 16.52 at 10,836.95. On the NYSE, declining issues 
outnumbered advancers 1,611-1,369. The Nasdaq composite index

	BOSTON (AP) -- Joe Torre returned as manager of the New York  
Yankees today, taking over the team two months after undergoing 
surgery for prostate cancer. Torre, who has guided the Yankees to 
two World Series championships in three years, joined the club for 
the start of a three-game series at Fenway Park. At 21-15, the 
Yankees held a one-half game lead over the Red Sox in the AL East. 
Bench coach Don Zimmer had managed the Yankees since Torre had 
surgery March 18.

	Interest Rates Left Unchanged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve ended closed-door  
discussions today with a decision to leave interest rates 
unchanged. But Fed policy-makers announced they had revised their 
policy bias to show the central bank was leaning toward an increase 
in rates in coming months should inflationary pressures increase. 
This marked the Fed's first use of a new procedure, put into effect 
in December, by which the central bank immediately informs the 
public of major shifts in its views about the balance of risks to 
the economy. In the past, the central bank has waited eight weeks 
before revealing in its minutes any changes in its policy bias. 
Stocks gave up some gain immediately after the announcement, but 
the Dow Jones industrial average closed down just 16.52 at 
10,836.95.

	Milosevic Open to Peace Proposal  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Proclaiming moral victory, a senior  
Yugoslav official said today that Belgrade is ready to ``cut a 
deal'' on Kosovo despite unspecified ``reservations'' about the 
formula put forward by the United States and its major European 
partners. Two Serb prisoners of war released by the United States, 
meanwhile, were handed back to Yugoslavia in drizzling weather at a 
Hungarian border post. In the meantime, NATO renewed its attacks on 
Yugoslavia. Alliance missiles hit at least four cities in raids 
that Yugoslav media said killed one woman and injured 12.

	Clinton Calls Apache Pilot Risk High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The vaunted Apache attack helicopters that  
were to have added a unique punch to NATO's air campaign are 
unlikely to see combat over Kosovo anytime soon. The risk to pilots 
is simply too great, President Clinton said today, after the 
Pentagon dispatched more ground-attack A-10 jets instead. Weather 
is a factor because the Apaches are designed to fly low -- just a 
few feet off the ground if necessary. Thus, they can operate below 
the cloud cover that bedeviled Air Force attack planes earlier in 
Operation Allied Force. But in recently improved weather 
conditions, that no longer is an advantage. And Serb soldiers would 
be able to shoot the helicopters out of the sky with shoulder-fired 
missiles.

	Barak Promises a Secure Peace

	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Winning a crushing victory over  
hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barak promised 
today to forge a secure peace with the Palestinians, pull troops 
out of Lebanon in a year and heal the deep divisions among 
Israelis. In an emotional speech, Barak promised tens of thousands 
of supporters that he would continue the path of peace forged by 
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He spoke in Rabin Square -- the 
wide plaza in Tel Aviv where Rabin was gunned down in 1995. Barak 
has modeled himself after Rabin, a tough soldier-turned-peacemaker 
who signed historic peace accords with Jordan and the Palestinians.

	Scientists Discover Bone Mass Gene  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Scientists have discovered a gene that appears to  
control bone density, opening the way to possible new treatments 
for crippling osteoporosis. Researchers from the biotechnology 
company Chiroscience R&AMP;D found the gene in a small group of South 
Africans suffering from an inherited disease that is the opposite 
of osteoporosis -- these patients can die because their bones grow 
too dense and large. A mutation in the gene appears responsible for 
making bone grow out of control. Chiroscience hopes to harness the 
protein this gene produces and turn it into a drug that might 
increase the bone mass of people with osteoporosis.

fill job openings and it's hampering the industry's growth. That 
employee shortage is translating into a $3 billion loss for local 
high tech companies, according to a study. The study says the 
workforce shortage is driven in part by a lack of interest among 
area high school students in high tech careers.

<HEADLINE> Makah Indians Celebrate Whale Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- The ancient taste of tradition was  
brought back to the Makah Indians on a chilly Pacific beach -- the 
nutty, slightly salty taste of whale blubber, freshly butchered 
from the corpse of a female gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Indians gathered in a cold drizzle as the first  
whale landed by the tribe in more than 70 years was brought ashore 
by the whaling crew Monday, culminating months of preparation and 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists decried the killing, which was accomplished  
through a combination of the traditional -- the cedar canoe, its 
hand-carved paddles and the whalers' ritual prayers -- and the 
modern, including .50-caliber rifles and motorized boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously very upset that the Makah went ahead with  
killing an innocent, sentient creature in such a bloody and 
untraditional way,'' said Jake Conroy of the anti-whaling group Sea 
Defense Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	It took about 11 hours for a Makah fishing boat to tow the whale  
home to this waterfront community of 2,400 people, which is tucked 
into the shoulder of Cape Flattery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah welcomed the whale with sacred songs, an honor guard  
escort and ceremonies. Harpooner Theron Parker performed a ritual 
to release the soul of the whale to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here for my great-grandfather,'' said Ron Johnson, who  
grew up hearing stories about his whaling forebears and traveled 
over 100 miles to be part of the celebration. ``He's dancing in 
heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No living Makah had whaled until now, and only a few elders  
remembered the taste of whale meat. Some who didn't remember wanted 
to know what they had been missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Eli, `You're not going to school today. This is a  
historic day for the Makah,''' said young mother Rebekah Greene as 
the 30-foot, 5-inch whale was butchered on the beach in fading 
daylight. 
</P>
<P>
	Far into the night, members of the community pitched in to help  
carve up the animal, peeling back an inch-thick layer of blubber to 
reveal the whale's red meat. The animal was believed to be at least 
3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny slivers of blubber -- rubbery and white, attached to the  
whale's dark skin -- were handed out for people to try. It had a 
nutty flavor, a little salty, and could be chewed for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Some meat will be cured for a few days in preparation for a big  
feast -- probably this weekend -- for the Makah and visitors. Some 
will be distributed to tribal members, with the blubber rendered 
into oil for cooking and dipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe is guaranteed whaling rights by its 1855 treaty, but  
the Makah tradition stopped in the 1920s, when commercial whaling 
decimated global whale populations. 
</P>
<P>
	When gray whales were taken off the Endangered Species List in  
1994, the tribe moved to resume whale hunts. The United States 
supported the tribe's bid before the International Whaling 
Commission, and in 1997 the tribe was given the go-ahead to hunt a 
total of 20 whales through 2004. Federal scientists estimate 
current gray-whale numbers at about 26,000, up from an estimated 
low of about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunt was filmed by helicopters and shown across the region.  
Makah whalers struck the giant mammal repeatedly with harpoons and 
with two shots from a high-powered rifle, staining the choppy 
waters with blood in an attack that lasted eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah, whose fishing and logging enterprises have struggled  
with the decline of those resources, hope the hunt will help 
restore tradition and pride. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful hunt ``restores a missing link in our heritage,''  
said Arnie Hunter, vice president of the tribal whaling commission, 
who was in a support boat when the whale was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-whaling demonstrators, who were here for two months last  
fall and returned as early as March to oppose the hunt, were not 
present when the whale was killed. Conroy said activists would 
renew their protests if the Makah try to kill another. 
</P>
<P>
	The communal hunt, involving many families, was considered the  
best way to resurrect the tradition by pooling available resources. 
The next hunt, which has not been scheduled, will be a family 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tribe's own management plan, members must use up the  
whale killed Monday before embarking on another hunt. Tribal 
leaders say the next hunt may not take place until fall, when the 
whale migration is heading in the opposite direction.

<HEADLINE> Macim Hotel Casino Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The Maxim hotel-casino has been sold to a  
time-share developer in a $40 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Interval Resorts purchased the property from West Coast  
Mortgage Limited of Newport, Calif. in a deal that closed late 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the sale will have no effect on the hotel's 850  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' said Ed Nigro, whose Max Gaming LLC will  
continue to hold a lease to operate the hotel. ``I think we'll see 
some invested capital into the Maxim. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, West Coast foreclosed on the 800-room Maxim and  
signed a five-year lease with Nigro, a longtime Las Vegas casino 
executive. The move came following a series of legal disputes with 
then-Maxim owner John Anderson.

the 1997 killing of John Dunagan. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, who sentenced him to one to three years, said she had  
received scores of letters calling for leniency. And Lancaster 
County Attorney Gary Lacey said the case was one of the most 
wrenching of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family went through what I think was fairly unbelievable  
abuse ... incessant and pounding,'' Lacey said. But he added, ``I 
do not think there was any legal justification for Matthew to kill 
his father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Karen Flowers said she would recommend that Dunagan serve  
his sentence in a community corrections center so he could continue 
attending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on the four-year 
scholarship he was awarded for getting straight A's in high school. 
He has been free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the elder Dunagan, who had been abusive for  
years, said after arguing with his wife one night that he might 
kill her. Matthew went to his room, got the shotgun, came back 
downstairs and shot his father twice in the chest as he lay on a 
couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was overwhelming fear in that house that night -- pure  
evil,'' defense attorney John Stevens Berry said. ``A holocaust of 
evil ... he became unable to cope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunagan was originally charged with murder, but he pleaded no  
contest in December to a reduced charge of manslaughter and use of 
a weapon to commit a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Before sentencing, Dunagan read a statement he had written on a  
piece of notebook paper expressing remorse for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have taken the guns out of the house months before,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Ambassador Nominee Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- J. Brian Atwood, who has headed the U.S.  
foreign aid agency for six years, today withdrew his nomination to 
be ambassador to Brazil, saying Senate confirmation was unlikely 
because of the opposition of Sen. Jesse Helms. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood said Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee, apparently based his opposition on the 
campaign Atwood waged to defeat Helms' proposal to merge the aid 
agency with the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, whose formal title is administrator of the U.S. Agency  
for International Development, said Helms apparently ``believes 
that I pursued this administration position too vigorously. I 
regret that he feels this way but I do not regret fighting for the 
independence of USAID.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to obtain comment from Helms' office were unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
	Helms had proposed merging USAID, the U.S. Information Agency  
and the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State 
Department. Of the three agencies slated for the merger, only USAID 
retained its independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Helms' opposition killed the nomination of former  
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld to be ambassador to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood noted there has been no U.S. ambassador to Brazil since  
Ambassador Melvyn Levitsky left in 1998. ``I have concluded that, 
were I to persist in pursuing this nomination, I would only delay 
further the appointment of an ambassador to this vitally important 
country,'' Atwood said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was clear that Helms will continue to block the  
nomination. He added that, as committee chairman, Helms' 
prerogatives are rarely challenged and ``even more rarely 
challenged with any success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to serving as head of USAID, Atwood has more  
recently assumed duties as chairman of the president's humanitarian 
relief effort for Kosovo. He indicated that he plans to leave both 
posts in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Drug Cuts Sneezing, Wheezing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A cure for the common cold may exist.  
</P>
<P>
	An experimental cold remedy called tremacamra cut sneezing,  
runny noses and congestion nearly in half, researchers reported in 
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether the drug will work on the many viruses known to  
cause colds has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	All 177 volunteers who participated in the study were given the  
same cold bug -- type 39 rhinovirus, said researchers led by Dr. 
Ronald B. Turner of the Medical University of South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhinoviruses commonly cause colds, but at least 100 subtypes of  
rhinoviruses exist; many colds are caused by other viruses such as 
cornaviruses and flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Tremacamra works by blocking rhinoviruses from attaching to one  
particular molecule on the outside of cells that the virus needs 
for a biological anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug was inhaled daily as a nasal spray or nasal powder for  
several days at about the time the people were infected. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not associated with the study, which was funded by  
tremacamra manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, said 
it should encourage further research. 
</P>
<P>
	But real-world effectiveness and long-term safety need to be  
established, said the expert, Dr. Kenneth McIntosh of Children's 
Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Sawyer, Gibson, ABC Agree To Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There will be many, many more early mornings for  
Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo have agreed to stay on for another year as hosts of  
ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' the troubled news show that has 
been revived since they came aboard in January. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News President David Westin told advertisers Tuesday that  
Gibson and Sawyer will remain in place until at least May 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had such a great time that they've agreed to stay  
on,'' Westin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer and Gibson were billed as a temporary fix when they  
replaced Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman in January. At the time, 
Sawyer said she expected to work on the show for only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, viewership for ``Good Morning America'' has gone up  
27 percent, good enough for second place behind NBC's ``Today'' in 
the ratings.

<HEADLINE> Indy Rookie Learns the Hard Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- When a race driver is heading toward Turn 3,  
it's not a good idea to be facing Turn 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Borkowski learned that the hard way -- a 200 mph reverse  
spin into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have a lot of time to test before we came out  
here,'' the rookie driver said Tuesday. ``The biggest thing we're 
working on right now is me, getting me up to speed, comfortable 
with the car, the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borkowski was the SCCA Trans-Am rookie of the year in 1997. He  
competed last season in Indy Lights for Team Rahal and is entered 
in the May 30 Indianapolis 500 with the low-budget PDM Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Borkowski wasn't hurt, but the left side of his G Force-Aurora  
was damaged after he spun into the wall Monday. Without a backup 
car, his hopes of qualifying on Saturday or Sunday depend on how 
quickly his crew can make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car works better but it's not so different, say, than an  
Indy Lights car, so I feel I can get a decent feedback from the 
get-go,'' said the Dublin, Ohio, driver, who blamed a gust for his 
crash. ``That will get a lot better as I experience more and more 
changes with the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borkowski managed only six laps on Monday and 28 laps in his  
repaired car on Tuesday, with a top speed of 207.977 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Practice was delayed Tuesday because of a morning rain, leaving  
only three full days of practice before qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Goodyear was fastest Tuesday at 223.842 mph. Stephan  
Gregoire improved his top lap to 223.647, followed by Kenny Brack 
at 223.447 and Greg Ray at 223.214. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need laps,'' Borkowski said. ``It could be windy on race  
day. ... A couple laps before that seemed fine and suddenly I got 
my nose pinned down. It felt like a gust of wind. Now, on a day as 
windy as yesterday, you have to pay a little more attention, maybe 
be a little more cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His top lap Monday was 212.389 mph, more than 3 mph slower than  
his best the day before, when track conditions were better. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get more mad than anything, worried about the car getting  
hurt,'' he said. ``I'm fine. I feel OK physically. I just feel very 
bad for my guys. They've been working very hard and we're not a 
big-dollar team, so this was tough for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first four days of practice, there have been four  
crashes: Billy Boat on Sunday and Borkowski, Scott Harrington and 
Boat again on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said his car ``just didn't want to steer,'' and now  
he's down to one car. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Schmidt, who started sixth last year but finished 26th after  
a seven-car crash early in the race, said drivers know the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know people have gotten hurt doing this, but this is my  
lifelong dream. This is everybody's dream that's out here,'' 
Schmidt said. ``You can't dwell on the risks, otherwise you'll go 
slow. And sometimes there's more risk going slow than going fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when the car's good, like Saturday, 224 wasn't probably as  
difficult as some of the laps I ran in the wind yesterday,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Indy 500 winner Eddie Cheever, who has worked with  
rookies as a car owner-driver the past three years, was watching a 
Speedway television monitor when Harrington crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he tells his drivers about safety, Cheever said: ``I  
tell them, `Crashing is not an option. Don't even consider it.' 
They have to leave themselves enough room until they understand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them, `That's a very hard wall, and if you spin you  
could kill yourself, or nothing could happen. So you make that 
decision.'''

<HEADLINE> Report Details Boxing Payoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boxing promoters and managers say the sport's  
sanctioning bodies sometimes sell the rankings that lead to more 
lucrative bouts, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters also have paid for the annual conventions of the three  
major sanctioning bodies -- the World Boxing Association, the World 
Boxing Council and the International Boxing Federation, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three organizations, while acknowledging that promoters do  
fund their conventions, denied any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 3,500-word story, the Times reported that it uncovered  
allegations of widespread abuse in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Alleged payments are being investigated by a federal grand jury  
in Newark, N.J. The Times reported that witnesses have testified 
that some payments to the sanctioning bodies were made in cash, but 
that others were less obvious, such as those contained in 
overpayments of standard fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just common knowledge that if you want to get something  
done, you have got to grease their palms,'' said Ron Weathers, a 
manager in Texas who was subpoenaed by the grand jury in New 
Jersey. ``Either $10,000 or $20,000, depending on where you want 
the guy rated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weathers said he had made numerous cash payments.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Hipp, a struggling heavyweight Weathers managed, rose  
through the rankings and was given a title fight against WBA 
champion Bruce Seldon in 1995. Seldon won on a TKO in the 10th 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't call you up and openly solicit you,'' Weathers  
said. ``You have to approach them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said many payoffs came at the annual WBA, WBC and IBF  
conventions. He did not disclose specific dates or amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody came with bags of money,'' Weathers said. ``They  
tell you who to pay. You hand them the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King defended the sanctioning bodies and called the  
accusations against them ``devious things, categorical lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to give the perception of impropriety in these  
organizations because it is the popular thing to do now, after 
Holyfield-Lewis,'' King told the Times. He was referring to the 
judges' controversial decision that declared the Evander 
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis bout a draw and allowed Holyfield to retain 
the IBF crown. 
</P>
<P>
	WBC and WBA officials denied accepting improper payments. IBF  
president Bob Lee, who is involved in the grand jury hearings in 
New Jersey, refused to comment on the advice of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are absolute lies and these are not people you should  
pay attention to,'' WBC president Jose Sulaiman told the Times. ``I 
have never, ever, received anything from anybody in return for 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High rankings have become increasingly important because of  
their value to fights carried by pay-per-view telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	King told the newspaper that he has helped pay for conventions  
held by the sanctioning bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to play, you've got to pay,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rival promoter Bob Arum said that as far back as 1983, he paid  
$500,000 to a Puerto Rican promoter whom Arum described as a 
``bagman'' for the WBA. The Puerto Rican promoter has denied the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said that was the only way a promoter could do business in  
those days, but, ``Now, if it looks like it has to be done, I try 
to stay away.''

<HEADLINE> Washington Monument Catches the Eye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``It looks better like this'' has become a  
cliche uttered by tourists who visit the Washington Monument that's 
covered -- all 555 feet, 5 1/8 inches of it -- in scaffolding and blue 
fabric for its restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Other visitors hope the $9.6 million repair job will be finished  
quickly so the scaffolding can be removed and the obelisk, which 
symbolizes the nation's capital for Americans, can stand tall, 
unadorned again on the city skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	Under repair or not, visitors still trek to the monument at the  
normal pace -- as many as 2,200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	From afar, people can spot the solemn gray shaft behind the  
sheer fabric, which is laid over an aluminum framework. The wrapped 
effect is equally dramatic under lights at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments span the gamut,'' said David Barna, chief  
spokesman for the National Park Service. ``Some people actually 
think it looks better, especially at night. At night, it's a gem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl D. Mehaffie, a retired teacher from Greenville, Ohio,  
isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more beautiful without the scaffolding, but I suppose  
it's necessary,'' Mehaffie said. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Mary Ann, who teaches first grade, was equally firm,  
but she likes it with the scaffolding. 
</P>
<P>
	Toria Banks, a perky 11-year-old fifth-grader from Columbia,  
Md., found it ``really nice,'' but she was thoughtful about it. 
``Well, I think it's good for this time,'' she said. ``But I think 
it needs to come down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yanni Poulakis, a retired engineering officer from the Greek  
navy, is glad the monument is being restored. ``I like to see old 
things preserved, like the Acropolis at home,'' he said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue fabric spares people from having to ``stare at  
disfiguring scaffolding for a couple of years,'' said J. Carter 
Brown, chairman of the capital's Fine Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The scaffolding exactly follows the shape of the monument,  
making the monument 8 feet thicker on each of its four sides. The 
frame rests gently against the stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could stand on its own -- the scaffolding supports itself,''  
says architect Michael Graves. 
</P>
<P>
	American architects rarely play games with scaffolding. But in  
Paris the restoration of the Madeleine, an 18th century church that 
looks like a Greek temple, took place behind huge paintings that 
fooled some visitors into thinking they saw the actual facade. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Washington Monument got such a thorough  
working-over was at the start of President Franklin Roosevelt's New 
Deal 65 years ago. Then the scaffolding was made of ordinary 
lumber. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards said the scaffolding hasn't discouraged visitors, though  
it makes it harder for those with cameras to snap the tremendous 
views from the top -- the Capitol, the White House, the Lincoln 
Memorial and the Potomac River -- down toward George Washington's 
own Mount Vernon, across the Potomac.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Backs New Controls on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Entering the fierce debate over gun control,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert on Tuesday suggested raising the age 
of possession from 18 to 21 for handguns and requiring background 
checks for all sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there needs to be uniformity in what they do at gun  
shows and what they do in a retail business,'' Hastert, R-Ill., 
said in an interview in his Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, he said, ``I'm just saying 21 is basically a standard  
of adulthood, and there's probably a uniformity that fits there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made his comments as the Senate struggled to escape a  
partisan stalemate over gun control, with Democrats pressing for 
stronger measures than Republicans will accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert emphasized that he was speaking for himself and not  
attempting to dictate the provisions of legislation. In fact, he 
said, the entire issue of gun control will have to be vetted 
thoroughly within the GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his comments underscored the change that has taken place  
on the issue in the wake of last month's shootings at a Colorado 
high school. Hastert, who represents a district outside Chicago, 
voted against the so-called Brady law in 1993, which instituted a 
three-day waiting period for handgun purchasers and established the 
system of instant background checks that supplanted it. He also 
voted against 1994 legislation to ban certain types of assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he said, he expects gun control to reach the House  
floor eventually as part of legislation to stiffen prosecution of 
juvenile offenders, just as a bill pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Republicans and Democrats spent the morning blaming one  
another for slowing the progress of legislation that encompasses 
fresh restrictions on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott criticized Democrats for refusing to  
agree to an expedited plan for a final vote. ``I want this ... bill 
done,'' the Mississippi Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered that Republicans were attempting to usher  
the bill into oblivion without accepting blame for scuttling a gun 
control bill less than a month after the shooting in Littleton, 
Colo., shocked the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority leader wants this bill to fade away without a  
roar or a whimper and without any Republican blame,'' said Sen. 
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, senior Democrat on the Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans last week first approved a provision for  
voluntary background checks in certain instances at gun shows. They 
then backtracked and muscled through a proposal they said would 
require checks for all sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the plan was riddled with loopholes, though, and  
additional votes were expected on the politically charged issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been a public relations nightmare for  
Republicans, GOP aides concede, with lawmakers reversing course 
while Democrats accuse them of doing the bidding of the National 
Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun shows, in particular, have emerged as a flashpoint during  
the Senate gun debate. Current law requires all federally licensed 
dealers to conduct background checks, just as they are required to 
do in their retail outlets. But other, private dealers may sell 
guns without verifying the background of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In his comments, Hastert offered a suggestion that seemed to  
track the Democratic proposal in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	His own view, he said, is ``some ... parallel with what we do in  
stores and what we do in gun shows as far as waiting periods and 
those types of things.'' The waiting period has given way to an 
instant background check in current law. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the age of possession of handguns, Hastert said, ``I  
think also the situation where you have kids who can't buy alcohol 
till they're 21 years of age but they can go out and buy a handgun, 
and I believe there needs to be some conformity to those types of 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	States currently regulate liquor possession, but Hastert said he  
wasn't suggesting 50 different laws for handgun possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just saying 21 is basically a standard of adulthood and  
saying there's probably a uniformity that fits here'' in the gun 
debate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun control debate was dormant for several years, as  
Democrats shied away from it for fear of inflicting political 
damage on their own rank-and-file from Western and Southern states. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue has flared since the Columbine High School  
shootings, as gun control advocates have pointed repeatedly to 
thousands of children deaths annually due to gun shot wounds.

<HEADLINE> Street Leads Philly Mayor Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A black politician trying to live down his  
past as a hot-tempered activist was in a close race in the city's 
Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday with a white lawyer tied to 
controversial former Mayor Frank Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
	With 40 percent of precincts reporting, John Street, a black  
former City Council president, had 42,153 votes, or 36 percent. 
Marty Weinberg, a white political insider, had 36,629 votes, or 32 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state welfare secretary John White Jr. had 24,691 votes,  
or 21 percent, and three lesser-known Democrats split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	They were vying to succeed popular Mayor Edward G. Rendell, a  
Democrat who is credited with bringing the city back from the brink 
of financial ruin but is barred from seeking a third consecutive 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will face businessman Sam Katz, who was unopposed in  
the GOP primary and is seeking to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was doing well in the blue-collar rowhouse  
neighborhoods of the nation's fifth-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Street was running strong in his base in northern Philadelphia.  
But he had to battle with White and another candidates for the 
black vote. More than 40 percent of Philadelphia's 1.5 million 
people are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders repeatedly called for at least one of the three  
black candidates to drop out of the race to give the remaining ones 
a better chance. Their pleas were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a political unknown in January but raised more than  
$5.2 million and launched an unprecedented advertising blitz. 
Street raised more than $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Weinberg's TV commercials were aimed squarely at Street,  
the front-runner throughout the race. Weinberg reminded voters of 
Street's past as a community activist, showing old TV footage of 
Street shoving a reporter and throwing a cup of water on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg also played up Street's financial problems, pointing  
out that he defaulted on his student loans and declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The negative advertising led to criticism that Weinberg was  
playing to racial fears. Street mostly ignored the attacks, 
although he came out with an ad four days before the election that 
accused Weinberg of racial divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, meanwhile, had to answer questions about his long  
political relationship with Rizzo, whose administration was blamed 
for police brutality and financial mismanagement. Weinberg defended 
Rizzo as a good man who made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the issues, there was surprising consensus.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the candidates promised to focus on the neighborhoods,  
whose residents felt neglected during the city's downtown building 
boom. The candidates said the mayor should play a bigger role in 
improving city schools and promised to build on Rendell's legacy of 
economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> FTC Case Targets Junk E-Mail Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The perpetrators of a new junk e-mail scam  
targeted at thousands of consumers have used the Internet and a 
complex telemarketing scheme to keep their identities unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not stopping the Federal Trade Commission from suing  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the FTC announced actions against an unidentified  
defendant accused of sending unsolicited e-mail, better known as 
``spam,'' that deceived consumers into making international calls 
to an adult entertainment phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency says this action -- the first taken against an unnamed  
perpetrator -- is a warning to con artists who try to hide behind 
the vast, faceless Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anonymity doesn't necessarily stand in the way of some kind of  
law enforcement,'' says Eileen Harrington, the FTC's associate 
director of marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme -- a combination of spamming and telemarketing fraud --  
has already prompted 20,000 consumers to complain to America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were caught off guard, like Clifton Taylor's 12-year-old  
grandson, who was doing his homework on the Internet when the 
offending e-mail popped up. It told him that his order for a 
purchase had been processed and that $375 would be billed to his 
credit card in the next two days unless he called the number on the 
screen to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of a consumer representative, on the other end was a  
pornographic recording by a company using a site in the Caribbean. 
The international toll call appeared on the family's phone bill 
shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	``This approach was so different it caught us by surprise,''  
said Taylor, a retired schoolteacher living outside of Charlotte, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The case highlights some of the challenges in tracking down and  
stopping the senders of spam. A common tactic among spam artists, 
including those cited in Tuesday's action, is to use a variety of 
forged e-mail addresses so they cannot be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Everett-Church, co-founder of the Coalition Against  
Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail, likens the problem to the arcade 
game ``whack-a-mole'': No sooner does the mole get hit by the 
mallet in one place than it pops up in another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spammers rapidly move from sending site to sending site,''  
says Everett-Church. That makes it futile for a server provider to 
block one specific e-mail address. But, he added, companies can 
block e-mails based on their content; for example, filtering out 
all messages that contain a particular word or telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem comes in finding similarities you can block,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC says it is raising the ante against fraud with its own  
technology. More than a year ago, the commission began collecting 
spam forwarded to it by consumers, creating a database with 
hundreds of thousands of messages in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission first learned of the scheme after a consumer  
submitted an online complaint form -- one of about 10,000 the FTC 
receives each week. Using the information provided by the consumer, 
the FTC ran a database search and came up with dozens of matches 
containing the same telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
	``This technology has given us an enormous leg up against scams  
that use technology,'' said Harrington. The agency was able to pull 
together a case in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has a similar mechanism for receiving forwarded junk e-mail.  
The company has passed on its complaints about the scam in 
question, plus copies of the actual spam to the FTC, said Rich 
D'Amato, an AOL spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington predicts the commission will have enough information  
to name a defendant in a few days. In the meantime, the court order 
has blocked the flow of money from American telephone carriers to 
the foreign telephone company that pays the operators of the hot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has asked the court for the money already paid by  
customers to their telephone companies for the toll charges to be 
put aside for consumer restitution and for the company to be barred 
from violating the law through its deceptive messages. 
</P>
<P>
	A successful case against the perpetrators would come as  
vindication to Taylor. He contacted an array of people from his 
phone company to members of Congress to local police to report the 
matter. Most rebuffed him because he didn't have enough follow-up 
information for them to pursue a case. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was furious about the e-mail, Taylor said his ``anger  
got worse because I couldn't get anywhere with anybody. The whole 
thing just completely rubbed me the wrong way.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Liability Bill Stalls in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to prevent an outbreak of lawsuits  
resulting from year 2000 computer problems stalled in the Senate 
today, for the second time the victim of an unrelated political 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 53-45 to proceed with debate on the Y2K bill,  
seven short of the 60 needed. 
</P>
<P>
	While many Democrats want legislation to prevent frivolous  
litigation, most voted against the motion to proceed because they 
say the Senate should first finish work on a juvenile justice bill 
that has become a vehicle for Democrats to push gun-control 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he  
wanted to go back to the Y2K bill, but only after the juvenile 
justice bill is completed. He said Republicans were trying to pin 
blame on the Democrats in the event the justice bill fails. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Democrats  
``want to play games on this (Y2K) bill and they want litigation.'' 
If the Y2K bill dies because of what he called political games, 
``let them explain it to the business community in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also defeated a similar motion to proceed several  
weeks ago, on that occasion because they objected to the Republican 
leadership's attempt to limit the kinds of amendments they could 
offer to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	While political fighting has held up action on the bill, there  
has been a bipartisan effort, led by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., to compromises 
some of the more disputed aspects of the legislation and make it 
more acceptable to the administration, which has opposed extensive 
changes to tort law. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would provide for a 90-day cooling-off period  
before Y2K lawsuits could be filed, encourage mediation and limit 
punitive damages for defendants with fewer than 50 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The House last week passed its version of the bill. The  
administration has threatened a veto, saying it goes further than 
the Senate bill in restricting legitimate claims based on Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S.96.

<HEADLINE> SEC Censures, Fines Datek Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have censured and fined  
Datek Online Brokerage Services Corp. for allegedly using its 
customers' money to pay some of its expenses, a violation of 
securities laws designed to protect investors. 
</P>
<P>
	While the actions didn't cause any customers to lose money, the  
enforcement action is the first of its kind taken by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission against the burgeoning Internet brokerage 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek and its former chief financial officer agreed in a  
settlement to the censure and fines, totaling $60,000, the SEC 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek, based in Iselin, N.J., is one of the nation's biggest  
online brokerages, processing more than 500,000 trades a day. With 
online customers now accounting for about a quarter of all retail 
stock trades, the mushrooming industry is expected to be pulling in 
some 10 million amateur investors by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action could be followed by similar moves against  
other online brokerages. The market watchdog agency has been 
conducting an extensive review of Internet trading firms 
nationwide. In addition to looking for violations of securities 
laws, the auditors have been examining how well firms execute 
orders and warn customers of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt challenged the  
online brokerage industry to provide better warnings to its 
customers about the risks that come with investing on the Internet 
and to tone down advertisements that appear to promise quick 
riches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customer-protection rules apply to everybody,'' including  
online brokerage firms, said Henry Klehm, senior associate director 
of the SEC's Northeast regional office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was the agency's first enforcement action involving  
customer-protection rules against an online trading firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that Datek violated customer-protection  
provisions of the federal securities laws by failing several times 
to keep a required minimum balance in a bank account containing 
customers' money, and by withdrawing cash from the account to pay 
its own financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokerages are required to keep excess funds in the customers'  
account to ensure they will not use customers' money for their own 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators also charged that Datek kept inaccurate books and  
records and filed a false report of its financial situation last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek and its former chief financial officer, Moishe Zelcer,  
neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement, under 
which they agreed to be censured, to pay civil fines of $50,000 and 
$10,000, respectively, and to refrain from future violations of 
securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Datek agreed to hire an independent consultant to  
review its internal policies, procedures and controls and to 
recommend changes that may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelcer also agreed to be suspended from the brokerage industry  
for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek, in a statement, said it ``responded quickly to address  
the concerns'' raised by the SEC. The firm noted, for example, that 
it replaced Zelcer last July.

<HEADLINE> Ford Recalls Some 1992-93 Sedans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will recall about 279,000  
full-size sedans to replace a cruise-control switch that could 
short-circuit and create a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall affects the 1992 and '93 Lincoln Town Car, Mercury  
Grand Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria sedans equipped with 
factory-installed cruise control. About 10,900 of the recalled cars 
are in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 147 reports of fires and two reported injuries  
attributed to the defect, Ford spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy said. 
No deaths have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said in a statement that a potentially defective cruise  
control deactivation switch could short-circuit, which in turn 
could overheat and catch fire. A short also could disable the 
cruise control system and blow the brake light fuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker said it is in the process of acquiring replacement  
switches; until then, customers will be asked by mail to take their 
cars to their dealer to have the cruise control disabled pending 
repair. The repairs will be made for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional information is available by calling Ford's customer  
service center at (800) 392-3673 or checking the company's Web site 
at www.ownerconnection.com.

<HEADLINE> Buffett Takes Bite of Dunkin' Donuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose investments in  
well-known consumer brands have attracted loyal followers who view 
him as one of the world's shrewdest investors, has added the 
British owner of Dunkin Donuts to his portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett, who is more at home with investments in Coca-Cola,  
Gillette and Dairy Queen than in Internet stocks, has bought 2.2 
percent of Allied Domecq PLC, which owns the donut shop chain, 
along with Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores and some of the world's 
best-known liquor brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment is Buffett's first overseas foray since he sank  
$265 million into Guinness PLC, the Irish beer-maker. He unloaded 
his Guinness shares in 1994 after holding them for just a few 
years, a rare departure from his celebrated buy-and-hold strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett's investment firm, Omaha, Neb.-based Berkshire Hathaway  
Inc., began buying shares in Allied Domecq as early as last month, 
a source at the British company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Allied Domecq share prices shot up 4.7 percent to  
close at $9 a share, or 555.5 British pence in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire Hathaway, the priciest stock listed on the New York  
Stock Exchange, saw its shares rise 1.3 percent, climbing $910 to 
$73,210 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett's skill at picking long-term investments has earned him  
the nickname ``sage of Omaha'' as well as a fortune of around $30 
billion, second only to that of Bill Gates, the chairman of 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In Allied Domecq, Buffett is not only betting on the sweet tooth  
of consumers but also on liquor brands such as Ballantine's Scotch, 
Canadian Club whiskey and Beefeater gin. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Guinness, Allied Domecq operates in the highly fragmented  
alcoholic beverages sector where consumer tastes vary widely 
between and even within countries. And that has some analysts 
skeptical about Buffett's latest stock pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect him as an investor, but when it comes to our  
particular industry, he has yet to earn his spurs,'' said Charles 
Winston, a senior beverage analyst at HSBC in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Guinesss, he demonstrated that he didn't understand what  
drives the industry. Can we be sure he knows what drives the 
industry today?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure of Berkshire Hathaway's investment, which  
followed a report in Tuesday's edition of The Guardian newspaper, 
ended weeks of rumors about Buffett's plans in Britain. Buffett 
told investors here in April that he thought U.S. companies were 
overvalued and that he was eyeing a large but unspecified British 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	An Allied Domecq spokesman refused to comment on the newspaper  
report, and officials at Berkshire Hathaway's headquarters did not 
immediately respond to calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Allied Domecq source, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed the Guardian report, which fed speculation 
that Buffett was seeking to buy more of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Buffett owned 22.8 million shares of the company  
last month, a stake worth $195 million based on Monday's closing 
share price. 
</P>
<P>
	While some analysts suggested that Buffett's move would attract  
new investors to Allied Domecq, others wondered if the company's 
shares would get more than a one-day lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether this continues and is sustainable is obviously the  
hard question to answer,'' said John Beaumont of Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett is unabashed in an investment strategy that favors  
established, widely recognized brands. Bucking Wall Street's 
fascination with computer-related stocks, he is openly skeptical 
about the Internet and says he is uncomfortable predicting where 
companies in that nascent field will be in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's much easier to predict the relative strength that  
Coke will have in the soft-drink world than Microsoft will in the 
software world,'' he said earlier this month at Berkshire 
Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Allied Domecq came to light after  
the British company made a routine query to find the identity of 
the shareholder who acquired 2.2 percent of its stock through a 
nominee. The true shareholder turned out to be Berkshire Hathaway, 
the Allied source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under British law, shareholders only have to announce their  
identities from the outset if they buy 3 percent or more of a 
company's shares.

<HEADLINE> Makah Indians Celebrate Whale Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- Hundreds of Makah Indians waited for  
hours in a chilly drizzle to celebrate the rebirth of an ancient 
tradition over the corpse of a female gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah's whaling crew delivered the whale Monday, culminating  
months of preparation and controversy as the tribe greeted the 
first whale landed by the tribe in more than 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists decried the killing, which was accomplished  
through a combination of the traditional -- the cedar canoe, its 
hand-carved paddles and the whalers' ritual prayers -- and the 
modern, including .50-caliber rifles and motorized boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously very upset that the Makah went ahead with  
killing an innocent, sentient creature in such a bloody and 
untraditional way,'' said Jake Conroy of the anti-whaling group Sea 
Defense Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	It took about 11 hours for a Makah fishing boat to tow the whale  
home to this waterfront community of 2,400 people, which is tucked 
into the shoulder of Cape Flattery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah welcomed the whale with sacred songs, an honor guard  
escort and ceremonies. Harpooner Theron Parker performed a ritual 
to release the soul of the whale to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here for my great-grandfather,'' said Ron Johnson, who  
grew up hearing stories about his whaling forebears and traveled 
over 100 miles to be part of the celebration. ``He's dancing in 
heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No living Makah had whaled until now, and only a few elders  
remembered the taste of whale meat. Some who didn't remember wanted 
to know what they had been missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Eli, `You're not going to school today. This is a  
historic day for the Makah,''' said young mother Rebekah Greene as 
the 30-foot, 5-inch whale was butchered on the beach in fading 
daylight. 
</P>
<P>
	Far into the night, members of the community pitched in to help  
carve up the animal, peeling back an inch-thick layer of blubber to 
reveal the whale's red meat. The animal was believed to be at least 
3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Some meat will be cured for a few days in preparation for a big  
feast -- probably this weekend -- for the Makah and visitors. Some 
will be distributed to tribal members, with the blubber rendered 
into oil for cooking and dipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe is guaranteed whaling rights by its 1855 treaty, but  
the Makah tradition stopped in the 1920s, when commercial whaling 
decimated global whale populations. 
</P>
<P>
	When gray whales were taken off the Endangered Species List in  
1994, the tribe moved to resume whale hunts. The United States 
supported the tribe's bid before the International Whaling 
Commission, and in 1997 the tribe was given the go-ahead to hunt a 
total of 20 whales through 2004. Federal scientists estimate 
current gray-whale numbers at about 26,000, up from an estimated 
low of about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunt was filmed by helicopters and shown across the region.  
Makah whalers struck the giant mammal repeatedly with harpoons and 
with two shots from a high-powered rifle, staining the choppy 
waters with blood in an attack that lasted eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah, whose fishing and logging enterprises have struggled  
with the decline of those resources, hope the hunt will help 
restore tradition and pride. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful hunt ``restores a missing link in our heritage,''  
said Arnie Hunter, vice president of the tribal whaling commission, 
who was in a support boat when the whale was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-whaling demonstrators, who were here for two months last  
fall and returned as early as March to oppose the hunt, were not 
present when the whale was killed. Conroy said activists would 
renew their protests if the Makah try to kill another. 
</P>
<P>
	The communal hunt, involving many families, was considered the  
best way to resurrect the tradition by pooling available resources. 
The next hunt, which has not been scheduled, will be a family 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tribe's own management plan, members must use up the  
whale killed Monday before embarking on another hunt. Tribal 
leaders say the next hunt may not take place until fall, when the 
whale migration is heading in the opposite direction.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Set To Return Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Roger Clemens is slated to make his first start  
Friday night since being placed on the disabled list April 29 with 
a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	If he beats the White Sox in Chicago, the New York Yankees  
pitcher will set the AL record of winning 18 straight decisions. He 
currently is tied with Dave McNally and Johnny Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' return was announced by Joe Torre, who managed the team  
for the first time Tuesday night since undergoing prostate surgery 
on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, 2-0 with a 5.47 ERA, made five starts this year for the  
World Series champions before going on the 15-day disabled list 
retroactive to April 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young award winner was eligible to return last  
Thursday. Torre said Clemens would be ready to pitch this Thursday 
in the finale of a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox, 
where Clemens spent 13 seasons before pitching the last two with 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre said he decided to hold Clemens out until Friday  
because of the likelihood of rain on Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens said he had no preference to pitch against Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get back out in action and be healthy,''  
Clemens said before Tuesday night's series opener. ``I won't pitch 
any harder here than I would in any other stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury may have jeopardized his chances of pitching in the  
All-Star game in Fenway Park on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it happens, great. If not, I have some other plans,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, 36, initially hurt his hamstring while jogging on a  
cold morning April 11, then aggravated it in the second inning 
while pitching April 27 at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, traded to the Yankees last February, has not lost since  
last May 29 while with Toronto, a span of 27 starts. The major 
league record for consecutive wins is 24 by Carl Hubbell in 1936-37 
for the New York Giants.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Someone at the post office had a little  
trouble finding the Grand Canyon.

	A new batch of 60-cent international stamps carry a picture of  
the canyon along with the words ``Grand Canyon, Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's true the Grand Canyon was carved by the Colorado River, but  
it's actually located in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal spokesman Don Smeraldi said Monday the agency currently  
is in discussions with the printer to determine whether the run of 
100 million stamps needs to be reprinted. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the stamps had been put in circulation. They were to be  
released later this year. The error was caught at the printing 
plant. The cost of reprinting the stamps was not immediately 
available from the post office, but the trade paper Linn's Stamp 
News estimated it at $500,000.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Chief Urges Financial Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- If Salt Lake City's sports venues are to  
open for pre-Olympics training, then outside financial help is a 
must, the chief organizer of the scandal-plagued games said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney said budget  
cuts -- including $5 million from funds to operate ski jumps, 
bobsled and luge runs and a speedskating track before the start of 
the 2002 Winter Games -- were painful reminders of the worst 
corruption case in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't pretend nothing has happened in the last year, and  
there have been things that have happened in the last year,'' 
Romney said in an interview. ``And we can't pretend that's not 
going to require any changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC faces a $300 million gap in sponsorships, caused at least  
in part by the bribery case. Last week it signed three new sponsors 
-- the first deals since the scandal broke six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee's marketing  
director said that, despite the bribery case, public support for 
Olympic athletes remained high -- although it ``clearly has been a 
black eye for the IOC's image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing chief Michael Payne said in an interview that  
worldwide surveys conducted for the IOC found that failure to adopt 
reforms in the wake of the scandal ``would cause certain erosion'' 
in other areas of the Olympic community. 
</P>
<P>
	But the surveys of 10,000 people in 10 countries in February and  
March showed 76 percent had a positive attitude toward the games 
and 85 percent a positive attitude toward Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat to keep the venues closed until just before the games  
begin in February 2002 is at the center of a dispute between SLOC 
and the U.S. Olympic Committee, which argues that Romney's' 
predecessors pledged free training access to American athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC is aiming to double its medal count in 2002, from 13 in  
Nagano last winter to 26 in Salt Lake, and says the training time 
is a key to that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has delayed SLOC's purchase of the facilities as it  
negotiates with the USOC on a solution. Romney said his suggestion 
that the USOC pick up the tab was ``not an outrageous request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we and the USOC have exactly the same incentive:  
to find ways to reduce costs and to share the costs wherever 
possible,'' he said. ``I don't feel any conflict with the folks at 
the USOC and we are working together to try to find ways to make 
that work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the IOC and the USOC had been cooperative in trying  
to find solutions to his budget problems, including exchanges of 
ideas during IOC coordination commission meetings this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that proposed budget cuts totaled $98 million ``and  
there's probably a lot more we haven't discovered yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC, he said, had ``every interest ... to see if other people  
can help out and be additional sources of revenue. ... I'm looking 
for heroes of all stripes to save our bacon and to also support the 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Romney -- brought in at the height of the  
scandal -- also confirmed that Mark Tanner, SLOC's chief financial 
officer, was leaving June 1 for a similar job with Salt Lake 
City-based Mrs. Field's Cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the IOC studies were conducted by SRI, an  
international research firm, among 18- to 49-year-olds with ``an 
interest in sports and an awareness of the Olympics.'' Because of 
the different countries and cultures, SRI eliminated the lowest 
income group from each sample. Africa was not included in the 
sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about watching the Olympics on TV, 7 percent said  
their interest was higher since the scandal. And 9 percent said 
their support for Olympic sponsors shot up. Only half approved of 
the course of IOC reform actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public sees a very elemental difference between the games  
and the athletes, and backroom dealings that may have taken 
place,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the clearest explanation for higher approval of sponsors  
was that, for the first time, fans recognized that sponsorship 
money was essential to stage the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys conducted at the same time by the U.S. Olympic Committee  
found that 73 percent of respondents said the scandal had not 
changed their attitudes toward Olympic athletes or sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, the USOC's marketing chief and deputy executive  
director, said the surveys by Wirthlin Worldwide would be conducted 
through June. They involve telephone interviews with households 
with more than $60,000 annual income, some college education and a 
``familiarity with the Olympics,'' Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne's comments were the first time the IOC has discussed its  
marketing surveys relating to the scandal's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks also came a week after the IOC's leading critic  
among sponsors, John Hancock president David D'Alessandro, said his 
company's surveys had found 20 percent of those questioned ``have 
now lost faith in not only the Olympics but in the companies that 
sponsor the Olympics and their products.'' Only 3 percent to 4 
percent said they were more likely to buy an Olympic sponsor's 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said it was difficult to comment on the Hancock findings  
without knowing details of the survey sample and questions. He said 
Hancock had sent the IOC some information but refused to reveal the 
wording of the questions.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone To Hold Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOME, Togo (AP) -- Sierra Leone's government and the country's  
rebels agreed Tuesday to a cease-fire that will begin next week and 
to start peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also agreed to immediately release all prisoners  
of war and give humanitarian workers free access to the entire 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Foday Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front, and  
Sierra Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah signed an agreement to 
lay down their weapons next Monday, with peace talks starting the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Although repeated attempts to end seven years of savage fighting  
have failed, both sides expressed optimism for peace in the West 
African nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabbah -- flanked by U.S. envoy Jesse Jackson, and  
representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of 
African Unity -- predicted negotiations would bring lasting peace to 
Sierra Leone by early June. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Sierra Leoneans, war should now be against ignorance,  
poverty and disease,'' Kabbah said in a speech in Togo's capital of 
Lome, where discussions have been held. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabbah didn't mention an earlier demand that the rebels vacate  
diamond mines and all roads before any cease-fire would take 
effect, and it wasn't clear if either side made any concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankoh, who says he commands 40,000 rebels who control  
two-thirds of the country including the diamond-rich east, called 
on the international community to ensure both sides lay down their 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a memorable day for Sierra Leone,'' said Sankoh. ``I  
call for my brothers to be patient and for a lasting peace to be 
implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Sankoh and Kabbah agreed to ask the Organization of African  
Unity to send observers to Sierra Leone to ensure both sides meet 
the terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilians have suffered horrendously in the war, which has  
destroyed the country's infrastructure and left hundreds of 
thousands homeless. Human rights groups say many civilians are 
hiding in jungles and remote villages for fear of the rebels who 
control the surrounding land. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel leaders have indicated that during peace talks they will  
demand a transitional government with rebel input to guide the 
country for four years before holding presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels earlier demanded that Sankoh, who was imprisoned two  
years ago and sentenced to death last October for treason, be 
released unconditionally. He is now on temporary leave from prison 
while he meets with senior rebel commanders ahead of peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hasn't outlined its plans for negotiations, and  
it's not yet clear where the peace talks will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 5,000 people were killed in December and January  
during the rebels' latest major push, which reduced parts of the 
capital to rubble before a Nigerian-led West African intervention 
force known as ECOMOG beat the rebels back.

<HEADLINE> Fox Might Spin Off `Ally McBeal' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Ally McBeal'' is expected to expand its  
rollicking law practice into a half-hour version also airing in Fox 
prime time this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it's going to happen,'' said David E. Kelley,  
creator of the original series, now finishing its second hit 
season, and originator of the spinoff idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, which unveils its fall prime-time schedule Thursday,  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new series would feature the same characters, cast and  
theme: an unconventional Boston law firm as likely to break into 
song in the unisex bathroom as to plead a case in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But, unique in TV annals, ``Ally'' Junior would consist of  
unused and repeat footage shot for the hour-long series, as well as 
brand-new scenes, all edited into individual half-hour stories. 
</P>
<P>
	While the original series intermixes drama with zaniness, the  
freestanding spinoff would have a distinctively comic bent, with 
its stories set in the firm and after hours. No court scenes would 
be included, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is expected to leave the original ``Ally McBeal'' in its  
current time slot Monday at 9 p.m. EDT, while ``Ally'' Lite may air 
Tuesday at 8 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said he proposed the new ``Ally'' for the network lineup  
a couple of weeks ago, after experimenting with re-editing ``Ally'' 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It occurred to me that, for syndication, they might play  
better in a half-hour form,'' he said. (When buying shows to slot 
before or after network prime-time fare, TV stations usually prefer 
half-hours to hours.) 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said he reasoned that, along with its instant familiarity  
among current ``Ally'' fans and its lower cost, the new series 
would boast a distinctly different style from traditional sitcoms, 
which employ multi-camera photography and laugh tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Call it what you want -- comedy, dramedy -- I think we can  
demonstrate that a single-camera show can be very funny,'' Kelley 
said.

<HEADLINE> IRL To Require Wheel Tethers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Indy Racing League will start requiring  
wheel tether systems beginning at next week's Indianapolis 500, The 
Associated Press learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes in response to the sport's latest fatal spectator  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL's largest promoter, Speedway Motorsports Inc., also  
announced plans to raise the height of safety fences at its tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company owns the tracks at which five of the 11 IRL races  
are staged, including Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte, where 
three spectators were killed and eight injured by a flying wheel 
and suspension parts during a race May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL officials declined to confirm their intentions to start  
making their teams use restraining cables designed to keep wheels 
from snapping free from the vehicles on impact. 
</P>
<P>
	But three authorities in the open-wheel racing industry,  
speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the AP that the IRL 
plans to announce the tether rule soon and put it into effect for 
next week's Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL teams will test the new restraining cables during  
Carburetion Day, the final scheduled practice session next Thursday 
before the May 30 race. The Indianapolis 500 is the first IRL event 
since the Charlotte accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Formula One began requiring its teams to use tether systems at  
the start of the 1999 season, and CART, the world's other major 
open-wheel circuit, announced a similar mandate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Tethers have come under fire from some industry authorities who  
say the restraints can yank wheels back toward the car, putting the 
driver in greater danger. Tethers that snap free also can 
accelerate the already high speeds at which many wheels fly away 
from vehicles during crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Charlotte wreck represented the second time in nine  
months that spectators were killed by flying wheels and debris at 
major open-wheel races in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The SMI tracks on the IRL circuit will get what the company  
calls the highest safety fences in racing. The company said the 
fences between the racing surfaces and grandstands, which currently 
are 15 feet high and are topped with 3-foot-long overhangs at most 
SMI properties, will be raised to 21 feet and topped with 
6-foot-long overhangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is completely overbuilt,'' SMI president H.A. ``Humpy''  
Wheeler said, ``but we just don't want this to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not determined exactly how high the wheel  
flew to clear Charlotte's safety fence. But Wheeler said that based 
on the evidence available to investigators, they feel it would have 
been unlikely for the wheel to have been able to get past the new 
fence and its arched overhang. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like this new fence would have probably saved that --  
we think,'' he said. ``We are not totally sure about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMI plans to spend about $1 million to upgrade its safety  
fences, starting with about 4,000 feet protecting grandstands at 
Texas Motor Speedway. The track in suburban Dallas is the next SMI 
venue on the IRL schedule, and Wheeler said the upgrades should be 
finished in time for the Longhorn 500 on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI also plans to upgrade the fences protecting spectator  
viewing areas at its tracks in Atlanta and Las Vegas, both of which 
are scheduled for IRL races later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	An 800-foot section of fence along Charlotte's fourth turn where  
the fatal accident began is to be upgraded in time for the 
Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR Winston Cup race on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Flying wheels and other parts usually aren't a major problem  
with the heavier, slower and sturdier Winston Cup cars. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler said SMI still wanted to upgrade Charlotte's  
fourth-turn fence to try to help ease any lingering concern fans 
may have about the IRL wreck, which produced the first spectator 
fatalities in the track's 40-year history.

<HEADLINE> Stars Ride Modano, Hull to Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Part psychologist, part hockey strategist.  
Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock has been both in the NHL playoffs, 
helping his team advance to the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	After splitting up the tandem of Brett Hull and Mike Modano for  
two games, the coach reunited the pair midway through the first 
period of Game 6 of their second-round series against the St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull ended up assisting on both Dallas goals, the second scored  
by Modano at 2:21 of overtime for a 2-1 victory Monday night. The 
Stars will have home ice in the conference finals against the 
winner of the Detroit-Colorado series. The Avalanche led 3-2 going 
into Tuesday night's Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting Hull and Modano back on the same line was Hitchcock's  
strategic move. The psychological part was not telling either 
player about the change until he did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to go back to that line. We just didn't want to  
create a circus with a lot of people talking to Hull,'' Hitchcock 
said. ``We didn't even tell Brett that we were going to make the 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull probably had an inkling something was up when he played  
alongside a different pair of skaters in each of his first two 
shifts. Then Hitchcock barked ``Modano! Lehtinen! Hull!'' and 
Dallas' money line was back on the ice at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brett had two good shifts so we made the change right away,''  
Hitchcock said. ``When you see people like Hull and Modano playing 
as well as they were, you've got to enhance their opportunity to 
win the game for you by making them play more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Hull and Modano leading the way, Dallas compiled the  
league's best regular-season record and won its first six playoff 
games. St. Louis ended the streak in Game 3, and Hitchcock 
responded by separating his top players for Game 4 in hopes of 
sparking one or both. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell skill people to dig in deeper all the time  
because it becomes redundant,'' Hitchcock said. ``So, we decided to 
put them in situations where they had to dig in. We felt if we 
couldn't get either up and running, then we weren't going to win 
the series, anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues foiled the plan, tying the series, but the Stars  
reclaimed the lead by winning at home Saturday night. They closed 
the series on their first chance, avoiding a winner-take-all Game 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis led 1-0 late in the third period when Hull controlled  
a lose puck and sent it to Derek Plante in the slot. Plante slid 
the puck past goaltender Grant Fuhr to tie the game with 6:02 left 
in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the extra period, Hull skated around the net with the  
puck and shot a low backhander into Fuhr's skates. Modano was 
stymied on his first rebound attempt, but a second try got through 
for his fourth goal and 11th point of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the game and the series was especially sweet for Hull,  
who never got past the second round during 10 seasons in St. Louis. 
He signed with Dallas last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be time I'll draw on the memories of this game,''  
Hull said. ``When I'm down, it'll make me feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis center Craig Conroy, who chased Hull on the  
game-winning assist, complimented his former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept battling and made things happen,'' Conroy said. ``That  
was the difference.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules Coca-Cola E-mail OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge says Coca-Cola Co. executives may  
continue sending e-mails to employees about a racial discrimination 
lawsuit, as long as Coke makes it clear that employees are free to 
join the case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Story issued a ruling setting  
guidelines for communication with employees by both Coke management 
and attorneys for the four black employees who filed the suit. 
After a hearing on the issue Thursday, Story issued the ruling 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, one former and three current black salaried  
employees, sued Coke last month alleging that the company 
discriminated against black employees in pay, promotions, 
performance evaluations and terminations. 
</P>
<P>
	They are seeking class-action status for their suit, which would  
add as plaintiffs all 1,500 salaried black employees who work for 
the company nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' attorneys had expressed concern about two  
e-mails Coke's chairman and chief executive officer, M. Douglas 
Ivester, sent to nearly 10,000 Coke employees after the suit was 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication that Ivester intended to pressure  
potential class members into nonparticipation in this lawsuit when 
he issued the two e-mails to Coca-Cola's associates,'' Story said 
in his ruling. ``But there is an inherent danger that these types 
of internal communication could deter potential class members from 
participating in the suit out of concern for the effect it could 
have on their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To keep that from occurring, he said, the company may discuss  
its views in e-mail communications as long as it includes a 
statement explaining that the opinions expressed are those of 
Coca-Cola and that ``it is unlawful for Coca-Cola to retaliate 
against employees who choose to participate in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Story said Coke officials may not discuss the case directly with  
potential class members, other than with managers for purposes of 
defense preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also said the plaintiffs' attorneys may speak freely  
about the case with any potential class members who contact them, 
but are not allowed to contact Coca-Cola's employees at work unless 
the employees have retained them.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Eyes Private Retirement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
today called for a quick transition to a private retirement system 
replacing Social Security that would ``rebuild the trust of younger 
generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that every American would find that personal  
retirement accounts offer them a much stronger, more secure 
retirement than they're getting from the current system,'' Forbes 
said in a speech to small business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said Monday that younger people are fueling the debate  
over reforming Social Security because most young workers ``believe 
they are more likely to see flying saucers than a Social Security 
check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The transition away from Social Security could be made within  
seven years, he said. A key to selling his proposal is to make it 
clear that those currently in the system, or about to retire, would 
have the option of sticking with traditional Social Security 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you make it feasible is you make it clear you're not  
going to tamper with the system for those who are on it, or about 
to go on it,'' Forbes said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In his previous bid for the Republican presidential nomination,  
Forbes focused almost exclusively on a flat tax. This time, he has 
shifted gears. He's been careful to broaden his agenda, speaking 
out on abortion and other issues important in Republican politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Wading into the fight over Social Security broadens his list of  
issues even further. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes conceded a host of details need to be worked out, such as  
devising a method of giving credit for Social Security taxes 
already paid. There's also likely a need to put in place age 
cutoffs, but those are technical details, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to rapidly phase in for younger people a new system  
where eventually the bulk of their Social Security tax goes to 
their own individual retirement accounts,'' said Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the chance to opt out of Social Security, up to 80 percent  
would do so and younger people almost unanimously would choose 
private retirement, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts it in your own hands and you don't have to trust  
Washington,'' said Forbes. ``The younger you are, the more I think 
people will go for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes planned to outline his proposal in a speech today before  
the Small Business Survival Summit in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal includes ending a penalty for those who continue  
working between the ages of 65 and 69. People who work beyond 
regular retirement age lose some benefits if their work-related 
earnings exceed a ceiling set this year at $15,500. 
</P>
<P>
	He said surpluses in Social Security funds could be used to help  
phase in the new system. ``You give people a choice who are 
working, a choice of going on the new system or staying on the old 
one,'' said Forbes. ``No one would be forced to do it against their 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privatizing the system is ultimately the only way to avoid raids  
on the fund by politicians, Forbes argued. ``They are like bears 
with a pot of honey -- as long as it's available, they'll continue 
to gorge themselves,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> CBOT Chairman Has Change of Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When David P. Brennan was elected chairman of the  
Chicago Board of Trade late last year, he urged a go-slow approach 
to considering an alliance with Eurex. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan came out against a proposed deal with the  
Frankfurt-based all-electronic derivatives exchange in January 
after flying suddenly to Europe to seek better terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the CBOT chairman has had a change of heart.  
</P>
<P>
	``The time is now right for a business alliance with Eurex, and  
it has my complete support,'' Brennan said in a statement Tuesday 
after CBOT directors voted overwhelmingly to pursue an alliance 
between the world's two largest futures exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after weekend meetings with Eurex officials at  
Monte Rotondo, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``After my meetings with Eurex executives this weekend in Italy,  
I am confident that we have reformatted an alliance with Eurex that 
will result in increased efficiency, stronger technology and shared 
costs that will serve CBOT members well,'' Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would schedule a membership vote on the renewed  
alliance by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had come out against the earlier attempt at an alliance,  
which failed despite the spending of millions of dollars on 
pre-implementation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurex is owned jointly by Germany's Deutsche Boerse and its  
Swiss counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	CBOT members voted Jan. 27 to abandon the earlier proposed  
alliance, signaling once more a commitment to auction-style trading 
that many call an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
	The members voted 450-390 at that time to place their bets with  
open outcry. That is the system in which traders stand in pits 
yelling and gesturing to set the price for everything from soybeans 
to Treasury bond futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Large trading firms have migrated to computer-based trading,  
saying it is easier and cheaper because it saves keeping expensive 
staff at individual exchanges. But others argue open outcry is the 
best method of determining prices because face-to-face contact 
allows traders to ``feel'' the mood of a market and act 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurex chief executive officer Jog Franke expressed cautious  
optimism about the latest vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still think that a cooperation with CBOT would be  
advantageous for the exchanges and their memberships, but this is 
something that the CBOT and its members will have to decide,'' 
Franke said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier deal had been supported by CBOT president and chief  
executive officer Thomas R. Donovan, who soon became locked in a 
power struggle with Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 19, the CBOT directors gave Donovan a vote of  
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-member board rallied around Donovan, 61, a week after  
Brennan, 41, tried to enlist their help in a failed attempt to oust 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the defeat of the original alliance proposal, and in light  
of competitive changes since then, Brennan and CBOT senior 
management, led by Donovan, have been conducting a formal review of 
potential exchange and technology alliances.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Likely To Stay Put </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's likely that Federal Reserve policy-makers  
will leave interest rates unchanged for now, most analysts say -- at 
least in part because it's too early to tell whether the jarring 
acceleration in the inflation rate last month is a sign the U.S. 
economy is overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Fed will want to overreact to one scary  
number,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill in 
Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans, who have grown accustomed to nothing but good news on  
inflation, got a jolt on Friday when the government announced that 
consumer prices jumped in April by the largest amount in nearly 
nine years, led by a sharp increase in gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Few private economists think Fed officials, who met today for  
one of their eight scheduled reviews of interest rate policy, will 
feel rushed to raise interest rates immediately in an effort to 
slow the economy and tame inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that construction of new  
homes and apartments fell for the third straight month with the 
10.1 percent April decline the biggest monthly drop in more than 
five years. Analysts said this showed that the economy is already 
beginning to slow on its own, lessening the urgency for the Fed to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	But private economists said they still believe a Fed rate hike  
is likely later this year and they predicted it would be preceded 
by a signal of the Fed's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The countdown is really on for a future tightening move by the  
Fed,'' David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in 
New York, said Monday. ``It is no longer a matter of whether they 
will tighten, but when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, at its December meeting, the FOMC approved a change in  
policy that will allow it to reveal changes in its members' 
``bias,'' or disposition toward future rate changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a series of three interest rate cuts last fall, the Fed  
has been in a neutral stance, meaning a rate cut was as likely as a 
rate increase. Many analysts believe the central bank will announce 
today that it has changed its bias from neutral to leaning toward 
raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement alone would be likely to nudge interest rates  
that are set by financial markets in the direction the Fed wants. 
That's because it would confirm investors' suspicions that the 
central bank is leaning toward an increase in its own influential 
federal funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other for 
overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank last changed the federal funds rate in the fall  
of 1998, cutting it three times in an effort to restore investor 
confidence and avert a worldwide recession. The funds rate has been 
at 4.75 percent since Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate cuts worked and U.S. markets have since soared to  
record levels, bolstered by low U.S. interest rates and continued 
strength in the U.S. economy, which is enjoying the lowest 
unemployment levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But since Friday's bad inflation report, Wall Street has grown  
nervous. The yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond has moved 
back toward 6 percent, the highest level in a year, and the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, which hit a record high on Thursday, has 
fallen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best news on inflation is over,'' said Allen Sinai, chief  
economist at Primark Global Economics. ``That is not to say that we 
will have runaway inflation, but we have seen the lows on 
inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While consumer prices were up 0.7 percent in April, other recent  
reports have shown that wage pressures remain low despite the tight 
labor markets, and the April report of wholesale prices showed 
little inflation pressure in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe the FOMC is likely to wait until its  
Aug. 24 meeting to increase rates, although some said the rate 
increase could come as soon as the June 29-30 meeting if the CPI 
continues to climb. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration continued to insist Monday that  
despite inflation jitters in the market, the U.S. economy remains 
on a sound footing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you look forward, the most likely prospect remains  
solid growth, low inflation,'' outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin said in an interview on CNBC.

<HEADLINE> Boxers' Records May Be Kept Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The Assembly gave final legislative  
approval Tuesday to a bill that ensures confidentiality of medical 
information provided by boxers to the Nevada Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	AB467, now going to Gov. Kenny Guinn for his signature, was  
sought by the commission after former heavyweight champion Mike 
Tyson's medical records were posted on the Internet. The records 
had been turned over to the commission and were public documents 
under current law. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel members said they are concerned that boxers seeking Nevada  
licenses and aware of the Tyson case might withhold information, 
fearing similar publicity. Athletic commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta 
adds that Tyson may not have been completely honest during his 
psychological evaluation because of the commission's open records 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson underwent psychological testing last year before  
regulators would agree to hear his request for a license to restore 
the one revoked for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, the commission could deem what information is  
relevant to granting or denying a license and therefore public. The 
rest of the applicants' records will remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also could offer a conditional license for  
boxers. Fertitta said this would result in more control over a 
licensee, such as requiring random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	That provision also stems from Tyson's licensing. The commission  
had wanted to impose conditions but found Nevada law didn't permit 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was opposed by Kent Lauer of the Nevada Press  
Association, who said members of the public who buy tickets or bet 
on fights have a right to know about a boxer's mental or physical 
state.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Sued Over Directory Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Frustrated by what she believes is AT&AMP;T's  
strategy to deprive callers of a second listing from directory 
assistance, a woman is suing the long-distance giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Yong Soon Oh seeks class-action status for her lawsuit,  
contending that everyone using directory assistance outside their 
own area code has been cheated. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint stems from AT&AMP;T's statement, filed with federal  
regulators, on what it can charge for various services. The filing 
permits AT&AMP;T to charge $1.40 for each call to area code directory 
assistance, but requires the company to answer up to two requests 
per call, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, however, unfairly hinders customers from availing  
themselves of the second request, the lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The company denies any wrongdoing, said Mark Siegel, a spokesman  
at AT&AMP;T's headquarters in Basking Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	When an AT&AMP;T operator or recording asks, ``What city, please''  
and ``What listing, please,'' it unfairly implies the customer can 
get second request after getting a response to first request, the 
lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The recording that provides the customer's first request does  
not offer an option to seek a second listing. 
</P>
<P>
	This is an ``unconscionable course of conduct which makes it  
impossible, as a practical matter, for (Oh) and the other members 
of the class to obtain the Area Code Directory Assistance services 
to which they are entitled,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason, according to the lawsuit, is so AT&AMP;T can ``minimize  
the amount of time that it must devote to any single call to Area 
Code Directory Assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T thwarts attempts by callers seeking compensation for not  
getting a second listing, the lawsuit says, by telling customers 
they must tell directory assistance at the beginning of call if 
they want two listings. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel declined to discuss specifics of the allegations, but  
said, ``If you want two listings, all you need to do is say you 
need two listings, very simple, and you'll get them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh could not be reached for comment Tuesday. The lawsuit, filed  
last month in state Superior Court in Bergen County, does not say 
where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left Tuesday for her lawyers were not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T filed last week to have the case heard in U.S. District  
Court in Newark.

<HEADLINE>  Years Later, McEnroe's Still at It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a few riveting moments, John McEnroe was  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered him on in a passion-filled tiebreaker. He  
threw his racket. He questioned calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this time, the distant flashes of Grand Slams past came  
before 1,925 fans in the final of the Spring PCS Champions seniors 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have Wimbledon or the U.S. Open,'' the gray-templed,  
40-year-old McEnroe said after parading the trophy around the court 
with a big grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a good crowd, good place, to me it's a big event. Is  
it a bigger event in Qatar? We're going over there in April. I'd 
rather win here, with all due respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a tour that sometimes seems as much show as competition --  
with players playing as much to the crowd as against each other -- 
McEnroe's 6-4, 4-6, (11-9) victory over Mats Wilander was a gem 
between two former No. 1s. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe served well, allowing just four points on his service  
games in the first set, and Wilander looked like a youngster as he 
chased balls in the corners. McEnroe won after saving two match 
points in the extended tiebreaker, which takes the place of the 
third set on the seniors tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``To raise the intensity of a match like today wasn't a  
problem,'' said Wilander, who is 34 and admits he sometimes has 
trouble motivating himself in seniors play. ``Once you get to this 
point, you can find something that's reminiscent of before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good match because I played well. I realized that  
John plays well pretty much all the time. He has such talent. His 
game is so fluid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In six years, the Worldwide Senior Tennis Circuit has become a  
yearlong tour, with 20 tournaments scheduled for the 1999-2000 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a long way from seniors golf -- ticket sales in  
Washington were disappointing despite heavy advance publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it is that we're sort of icing on the  
cake,'' said McEnroe, who has 16 seniors singles titles. ``The main 
tour has got to get going. If the cake isn't baked, then no icing 
is going to do any good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American stops on the tour are heavily dependent on two  
players, McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, who not only can still play a 
good game but will stay and talk about it afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors tore an abdominal muscle and had to retire against  
Jose-Luis Clerc on Friday night. Clerc said it was ``really bad for 
the tournament because everybody wants to see Jimmy Connors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, who won 32 of his 35 matches on the tour last year, is  
still the outspoken, unpredictable character of his ATP days. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to the umpire as the ``clown in the chair,'' said he  
should be considered for the Davis Cup doubles team because he at 
least ``cares about it,'' and otherwise offered his opinions on 
anything and everything about tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be the commissioner of tennis,'' McEnroe said.  
``It would be sort of a liaison. Someone who has a sense of the 
future of the game and who can do something about it as well. 
Someone who can walk out on a tennis court and excite some young 
kid into playing as well as has a good idea of what would allow the 
professional players to play their best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'd be a good candidate, but whether or not it's me, I  
think there should be someone like that.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Whistle-Blower Reemerges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The hiring of a respected sports marketing  
company to recruit more 2002 Winter Games sponsors was a smart 
move, according to the chairman of the International Olympic 
Committee's coordination commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss lawyer Marc Hodler, whose allegations of bribery against  
his colleagues triggered the biggest Olympic scandal in history, 
said he has little doubt Salt Lake City can recover. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to the hiring of International Management Group,  
which handled sponsorship sales for the 1992 Winter Games in 
Albertville, France, the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, 
and the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never let me down,'' Hodler said of Cleveland, Ohio-based  
IMG, which he has dealt with for decades as the senior IOC member 
and the former head of the international skiing federation. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG has agreed to recruit sponsors for the SLOC and U.S. Olympic  
Committee, and will be paid only on commission for any sponsors it 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler is in Salt Lake City with 17 other members of the  
coordination commission to scrutinize budgets, venues and plans for 
the games that begin on Feb. 8, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the commission's priorities, he said, is to help  
the scandal-tarnished organization find ways to raise more money 
and cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	He endorsed SLOC President Mitt Romney's approach of winnowing  
down the main budget to the essentials and planning to spend for 
frills only if the revenue comes through. The SLOC is still 
operating from a $1.45 billion budget, although a hiring freeze and 
other frugalities are already allowing the committee to delay 
borrowing from a line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney has said he will ask the IOC this week to renegotiate its  
contract to cut SLOC's hosting costs; to defer royalty payments on 
merchandise, sponsorships and tickets; and to let SLOC go after 
technology sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City has had some good news recently; a sponsor and  
two suppliers last week signed letters of intent that could be 
worth $30 million. But the committee is still saying it is $350 
million short of revenue to meet the full budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am quite certain there will be no problem,'' Hodler said.  
``We have the same interest in our present position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Jean-Claude Killy, the Olympic ski champion and now IOC  
member from France, the coordination commission's financial task 
force was briefed Monday by SLOC officials on their problems 
raising money from jittery sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy met with three experts who are reviewing SLOC's books: IOC  
financial director Thierry Sprunger; Bjorn Brenna, head of finance 
for the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer; and Pat Glisson, 
Atlanta's financial chief for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was pleased with progress the IOC has made in  
dealing with the scandal and repeated that Salt Lake City was a 
victim of unscrupulous committee members and agents promising 
blocks of votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler did not admit to any regret for blowing the whistle on  
corrupt IOC members last December -- a move that led to the 
resignations of SLOC's vice president and president, the purge of 
10 IOC members, wrenching reform at IOC and six separate 
investigations. The Justice Department and Utah attorney general's 
office are still investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed previous reports that Dave Johnson, then the  
No. 2 official of SLOC and a bid leader, telephoned him last Nov. 
19 or 20 to tell him ``some important documents'' regarding a 
scholarship program were stolen from the committee and turned over 
to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `What should we do?'''  
</P>
<P>
	Days later, KTVX-TV broke the news that Johnson sent a letter to  
the daughter of the late IOC member Rene Essomba of Cameroon, 
ending a $10,000-a-year scholarship. That was the first documented 
proof of abuse of power within the IOC and the first element in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had heard rumors for a long time, but we never really had  
facts,'' said Hodler, who helped write the IOC's old ethics code.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Politics Leads to Apathy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- High Kremlin politics appear to be far away from  
Babushkino neighborhood in northeastern Moscow, a cluster of 
residential apartment buildings built hastily during a 1960s 
construction boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Few seem to care whether Sergei Stepashin is confirmed Wednesday  
as Russia's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The buildings are nicknamed ``khrushchoby,'' after then-Soviet  
leader Nikita Khrushchev. It translates as something like 
``khrushch-slums,'' and the view from the slums is one of 
indifference, perhaps amusement. 
</P>
<P>
	``A circus, I'm telling you, it's a circus. The premiers keep  
coming and going,'' said Vladimir Vishnevsky. ``How can one be 
serious about it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vishnevsky, 43, works as an occasional driver for foreign  
companies and does not feel that his life depends on the outcome of 
Wednesday's parliamentary vote. Yevgeny Primakov was fired as prime 
minister last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin is the third prime minister named by President Boris  
Yeltsin in a year, and many Russians are tired of the constant 
political leapfrog and too busy with their daily affairs to worry 
about Stepashin's confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	There is disbelief that a change of prime ministers will achieve  
a more fundamental change -- a healthy economy, perhaps, or a 
society purged of pervasive corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that I want a normal government and a normal  
life, and I don't care whether it's Stepashin or Primakov,'' said 
Suzannah Kiryayeva, a teen-ager about to graduate from secondary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The longing for normal life and political stability also is  
evident among the Babushkino pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't think about the people, they think only about  
themselves and their pockets,'' said pensioner Nikolai Ostapenko, 
awaiting a train at a crowded subway station. ``In that sense, it 
is better to have a guy who had served in the post. He would not be 
that greedy. Primakov seemed all right, so Yeltsin kicked him 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Stern, a secretary, also said she felt sorry for ``poor  
Primakov, thrown out like a dog.'' And, like the others, she 
directed her frustration at Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old president's approval rating already was at an  
all-time low before he ousted Primakov's Cabinet. The dismissal of 
the popular premier appeared to have ended any semblance of 
popularity for Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should just go,'' Stern said.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Presents E-Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co., already bolstered  
by a profitable second quarter, on Tuesday unveiled its strategy 
for the future: electronic services. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Platt, the company's chairman and chief executive officer,  
dubbed e-services: ``The Internet: Chapter Two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Livermore, the president and chief executive of HP's  
Enterprise Computing business, expanded on the idea. She suggested 
that ``Chapter One'' was e-commerce, where companies like 
Amazon.com presented their goods and services on the Internet, and 
e-business, which brought transactions and other business practices 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 'Chapter One' you have to work the Web,'' Platt said. ``In  
`Chapter Two,' the Web will work for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the consumer, e-services will integrate separate tasks. If  
you are traveling, an e-service can coordinate air travel, hotel, 
rental car and dinner reservations, Livermore said. If your plane 
is delayed, it will notify you and adjust your other reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	For a business, e-services will create new sources of revenue  
and new, efficient ways to conduct business. For instance, software 
companies that currently sell products in traditional ways could 
instead put them on the Internet and charge on a per-use basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just a vision,'' she said. ``This is something  
that's happening today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Hewlett-Packard announced a 34 percent increase in  
second-quarter profits, beating analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palo Alto-based maker of computers, printers and high-tech  
accessories said Monday it earned $918 million, or 88 cents a 
share, for the three months ended April 30. It earned $685 million, 
or 65 cents a share in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 3 percent to $12.4 billion from $12 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the stock closed at an all-time high of 96, up 7 1/4 on  
the quarterly report. 
</P>
<P>
	E-services is part of a plan to re-energize the 60-year-old  
computer company into a strong Internet presence. Last week, 
computer giant IBM announced that 25 percent of the company's total 
revenues last year were Internet-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Kunstler, an analyst for J.P. Morgan in San Francisco,  
said HP's Internet strategy was essential. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for them. It's necessary,'' he said. ``You can't be  
in a league with IBM and Sun if you don't have an Internet 
presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An essential component of e-services is e-speak, HP's Internet  
language that will bring together the various services, said Rajiv 
Gupta, general manager of HP's Open Services Operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no easy way to get services to integrate on the  
Internet right now,'' he said. ``Truly, e-speak will do for 
services what the Web has done for data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another key to e-services is Hewlett-Packard's partners. HP has  
alliances with Qwest Communications, Microsoft Corp., PSINet, 
Answer Financial, Internet Travel Network, Anderson Consulting and 
other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``HP showed us they had really redefined themselves as a  
corporation,'' said Lewis Wilks of Qwest, a Denver-based provider 
of data networking, Internet and voice services.

<HEADLINE> Sawyer To Stay at Morning Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson have agreed to  
stay another year as hosts of ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' the 
troubled news show that has been revived since they came aboard in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News President David Westin made the announcement to  
advertisers Tuesday at a presentation of the network's plans for 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had such a great time that they've agreed to stay  
on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer and Gibson were billed as a temporary fix when they  
replaced Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman in January. At the time, 
Sawyer said she expected to work on the morning show for a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, viewership for ``Good Morning America'' has gone up  
27 percent. The show is still far behind NBC's ``Today'' in the 
ratings, but is no longer threatening to slip behind CBS' ``This 
Morning'' into third place. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is building a new studio in Times Square for ``Good Morning  
America'' that is expected to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS recently announced that Bryant Gumbel will take over as its  
morning show anchor in November. ABC's competitors have sought to 
exploit the uncertainty over how long Sawyer and Gibson would 
remain as hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Westin assured advertisers looking at purchasing time for the  
next TV season that ``they will be buying Charlie and Diane.'' 
That's a signal the duo will remain in place until at least May 
2000, when the TV season traditionally ends.

<HEADLINE> Gates Enjoys 'Star Wars' Preview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Bill Gates took his wife to the movies, sat with  
an old friend and thought the show was great. 
</P>
<P>
	But things are never quite that simple for the Microsoft chief.  
</P>
<P>
	The movie was ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace''; the  
tickets were $1,000 apiece; and the old friend was Paul Allen, who 
started Microsoft with Gates and owns the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates and hundreds of other ``Star Wars'' fans -- many of them  
computer industry people made wealthy from working at Microsoft -- 
attended Sunday's special showing at Allen's newly restored 
Cinerama theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The screening raised more than $500,000 for Children's Hospital  
and Regional Medical Center, a charity favored by Gates' wife, 
Melinda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great,'' Gates said of the movie.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Accuses Amtrak Crash Driver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The truck driver involved in an Amtrak crash  
that claimed 11 lives in Illinois stands accused by the federal 
government of falsifying his driving time log book and is on notice 
that he will be fined. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Shibley, spokeswoman for the Federal Highway  
Administration, said Monday that drivers are allowed some leeway in 
filling out their log books, ``but there were four occasions where 
this was clearly a false log.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal rules say a trucker must be away from the wheel for at  
least eight hours after driving for 10 hours. Driving time must be 
logged in a book available for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Shibley did not immediately have details of the driver's alleged  
infractions, which she said were spelled out in a letter sent to 
him on Monday. Federal regulations allow a fine of $500 per 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Sacks, attorney for driver John R. Stokes, said he had  
not seen the letter and knew nothing about it. ``It's nice they 
tell everyone else before John,'' Sacks said. ``That way they can 
sufficiently prejudice the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes was operating with a probationary permit because of  
previous traffic violations when Amtrak's City of New Orleans train 
slammed into his steel-hauling truck March 15 at Bourbonnais, Ill. 
Eleven aboard the train were killed, and more than 100 were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to determine whether Stokes went around  
the railroad crossing guards when the lights were flashing and 
security gates were down. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner's inquest has ruled the deaths were accidental, but  
that does not preclude prosecutors from bringing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes is to lose his commercial driver's license June 1 for 60  
days because of a ticket unrelated to the crash. He has been 
ticketed for moving violations at least seven times since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Feds Hear Complaints on Child Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating  
nearly 2,000 complaints that handles on some Kolcraft Enterprises 
infant carrier-car seats can unlatch or slip suddenly when they're 
used outside the vehicle, dumping babies on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received  
1,992 complaints from parents about the handle, which either slips 
out of the locked position or detaches from the infant seat, 
abruptly flipping the seat forward or backward, according to a 
monthly agency report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents reported 91 babies were tossed from their infant seats,  
resulting in 54 injuries, when the infant seats were removed from 
the car and used as carriers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators are examining the construction of the  
handles on Kolcraft Infant Riders manufactured from 1995 through 
1998 and the Secura, manufactured from 1997 through this year. More 
than 400,000 of those infant seats were made during the years under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolcraft's general counsel, Eileen Lysaught, said the company  
was cooperating with the investigation. In a January letter to the 
safety agency, Kolcraft president Tom Koltun said that ``no safety 
defect exists'' in the infant seats and that ``the incidence of 
handle slippage is rare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation is one of two recently launched by the agency  
involving the handles on infant seats that also can be used as 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators continue to investigate about 460,000 Arriva  
and Turn-About seats manufactured by Cosco Inc., from 1995 through 
1998. Earlier this year, there were 37 complaints from parents 
about the handles on the Cosco seats, including eight reports of 
infants being ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after another agency investigation, Evenflo Co.  
recalled 800,000 of its combination infant carrier-car seats 
because of a faulty handle. When the seat was used as a carrier 
outside of a car, the locking mechanism on the handle could slip, 
flip the seat forward and toss the baby on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the Kolcraft seats, most of the complaints are  
about two types of Infant Rider handles -- the standard handle and a 
curved ``smart'' handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Several parents said the handle would unlatch or slip when they  
were resting the child carrier on a hip or leg.

<HEADLINE> Irish Anglicans Warn Orangemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- In a vote designed to reduce street  
violence this summer, the Anglican Church of Ireland voted 
overwhelmingly Tuesday against Northern Ireland's major pro-British 
Protestant group, the Orange Order. 
</P>
<P>
	By a more than 5-to-1 margin, the bishops and several hundred  
ministers voted at the church's annual conference to demand that 
Orangemen adhere to strict guidelines or have their privilege to 
worship at a rural Church of Ireland parish withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop Robin Eames, leader of the approximately 350,000  
Anglicans in both parts of Ireland, said the motion marked ``a 
defining moment'' in the history of the church's normally good 
relations with the 204-year-old fraternal group. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three summers, the graveyard and pastures  
surrounding the Drumcree Church of Ireland church near the 
predominantly Protestant town of Portadown have become a 
battlefield between British security forces and Orangemen trying to 
march through the town's main Catholic district. 
</P>
<P>
	Church authorities have been heavily criticized for not  
previously distancing themselves from the Orangemen, who have 
marched to and from the church each first Sunday in July since the 
1810s. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, they have faced concerted Catholic opposition on one  
stretch of road. Police forced the march down the road in 1996 and 
1997, and blocked it last year. The dispute has triggered rioting 
across Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion said Orangemen would not be welcome at Drumcree this  
July 4 unless Orange leaders promised their supporters would ``do 
nothing to diminish the sanctity of the act of worship'' and 
``remain obedient to the law before and after any service at 
Drumcree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latter condition appears to require the Orange Order to  
accept this year's verdict by a British government-appointed 
commission empowered to rule whether disputed Northern Ireland 
parades should proceed or be banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange leaders have refused all contact with the commission,  
branding it illegal and arguing that the 80,000-member organization 
should not have its right to assemble restricted in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	The rector of Drumcree -- who voted against the measure -- said he  
was certain that Orange leaders would make the necessary pledges 
and be welcome again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never prevent anyone going to church to worship  
Almighty God,'' said the Rev. John Pickering. 
</P>
<P>
	Several clergymen from British-ruled Northern Ireland criticized  
the proposal. But almost every member who spoke from the Republic 
of Ireland -- where a small Protestant minority lives amicably 
alongside its overwhelmingly Catholic neighbors -- said they were 
embarrassed and ashamed by their church's apparent tolerance of 
divisive, violent Orange protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference passed another motion, prohibiting the flying of  
British union flags from the steeples of its churches, a common 
practice in Northern Ireland. This, too, was designed to lessen the 
perception that the church was taking sides in the province's 
three-decade-long conflict.

<HEADLINE> Test Planned for New Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A highly publicized experimental cancer drug that  
wiped out tumors in mice will be tested on patients for the first 
time in Boston later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic effect of the drug called endostatin has raised the  
hopes of cancer patients and the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's exciting, but of course you always have the risk  
that something will fail'' in early testing, said Dr. Judah 
Folkman, the Harvard University and Children's Hospital researcher 
whose assistant, Michael O'Reilly, discovered endostatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin and a sister protein, angiostatin, work by destroying  
the tumors' ability to sprout new blood vessels, but do not harm 
normal cells. This makes cancer fall dormant or disappear 
altogether in lab animals, but no one knows if the same thing will 
happen in people. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the trial will check for adverse side  
effects, though researchers will also look for signs that the drug 
is halting progress of tumors. If the drug is found to be safe, a 
second phase will evaluate the drug's effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase, to begin in the fall, will involve about 25  
patients at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's 
Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, all in Boston. 
Candidates must have solid tumors from lymphoma or cancers of the 
colon, breast and other organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial tests will be sponsored by EntreMed Inc., a  
Maryland-based biotech company which licensed the right to develop 
endostatin from Boston's Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Two similar Phase I trials studying possible side effects,  
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, will begin after the 
Boston trials. They will be done at the University of Texas, M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Institute in Houston and the University of 
Wisconsin's Comprehensive Cancer Center in Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin and angiostatin have been the subject of a roller  
coaster of speculation ever since an enthusiastic front-page story 
on Folkman in The New York Times a year ago. Doubts cropped up last 
fall when it was reported that scientists from the National Cancer 
Institute had not been able to reproduce Folkman's results. Then in 
February, an NCI team said it had at last duplicated Folkman's work 
by having the NCI scientists conduct the experiments at Folkman's 
laboratory in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates  
unchanged Tuesday but put financial markets on notice that it is 
poised to raise rates if inflation concerns continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Following last week's worrisome jump in consumer prices, the  
Federal Open Market Committee, comprising Fed board members in 
Washington and regional bank presidents, said it has adopted a 
policy stance that tilts toward future interest rate increases. The 
one-page statement marked the first time the Fed had ever signaled 
a change in its operating policy in such a manner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup  
of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable 
performance of the economy,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private economists viewed the Fed announcement as a clear  
warning that rates could start to go up as early as the central 
bank's next meeting on June 29-30 if the U.S. economy has shown no 
signs of slowing on its own by that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed's hand was forced by the much-larger-than-expected  
increase in consumer prices,'' said David Jones, chief economist at 
Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. ``The Fed saw domestic growth 
as too strong and increased dangers from an already tight labor 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported last Friday that consumer prices, led by  
a record surge in gasoline costs, rose 0.7 percent in April, the 
worst showing in almost nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, on edge since Friday's inflation report, fell  
further on the Fed announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average, 
up more than 60 points just before the Fed's afternoon 
announcement, ended the day down 16 points. It was a third 
consecutive losing session after the Dow hit a new high Thursday 
before the inflation report came out. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOMC, which meets eight times a year to set interest rates,  
used a new signaling option of immediately announcing a change in 
its policy bias. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed immediately announces rate changes, it has waited  
until eight weeks later to reveal changes in what is known as its 
policy directive, the bias it adopts that points toward likely 
future actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, a key determinant of banks' prime  
lending rate, has been at 4.75 percent since Nov. 17 after three 
consecutive quarter-point cuts the Fed engineered last fall to keep 
the U.S. economy from falling victim to global financial turmoil. 
At its November meeting, the Fed moved its bias from leaning toward 
rate cuts to neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed officials decided in December they wanted to have the option  
of immediately announcing changes in policy bias in an effort to 
put markets on notice that future rate changes are possible. 
</P>
<P>
	With the stock market at such lofty highs, economists expect  
that rate hikes, when they do occur, will trigger a sell-off by 
investors worried that a slowdown in the U.S. economy will dampen 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy is in its longest period of growth in peacetime  
history, the ninth year of uninterrupted growth since the end of 
the 1990-91 recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation has remained low even as unemployment has dipped to  
three-decade lows. The jobless rate currently is 4.3 percent, far 
below the 6 percent threshold that economists used to view as the 
line that would trigger rising wage pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	America's good inflation performance was helped last year by the  
global financial crisis, which pushed one-third of the world 
economy into recession and resulted in a glut of many commodities, 
including oil. But with economies now recovering and oil prices 
rebounding, the Fed has become wary of future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Fed deferred immediate interest rates increases,  
critics said the change in the policy bias was premature given that 
a number of inflation indexes outside of the CPI have shown no 
warnings of price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under these circumstances, the United States needs to act as  
an economic locomotive pulling the rest of the world toward growth 
and stability,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National 
Association of Manufacturers, which urged the central bank to 
withhold raising rates for the rest of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists said an actual rate hike is likely either at the  
Fed's June or August meeting. But Merrill Lynch economist Gerald 
Cohen said he believes the Fed could remain on hold for the rest of 
the year if Cohen's forecast proves accurate that consumer 
spending, home building and overall economic growth will slow 
significantly from their first quarter performance.

<HEADLINE> Composer To Honor Linda McCartney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Eight British composers have organized a classical  
music tribute to honor Linda McCartney, the late wife of former 
Beatle Paul McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert, which will include five McCartney songs, will  
launch a new charity called the Garland Appeal, which aims to raise 
money for cancer research that doesn't involve animal testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The composers involved in the project include McCartney, Sir  
Richard Rodney Bennett and John Tavener, whose piece ``Song for 
Athene'' was used at Princess Diana's funeral in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert will debut at the Charterhouse public school in  
Surrey on July 18 before going to the Riverside Church in New York 
on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes a month after a celebrity rock concert at  
London's Royal Albert Hall in McCartney's memory, family spokesman 
Geoff Baker said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda McCartney, a professional photographer, died of breast  
cancer in April 1998. She was a passionate supporter of animal 
welfare and launched a vegetarian food empire.

<HEADLINE> Neb. May OK Execution Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska's one-house Legislature is on the  
verge of becoming the first in the nation to vote for a moratorium 
on executions. But why here? Why now? 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, after all, has long been a conservative Republican  
bastion populated by hard-working, law-and-order Midwesterners. As 
many of 80 percent of registered voters have indicated support for 
the death penalty in polls, a sentiment echoed in a survey of state 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the moratorium suggestion came from a surprising source:  
Republican Sen. Kermit Brashear, the conservative chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee and a longtime capital punishment supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brashear says state law requires the death penalty be applied  
fairly, uniformly and ``scrupulously.'' But he says many of the 155 
murderers serving life sentences committed crimes just as heinous 
as those of the 10 men now on Nebraska's death row. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are beginning to understand the difference between  
believing in the death penalty, but not wanting it done in a way 
that does not honor and uphold the law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Associated Press survey this year, more than three-fourths  
of the Nebraska senators who responded said they were against 
abolishing the death penalty. Now, more than half of the 49 members 
of the nonpartisan Legislature embrace the idea of a two-year 
moratorium on executions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have considered such moratoriums but have not  
adopted legislation, according to the Death Penalty Information 
Center, a Washington-based group critical of how capital punishment 
is applied. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials stopped executions for a year after a fire  
started during a 1997 electrocution. In March, the Illinois House 
Judiciary Committee voted for a measure that would halt executions 
for one year while a study is done. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association and the National Conference of  
Catholic Bishops have called for such moratoriums. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 38 states with the death penalty, Nebraska is among the six  
that have the electric chair as their sole means of execution. Sen. 
Ernie Chambers, an independent, has introduced a measure to abolish 
the death penalty nearly every year since his election in 1970. His 
bill was passed in 1979 but vetoed by Gov. Charles Thone. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there is enough support to push the idea through two  
of the required three rounds of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is not about the death penalty and whether you  
support it or not,'' Brashear said. ``It's about justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three men have been put to death since Nebraska resumed  
executions in 1994 after a 35-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brashear said that his moratorium idea grew from a series of  
recent state Supreme Court opinions saying that the law regarding 
aggravating and mitigating factors weighed in death penalty cases 
is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Brashear said he still supports the death penalty unless it is  
found that the state is sparing some from death while executing 
others for similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what due process and equal protection are all about,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are expected to send the bill to Gov. Mike Johanns  
before adjourning for the year May 28. Johanns doesn't support the 
moratorium, but will wait until he receives the bill before 
deciding how to respond, spokesman Chris Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton University law professor and political analyst Richard  
Shugrue said Brashear has been careful to couch his idea so it is 
acceptable to most Nebraskans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's appealing to their sense of fairness,'' Shugrue said.  
``Most Nebraskans are willing to take a couple of years to be 
certain that fairness is a key component of the state's decision to 
kill people.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Wednesday  
morning after the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-making committee 
hinted it may raise interest rates. Japanese stocks fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.74 yen at late morning, up 0.88 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
123.20 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 160.90 points,  
or 0.98 percent, to 16,217.72 at the end of the morning session. On 
Tuesday, the average lost 42.40 points, or 0.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was buoyed on buying from U.S.  
funds following the decision by the Fed's Open Market Committee to 
assume a tightening bias regarding interest rates at its Tuesday 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOMC left interest rates unchanged this time, but it put  
financial markets on notice that it is poised to raise them if 
inflation concerns in the U.S. economy continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	The bias was likely to further pry open the gap between U.S. and  
Japanese bond yields, and push up the dollar, market participants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.10 yen, down  
from 131.30 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors turned bearish following the FOMC  
decision, which led them to worry about a slowdown in the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market was also under pressure as many investors  
continued to adopt a cautious position ahead of more corporate 
earnings announcements in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Institutional investors also want to see the earnings  
forecasts for this fiscal year before deciding whether to buy,'' 
said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 21.67 points, or 1.64 percent, to 1,302.48. 
The TOPIX gained 1.72 points, or 0.13 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 16.52  
points at 10,836.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.340 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.280 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.42 yen from 101.96 yen.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Create Rocky Flats Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- About 800 acres of the former Rocky Flats  
nuclear weapons plant will be set aside for wildlife, Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Energy and the Fish and Wildlife Service will  
create ``Rock Creek Reserve,'' a protected area of tall grass 
prairie and wetlands at the nuclear waste cleanup site about 15 
miles northwest of downtown Denver, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reserve represents a remnant of the prairie and a reminder  
of our collective past,'' Richardson said. ``It symbolizes the 
importance of living in harmony with the land as our tribal leaders 
teach us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve, in a 6,000-acre ``buffer zone'' around the core of  
the site, is home to several rare species, including the threatened 
Preble's meadow jumping mouse, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, 
Eastern short-horned lizards and Eastern burrowing owls. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are busy trying to clean up the radioactive waste left  
at Rocky Flats by nearly 40 years of nuclear weapons production. An 
accelerated cleanup began in 1995, and Richardson reiterated his 
pledge that the job would be finished by 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan's critics are worried about the safety of moving  
contaminated materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Marshall, who works for the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice  
Center, said Richardson's wildlife announcement is just a 
distraction from the environmental issues at Rocky Flats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is window dressing,'' Marshall said. ``The real  
issue is whether Rocky Flats gets cleaned up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first shipments of waste are being prepared for transport in  
mid-June to a storage facility in New Mexico, site manager Jessie 
Roberson said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Cites '96 Election Theme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOMERSWORTH, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential contender Pat  
Buchanan is sticking to the same message that helped him win the 
1996 New Hampshire primary, pledging to ``stand up for the jobs of 
working men and women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the political commentator struck a chord with  
workers in New Hampshire and across the nation who feared their 
jobs would go overseas. Tuesday, he returned to that theme at a 
General Electric plant where jobs have been slowly emigrating to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference held across the street from the  
electric meter manufacturing plant, Buchanan accused the federal 
government of driving jobs out of the country with heavy taxes and 
regulation. Despite a robust economy, layoffs like those in 
Somersworth are happening across the country because of government 
policies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is producers and makers and builders of things who are the  
ones losing their jobs in America,'' he said. ``They are some of 
the best jobs in the United States for working men and women. And 
if we don't stop this process we will eventually lose every factory 
and plant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The self-proclaimed candidate of ``peasants with pitchforks'' in  
the last primary, Buchanan said he was the only presidential 
contender in either party who would ``stand up for the jobs of 
working men and women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies would stay in the United States if they had that  
option, Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would impose taxes on imports and offer incentives  
for companies to remain in the United States, but did not offer 
more specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said trade policies like the North American Free Trade  
Agreement, promoted by President Clinton, unfairly pit American 
workers against Mexican workers who get much lower wages. He said 
he would not enter into trade agreements like NAFTA and would tell 
the World Trade Organization to go ``fly a kite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to government figures, 215,797 American workers have  
lost their jobs because of NAFTA in the five years since the trade 
agreement took effect, said Michelle Sforza, research director of 
Public Citizen's World Trade Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that figure only includes those workers who qualified  
for NAFTA-related unemployment benefits, and does not represent all 
the jobs lost. Most of the jobs lost were in manufacturing -- 
especially the auto, electronics and textile and apparel 
industries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm elected I will reverse those policies 180 degrees and  
bring those jobs home,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some voters will be drawn to Buchanan's consistency, even though  
the economy has improved in the past four years, according to Ken 
Egan, executive director of New Hampshire's Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat's playbook really hasn't changed,'' Egan said. ``He  
doesn't waffle. People know what he believes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategist Tom Rath agrees that consistency is one of  
Buchanan's strong points, but believes his message won't enjoy the 
wide appeal it did in the last primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a harder sell in a state that's got a jobless  
rate of 2.4 (percent). I don't sense this sense of angst that was 
there even just one presidential cycle ago,'' Rath said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Buchanan may not be aiming for widespread support, Rath  
said. Appealing to a particular niche may help distinguish him from 
other contenders on the Republican right. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a CNN and WMUR-TV poll released two weeks ago,  
Buchanan was the fourth choice of New Hampshire voters with 7 
percent. Texas Gov. George W. Bush had 37 percent, Elizabeth Dole 
had 37 percent, and Arizona Sen. John McCain had 14 percent. The 
margin of error was plus or minus 6 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Scalpers Peddle 'Star Wars' Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As if shelling out up to $9 for a movie  
ticket isn't rough enough, how about spending $50 or more? 
</P>
<P>
	It's what some scalpers are asking for tickets to Wednesday's  
opening of the ``Star Wars'' prequel as they peddle seats to 
screenings long sold out across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible,'' said Tom Sherak, head of 20th Century's  
domestic film group. ``This is just what we didn't want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director-producer George Lucas and 20th Century Fox initially  
decided against advance ticket sales to prevent scalping, but 
relented under pressure from theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
	When tickets went on sale Wednesday, each customer was limited  
to 12 tickets, although there has been no formal way to stop 
scalpers from returning to snag more tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Offers for tickets have been common on the Internet. The online  
auction house eBay has posted hundreds of listings for tickets to 
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were examples of tickets getting bids for double or triple  
their face value. One seller got a bid of $89.99 for two $8.50 
tickets for Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, or roughly five 
times the face price. 
</P>
<P>
	On the high end of the scale, someone was asking $1,000 for 12  
tickets in San Jose, six tickets for each of two shows, telling 
potential customers, ``Here's the chance to be the coolest friend 
ever.'' But no bids had been entered this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice, however flagrant, should have no effect on the  
movie's take at the box office, said Paul Dergarabedian, an 
entertainment analyst with Exhibitor Relations Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a ticket is being scalped, it had to be bought first. The  
theaters are basically going to sell every ticket that's 
available,'' he said. ``The loser is the moviegoer, who gets lost 
in the shuffle and will have to pony up a lot of money to see this 
film.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Deem Hepatitis B Vaccine Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective,  
despite reports that it can cause serious and even life-threatening 
side effects, federal scientists said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before a House subcommittee investigating vaccine  
safety, federal officials said the use of the vaccine has been 
monitored for 15 years, and it has not been proven to be the cause 
of any deaths and is only rarely linked to serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vaccines are extremely safe, but they are not risk-free,''  
said Susan S. Ellenberg, an epidemiologist at the Food and Drug 
Administration. ``While serious complications are extremely rare, 
they do occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellenberg, testifying before the Government Reform subcommittee  
on criminal justice, drug policy and human resources, said a 
federal organization, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 
receives about 12,000 reports a year of incidents related to 
vaccines. Most incidents are minor, such as irritability or fever, 
but about 15 percent are serious, involving death, hospitalization 
or disability. All of the serious incidents are investigated, said 
Ellenberg, but no cause-and-effect connection with the hepatitis B 
vaccine has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	She said many of the adverse events are linked to vaccines only  
by time -- they occurred shortly after a baby or adolescent received 
shots -- but there has been no scientifically conclusive proof that 
the hepatitis B vaccine caused the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,800 or so serious adverse event reports represent only a  
small fraction of the 1.2 million people who annually receive 
hepatitis B shots, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harold S. Margolis, a hepatitis authority at the Centers for  
Disease Control and Prevention, said his organization has seven 
investigations under way to determine if any of the reported side 
effects can be linked to hepatitis vaccines. So far, no link has 
been found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents appearing before the committee, however, claimed  
their children became ill and one even died after getting the 
vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Belkin of New York said his healthy infant daughter died  
within 15 hours of receiving a second hepatitis B injection. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner ruled that the death was caused by sudden infant  
death syndrome, but the pediatrician noted that the brain was 
swollen, which is not associated with SIDS, Belkin said. But he 
said the drug manufacturer told his doctors the vaccine could not 
have caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis said statistics indicate hepatitis B vaccine is not  
linked to SIDS. Since 1992, the number of babies dying of SIDs has 
dropped from about 5,000 to 3,000 a year, while, at the same time, 
more than 80 percent of all children have received the vaccine.If 
the vaccine caused SIDS, he said, the death rate would have gone up 
as more babies were vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Other witnesses linked the hepatitis B vaccine to multiple  
sclerosis and to neurological disorders that include intense pain 
and vomiting, but Margolis said that researchers, who started 
studying the issue in the 1980s, are unable to find a link between 
the vaccine and neurological disorders, including MS. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver and is often  
spread through sexual intercourse or the sharing of needles by drug 
users. However, sex and drugs are not linked to about 40 percent of 
all cases and the exact source of the infection is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease can strike in childhood, but not be detected,  
causing a chronic infection that simmers for decades until it 
destroys the liver, causing death. It has also been linked to liver 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis said hepatitis B kills about 5,000 Americans and 1  
million people worldwide each year. About 220 patients receive 
liver transplants each year because of the disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies or young children who become chronically infected have a  
25 percent chance of dying of liver disease or cancer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said CDC studies show about 12.5 million Americans are  
infected with hepatitis B, a disease 100 times more contagious than 
the virus that causes AIDS. Once an infection occurs, treatment is 
only modestly successful, despite the use of strong drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Childhood vaccinations among populations where hepatitis B is  
common have shown the disease can be prevented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For these reasons, the CDC, the World Health Organization, the  
American Medical Association and most other major health 
organizations have supported adding hepatitis B to the regimen of 
childhood vaccinations. Forty-two states now require it for school 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only by achieving high vaccination rates can we protect the  
American people from this disease,'' Margolis said. The key is to 
start the vaccinations in childhood.

<HEADLINE>  Years Later, McEnroe's Still at It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a few riveting moments, John McEnroe was  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered him on in a passion-filled tiebreaker. He  
threw his racket. He questioned calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this time, the distant flashes of Grand Slams past came  
before 1,925 fans in the final of the Sprint PCS Champions seniors 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have Wimbledon or the U.S. Open,'' the gray-templed,  
40-year-old McEnroe said after parading the trophy around the court 
with a big grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a good crowd, good place, to me it's a big event. Is  
it a bigger event in Qatar? We're going over there in April. I'd 
rather win here, with all due respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a tour that sometimes seems as much show as competition --  
with players playing as much to the crowd as against each other -- 
McEnroe's 6-4, 4-6, (11-9) victory over Mats Wilander was a gem 
between two former No. 1s. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe served well, allowing just four points on his service  
games in the first set, and Wilander looked like a youngster as he 
chased balls in the corners. McEnroe won after saving two match 
points in the extended tiebreaker, which takes the place of the 
third set on the seniors tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``To raise the intensity of a match like today wasn't a  
problem,'' said Wilander, who is 34 and admits he sometimes has 
trouble motivating himself in seniors play. ``Once you get to this 
point, you can find something that's reminiscent of before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good match because I played well. I realized that  
John plays well pretty much all the time. He has such talent. His 
game is so fluid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In six years, the Worldwide Senior Tennis Circuit has become a  
yearlong tour, with 20 tournaments scheduled for the 1999-2000 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a long way from seniors golf -- ticket sales in  
Washington were disappointing despite heavy advance publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it is that we're sort of icing on the  
cake,'' said McEnroe, who has 16 seniors singles titles. ``The main 
tour has got to get going. If the cake isn't baked, then no icing 
is going to do any good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American stops on the tour are heavily dependent on two  
players, McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, who not only can still play a 
good game but will stay and talk about it afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors tore an abdominal muscle and had to retire against  
Jose-Luis Clerc on Friday night. Clerc said it was ``really bad for 
the tournament because everybody wants to see Jimmy Connors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, who won 32 of his 35 matches on the tour last year, is  
still the outspoken, unpredictable character of his ATP days. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to the umpire as the ``clown in the chair,'' said he  
should be considered for the Davis Cup doubles team because he at 
least ``cares about it,'' and otherwise offered his opinions on 
anything and everything about tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be the commissioner of tennis,'' McEnroe said.  
``It would be sort of a liaison. Someone who has a sense of the 
future of the game and who can do something about it as well. 
Someone who can walk out on a tennis court and excite some young 
kid into playing as well as has a good idea of what would allow the 
professional players to play their best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'd be a good candidate, but whether or not it's me, I  
think there should be someone like that.''

<HEADLINE> Endangered Florida Species Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt  
approved a plan Tuesday to protect the Florida panther, the blue 
tail mole skink and other endangered animals and plants in the 
Everglades, calling it the most comprehensive effort of its kind in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Such plans usually focus on one threatened plant or animal at a  
time, or a few species in one ecosystem. The new plan is 
unprecedented because it covers 68 species living in 23 diverse 
habitats. 
</P>
<P>
	Some environmentalists criticized the 2,000-page plan as being  
light on specifics. Jay Slack, a field supervisor with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, which created the plan, said details 
will be released in stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the plan could not be determined. It will require  
the government to buy land, and it will force local governments to 
be more careful about preserving parks and open spaces. Property 
owners will be urged to be aware there could be rare birds such as 
scrub jays in their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is tied to a $7.8 billion proposal -- called the  
Everglades Restudy -- due to go before Congress in July. That plan 
seeks to undo damage done to the Everglades by pollution and 
manmade canals and levees, to ensure enough water for cities, farms 
and the environment for the next half century. 
</P>
<P>
	The species protection plan doesn't require congressional  
approval. It will serve as guidance for managers of the Everglades 
Restudy in how to protect wildlife as they revamp the water system 
through the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Hamilton, regional director of the Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service,  
said the integrated approach is just what his agency needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many times we launch off and try to find ways to protect  
species without a solid plan to know what it takes to improve those 
conditions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miccosukee Indian Tribe, which makes its home in the  
Everglades, called the species protection plan an unnecessary 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department is ``hoping we won't notice their dismal  
failure to do what Congress told them to do 10 years ago to save 
the Everglades where these endangered species live,'' said Dexter 
Lehtinen, the tribe's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan does include some specifics. For instance, it calls for  
more monitoring of the delicate nests of the American crocodile on 
the southern tip of Florida. It also calls for the purchase of 
hardwood hammocks in the Keys to protect the Schaus Swallowtail 
butterfly from harmful insecticides.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Death Row Inmate Exonerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man once sentenced to death for rape and murder  
has become the 12th Illinois death row inmate exonerated in the 
last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dropped charges Monday against Ronald Jones, 49, who  
had been sentenced to die for raping and stabbing to death Debra 
Smith, 28, on March 10, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones confessed in October 1987 to the crime, though he later  
claimed police had beaten the confession out of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been on death row eight years when the state Supreme  
Court threw out his conviction in July 1997 because DNA tests 
showed semen found in Smith's body wasn't from Jones. There was no 
evidence of a second assailant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones remained in the Cook County Jail while prosecutors  
considered whether to retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided to drop the charges after an ``extensive  
investigation,'' Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Ellen 
Mandeltort told Criminal Court Judge Kenneth Wadas on Monday. 
Mandeltort did not elaborate on the results of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time coming,'' said Jones' brother, Albert.  
``This is kind of a shock... It's a pleasant surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones remained in custody because of an outstanding warrant in  
Tennessee that accused him of skipping out of a work release 
program in 1980. Tennessee officials have notified Cook County 
officials that they plan to extradite Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 11 men released from death row in Illinois since capital  
punishment was restored, three were exonerated as a result of 
research done by Northwestern University student journalists led by 
professor David Protess.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raiser Will Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated five  
charges Tuesday against a Democratic fund-raiser accused of hiding 
illegal contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  
reversed a lower court's ruling that had thrown out the five 
false-statements charges against Maria Hsia, who steered thousands 
of dollars from a Buddhist temple to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also affirmed the lower court's ruling that  
Hsia must stand trial on another charge of conspiracy involving 
$65,000 in illegal contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said she was ``surprised and  
disappointed'' in the decision and some form of appeal was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased'' with the ruling, Justice Department  
spokesman Myron Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, was accused of  
disguising contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign and other 
politicians between 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges allege she solicited the donations and then  
orchestrated false filings to the Federal Election Commission. 
Prosecutors said the filings amount to false statements to the 
government because the contributors named were not the true source 
of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia, who has close ties to Gore, pleaded innocent. Her lawyers  
argued in court papers that she never made any claim about the 
names listed with the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	After former Little Rock, Ark., restaurateur Yah Lin ``Charlie''  
Trie, Hsia was the second figure charged by a special Justice 
Department campaign fund-raising task force investigating alleged 
abuses in the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court rejected U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman's  
findings last September that the government's case against Hsia was 
illogical and prosecutors did not show how Hsia ``knowingly 
caused'' false filings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not entirely clear what defects the district court found  
in the government's theory of causation,'' Judge Stephen F. 
Williams wrote for the appeals court. ``The false statements here 
are the political committees' reports identifying certain listed 
names as sources of specific contributions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also rejected Friedman's finding that Hsia's conduct  
was largely shielded by the First Amendment protection for 
political expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who was appointed by President Reagan, was joined in  
the ruling by Judges Judith W. Rogers and David Tatel, both 
appointed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's ruling could boost government prosecutors in at least  
two other cases alleging that Democratic fund-raisers made false 
statements to campaign regulators. Those cases involve Trie and 
Thai businesswoman Pauline Kanchanalak. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie had filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Hsia  
against the government's appeal. However, the appeals court 
rejected his arguments that the FEC reporting forms were 
``fundamentally ambiguous'' and did not request identification of 
the actual source of contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thus reject all arguments that the statements alleged in  
the indictment were 'literally true,''' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia is on trial in Los Angeles on separate tax evasion charges.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Getting Tough on Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Entering the fierce debate over gun control,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert suggested Tuesday requiring background 
checks for all sales at gun shows and raising the age for buying 
handguns at them from 18 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert made his comments shortly before the  
Republican-controlled Senate voted, 78-20, to require the sale of 
``secure gun storage or safety devices'' with handguns. The 
provision also provides liability protections for a gun owner who 
uses a safety lock and whose gun is stolen and used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments by the top Republican in the House, a foe of  
previous gun control legislation, coupled with a recent series of 
votes in the GOP-controlled Senate, underscore how the political 
ground has shifted in the month since two student-gunmen at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., killed 12 students and a 
teacher before turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there needs to be uniformity in what they do at gun  
shows and what they do in a retail business,'' Hastert, R-Ill., 
said in an interview in his Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, he said, ``I'm just saying 21 is basically a standard  
of adulthood, and there's probably a uniformity that fits there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Hastert responded to a question about the age  
of possession for handguns, although an aide later said the speaker 
was referring to raising the age for purchases, not possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to reiterate my support for legislation that closes  
legal loopholes which allow people under the age of 21 to purchase 
handguns at gun shows,'' the Illinois Republican said in a written 
statement. ``I do not believe that people under the age of 21 
should be allowed to purchase handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for greater enforcement of existing laws, saying,  
``It does the country no good for the Congress to pass gun laws if 
the executive branch fails to enforce them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current law bars handgun purchases from licensed dealers to  
anyone under 21, and Hastert's aide said the speaker wants the same 
restrictions to apply to all sales at gun shows. 

</P>
<P>
	Hastert emphasized that he was speaking for himself and not  
attempting to dictate the provisions of legislation. In fact, he 
said, the entire issue of gun control will have to be vetted 
thoroughly within the GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Clinton praised the Senate vote, and thanked  
Hastert ``for agreeing that we should close the gun show loophole 
and raise the age of handgun ownership from 18 to 21.'' Clinton 
said the Senate ``should likewise put progress over politics and 
give its strong backing to these reasonable measures to keep guns 
out of the hands of children and criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said he and House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of  
Missouri had agreed to see whether the two parties could work 
together on the outlines of a response to the Littleton shootings, 
including a look at the cultural issues involved in teen violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert didn't provide any additional specifics. Laura Nichols,  
an aide to Gephardt, said, ``We're going to propose it include 
everything, that it include guns as well as issues related to 
school violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who represents a district outside Chicago, voted  
against the so-called Brady law in 1993, which instituted a 
three-day waiting period for handgun purchasers and established the 
system of instant background checks that supplanted it. He also 
voted against 1994 legislation to ban certain types of assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he said, he expects gun control to reach the House  
floor eventually as part of legislation to stiffen prosecution of 
juvenile offenders, just as a bill pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Republicans and Democrats spent the day struggling over  
gun control issues as part of a debate on legislation to stiffen 
prosecution of juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun lock proposal was crafted by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,  
and Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and embraced by Handgun Control, a gun 
control advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In other votes, the Senate agreed to provisions to stiffen  
penalties for offenses committed by gang members, and for crimes 
committed by offenders wearing body armor. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans last week first approved a provision for  
voluntary background checks in certain instances at gun shows. They 
then backtracked and muscled through a proposal they said would 
require checks for all sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the plan was riddled with loopholes, though, and  
additional votes were expected on the politically charged issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been a public relations nightmare for  
Republicans, GOP aides concede, with lawmakers reversing course 
while Democrats accuse them of doing the bidding of the National 
Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun shows, in particular, have emerged as a flashpoint during  
the Senate gun debate. Current law requires all federally licensed 
dealers to conduct background checks, just as they are required to 
do in their retail outlets. But other, private dealers may sell 
guns without verifying the background of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In his comments, Hastert offered a suggestion that seemed to  
track the Democratic proposal in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	His own view, he said, is ``some ... parallel with what we do in  
stores and what we do in gun shows as far as waiting periods and 
those types of things.'' The waiting period has given way to an 
instant background check in current law. 
</P>
<P>
	As for handguns, Hastert said, ``I think also the situation  
where you have kids who can't buy alcohol till they're 21 years of 
age but they can go out and buy a handgun, and I believe there 
needs to be some conformity to those types of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	States currently regulate liquor possession, but Hastert said he  
wasn't suggesting 50 different laws for handgun possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just saying 21 is basically a standard of adulthood and  
saying there's probably a uniformity that fits here'' in the gun 
debate, he said.

<HEADLINE> Release Angers Venezuelan IOC Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- IOC member Flor Isava of Venezuela is  
considering a boycott of the Sydney Games in protest of Olympics 
Minister Michael Knight's release of members' personal dossiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The files, written by embattled IOC member Phil Coles and his  
partner Patricia Rosenbrock, contained intimate details and were 
apparently written for members of Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Isava, 78, was the subject of favorable notes by Rosenbrock  
which included the observation that, ``Flor `loves men' especially 
good looking, attentive ones. They `keep her young.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Isava was a supporter of Sydney when it won the vote in 1993.  
She wore a green scarf on stage to let Australian officials know 
they had made the final voting round against Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	But she now says her desire to visit Sydney is gone.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am thinking not to go to Sydney again,'' Isava told the  
Sydney Morning Herald. ``If the Games were held next week I would 
not go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Knight has involved the people of Sydney in this dirty  
affair. How ungentlemanly of this Mr. `So and So' to give them to 
the public; to the newspapers!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Knight said ``there's an apology for undue  
criticism and any hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles is under investigation by the IOC for how the dossiers  
made their way to Salt Lake's bid team. 
</P>
<P>
	They were leaked to two media organizations and Knight then  
decided to make them available to all media. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a poll in the Sydney Morning Herald found 51 percent  
of respondents thought Coles should resign from the IOC over 
continuing troubles. He is also being investigated for allegations 
he took expensive jewelry from a businessman associated with 
Athens' failed bid to host the 1996 Games and was censured for 
receiving excessive hospitality from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Herald polled 2,000 people nationwide and 29 percent said he  
should not resign and 19 percent said they did not know. No margin 
of error for the poll was available.

<HEADLINE> Torre Returns To Manage Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joe Torre returned as manager of the New York  
Yankees on Tuesday, taking over the wobbling team exactly two 
months after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	His first game back was not a success on the field -- the Yankees  
lost 6-3 to the Boston Red Sox. Still, he was just glad to be in 
the dugout once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt very good, no fatigue,'' Torre said. ``I was very  
glad. I thought I'd be jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish the result was better.''  
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who has guided the Yankees to two World Series  
championships in three years, joined the club in Boston for the 
start of a three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	And even fans of the Yankees' most ardent rivals were glad to  
see the manager. A sellout crowd at Fenway Park gave him a 
two-minute standing ovation when he walked onto the field to 
present the lineup card, and the scoreboard flashed: ``Welcome 
Back, Joe Torre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been ready to do this about a week,'' Torre said before  
the game. ``I think I'm all the way back. I don't anticipate 
missing any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Don Zimmer, who had managed the Yankees since Torre  
underwent surgery in St. Louis on March 18, returned to his more 
familiar role, sitting at his friend's side in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours before the game, Yankees general manager Brian  
Cashman walked up to Zimmer, shook his hand and whispered, ``Thank 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, 58, said he made his decision Monday night, then took a  
flight with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to Boston on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's healthy and he's back and he's well,'' Steinbrenner said.  
``It's a special day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, the Yankees' sixth in seven games, dropped them out of  
first place in the AL East, one-half game behind Boston. Coming off 
a 3-6 homestand, New York fell to 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been chomping a little bit lately,'' Torre said. ``It's  
tough when we struggled here. I was feeling a little helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer recently had talked a lot about leaving baseball because  
of a bad knee, but had said he would not walk away until Torre came 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be sitting next to me tonight, and I anticipate  
he'll be doing that the rest of the year,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said he called Zimmer in the morning to tell him the  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just said, `Are you ready to do the job you were hired to  
do?''' Torre said. ``He said, `You bet I am.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``A great big hug and a tip of the hat from me,'' he said. ``It  
was just more than he should have had heaped on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who had a run-in with Steinbrenner a few days before the  
season opener, seemed pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a bench coach,'' Zimmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Torre had been with the Yankees for some of their home and road  
games, though he had not felt ready to return on a full-time basis 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a doubt. I had to come back here to see,''  
Torre said. ``I want to busy my mind with something other than when 
the next test is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last week or so, I've been enthusiastic, looking  
forward to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre will continue to undergo tests and said he expects further  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	While Zimmer managed to handle the stress in one of sports' most  
demanding jobs, Torre's calming influence was something the Yankees 
clearly missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real happy that Joe's back, although I don't think Zim  
could have done anything differently,'' Yankees shortstop Derek 
Jeter said. ``He did a good job.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Democrats Compete for Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A buttoned-down black politician trying to  
live down his past as a hot-tempered activist and a white political 
insider tied to controversial former Mayor Frank Rizzo were the 
leading candidates Tuesday in the city's Democratic mayoral 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Street, a black former City Council president, and Marty  
Weinberg, a white lawyer, led the field of five Democrats trying to 
succeed popular Mayor Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat who is credited 
with bringing the city back from the brink of financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell is barred from seeking a third consecutive term.  
</P>
<P>
	The winner will face businessman Sam Katz, who was unopposed in  
the GOP primary and is seeking to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. Street is trying to become the city's 
second black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was expected to do well in the blue-collar rowhouse  
neighborhoods of the nation's fifth-largest city. Street battled 
with another black candidate, John White Jr., for the black vote. 
More than 40 percent of Philadelphia's 1.5 million people are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a political unknown in January but raised more than  
$5.2 million and launched an unprecedented advertising blitz. 
Street raised more than $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Weinberg's TV commercials were aimed squarely at Street,  
the front-runner throughout the race. Weinberg reminded voters of 
Street's past as a community activist, showing old TV footage of 
Street shoving a reporter and throwing a cup of water on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg also played up Street's financial problems, pointing  
out that he defaulted on his student loans and declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The negative advertising led to criticism that Weinberg was  
playing to racial fears. Street mostly ignored the attacks, 
although he came out with an ad four days before the election that 
accused Weinberg of racial divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders repeatedly called for at least one of the three  
black candidates to drop out of the race to give the third a better 
chance of winning. Their pleas were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, meanwhile, had to answer questions about his long  
political relationship with Rizzo, whose administration was blamed 
for police brutality and financial mismanagement. Weinberg defended 
Rizzo as a good man who made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the issues, there was surprising consensus.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the candidates promised to focus on the neighborhoods,  
whose residents felt neglected during the city's downtown building 
boom. The candidates said the mayor should play a bigger role in 
improving city schools and promised to build on Rendell's legacy of 
economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> ABC, WB Each Offering Six New Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC will add new dramas in the fall from the  
creators of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Dawson's Creek,'' and is hoping 
that Michael J. Fox can fill a hole in its schedule created by the 
departure of Tim Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the WB network said Tuesday it will add a sixth night  
of programming in September and include a spinoff series from 
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' among its six new shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven broadcast networks are all presenting their fall  
schedules to advertisers this week, and Tuesday was the chance for 
struggling ABC and the WB, a favorite among teens, to step up. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC made critical strides this season, but its ratings continued  
to slide. Next fall it must replace its most popular comedy, 
Allen's ``Home Improvement.'' The network will move Fox's ``Spin 
City'' comedy into that time slot Tuesdays at 8 p.m. Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has high hopes for ``Snoops,'' a drama about private  
investigators in Los Angeles starring Gina Gershon. It's the 
brainchild of David E. Kelley, creator of ``Ally McBeal.'' The new 
show will air on Sundays, usually the most-watched night of 
television, just before another Kelley series, ``The Practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Williamson, creator of ``Dawson's Creek'' and the movie  
``Scream,'' will premiere ``Wasteland'' on Thursdays. It's an 
ensemble drama set in New York City that features a 25-year-old 
virgin. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of failure to develop shows on Saturday nights, ABC  
is turning that evening over to movies. The network is canceling 
the Olsen twins' show ``Two of a Kind'' and ``Brother's Keeper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WB, the only network to see its ratings go up this year,  
will begin broadcasting Friday nights in the fall. Its only night 
off the air will be Saturdays, and plans are to start there in the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is adding six new programs and canceling ``Smart  
Guy,'' ``The Wayans Brothers'' and ``Rescue 77.'' The comedy ``Zoe, 
Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' is to return in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of the network's half-hour situation comedies will be  
on Friday nights. The rest of the week the network's schedule will 
consist entirely of hour-long dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These shows aren't traditional fare,'' said Susanne Daniels,  
the WB entertainment president. ``They blur the lines between 
comedy and drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Boreanaz, who played Sarah Michelle Gellar's boyfriend in  
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' will have his own show, ``Angel.'' 
It will be broadcast Tuesdays at 9 p.m., following ``Buffy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network is moving ``Charmed'' to Thursday nights, signaling  
a new aggressiveness among networks in competing with NBC on its 
strongest night. ``Felicity'' will switch to Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new shows on the WB:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Jack &AMP; Jill,'' a romantic comedy about a toy inventor and  
fellow post-college friends living in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Safe Harbor,'' a family drama about a Florida sheriff and his  
four boys created by Brenda Hampton, the executive producer of the 
WB's most popular show, ``7th Heaven.'' It will follow ``7th 
Heaven'' on Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Roswell,'' a science fiction drama about a teen-aged alien.  
</P>
<P>
	--''Popular,'' a drama focusing on two mismatched girls set in  
the fictional Jacqueline Kennedy High School. 
</P>
<P>
	--''The Downtowners,'' an animated comedy about a 24-year-old man  
and his teen-age brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Snoops'' and ``Wasteland,'' the new ABC series will  
be: 
</P>
<P>
	--''Odd Man Out,'' a situation comedy about a 14-year-old boy  
living in a house with five women, by the co-writers of the movie 
``There's Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Oh Grow Up,'' a situation comedy about three roommates.  
</P>
<P>
	--''Once and Again,'' a romantic drama about two divorced parents  
who meet for the first time but can't remember how to date. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Then Came You,'' a situation comedy about a 34-year-old  
divorcee falling in love with a man a decade younger.

<HEADLINE> Execs' Pay Irks US Airways Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The top two executives at US Airways made a  
combined $70 million last year and stand to benefit even more from 
a cash incentive program proposed by the board of directors, 
infuriating flight attendants who have been without a contract for 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The $34.2 million paid to Stephen Wolf, chairman of US Airways  
Group, and the $36 million paid to Rakesh Gangwal, chief executive 
officer, came despite a 17 percent drop in the value of the 
company's stock during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The total compensation, which includes salary, bonus, stock  
grants, stock options and add-ons such as free financial planning, 
dwarfs the pay received by the leaders of the country's top three 
airlines. US Airways is No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, United Airlines Chairman Gerald Greenwald received  
compensation totaling $4.3 million, according to the UAL Corp. 
proxy statement. Donald Carty, the new chairman of American 
Airlines, received $9.6 million, while Leo Mullin, president of 
Delta Airlines, received compensation totaling $19.5 million, 
according to their companies' proxies. 
</P>
<P>
	During the US Airways annual meeting in Charlotte, N.C., on  
Wednesday, the board of directors is asking stockholders to approve 
a long-term incentive plan for the airline's senior management. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the plan, the top 30 executives at US Airways will  
be eligible for cash payments of up to 500 percent of their average 
salaries if they meet performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the incentive plan is to encourage behaviors that  
create superior financial performance and to strengthen the 
commonality of interests between (plan) participants and owners in 
creating superior stockholder value,'' the airline's proxy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current terms, both Wolf and Gangwal would be eligible  
for annual bonuses equal to 220 percent of their average salaries. 
That would make them eligible for cash payments of around $1 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's flight attendants complain that the $70 million  
already received by Wolf and Gangwal would cover the annual pay of 
2,000 flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's asking us to lower costs within the airline at the same  
time he's raising them significantly through his own pay and 
compensation package. We're also criticizing the numbers he pulls 
in: Does he really need that?'' said Jeff Zack, spokesman for the 
Association of Flight Attendants, which represents US Airways' 
9,000 flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's last contract expired in December 1997, but since  
then negotiations have bogged down over improvements in pay and 
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways refused to comment on the flight attendants'  
complaints or the incentive plan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to discuss the labor negotiations,'' said  
airline spokesman David Castelveter. ``Those are best left behind 
closed doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf is a longtime airline executive who is known for his red  
suspenders, penchant for fine wines and hobby of collecting Jaguar 
automobiles. His career has taken him from American Airlines to Pan 
Am, Continental, Republic, Tiger International and United Airlines 
before he joined US Airways in January 1996 when it was known as 
USAir. 
</P>
<P>
	In his more recent jobs, he has favored taking a lower salary in  
exchange for company stock. When he started at US Airways, for 
example, his salary was $452,000 but he received 1.3 million stock 
options -- 500,000 of which could be exercised at $12.19 the day he 
started. That was less than the stock's $12.65 closing price that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a business plan that has included a new pilots'  
contract, the purchase of a fleet of Airbus Industrie airplanes and 
a new marketing plan, US Airways stock rose to $62.50 per share at 
the end of 1997. Last year, however, it fell to $52 per share, a 
drop of 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the overall increase in the stock's price left Wolf  
with a pool of unexercised stock options worth $56 million at the 
end of 1998, according to the US Airways proxy. Gangwal's options 
were worth $36 million.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve decided today that  
inflation is not enough of a threat to justify an immediate 
increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fed officials put financial markets on notice that higher  
rates are likely in coming months, warning of the ``need to be 
alert'' to possible inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks gave up some gains immediately after the announcement and  
long-term interest rates turned higher in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 60 points just  
before the Fed announced its decision, was down more than 100 
within 20 minutes. But it was down only about 25 points at 
midafternoon. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, at 5.85 percent 
before the announcemeant, quickly rose to 5.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy may be over the speed limit, but the Fed let us  
off with a warning,'' said Barry Evans, senior vice president of 
John Hancock Funds in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members  
and regional bank presidents, ended closed-door discussions with a 
decision to leave the target for the federal funds rate, the 
interest that banks charge each other, unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fed policy-makers announced they had revised their policy  
bias to show the central bank was leaning toward an increase in 
rates in coming months should inflationary pressures increase. 
</P>
<P>
	This marked the Fed's first use of a new procedure, put into  
effect in December, by which the central bank immediately informs 
the public of major shifts in its views about the balance of risks 
to the economy. In the past, the central bank has waited eight 
weeks before revealing in its minutes any changes in its policy 
bias. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance  
of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential 
for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the 
favorable performance of the economy,'' the Fed said. The one-page 
statement announced a shift in ``policy bias'' from neutral to 
leaning toward a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to leave rates unchanged had been expected despite  
a worrisome 0.7 percent jump in consumer prices reported Friday, 
the biggest one-month increase in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets  
and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the 
committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over 
coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no 
longer be consistent with containing inflation,'' the Fed statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists blamed the April surge in prices on one-time  
factors that they said overstated inflation pressures. They noted 
that other indicators of inflation, including wage pressures, had 
shown no signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	But while analysts had expected the Fed to leave rates alone,  
many had forecast that the Fed would for the first time use its new 
signaling tool to put financial markets on notice that the central 
bank was leaning toward raising rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The countdown is really on for a future tightening move by the  
Fed,'' David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in 
New York, said Monday. ``It is no longer a matter of whether they 
will tighten, but when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence that the economy might be slowing on its own came  
earlier today. The Commerce Department reported that construction 
of new homes and apartments fell for the third straight month with 
the 10.1 percent April decline the biggest monthly drop in more 
than five years. Analysts said this showed that the economy is 
already beginning to slow on its own, lessening the urgency for the 
Fed to act. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's next interest rate meeting is June 29-30. While some  
economists believe a rate hike could occur then, many believe the 
central bank will wait until its August meeting to start raising 
rates if the economy has not slowed enough on its own and 
inflationary pressures are building. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until now, the Fed has only announced actual rate changes  
after meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee, composed of 
Fed governors and bank presidents who gather eight times a year to 
set interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	However, at its December meeting, the committee approved a  
change in policy that will allow it to reveal changes in its 
members' ``bias,'' or disposition toward future rate changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a series of three interest rate cuts last fall, the Fed  
has been in a neutral stance, meaning a rate cut was as likely as a 
rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement that it has changed its bias to leaning  
toward raising rates may be enough, many economists say, to nudge 
interest rates that are set by financial markets in the direction 
the Fed wants. That's because it would confirm investors' 
suspicions that the central bank is leaning toward an increase in 
its own influential federal funds rate -- the interest that banks 
charge each other for overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank last changed the federal funds rate in the fall  
of 1998, cutting it three times in an effort to restore investor 
confidence and avert a worldwide recession. The funds rate has been 
at 4.75 percent since Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate cuts worked and U.S. markets have since soared to  
record levels, bolstered by low U.S. interest rates and continued 
strength in the U.S. economy, which is enjoying the lowest 
unemployment levels in three decades.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Tinkering Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a soapbox for a pet issue, proposing an  
amendment to the Constitution has become a political habit -- more 
often for can't-win changes than for real ones. 
</P>
<P>
	But a foundation study of the amendment process suggests that  
there is more political tinkering than before, and it could make 
unwarranted changes more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard questions are, of course, what is warranted, and should  
constitutional amendments be used to deal with social policy issues 
that seem surmounting now but may not last. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens for the Constitution, a bipartisan organization of  
former members of Congress, federal officials, lawyers and 
scholars, suggests the process should be restrained by guidelines 
to determine whether an amendment should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	They say constitutional amendments should deal with topics of  
lasting importance, not only immediate political concerns, and then 
only when it can't be done by other means. They also want a firm 
deadline set for ratification of amendments that Congress does 
approve. In practice, most amendments now include a seven-year 
limit, but that can be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	By their standards, the amendment up next, to permit Congress to  
ban desecration of the American flag, shouldn't be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag-burning amendment has become a regular exercise in  
Congress. Senate Republican leaders plan a vote on it this month; 
it has narrowly failed there before and, by current estimates, may 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes two-thirds votes in both houses of Congress to approve  
an amendment and put it up for action by the states; three-fourths 
of them must ratify to change the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag-burning amendment was written to overturn a Supreme  
Court decision that invalidated laws against desecration, on First 
Amendment grounds. The case stemmed from a demonstrator's burning 
of a flag outside the Republican National Convention hall in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the amendment argue that while they are as opposed  
to flag-burning as anyone on the other side, it is not a menace 
that warrants changing the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such particularized amendments may ... be perceived as the  
political victory of one faction in a particular historical 
moment,'' the Citizens for the Constitution study says. ``Flag 
desecration is not an immortal form of political protest; we cannot 
know whether political dissidents will have the slightest interest 
in this gesture generations from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, they don't seem to have much interest now, except in  
sporadic episodes meant to irritate sponsors of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag and balanced budget amendments are two that have come  
close to clearing Congress to go to the states. The equal rights 
for women amendment got to that point, but wasn't ratified. The 
last amendment adopted with nationwide application, in 1971, gave 
18-year-olds the right to vote. In 1992, the last four state 
legislatures finally ratified an amendment, sent to the states more 
than two centuries earlier, in 1789, that bars a sitting Congress 
from voting itself a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
	So the foundation study that warns against littering the  
Constitution with constant changes would seem to overstate the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, introducing constitutional amendments is a growth  
business in Congress, and in the last session, nine moved past the 
point of just talk to committee or floor consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's crop is already growing. There are the perennials,  
among them flag-burning bans, an amendment to permit prayer in 
public schools, to overturn the Supreme Court decision legalizing 
abortion, for a balanced budget, for congressional term limits, and 
for to end the electoral college system in favor of the popular 
election of presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposed amendment would permit the line item veto, a  
power granted presidents by the last Congress but overturned by the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also an amendment to make future amendments easier to  
adopt, by opening a route that wouldn't depend on Congress. That 
would allow two-thirds of the state legislatures to approve an 
amendment, subject to congressional disapproval by two-thirds 
votes. The final step still would be ratification by three-fourths 
of the states. One amendment would write into the Constitution a 
provision to put the Social Security and Medicare trust funds 
outside the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The House already has killed one just-for-show amendment this  
session, the annual income tax day measure to require two-thirds 
votes in Congress to approve tax increases. That Republican fixture 
failed, as usual, by 57 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 11,000 amendments to the Constitution have been  
introduced since 1789, but only 33 cleared Congress and only 27 
were ratified. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  The Familiar, Fresh Shine at Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- It happens every year: about halfway  
through the Cannes Film Festival, the amorphous buzz along the 
Croisette starts to take a discernible shape. Here's what it's 
saying about who's shining in the Riviera sun: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PEDRO IS THE NEW ROBERTO:   	
</P>
<P>
	Last year it was Roberto Benigni, the Italian director-actor,  
who had the buzz. This year, it's the almost-as-colorful Spanish 
director, Pedro Almodovar. 
</P>
<P>
	Almodovar's ``All About My Mother'' seems to be the unanimous  
choice among Cannes-watchers for the Golden Palm, the festival's 
top award. It is the 13th film by the man best known for ``Women on 
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and many say it's his best. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of an appealing youth in the beginning of a film could  
easily sink any attempt at lightness. Somehow Almodovar manages to 
achieve the perfect balance between tragedy and humor with a 
quartet of absorbing women who form an offbeat family: a grieving 
single mother, a transvestite, an impressionable young nun and a 
lesbian actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked his secret, the engaging Spaniard is about as modest as  
Benigni. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just talent,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Fans of old Hollywood will appreciate the film's clever tributes  
to ``All About Eve'' and ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' 
Unfortunately, those using the simultaneous English translation at 
the premiere may have missed these references: the title of 
``Streetcar'' became something like ``A Tramway About Feelings,'' 
and Blanche's famous line, ``I have always depended on the kindness 
of strangers,'' sounded like ``I've always counted on people being 
nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WELCOME, TIM AND SUSAN:   	
</P>
<P>
	Some grumbled that the Hollywood star quotient of this festival  
was low. So everyone was glad on Tuesday to see the arrival of Tim 
Robbins and the star-studded cast of ``Cradle Will Rock'': Susan 
Sarandon, Hank Azaria, Vanessa Redgrave, Joan Cusack, Emily Watson 
and Ruben Blades. 
</P>
<P>
	The period film, which also stars Bill Murray and Joan's brother  
John, recounts the true story of a 1930s theater troupe in New York 
risking their careers to perform a play about labor unrest, against 
a background of anti-communist censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	First-time Cannes visitor Azaria, best-known for TV work in  
``Mad About You'' and ``The Simpsons,'' says he was excited by the 
principle the film is based on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not often that actors get to put their beliefs on the  
line,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BEST ACTOR AND ACTRESS:   	
</P>
<P>
	British actor Bob Hoskins gives an enthralling performance as a  
sinister bachelor -- that's putting it mildly -- in Atom Egoyan's 
engrossing ``Felicia's Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hilditch, ostensibly a cheerful catering manager, Hoskins  
spends evenings cooking elaborate meals with the help of old videos 
of his mother's cooking show. Only slowly does the film reveal the 
true horror lurking behind his amiable facade. Both Egoyan and 
Hoskins do a memorable job of pacing the performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecilia Roth has made a deep impression as Manuela, the single  
mother in Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' portraying strength 
and weakness and despair and optimism all at once. A regular in the 
Spaniard's films, this appears to be her big break. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NEW FACES:   	
</P>
<P>
	Two fresh and interesting faces are those of Penelope Cruz, the  
beautiful young nun in Almodovar's film, and Elaine Cassidy, the 
Irish girl who makes extreme naivete plausible in ``Felicia's 
Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least Cruz won't be unknown for long: she plays Matt Damon's  
love interest in an upcoming Billy Bob Thornton film.

<HEADLINE> Scalpers Peddle `Star Wars' Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As if shelling out up to $9 for a movie  
ticket isn't rough enough, how about spending $100 -- or more? 
</P>
<P>
	It's what scalpers are asking for tickets to Wednesday's opening  
of the ``Star Wars'' prequel as they peddle seats to screenings 
long sold out across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible,'' said Tom Sherak, head of 20th Century's  
domestic film group. ``This is just what we didn't want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director-producer George Lucas and 20th Century Fox initially  
decided against advanced ticket sales to prevent scalping, but 
relented under pressure from theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
	When tickets went on sale May 17, each customer was limited to  
12 tickets, although there has been no formal way to stop scalpers 
from returning to snag more tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition for tickets has been especially fierce on the  
Internet. The online auction house eBay has posted hundreds of 
listings for tickets to ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace'' whose face value had doubled or tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a $8.50 ticket to the first showing in a theater in  
Bellevue, Wash., was up for bids starting at $15.00. Two seats at 
an advance showing of the film in Washington, D.C., were bidding at 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice, however flagrant, should have no effect on the  
movie's take at the box office, said Paul Dergarabedian, an 
entertainment analyst with Exhibitor Relations Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a ticket is being scalped, it had to be bought first. The  
theaters are basically going to sell every ticket that's 
available,'' he said. ``The loser is the moviegoer, who gets lost 
in the shuffle and will have to pony up a lot of money to see this 
film.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps 70; Nasdaq Falls Slightly / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as strong  
earnings from Hewlett-Packard helped investors overcome their 
nervousness in advance of today's Federal Reserve meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 70.20 at 10,923.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 3.81 at 1,343.30, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 0.58 at 2,561.26. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two sessions, stocks have slipped as fears of  
inflation rattled the market. On Monday, the Dow fell 59.85 to 
close at 10,853.47. 
</P>
<P>
	An unexpected jump in the consumer price index last Friday  
raised expectations that the Fed would consider pushing rates 
higher at its Open Market Committee meeting today to try to bring 
inflation under control. By Monday afternoon, however, many 
analysts had taken the position that the committee would only issue 
a warning about inflation, and stocks began a gradual recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in  
St. Petersburg, Fla., said the days of intense speculation may have 
insulated the market from any wild swings once the Fed reaches a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A new wave of solid corporate earnings further settled the  
market. Late Monday, Hewlett-Packard reported a 34 percent increase 
in second-quarter profits, soundly beating Wall Street 
expectations. Its stock was up 5 3/4 today at 94 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news from Hewlett-Packard also turned attention toward  
Dell Computer, an industry bellwether scheduled to report earnings 
today. Dell rose 7/16 to 43 11/16 and was the most actively traded 
issue on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 204 million shares, 
ahead of Monday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.19 at 639.11, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.35 at 786.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.26 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.1 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hernandez, Orioles Settle Grievance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Xavier Hernandez and the Baltimore Orioles  
agreed Tuesday to a $2 million settlement for his grievance over a 
voided contract, a person involved in the negotiations told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles voided Hernandez's $2.7 million, two-year contract  
after saying the 33-year-old right-hander failed a physical because 
of a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez subsequently signed a $250,000 contract with the  
Houston Astros and was released at the end of spring training. He 
will receive $1.75 million from the Orioles and the rest of the 
money comes from the contract with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was seeking $2.45 million from the Orioles in the  
grievance, which was argued before arbitrator Richard Bloch on 
Monday. The agreement was reached before Bloch was forced to decide 
the case, the source said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	An Orioles spokesman said a deal had not yet been reached, but  
the sides were still negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was 6-6 with one save and a 3.57 ERA last year. He  
signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets last week and 
will pitch for their Triple-A team in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is just very pleased to have this behind him and get back  
on the field,'' said Hernandez's agent, Barry Meister, who declined 
to discuss details of the agreement. ``You don't get everything you 
want. He strongly feels like this is to his benefit and in his best 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez agreed to his deal with Baltimore on Dec. 17, getting  
a contract that called for $1.2 million this year and $1.25 million 
in 2000. The Orioles had a $1.5 million option for 2001 with a 
$250,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 33, is 40-35 with a 3.90 ERA in 10 seasons with  
Toronto, Houston, the New York Yankees, Cincinnati and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch heard the case as an interim arbitrator. Players and  
owners are searching for a new arbitrator to replace Cornell 
professor Dana Eischen, who was hired in December 1997, but quit 
after ruling in May against J.D. Drew's grievance seeking free 
agency.

<HEADLINE> Navarro Criticizes Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- White Sox right-hander Jamie Navarro didn't back  
down Tuesday from his criticism of umpires for ``squeezing him'' 
with a smaller strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro went on a tirade following Monday night's 13-9 loss to

<HEADLINE> New Home Construction Falls 10 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New construction of homes and apartments took  
the biggest slide in nearly five years last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the sharper-than-expected 10.1 percent drop in  
April occurred in part because unseasonably warm weather in the 
Northeast and the Midwest let builders get more projects than usual 
under way last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, there is less activity in the pipeline this  
spring,'' said David Orr, an economist with First Union Bank Corp. 
in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many economists also have been expecting a moderate  
decline in construction this year from a torrid pace in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started work in April on 1.57 million housing units at  
a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the Commerce Department said 
Tuesday. That marked the third straight month of declines from a 
12-year high of 1.82 million units hit in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, housing starts fell by a tiny 0.06 percent and in  
February by 3.7 percent, according to the department's latest 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest unemployment in nearly three decades, strong stock  
market gains and low mortgage rates combined to create record 
demand for new and existing homes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The home-buying boom so far has continued into 1999, but  
shortages of materials and labor have hampered builders' progress 
in some parts of the country this year, and there have also been 
signs that inflation and mortgage rates may be starting to edge up. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April, the biggest jump in  
nearly nine years, which included a 0.4 percent increase in housing 
costs. And a nationwide survey by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company, showed 30-year mortgages rose to an average rate of 7.10 
percent last week, approaching the 10-month high of 7.11 percent 
hit in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	``While mortgage applications to purchase homes have advanced  
modestly over the last few weeks as home buyers scramble to lock in 
favorable mortgage rates, we expect mortgage applications to slow 
in the near future,'' said Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	Building permits, a good sign of future construction activity,  
fell 5.1 percent in April, also following declines in February and 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in housing construction reflected an 11 percent dip in  
single-family homes started and a 6.5 percent decline in apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The West was the only region that experienced growth in housing  
construction in April -- it rose 2 percent there. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Midwest and the South, new home building plummeted by  
14.6 and 14.5 percent, respectively. It fell by a smaller 6.8 
percent in the Northeast.

<HEADLINE> Suggestions on Using Tax Refund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q. I'm fortunate to be getting an income tax refund this year.  
Any suggestions on how I can put it to good use? 

</P>
<P>
	A. First, some advice on what NOT to do with it: Don't blow it  
all on fancy dinners and indulgent purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial advisors say taxpayers should look to their refund  
checks as a means of making headway on long-delayed goals, such as 
paying down debt, opening an Individual Retirement Account or 
saving for their children's college education. 
</P>
<P>
	The average refund check this year is $1,500, which is 15  
percent higher than last year. It also happens to be just under the 
$2,000 annual limit for IRA contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's found money,'' says Judith Perry, a vice president and  
personal financial consultant at Merrill Lynch in Milwaukee. ``It's 
been a kind of forced savings, and people should continue saving it 
according to their own priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If paying down debt is a goal, individuals should focus on the  
debt that carries the highest interest rates, such as credit cards. 
Paying off a mortgage, where interest rates are generally low these 
days and the interest payments are tax-deductible, should be 
further down on the list, according to financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Investing is another good option. For many, that means putting  
money into a mutual fund of stocks or bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The type you choose depends on many variables, such as age. For  
younger people saving for retirement or college costs, a more 
aggressive stock fund would be appropriate, Perry says. Those 
closer to retirement should choose a more conservative fund, such 
as a balanced fund or bond fund, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	But what about a little shopping spree, you might ask.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think you should postpone that until you win the lottery,''  
Perry says.

<HEADLINE> BT, Nortel Team Up in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- British Telecommunications PLC's Spanish  
subsidiary and Nortel Networks Corp. are building an Internet voice 
and data network that they claim will be the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Nortel's Internet Protocol technology, the high-speed  
fiber optic network will be capable of supporting ``many million'' 
potential customers in Spain, the companies said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	BT Telecomunicaciones S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of  
London-based BT, will offer the high-speed data and voice services 
early next year to residential and business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	IP technology allows telephone voice conversations to be  
converted into bits of data that can be transmitted over phone 
lines. The BT-Nortel network would combine data traffic and 
digitized voice files on the same network and would be compatible 
with traditional telephone networks. 
</P>
<P>
	BT has already spent $640 million on its fixed, mobile and  
Internet interests in Spain and plans to spend at least an 
additional $970 million over the next ten years, according to Pat 
Gallagher, BT's European director. 
</P>
<P>
	BT operates Spain's second largest communications network.  
Nortel is based in Brampton, Ontario.

<HEADLINE> Little Impeachment Fallout Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional candidates need not  
fear repercussions from the House vote to impeach President Clinton 
because Americans are tired of the issue, the top House GOP 
strategist says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters have put this behind them,'' said Rep. Tom Davis,  
R-Va., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
``We're going to talk about the future -- our vision for the 21st 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis told reporters Tuesday that recent internal GOP polls  
showed interest in impeachment as a campaign issue has diminished 
since January, when one-third of voters polled by Republicans said 
it was a key factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the Democratic  
Congressional Campaign Committee, said last week that the 
impeachment vote would be ``most damaging'' to the GOP -- even if 
Democrats don't call attention to it -- and would help demonstrate 
that they are also out of the mainstream on issues such as 
education, health care and protecting Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes off the veneer of them being moderate in any  
manner,'' Kennedy said of December's House impeachment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis admitted that impeachment did ``smother'' the GOP message  
on other issues for a time. But since the Senate acquitted Clinton 
in February, he said, Republicans are ``closing the gap'' with 
Democrats on issues of importance to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, whose party holds a slim 222-211 majority in the House,  
said congressional Republicans are coordinating with some of the 
party's presidential contenders to develop a united campaign 
message for 2000. He wouldn't say which presidential hopefuls, but 
clearly was excited about the potential candidacy of Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outsider, and he's got the brand name,'' Davis said.  
``If we get any kind of help at the top of the ticket, we'll gain 
seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the House campaigns, Davis said the focus is on  
recruiting 30 to 50 ``blue-chip candidates'' to challenge 
vulnerable incumbent Democrats and to run in districts being 
vacated by Democrats. Those include seats now held by Reps. Ron 
Klink of Pennsylvania, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Robert Wise of 
West Virginia, Lane Evans of Illinois and Dennis Moore of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis acknowledged that some GOP incumbents are on shaky ground,  
including Rep. James Rogan of California, one of the most prominent 
House impeachment managers, Rep. Richard Baker of Louisiana and 
Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. But he said incumbents who survived in 
1998 are ``toughened up'' for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are doing some good recruiting, but we don't see  
anything that scares us,'' Davis said. ``We'll have our best team 
in the field. We are out recruiting heavily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis would not release fund-raising figures for the House  
campaign committee but predicted the GOP would best the Democrats 
``2-to-1'' in hard money contributions for specific races, with a 
lesser advantage in soft money donations used for party-building 
activities.

	Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve today said it will not  
raise short-term interest rates at this time, deciding that 
inflation is not enough of a threat. But Fed officials put 
financial markets on notice that higher rates are likely in coming 
months. And Fed policy-makers said they had revised their policy 
bias to show the central bank was leaning toward an increase in 
rates in coming months should inflationary pressures increase. In 
the past, the central bank has waited eight weeks before revealing 
in its minutes any changes in its policy bias.

	Clinton Calls Apache Pilot Risk High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The vaunted Apache attack helicopters that  
were to have added a unique punch to NATO's air campaign are 
unlikely to see combat over Kosovo anytime soon. The risk to pilots 
is simply too great, President Clinton said today, after the 
Pentagon dispatched more ground-attack A-10 jets instead. Weather 
is a factor because the Apaches are designed to fly low -- just a 
few feet off the ground if necessary. Thus, they can operate below 
the cloud cover that bedeviled Air Force attack planes earlier in 
Operation Allied Force. But in recently improved weather 
conditions, that no longer is an advantage. And Serb soldiers would 
be able to shoot the helicopters out of the sky with shoulder-fired 
missiles. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO: Serbs May Be Hiding Evidence  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO officials said today there is  
growing evidence that the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan 
Milosevic is digging up mass graves and trying to hide the evidence 
of war crimes against Kosovo Albanians. David Scheffer, a U.S. 
ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, also said the evidence 
was increasing that the Serbs have used ethnic Albanians as human 
shields during the NATO air campaign that began March 24.

	Scientists Discover Bone Mass Gene  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Scientists have discovered a gene that appears to  
control bone density, opening the way to possible new treatments 
for crippling osteoporosis. Researchers from the biotechnology 
company Chiroscience R&AMP;D found the gene in a small group of South 
Africans suffering from an inherited disease that is the opposite 
of osteoporosis -- these patients can die because their bones grow 
too dense and large. A mutation in the gene appears responsible for 
making bone grow out of control. Chiroscience hopes to harness the 
protein this gene produces and turn it into a drug that might 
increase the bone mass of people with osteoporosis.

	Spam Scam Trapping Consumers

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is suing the  
people responsible for a scam that bills your credit card $375 for 
something you didn't order, and then when you call the number in 
the e-mail to cancel the order, wind up making an overseas call 
that connects you to a sex line. One problem with the lawsuit is 
the FTC doesn't know the individual or company responsible for the 
scheme. So, the government agency is listing the defendant as 
``unknown,'' and hopes to have an identification in a few days. But 
investigators acknowledge that it's tough to crack down on people 
sending out junk e-mails.

	High Tech Cos. Lack Trained Workers  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A new study shows that high tech  
companies in Silicon Valley can't find enough qualified workers to 
fill job openings and it's hampering the industry's growth. That 
employee shortage is translating into a $3 billion loss for local 
high tech companies, according to a study by Joint Venture: Silicon 
Valley Network, a group of public organizations and private 
businesses in the area where most of the top high tech businesses 
in the U.S. are headquartered. The study says the workforce 
shortage is driven in part by a lack of interest among area high 
school students in high tech careers.

<HEADLINE> Indy 500 Denies SI Credentials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A Sports Illustrated writer has been denied  
credentials for the Indianapolis 500, partly because the magazine 
ran a photograph of a sheet-covered body after three fans were 
killed at a race earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, SI said it would not cover the event.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony George, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and  
founder of the Indy Racing League, said in a letter to SI that Ed 
Hinton, the magazine's senior auto racing writer, would be barred 
from the May 30 race. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL was angered by the photo and accompanying story in which  
Hinton wrote that such accidents could be avoided. The article in 
the May 10 issue was headlined ``Fatal Attractions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By no means are we going to allow them to dictate how we cover  
events,'' SI spokesman Joe Assad said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway offered to provide credentials for a different  
writer, but the magazine declined. 
</P>
<P>
	SI will not cover the race unless something ``major'' happens,  
Assad said. In that case, it would probably rely on stringers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators were killed and eight others injured when  
debris from a crash during the May 1 VisionAire 500 in Concord, 
N.C., flew over a 15-foot fence and into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The photograph, by The Associated Press, showed one victim with  
a leg protruding from beneath a sheet, lying on the blood-covered 
grandstand steps. It also showed another sheet-covered body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The photograph in Sports Illustrated was very tasteless and  
offensive, not only to the family of the deceased but to many 
people, including us,'' IRL spokesman Fred Nation said. ``The total 
coverage of the story, we thought, was offensive and inaccurate, 
and that's why we took the action we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mai Lindstrom, an IRL spokeswoman, said that while some of the  
AP photos were ``very graphic, to our knowledge, SI was the only 
publication that chose to print one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Horton, AP's senior photo editor for sports, said, ``AP  
photo editors were sensitive to the graphic nature of the 
photographs. We carefully edited pictures from the accident to make 
sure the coverage was accurate and responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horton said there had been no complaints from AP members.  
</P>
<P>
	In the story, Hinton noted three spectators also died in a  
similar crash at a Championship Auto Racing Teams race at Michigan 
last year. He said either tragedy, in isolation, might have passed 
as ``a grievous fluke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Together they should ignite a public outcry that doesn't  
dissipate until track officials devise a plan to prevent further 
episodes of this nature,'' he wrote, adding that IRL and CART 
should stop racing on high-speed oval tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the page opposite the photo, SI ran a full-page Valvoline ad  
that showed five men peering under the hood of a car, with the 
caption, ``You're born. You die. In between you work on cars. We 
should all be so lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valvoline and SI apologized for the placement of the ad.  
</P>
<P>
	Hinton said he had nothing to do with the selection of the photo  
and that the headline was written by editors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stand by the story, we stand by the picture and I  
understand the reasons it was run, graphic as it was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hitachi, Cambridge Unveil New Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and the University of  
Cambridge have developed a computer chip that could lead to smaller 
and faster computer equipment and cellular phones, Hitachi said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductors, called PLEDM chips, could replace a variety  
of today's memory devices, Hitachi said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	The chips, which could show up in products in five years, pack  
information into a smaller space than conventional dynamic random 
access memory chips, the main memories in computers today, the 
electronics giant said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the chips retain their memory even without power.  
That feature could make the new technology handy for use in 
cellular phones, for example, which must retain phone numbers even 
when the batteries fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitachi's European arm and the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge  
University hope to produce memory chips using the technology within 
a year and have it on the market within five, they announced in 
London on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	DRAM chips are made up of transistors, which regulate the flow  
of electricity, and capacitors, which store a charge. The key to 
developing the PLEDM chip, an acronym for Phase-state Low Electron 
Drive Memory, was to use a second transistor instead of a 
capacitor, Hitachi said.

<HEADLINE> ShopKo Plans Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- ShopKo Stores, Inc. will expand two  
distribution centers, one in Wisconsin and one in Idaho, and build 
a new center in Nebraska under a project that will cost about $70 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, announced Tuesday, will help the company grow and  
improve service to its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The De Pere, Wis., distribution center is expected to be  
expanded to 494,000 square feet from its existing 269,000 square 
feet. Plans are to expand the Boise, Idaho, facility to 347,000 
square feet from the present 214,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on both facilities will begin this summer and will  
be completed by summer, 2000, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Omaha, Neb., area ShopKo's existing 52,500 square-foot  
distribution center will be closed and replaced with a new 387,000 
square-foot facility, which is expected to open in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``ShopKo's distribution capabilities will be well-prepared for  
the future as we continue to pursue aggressive growth,'' said 
ShopKo president and chief executive officer William Podany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have stated publicly that we intend to add more stores in  
the geographic region we currently serve. This investment provides 
the foundation for that growth.''

<HEADLINE> Discovery Launch Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Grounded by hail damage, space  
shuttle Discovery probably will not lift off on its station-supply 
mission until Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was supposed to soar this Thursday. Instead, NASA sent  
the shuttle back to the hangar for repairs to its external fuel 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians discovered 648 holes in the foam insulation covering  
the tank, more than they expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the cavities are so small they do not need to be fixed,  
NASA spokesman Joel Wells said Tuesday. Most, however, are being 
sanded or patched to prevent ice from forming when the tank is 
filled with super-cold fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers feared ice in the cavities could break off during  
liftoff and damage the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA still is targeting launch for no earlier than May 27, but  
the agency is going to be ``hard pressed'' to make that date, Wells 
said. Shuttle managers figure they will need a week to prepare 
Discovery for launch once it's back on the pad. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery is loaded with 1 1/2 tons of equipment for the  
international space station, which was hoisted into orbit late last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Defense Tough on O'Neal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Spurs may finally be shedding their  
``soft'' image after their attack on Shaq. And Shaq doesn't like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Four San Antonio players took turns guarding Los Angeles Lakers  
center Shaquille O'Neal in the rough opening game of their Western 
Conference semifinal series Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to guard Shaq is to break the rules that they NBA  
is supposed to enforce but they never enforce,'' the 7-foot-1, 
315-pound O'Neal said Tuesday after the Spurs 87-81 win over the 
Lakers Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to break me.''  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal wouldn't elaborate about what rules he thought were  
violated. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, he ran after referee Steve Javie but Lakers  
coach Kurt Rambis kept O'Neal from getting close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get a chance to say anything to him,'' O'Neal said.  
</P>
<P>
	Guarded at various points by Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Will  
Perdue and Malik Rose, O'Neal went to the foul line 14 times and 
made nine of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who'd been averaging a league-best 29.5 points in the  
playoffs before facing the Spurs, had 21 points and 15 rebounds in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was obviously a tough one for him,'' Robinson said  
Tuesday. ``He didn't get his average. So that was a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan led the Spurs with 25 points, and Robinson added 15  
points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 in the best-of-7 playoff series is Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who said the Spurs were prepared to use lots of fouls  
in their attempt to shut down O'Neal, expects the series to get 
even more physical as it goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the nature of the playoffs,'' Robinson said. ``But it's  
still about basketball. You've got to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson knows what it takes to succeed -- and fail. In his 10  
seasons in the NBA, the Spurs have been to the playoffs nine times 
but made it past the conference semifinals only once, in 1995 when 
the Spurs lost to Houston in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	That record and Robinson's sometimes disappointing postseason  
performance got the Spurs branded as ``soft'' in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, with the addition of veterans Mario Elie, Jerome  
Kersey and Steve Kerr, the Spurs added more playoff experience and 
physical and emotional intensity on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs won their first-round series with Minnesota 3-1,  
capping it with a hard-fought game that left Elie with a cut and 
stitches above his right eye and Robinson with a technical foul for 
a slapping and shoving match with Joe Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that San Antonio has won its series opener against the  
Lakers in another aggressive contest, does Robinson believe the 
label ``soft'' has been wiped away for good? 
</P>
<P>
	``If you say so,'' he said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Lakers shot only 38 percent Monday night, they  
still had chances to win in the final period and at one point 
pulled to within five points. The Spurs, shooting 42 percent for 
the game, committed nine turnovers in the fourth quarter and missed 
some critical free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to watch a lot of film and we're going to try to  
figure out some of those fourth quarter problems,'' Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis plans some changes for the Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do a much better jot at not being predictable with  
what we're going,'' he said. ``They knew exactly how they were 
going to double team and what they were going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis also expects a better game out of O'Neal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's going to play better,'' he said. ``There's no  
doubt in my mind.''

<HEADLINE> Wis. DA Ponders Hate Crime Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- A white man was charged with deliberately  
driving over a curb and running down two black boys on bicycles, 
and the youngsters' family says the motorist should be charged with 
a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said James G. Langenbach struck the boys without  
provocation Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dontrell Langston was listed in fair condition, and his cousin  
Austin Hansen-Tyler was in critical condition. Both are 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach, 27, was charged Monday with two counts of  
intentionally causing great bodily harm to a child while armed with 
a dangerous weapon, and two counts of leaving the scene of an 
injury accident. The charges carry up to 66 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Langenbach hit the boys because they were black,  
Detective Cindy Fredericksen said, ``There is no other obvious 
reason at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be tried for a hate crime and attempted murder,''  
said Tina Tyler, the boys' aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Disstrict Attorney Robert Jambois wouldn't say whether he would  
charge Langenbach with a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Jambois noted that Langenbach committed a similar crime eight  
years ago. In 1991, he rammed his car twice into a stopped van 
carrying five black men and drove away, Jambois said. He was placed 
on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, as a prosecutor, don't believe in coincidences,'' the  
prosecutor said in asking for high bail. Bail was set at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach remained in jail Tuesday. His lawyer, Dennis Egre,  
had no comment.

<HEADLINE>  Golfing Great Sarazen Remembered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARCO ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Gene Sarazen, known among golf fans  
for his ``shot 'heard round the world'' in 1935, was remembered by 
friends for his smile, his generosity and his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave strength in times of weakness, he gave courage in  
times of fear, and above all, he gave love in times of doubt,'' 
1964 U.S. Open champion Ken Venturi told mourners at Sarazen's 
funeral Monday. ``Each day I think of Gene, I will always smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi, who now works as a television analyst, said those who  
saw Sarazen hit the Masters tournament's ceremonial first drive at 
Augusta National last month were lucky enough to see his last shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little man with a big smile,'' Venturi said, ``a boy  
wonder who emerged from the hickory-stick era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at San Marco Cemetery, Venturi laughed with friends,  
remembering Sarazen fondly through golf stories. In a more solemn 
moment, he leaned over and kissed the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and LPGA founding member Patty  
Berg were among some 800 friends and family who gathered at San 
Marco Church to remember ``The Squire'' -- a nickname Sarazen earned 
for his elegant style and fashionable knickers. He died Thursday at 
97 from complications of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the church altar contained an arrangement of at  
least five dozen red roses standing about three feet high. On a 
pedestal behind it was a white golf hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen is best known for his double-eagle in 1935 that helped  
make the Masters a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Then called the Augusta National Invitation Tournament, Sarazen  
trailed Craig Wood by three shots when his drive at the par-5 15th 
hole left him 235 yards from the pin. His caddie wanted him to hit 
a 3-wood over the pond, but Sarazen insisted on a 4-wood. 
</P>
<P>
	He swung and the ball hit the pin and dropped for a double-eagle  
2, the rarest shot in golf. Sarazen tied Wood in regulation and 
beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The golf ball and the 4-wood Sarazen used are in a trophy case  
at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as golf fans will remember Sarazen for his  
accomplishments on the golf course, Father William McConville said 
Sarazen will be remembered for his generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is a legend and we gather and celebrate him as a  
legend,'' said McConville, former president of Siena College in 
Albany, N.Y. ``But let's be honest: As important as golf is, it is 
only a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen received an honorary doctorate from Siena in 1978. Three  
years later, he started an annual tournament that has provided 68 
scholarships through The Gene &AMP; Mary Sarazen Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the quality of our heart that will be judged and not the  
quality of our short game,'' McConville said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a lighter moment, McConville said he was playing golf  
Saturday when he hit a ball into a ravine. Trying to get back on 
the fairway, he hit a concrete step and the ball ended up behind 
him, causing his caddie to drop to his knees at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you're praying,'' McConville said he told the caddie.  
``And if you're praying, I hope you're praying to Gene Sarazen 
because only he can save me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, who began caddying when he was 8, burst onto the scene  
in 1922 to win the U.S. Open. He won his second major later that 
year in the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked two years ago what he thought about Tiger Woods winning  
the Masters at age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I 
was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won seven major championships in all -- the PGA three times,  
the U.S. Open twice and the Masters and British Open once. Only Ben 
Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus have managed to win the career 
Grand Slam -- the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen also invented the sand wedge, which can be found in  
almost every golf bag.

<HEADLINE> Phone Cos. To Aid Battered Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mobile telephone companies from around New  
York signed onto a program Tuesday to make old or unused cellular 
telephones available to abused women when they venture away from 
home or work. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is an expansion of a four-month ``Wireless at Work''  
effort by Bell Atlantic Mobile in New York City and Long Island to 
recycle phones. So far, that has resulted in some 2,000 cell phones 
being collected for distribution to domestic violence victims, 
community watch groups and others. 
</P>
<P>
	State Senate officials said Tuesday that other leading cellular  
phone providers have agreed to participate, including Frontier 
Cellular, Sprint PCS and AT&AMP;T. Between them, the companies operate 
in areas containing 95 percent of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Stott, Northeast region president of Bell Atlantic Mobile,  
said the introduction of a new generation of newer, smaller phones, 
plus the evolution of wireless phones from analog to digital, has 
created a supply of older used and sometimes never-used models. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they would collect donated telephones and  
refurbish them or donate new ones. The phones would be programmed 
to dial 911 emergency numbers at the touch of a button so women and 
other domestic violence victims can talk to police immediately if 
they sense they are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This little device here is a little device that's going to  
save lives,'' said state Sen. Charles Fuschillo, R-Nassau, at a 
state Capitol news conference while holding up a cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounted the case of an abused Long Island woman who felt  
that she got her life back when given one of the Bell Atlantic 
Mobile phones because it allowed her to feel safer when she goes 
out shopping or otherwise leaves home. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times a phone call can mean the difference between  
safety and injury or death,'' said Sherry Frohman, executive 
director of the state Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, cell phone carriers are obligated to carry  
911 transmissions to local emergency officials at no charge to the 
caller. The phones provided under the program are programmed to 
call 911 lines only and cannot access any other numbers, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic violence victims seeking phones were urged to call  
local cellular telephone providers, their state senator's office or 
domestic violence advocacy groups to find out more about the 
program. The state's domestic violence hotline at 1-800-942-6906, 
or for Spanish speakers at 1-800-942-6908, can also provide 
information about the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier Cellular and Motorola also announced Tuesday the  
distribution of 1,000 cell phones to domestic violence programs in 
the Albany area.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Court Rule on Diffie Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's official: Joe Diffie's hit country  
tune ``Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox If I Die'' is original. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati decided  
Monday that Diffie's tune was written independently of Everett A. 
Ellis' ballad ``Lay Me Out by the Jukebox When I Die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis brought the lawsuit against Diffie, his publisher, record  
company, three songwriters and several others, claiming his chorus 
was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The song reached No. 3 on the Billboard country chart in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, the Ellis song was a revised version  
of ``Aunt Belle,'' about an aunt who wanted to be laid out when she 
died by the jukebox in her tavern. Diffie's song was a revised 
version of ``Double Two-Steppin' Honkeytonk,'' which included a 
line about being propped up against a jukebox after death. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower court had found that Ellis couldn't provide adequate  
proof that the writers of the Diffie song were plagiarists.

<HEADLINE> Researcher: Depression Is Treatable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once depression has settled in for a couple  
years it's considered difficult to treat. But a study reported 
today provides new hope for people with long-standing cases of the 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	By combining a special psychotherapy with an antidepressant,  
researchers achieved a ``mind-boggling'' level of success against 
chronic depression, said Dr. Martin B. Keller of the Brown 
University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was paid for by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The company  
makes Serzone, the antidepressant used in the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 85 percent of patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy  
showed a good response or even remission, said Keller, an author of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	He reported initial results of the study, which is continuing,  
at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. He 
also spoke Tuesday at a news conference and in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert C. Schulberg, a psychologist at the University of  
Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was familiar with the results, 
called them impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does point to a direction to be pursued,'' he said in a  
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The study began with 681 people who had depression for at least  
two years. Half the participants had been ill for more than 20 
years, and most had never had an adequate attempt at treatment, 
Keller said. Their average age was the early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:  
Serzone only, psychotherapy only, or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychotherapy, called the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis  
System of Psychotherapy, was developed especially for chronic 
depression but is not widely used. Patients focus on specific 
troublesome situations, learn how to solve their problems in 
relating to other people and take responsibility for the 
consequences of their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants assigned to the psychotherapy got 16 to 20 sessions  
over the 12-week treatment period. Those assigned to Serzone, also 
called nefazodone, took it twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 12 weeks, about 25 percent of patients dropped out of  
each of the three treatment groups, which is a low loss for such 
studies. Of those who remained in the study 12 weeks, 55 percent 
who'd taken Serzone alone and 52 percent of those who'd gotten 
psychotherapy alone showed a response on a standard scale measuring 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who received the combined treatment showed an 85 percent  
response rate. 
</P>
<P>
	A response meant a remission or a big enough improvement on the  
scale to be considered satisfactory. In this latter group, ``by no 
means are they all better,'' Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three treatment groups, about half the responders showed  
a remission. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said it would be reasonable to study whether a drug other  
than Serzone would work as well in combination with the 
psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulberg, the psychologist, said that to get results like those  
in the study, mental health providers would have to learn to do the 
special psychotherapy or otherwise make it available, monitor 
patient progress closely and alter the medication dose or course of 
psychotherapy accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Running Over Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- A man whose car swerved onto a sidewalk,  
injuring two teen-age bicyclists, acted intentionally and had 
committed a similar crime eight years ago, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Langenbach, 27, was charged Monday with two counts of  
intentionally causing great bodily harm to a child while armed with 
a dangerous weapon, and two counts of leaving the scene of an 
injury accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Tyler, 14, was in critical condition at a suburban  
Milwaukee hospital following Sunday's incident. His cousin Dontrell 
Langston, 14, was in fair condition at a Kenosha hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the boys, both of whom are black, said Langenbach,  
who is white, should be charged with a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what it boils down to, a hate crime,'' said Roecitha  
Tyler, Dontrell's mother. ``This is one of the worst hate crimes 
I've seen, and I don't want to see it happen again. It has to be 
stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Robert Jambois said charges against Langenbach could  
be amended to include allegations of a hate crime, though he would 
not say whether he intended to pursue such a charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Langenbach swerved his car toward the  
teen-agers, drove over the curb and struck them from behind. Both 
boys were thrown onto the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach then stopped to dislodge a bicycle from beneath his  
car and drove until stopped by police, the criminal complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be entirely unprovoked,'' Jambois said.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Langenbach rammed his car twice into a stopped van  
carrying five black men and drove away, Jambois said. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach was sentenced to probation for the incident. He told  
police the crash was a result of an earlier argument in which eight 
to 12 men chased him and his stepbrother, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Send Kamieniecki to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Convinced that the Baltimore Orioles' poor  
start can be attributed almost entirely to pitching, manager Ray 
Miller shuffled his starting rotation Tuesday by sending Scott 
Kamieniecki to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki, who started the season on the disabled list with a  
strained hamstring, has been horrid in his two starts since 
returning May 8. The right-hander is 0-2 with a 23.40 ERA and has 
seven walks in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Kamieniecki is vested, he could not be sent to the  
minors without giving his consent. He complied with Miller's 
request and will spend the next 20 days with Rochester of the 
Triple-A International League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scott's taking advantage of the three starts down there to see  
if he can get himself going,'' Miller said. ``He feels he's just 
not at the caliber he wants to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles planned to announce Kamieniecki's replacement as the  
No. 5 man in the rotation after Tuesday night's game against 
Anaheim. Jason Johnson, obtained in March in a trade with Tampa 
Bay, is a likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that Miller would be the one sent packing  
from Camden Yards on Tuesday, given the Orioles' 13-24 start and 
their position in last place in the AL East. Although Baltimore had 
lost six of seven before facing the Angels, Miller has managed to 
retain a tenuous hold on his job. 
</P>
<P>
	During frequent conversations with owner Peter Angelos, Miller  
has repeatedly stressed that the team's woes can be traced to 
ineffective pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a 6.04 ERA and we're scoring 5 1/4 runs per game. We've  
played 37 games and the starters have not gotten beyond the fifth 
inning 12 times,'' Miller said. ``So we're doing the best we can to 
upgrade our pitching and get Scott Kamieniecki turned around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Orioles have not lived up to their $78.5 million  
payroll, Miller said Angelos has not put any heat on him to right 
things in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about the health of the club, what areas need to be  
shored up and what we're trying to do. He likes to know what's 
going on,'' Miller said. ``He's never put any pressure on me to 
play this guy or get rid of this guy. He leaves that to his 
baseball people, and I respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Joan of Arc Helps CBS Top Nielsens / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joan of Arc proved a better ratings-grabber than  
a train careening out of control or Diana Ross and Brandy, enabling 
CBS to earn an important Nielsen victory. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS narrowly topped NBC in the prime-time ratings for the week,  
part of the May ``sweeps'' period during which viewership is 
closely watched to set local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three networks each scheduled ``big event'' movies on  
Sunday to lure viewers. CBS was most successful with its movie 
about the 19-year-old French heroine burned at the stake for heresy 
in 1431. It drew an average audience of 23.3 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first part of NBC's ``Atomic Train'' miniseries had 16.6  
million viewers. The story about the train hurtling toward Denver 
drew poor reviews and had to be edited hastily because of concerns 
over its depiction of science and sensitivies about the Littleton 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's movie, ``Double Platinum,'' featuring Ross and Brandy in a  
drama about a singer reuniting with her long-ago abandoned child, 
had 14.2 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	All ranked among the week's 17 most-watched shows. ``ER'' was in  
its customary spot at the top of the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.5 rating and 16 share. NBC had a 9.3  
rating and 16 share, ABC a 7.2 rating and 12 share and Fox a 6.1 
and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB, the only network to show year-to-year ratings growth,  
had a 3.3 rating and 6 share. UPN was at 1.8 and 3 and Pax TV had a 
0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.2 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.0 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 10-16, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 18.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.6; ``CBS 
Sunday Movie: Joan of Arc, Part One,'' CBS, 15.2; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
14.8; ``Mad About You'' special, NBC, 13.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 13.4; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Ally McBeal,'' 
Fox, 11.4; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: Atomic Train, Part One,'' NBC, 
11.3; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.1.

<HEADLINE>  Golfing Great Sarazen Remembered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARCO ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Gene Sarazen, known among golf fans  
for his ``shot 'heard round the world'' in 1935, was remembered by 
friends for his smile, his generosity and his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave strength in times of weakness, he gave courage in  
times of fear, and above all, he gave love in times of doubt,'' 
1964 U.S. Open champion Ken Venturi told mourners at Sarazen's 
funeral Monday. ``Each day I think of Gene, I will always smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi, who now works as a television analyst, said those who  
saw Sarazen hit the Masters tournament's ceremonial first drive at 
Augusta National last month were lucky enough to see his last shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little man with a big smile,'' Venturi said, ``a boy  
wonder who emerged from the hickory-stick era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at San Marco Cemetery, Venturi laughed with friends,  
remembering Sarazen fondly through golf stories. In a more solemn 
moment, he leaned over and kissed the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and LPGA founding member Patty  
Berg were among some 800 friends and family who gathered at San 
Marco Church to remember ``The Squire'' -- a nickname Sarazen earned 
for his elegant style and fashionable knickers. He died Thursday at 
97 from complications of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the church altar contained an arrangement of at  
least five dozen red roses standing about three feet high. On a 
pedestal behind it was a white golf hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen is best known for his double-eagle in 1935 that helped  
make the Masters a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Then called the Augusta National Invitation Tournament, Sarazen  
trailed Craig Wood by three shots when his drive at the par-5 15th 
hole left him 235 yards from the pin. His caddie wanted him to hit 
a 3-wood over the pond, but Sarazen insisted on a 4-wood. 
</P>
<P>
	He swung and the ball hit the pin and dropped for a double-eagle  
2, the rarest shot in golf. Sarazen tied Wood in regulation and 
beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The golf ball and the 4-wood Sarazen used are in a trophy case  
at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as golf fans will remember Sarazen for his  
accomplishments on the golf course, Father William McConville said 
Sarazen will be remembered for his generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is a legend and we gather and celebrate him as a  
legend,'' said McConville, former president of Siena College in 
Albany, N.Y. ``But let's be honest: As important as golf is, it is 
only a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen received an honorary doctorate from Siena in 1978. Three  
years later, he started an annual tournament that has provided 68 
scholarships through The Gene &AMP; Mary Sarazen Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the quality of our heart that will be judged and not the  
quality of our short game,'' McConville said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a lighter moment, McConville said he was playing golf  
Saturday when he hit a ball into a ravine. Trying to get back on 
the fairway, he hit a concrete step and the ball ended up behind 
him, causing his caddie to drop to his knees at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you're praying,'' McConville said he told the caddie.  
``And if you're praying, I hope you're praying to Gene Sarazen 
because only he can save me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, who began caddying when he was 8, burst onto the scene  
in 1922 to win the U.S. Open. He won his second major later that 
year in the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked two years ago what he thought about Tiger Woods winning  
the Masters at age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I 
was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won seven major championships in all -- the PGA three times,  
the U.S. Open twice and the Masters and British Open once. Only Ben 
Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus have managed to win the career 
Grand Slam -- the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen also invented the sand wedge, which can be found in  
almost every golf bag.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Caribbean Trade Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House trade panel voted Tuesday to extend to  
Caribbean and Central American nations the same low tariffs enjoyed 
by Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, approved by the Ways and Means trade  
subcommittee on a voice vote, is aimed at giving an economic boost 
to nations in the area hit hard by hurricanes Georges and Mitch 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would extend the Caribbean Basin Initiative of 1983,  
under which some 70 percent of imports from the area enter the 
United States duty-free. As a result of that act, U.S. exports to 
the area have also soared, growing to $18.5 billion annually, or 
more than exports to China, said subcommittee Chairman Philip 
Crane, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would give duty-free status to those items not included  
in the 1983 act, including canned tuna, petroleum products, 
handbags and, most importantly, textiles and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	It states that textile products from the Caribbean will be  
duty-free only if they are made from fabric formed and cut in the 
United States, but the textile industry has argued that the bill 
still doesn't adequately protect them from outside imports moving 
through the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allowing Caribbean nations to ship back products duty free,  
regardless of the source of the materials, might arguably be the 
optimal position for some Caribbean nations, but it isn't for our 
nation,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., ranking Democrat on the 
panel. ``And it simply won't sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levin said the final bill must also ensure that Caribbean  
exporters meet core labor standards that are meaningful and 
enforceable.

<HEADLINE> Trie's Obstruction Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A Senate Governmental Affairs Committee  
staff member said today that media accounts led the committee to 
want information from Democratic fund-raiser Yah Lin ``Charlie'' 
Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee staffer Michael Bopp was the first witness in Trie's  
trial on a charge of obstructing a Senate investigation. Bopp said 
newspaper and television stories drew attention to Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided he was someone we should try to gather documents  
from, and get him in to talk to us'' as part of the committee's 
investigation of campaign finance in the 1996 elections, Bopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Bopp testified that the committee's  
goal was not only to uncover illegal activities, but also to look 
into transactions that were legal but questionable, to give insight 
into changes needed in the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side outlined its case during opening arguments Monday  
after 12 jurors and four alternates were seated. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's star witness was expected to take the stand later  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dia Mapili, who was Trie's bookkeeper, was expected to testify  
under an immunity deal that her longtime boss ordered her to 
destroy documents subpoenaed by a Senate committee investigating 
political fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Monday, defense attorneys said Mrs. Mapili  
lied about Trie before a grand jury after becoming ``utterly 
confused'' under Justice Department pressure.	   A naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, Trie used to operate 
a Chinese restaurant in Little Rock, becoming a friend of then-Gov. 
Clinton. In 1991, he began an international trading business. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to Washington and began raising money for Democrats,  
becoming known for entertaining visiting Asian business people at 
his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Reid Weingarten said Trie was guilty only of  
ambition for taking advantage of his friendship with Clinton to 
transform himself into a successful international businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no credible evidence that Charlie Trie ever  
corruptly obstructed or ever corruptly tried to corrupt any 
investigation, much less the United States Senate's 
investigation,'' Weingarten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, 49, could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000  
fine if convicted here. He faces stiffer penalties if convicted of 
charges in Washington that he made and arranged illegal 
contributions from foreigners to the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has returned $640,000 that Trie raised, and  
Clinton's legal defense fund has returned an additional $460,000.

<P>
	HAVERHILL, Mass. (AP) -- Wendell H. Coltin, a longtime newspaper  
columnist who specialized in elder affairs, died Sunday of heart 
failure. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in public relations as a staff sergeant in the Army  
Air Corps during World War II and began his more than half a 
century in journalism as a reporter in Wilmington, Del., before 
joining the Haverhill Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, Coltin joined the Boston Herald, where he would  
specialize in Medicare and Social Security issues for 35 years. His 
column ``Medicare Mailbox'' began running in 1965, prior to the 
inception of the federal Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	Coltin later wrote ``Ask Wendell,'' an advice column for the  
elderly, which appeared in The Haverhill Gazette and The 
Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kyriacos Demetriou, a haircutter whose  
old-fashioned barbershop was recreated in the Museum of the City of 
New York when he retired three years ago, died Friday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Demetriou, known by customers as Mr. Kay, took over the Broadway  
Barbershop in the 1950s. The shop, founded in 1904, was the oldest 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers and magazines described Mr. Kay, who gave lollipops  
to his younger customers and straight-razor shaves to his older 
ones, as a throwback to the days before unisex salons, stylists and 
blow-driers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Kay's barbershop, with its old, shiny appliances and a radio  
tuned to a classical music station, was visited by numerous 
celebrities. He told of cutting Yul Brynner's hair -- when the actor 
had hair. He also trimmed and shaved Humphrey Bogart and George 
Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Kay, who was born in Cyprus but grew up in England, began  
working as a shoeshine boy outside a barbershop in London's West 
End before learning to cut hair. In his 20s, he won a contest 
selecting England's best barber. He moved to New York shortly 
before World War II.

of the Richmond County Daily Journal, died Sunday at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Easterling's newspaper career began in 1937 when she and  
her husband, J. Neal Cadieu, bought the Richmond County Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal grew from a weekly to a tri-weekly. After her  
husband's death, she became publisher and owner and began daily 
publication in 1963. The newspaper was sold to her son in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	She retired from newspaper work in 1972.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
	The LPGA said Owens was stricken while giving a lesson at Cog  
Hill Golf and Country Club in Lemont on May 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, an LPGA member for 29 years, was honored as LPGA Teacher

<P>
	CHILMARK, Mass. (AP) -- John W.M. Whiting, a former Harvard  
University anthropologist and a leader of comparative studies in 
child development, died Thursday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiting was known best for his work comparing child behavior and  
parental practices in diverse societies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his major research projects was the ``Six Cultures Study  
of Socialization,'' a comparative field study launched in 1964 in 
Mexico, India, Kenya, Japan, the Philippines and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1950 to 1980, Whiting conducted a seminar at Harvard  
focused on comparative childhood development with his wife, 
Beatrice Whiting, an emeritus professor of education and 
anthropology. Together they founded and directed the Child 
Development Research Unit at the University of Nairobi in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his other works are ``Becoming a Kwoma,'' based on his  
studies in the 1930s of childhood learning in New Guinea, and 
``Child Training and Personality.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Maps Cuts in Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are planning bills that would cut  
spending for the environment, education and other traditional 
Democratic priorities by billions of dollars next year, setting up 
months of conflict with President Clinton and among lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee, living within spending  
limits imposed by the 1997 balanced-budget pact, meets Wednesday to 
divide $538 billion among 13 bills covering all government 
agencies. That figure is nearly a third of the entire federal 
budget, including everything but automatic payments like Medicare 
benefits and interest to bond holders. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's plans, obtained by The Associated Press, map  
bills with domestic cuts so deep that even many Republicans wonder 
how they will ever be approved by the GOP-controlled Congress, let 
alone get signed by Clinton without a headline-grabbing veto fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The early reports about the Republican plan suggest their 2000  
budget is simply not tenable,'' said Sylvia Mathews, the White 
House deputy budget director. ``The level of cuts it would require 
would do enormous harm to critical areas that Americans care deeply 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy,'' said House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think of this as a placeholder, and hopefully we'll get''  
more money later, said Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., whose 
Appropriations subcommittee oversees labor, education and health 
programs that would be among those getting the deepest cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under GOP plans, Porter's bill would get $78.1 billion, $10.7  
billion less than this year. That measure is home to schools, job 
training and other programs that produce annual battles between 
Democrats and Republicans, and the proposed cut assures a nasty 
partisan fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other three, always controversial domestic spending  
bills, the committee would spend $30.5 billion for the Commerce, 
Justice and State departments, $2.8 billion less than this year; 
$11.3 billion for the Interior Department, or $2.7 billion less; 
and $66.2 billion for the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban 
Development departments, the Environmental Protection Agency and 
other agencies, $5.8 billion below this year's level. 
</P>
<P>
	These committee figures do not include additional billions in  
so-called emergency spending enacted this year -- money that does 
not count against spending limits. Even with that extra money, 
however, the fiscal 2000 bills come up short compared with this 
year, and even shorter compared with the amounts Clinton would like 
to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other, smaller domestic spending bills have just  
minor differences between GOP plans for 2000 and actual totals from 
the current year. Several of them could become law with relatively 
little controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one indicator of the pressure on Republicans to exceed  
spending limits, a bill approved Friday by the Appropriations 
panel's Treasury-Postal Service subcommittee totaled $13.7 billion 
-- more than $140 million above the amount leaders plan for that 
subcommittee to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the budget-balancing deal, an escalating, annual series of  
savings was planned in an effort to eliminate what looked like a 
parade of unending federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beginning of this year, many Democrats and some  
Republicans have said this year's spending limit would have to be 
breached because the required savings are too tough. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders have continued to insist publicly that  
the so-called spending caps must be obeyed. The Senate's spending 
plans are similar to the House's, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should stay within the caps,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a brief interview. ``We knew the 
caps would pinch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To spend beyond those limits means using the federal surplus,  
and that would mean spending Social Security surpluses Republicans 
have promised not to spend or leaving less money available to pay 
for the tax cut. Cutting taxes and protecting Social Security are 
both major GOP priorities, and jeopardizing either would outrage 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how Republicans plan to move all 13 annual  
spending bills through Congress without prompting a veto fight with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP aides said their strategy calls for spending weeks this  
summer focusing on the message that Republicans are honoring 
spending limits to protect Social Security and tax cuts. The goal 
is to identify the GOP with those goals, and to ensure that in the 
likelihood that the spending caps are broken, Clinton and 
congressional Democrats are to blame.

<HEADLINE> Suit Seeks $3B Against Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- In the opening round of a major  
class-action suit, a lawyer for 3 million California vehicle owners 
has told jurors Ford Motor Co. knew an ignition device was prone to 
overhearing and stalling but hid the problem for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, called the thick film ignition module or TFI, is  
essential to safe operation of the car, attorney Paul D. Nelson 
said Tuesday. ``Ford knew early on that it would fail at extremely 
high rates, and knew how to fix it ... but had to keep it secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford lawyer Warren Platt denied any safety problem, product  
defect or deception of either the government or the public. He 
noted that none of the five named plaintiffs, or the millions of 
customers they claim to represent, allege any physical injury or 
property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	If millions of vehicles sold for 15 years were at risk of  
stalling as the plaintiffs claim, Platt said, ``Ford's sales and 
market share would have gone in the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, the largest class action to go to trial against a U.S.  
automaker, seeks $3 billion in damages under a California law 
requiring businesses to pay $1,000 for each deceptive sale or 
illegal practice. Plaintiffs' lawyers say they also will ask for 
replacement costs and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers estimate the trial will last two months.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford first installed an electronic ignition system in its 1972  
vehicles, to meet federal clean-air requirements, and later 
replaced it with the lighter, more efficient TFI, starting with 
some 1983 models. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, Nelson said, arose when Ford ``chose to mount the  
device on the hottest part of the engine, on the distributor, 
directly above the engine block.'' That saved $4 per vehicle but 
exposed the TFI to temperatures ``on the ragged edge of 
reliability,'' the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a Ford engineer warned in a May 1982 memo that the  
device was likely to overheat at high temperatures, causing engine 
stalls. Ford soon received a flood of complaints from customers and 
dealers, and has had to replace TFI modules in 15 million vehicles, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Platt, Ford's lawyer, said company and government studies  
have found that mounting the TFI on the distributor above the 
engine does not increase the risk of stalling or accidents. Five 
successive investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration concluded the device was not a safety hazard, Platt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the very best location for the TFI from the standpoint  
of reliability and performance,'' a mounting chosen by 70 percent 
of manufacturers that use the TFI, Platt told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nelson contended that Ford had withheld crucial documents  
from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit covers 1.8 million owners and 1.2 million former owners  
in California of Ford vehicles from model years 1983-95, when the 
TFI mounting was used.

<HEADLINE>  The Familiar, Fresh Shine at Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- It happens every year: about halfway  
through the Cannes Film Festival, the amorphous buzz along the 
Croisette starts to take a discernible shape. Here's what it's 
saying about who's shining in the Riviera sun: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PEDRO IS THE NEW ROBERTO:   	
</P>
<P>
	Last year it was Roberto Benigni, the Italian director-actor,  
who had the buzz. This year, it's the almost-as-colorful Spanish 
director, Pedro Almodovar. 
</P>
<P>
	Almodovar's ``All About My Mother'' seems to be the unanimous  
choice among Cannes-watchers for the Golden Palm, the festival's 
top award. It is the 13th film by the man best known for ``Women on 
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and many say it's his best. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of an appealing youth in the beginning of a film could  
easily sink any attempt at lightness. Somehow Almodovar manages to 
achieve the perfect balance between tragedy and humor with a 
quartet of absorbing women who form an offbeat family: a grieving 
single mother, a transvestite, an impressionable young nun and a 
lesbian actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked his secret, the engaging Spaniard is about as modest as  
Benigni. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just talent,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Fans of old Hollywood will appreciate the film's clever tributes  
to ``All About Eve'' and ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' 
Unfortunately, those using the simultaneous English translation at 
the premiere may have missed these references: the title of 
``Streetcar'' became something like ``A Tramway About Feelings,'' 
and Blanche's famous line, ``I have always depended on the kindness 
of strangers,'' sounded like ``I've always counted on people being 
nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WELCOME, TIM AND SUSAN:   	
</P>
<P>
	Some grumbled that the Hollywood star quotient of this festival  
was low. So everyone was glad on Tuesday to see the arrival of Tim 
Robbins and the star-studded cast of ``Cradle Will Rock'': Susan 
Sarandon, Hank Azaria, Vanessa Redgrave, Joan Cusack, Emily Watson 
and Ruben Blades. 
</P>
<P>
	The period film, which also stars Bill Murray and Joan's brother  
John, recounts the true story of a 1930s theater troupe in New York 
risking their careers to perform a play about labor unrest, against 
a background of anti-communist censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	First-time Cannes visitor Azaria, best-known for TV work in  
``Mad About You'' and ``The Simpsons,'' says he was excited by the 
principle the film is based on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not often that actors get to put their beliefs on the  
line,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BEST ACTOR AND ACTRESS:   	
</P>
<P>
	British actor Bob Hoskins gives an enthralling performance as a  
sinister bachelor -- that's putting it mildly -- in Atom Egoyan's 
engrossing ``Felicia's Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hilditch, ostensibly a cheerful catering manager, Hoskins  
spends evenings cooking elaborate meals with the help of old videos 
of his mother's cooking show. Only slowly does the film reveal the 
true horror lurking behind his amiable facade. Both Egoyan and 
Hoskins do a memorable job of pacing the performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecilia Roth has made a deep impression as Manuela, the single  
mother in Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' portraying strength 
and weakness and despair and optimism all at once. A regular in the 
Spaniard's films, this appears to be her big break. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NEW FACES:   	
</P>
<P>
	Two fresh and interesting faces are those of Penelope Cruz, the  
beautiful young nun in Almodovar's film, and Elaine Cassidy, the 
Irish girl who makes extreme naivete plausible in ``Felicia's 
Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least Cruz won't be unknown for long: she plays Matt Damon's  
love interest in an upcoming Billy Bob Thornton film.

<HEADLINE> CFO for Salt Lake Games Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The chief financial officer of the Salt  
Lake Olympics resigned Tuesday, a move that comes about two months 
after his budget was criticized by the head organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Tanner is quitting to become chief financial officer at  
Mrs. Field's Cookies, which is based in Salt Lake, and begins work 
there June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, president of the organizing committee, said  
Tanner's departure should not worry sponsors because they had no 
dealings with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a month of becoming chief executive in February, Romney  
described mistakes in the $1.45 billion budget that Tanner helped 
put together last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The games will cost about $40 million more because of wrong  
assumptions concerning federal funding and the cost of supplies. 
Information technology also will cost $25 million more than 
budgeted, Romney said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Tanner said Romney's criticism of the budget had  
nothing to do with his resignation. Indeed, he was the one who 
pointed out the mistakes to Romney, Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistakes in part were due to the fact that 30 percent is  
donated goods and services. Putting dollar values on such donations 
is tough, and after the budget was approved, the mistakes began 
cropping up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner said he was recruited by Mrs. Field's Cookies and decided  
it was a better fit financially than SLOC, since he has two 
children entering college this fall and another in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an organization that will exist in 2003, 2004, 2004 and  
onward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the committee has a good financial staff. He  
describes himself as chief financial operator for the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee and he hired another financial expert, Fraser 
Bullock, as chief operating officer last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, in the financial area we are very deep,'' Romney  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner was chief financial officer at Pepsi-Cola International  
when he was hired to run finances at the SLOC in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Just months after joining the SLOC, Tanner reportedly alerted  
former chief executive Frank Joklik that the committee was paying 
college tuition for the son of IOC member Bashir Mohamed 
Attarabulsi of Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	That conversation was reported by the SLOC ethics panel, which  
this winter interviewed Tanner as part of its investigation into 
lavish treatment of IOC members by Salt Lake's bid committee. Some 
payments continued after the SLOC took over from the bid committee, 
but those ended last year.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch: Crackdown Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch warned Tuesday his organization will continue its 
crackdown on members accepting bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very tough with members who were guilty regarding Salt  
Lake City,'' Samaranch said at a news conference. ``If a new case 
appears, we will act in the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's successful  
bid for the 2002 Winter Games resulted in 10 IOC members resigning 
or being expelled in the biggest purge in the committee's 105-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who is visiting Prague to celebrate the 100th  
anniversary of the Czech Olympic Committee, insisted that the IOC 
could not have acted sooner to head off the vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had many rumors that the behavior of some members of the  
committee was not right,'' Samaranch said. ``But we cannot act on 
rumors. We need facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however, that it takes two to bribe: ``one party who  
is offering, and the other one who is taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also dismissed concerns that sponsors might pull out  
of the games because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next year we will have the Olympic Games in Sydney, and not a  
single sponsor withdrew,'' Samaranch said. ``And yesterday, we had 
a very good news coming from Salt Lake City: new sponsors are 
coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not provide details, but on Friday the Salt Lake Olympic  
Committee announced the first new national sponsor in nearly a 
year. Marker Ltd. of Salt Lake will supply all the uniforms for 
staff at the games, a sponsorship worth at least $20 million.

<HEADLINE> Viroids Stunt Trees Growth / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINDCOVE, Calif. (AP) -- Under the shadow of the Sierra  
foothills, three rows of pint-sized Valencia orange trees stand in 
sharp contrast to the taller, bushier trees in the rest of a 
quarter-acre field. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Semancik, a University of California, Riverside researcher,  
created the dwarf trees using tiny nucleic acids called viroids, 
which have the seemingly paradoxical effect of stunting the trees' 
growth but making them produce more and bigger oranges. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you stress the trees, they tend to fruit,'' says Semancik,  
a nationally renowned plant pathologist who planted these dwarfs 15 
years ago at the UC Lindcove Research &AMP; Extension Center. ``With 
the viroids, there's not enough stress to damage it, but enough to 
produce more. How all this happens? I'm not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For citrus farmers, the technique promises lower costs and  
higher yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Mulholland, a fourth-generation grower in Tulare County,  
said smaller trees mean lower costs for water, nutrients and 
pesticides. Pruning is much easier, and workers don't have to climb 
tall ladders to reach the fruit on top when harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland found out about Semancik's research in a journal  
three years ago. He called the scientist and decided to test the 
dwarf trees on his own field, devoting an acre of his 350-acre 
orchard in Orange Cove. 
</P>
<P>
	The trees are still very young, but Mulholland said he already  
is beginning to see the miniaturization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get more oranges per surface area of the tree  
canopy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A dwarf tree's canopy -- the graceful, rounded mass of leafy  
branches spreading out from the base of the tree -- is about half 
the size of a normal orange tree's. Growers are doing the math: 
with smaller, better-producing trees, they can plant and harvest 
more per acre, increasing their yield. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of controlling citrus tree size is nothing new.  
Researchers have been trying to create smaller and more productive 
trees for years through grafting and breeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Semancik has been applying the use of viroids since the  
discovery of the tiny particles in the early 1970s. His laboratory 
and a team of U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists discovered 
the existence of viroids at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	To make a dwarf, he dips a razor blade into a solution  
containing the IIa viroid, then makes small cuts into the root of a 
young tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Semancik said researchers are still trying to learn just how the  
viroid works. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't know the physiological effects,'' he said.  
``It could be hormonal, which has translated into morphological 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Batkin, manager of the Citrus Research Board, said while he  
is pleased with the initial success of Semancik's viroids, tests on 
large-scale production are needed before any conclusion is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just in the research phase,'' Batkin said. ``Once Joe's  
work is completed, then we would have to take it to a full-sized 
field for testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will take at least several more years of research before  
tests are done at the commercial production level, Batkin said.

<HEADLINE> Court Suspends Phone Slamming Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New regulations giving telephone callers  
broader remedies when their long-distance service is illegally 
switched were suspended Tuesday by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted  
MCI WorldCom's request to indefinitely halt enforcement of the 
Federal Communications Commission's rules. The one-page order did 
not address the validity of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, which went into effect Monday, aim to crack down on  
the illegal practice known as ``slamming'' -- switching people's 
long-distance service without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Under them, consumers would have had up to 30 days to avoid  
paying long-distance charges when their service is illegally 
switched, giving them time to resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC had asked the court to uphold the rules, which were  
adopted last year. But MCI wanted them suspended to give the 
commission more time to consider an industry plan to address the 
fast-growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said he was disappointed by the  
court's action. ``Consumers should not have to pay when they are 
slammed,'' he said. ``To me, this is a matter of fundamental 
fairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, MCI and other long-distance companies, which had  
complained that the FCC rules created an administrative headache, 
hailed the court's action. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-distance phone industry in March proposed creation of a  
third-party group to handle consumers' complaints when their 
long-distance service is illegally switched. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, Sprint, associations representing smaller  
long-distance companies and others back the proposal, which is 
subject to FCC approval. Under it, an industry-financed panel would 
include representatives of large and small long-distance companies 
and consumer groups to field complaints, determine liability and 
handle refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to work with the FCC in its prompt consideration of  
the industry plan,'' said Jonathan Sallet, MCI's chief policy 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the industry plan, the panel would have 30 days to  
determine whether an illegal service change occurred. If so and the 
customer paid the charges, the offending company would have to 
return the total amount of money to the customer's designated 
carrier. The designated carrier would then send half of that amount 
to the customer as a credit, avoiding rebilling. 
</P>
<P>
	If a customer was illegally switched and didn't pay anything,  
the customer would receive the first 30 days of service free.

<HEADLINE> Panel Favors Gambling Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal commission has decided to recommend  
that governments require ``gambling impact statements'' -- akin to 
the environmental impact statements required of developers -- before 
approving new or additional casinos, slot machines or lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission also may urge  
states to ban campaign contributions from gambling interests, using 
New Jersey's ban as a model. 
</P>
<P>
	Like developers' environmental statements, gambling impact  
statements would predict the economic and social effects of 
gambling not just in the city or town considering gambling 
facilities but throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Robert Loescher, an Alaska businessman, objected to  
the idea as anti-business. ``This becomes a holdup. This becomes a 
delay,'' Loescher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner John Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel  
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, agreed that the 
statements would slow the approval process. But he added: ``I don't 
think that's bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-day meeting that ended Tuesday, the nine-member  
National Gambling Impact Study Commission also adopted restrictions 
aimed at state lotteries. Among other steps, the commission's 
report will recommend that federal truth-in-advertising laws apply 
to lottery ads and that states stop offering video poker or similar 
games as part of their lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	George Andersen, president of the North American Association of  
State and Provincial Lotteries, said lotteries are well regulated 
by states and have been treated unfairly by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're astonished at this late date that they have seemingly  
read nothing that we sent and at (their) continued level of 
narrow-minded bias,'' Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also discussed, but tabled, a rebuke of American  
Indian casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Most tribes that run casinos refused to fill out a commission  
survey because they said the information requested was private. 
Members of the commission opted not to subpoena the information but 
promised to make clear their displeasure in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm one of those who believe you don't always hide behind the  
law,'' said commissioner Paul Moore, a Mississippi radiologist and 
neighbor of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission considered a recommendation calling for creation  
of a new panel, ``with full subpoena power,'' to look specifically 
at Indian gambling. The idea was discarded after Loescher, an 
Indian, objected to singling out tribal casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has one final two-day session left before  
submitting a report to Congress, the White House, state governors 
and leaders of Indian tribes on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Among commission recommendations approved for the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Automated teller machines should be banned from the area where  
betting takes place at casinos or race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	--State lotteries should not move into casino-style instant games  
such as slot machines and video poker. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should not allow casino-style gambling to be introduced  
at horse tracks or other pari-mutuel facilities for the primary 
purpose of bailing out economically strapped facilities or 
competing with other forms of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should stop the proliferation of ``convenience  
gambling'' outlets, such as video gambling machines in neighborhood 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	--So-called ``cruises to nowhere'' should be prohibited unless  
states from which the boats originate specifically allow them by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress should amend truth-in-advertising laws to cover  
American Indian gambling and state lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal adopted by the commission Monday -- to end legalized  
gambling on collegiate sports -- drew fire from Rep. Jim Gibbons, 
R-Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports gambling is legal in Nevada and Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
	``The anti-gaming forces on this commission made a ridiculous  
recommendation that will never be accepted by Congress or the 
casinos in Nevada,'' Gibbons said. He called the recommendation ``a 
clear violation of states' rights.''

<HEADLINE> Cruise, Kidman Get L.A. Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A tabloid photographer was sentenced to six  
months in a halfway house for eavesdropping on a cellular telephone 
call between Tom Cruise and his wife, Nicole Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Ford, 27, pleaded guilty in March to a federal wiretapping  
charge in a deal with prosecutors to drop two related counts. He 
could have been sentenced to a year in jail and fined $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being ordered Monday to the halfway house, U.S.  
District Judge Terry Hatter also placed Ford on three years of 
probation, fined him $3,000 and ordered him to perform 150 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was indicted in December on three federal wiretapping  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He used a modified radio scanner to listen to the call between  
Cruise and Ms. Kidman in February 1998, and then sold the tape 
which included an alleged quarrel to the Globe newspaper. The 
supermarket tabloid was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruise and Ms. Kidman had no comment Monday, publicist Pat  
Kingsley said.

<HEADLINE> Stadium Project Nixed in Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected a  
$1.8 billion convention center and sports complex that would have 
featured a new stadium for the NFL's Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters rejected the gigantic Rio Salado Crossing project, which  
would have meant a sales tax increase for residents of Mesa, where 
the complex would have been built. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, voters in suburban Scottsdale approved forming a  
stadium district, which could lead to a new 20,000-seat arena for 
the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	With a surprisingly high turnout of 30 percent, twice what had  
been expected, Mesa voters rejected the sales tax proposal 60 
percent to 40 percent. Another measure simply authorizing the 
project was rejected by Mesa voters 59 percent to 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other small suburban communities also voted for the  
proposal, with voters in Queen Creek narrowly rejecting the 
project, while Gilbert voters approved it by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters were asked to authorize a quarter-cent sales tax and  
extend an existing quarter-cent sales tax beyond its 2006 
expiration date to help pay the public's $507 million share of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I cry, I can get away without talking,'' longtime Cardinals  
owner Bill Bidwill told a cheering pro-Rio Salado crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked ``those people who went out and worked for this  
wonderful public-private partnership that could have gone forward 
but is temporarily stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona House Speaker Jeff Grosscost suggested Rio Salado isn't  
dead. He proposed a ``re-framed effort'' that would lessen the 
emphasis on sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of rolling up our sleeves and putting in a  
little more work,'' he said, not mentioning any specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have played at Sun Devil Stadium at Arizona State  
University since they moved to Arizona from St. Louis 11 years ago. 
The Cardinals are the only franchise in the four major professional 
sports that plays on a college campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bidwill, the owner's son and the team's vice president  
and general counsel, refused to suggest the Cardinals would 
consider moving to another city. Asked if the Cardinals would 
support Grosscost's idea, he said, ``The answer is probably yes but 
I didn't understand what he said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said he didn't think Bidwill would  
move the team out of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves Arizona. He loves this valley,'' Tobin said. ``Our  
job is to get our product in such a way that people embrace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rio Salado would have been built along the dry bed of the Salt  
River on Mesa's northern edge and would have included one of the 
largest convention centers in the country, far larger than the one 
in nearby Phoenix. It called for hotels, shops, restaurants, three 
golf courses, offices, homes, apartments, parks, a small lake and 
hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	At its heart was a 67,000-seat stadium that could expand to  
78,400 for big events, such as the Super Bowl or Fiesta Bowl. The 
stadium was to have a retractable roof and a natural grass field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not surprised,'' said Manny Cortez, chairman of  
Taxpayers Against Rio Salado. ``I always felt like if we'd have a 
large turnout, we would win. It's not just the Cardinals stadium, 
it's just the fact people are getting tired of taxes. I've always 
said we're being nickeled and dimed to death. It's time to say 
enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, the major contributor to a pro-Rio Salado  
campaign that outspent opponents at least 70-to-1, pledged $75 
million to the project. They also promised $75 million to the 
private development and to pay $2 million per year in rent for 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, the Cardinals were to get the right to sell the  
stadium's name, as well as parking revenue on game day, concession 
revenue, advertising signs, luxury suite revenue and up to half the 
revenue from parking for all other events. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote in Scottsdale was only on forming a district to pursue  
the proposed $624 million renovation of Los Arcos Mall, a dying 
shopping center in south Scottsdale. A yes vote would mean a second 
vote this fall on a finance plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes say they can't make money at America West Arena in  
downtown Phoenix, where they have limited revenue capability and 
more than 4,000 seats have an obstructed view of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Rio Salado and Los Arcos projects are the result of an  
Arizona law that lasted two years before it was repealed recently 
by the legislature. Under that law, if two or more cities form a 
stadium district for a project, half of the sales taxes generated 
by that project would be funneled back to it.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Tests Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflating air bags in some DaimlerChrysler  
minivans could seriously injure or kill short female passengers, 
according to tests by a federal safety agency released on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials strongly disputed that the 11 tests  
performed on dummies representing short women indicated they could 
be seriously injured by the passenger-side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Company engineers said the air bags in the tests were catching  
between the dummy's head and neck in a cavity people do not have, 
causing false high readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
said they experimented with four types of dummy necks, working to 
fill the space between the head and neck with protective wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the air bags appeared to catch in the crack between the  
head and neck of dummies in some tests, six of the 11 tests 
indicated the air bags were generally exerting strong force on a 
variety of dummy neck types, government officials said. The forces 
registered on the neck during the six tests indicated a high 
probability of serious injury or death, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocacy groups urged the safety agency to force  
DaimlerChrysler to recall the more than 2 million minivans the 
company has built since 1994 and replace the air bags with less 
forceful ones. Most of those minivans were built before Chrysler 
Corp.'s acquisition last year by Germany's Daimler-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA officials have not started the formal investigative  
process required of the minivans, or any other vehicle, before they 
would request any recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president in charge of  
safety, said company engineers believe the air bags were getting 
caught between the dummy's head and neck in all six of the tests 
where the neck injury levels were high. 
</P>
<P>
	``For anybody to make a link between these tests and what's  
happening in the real world is totally ludicrous,'' Cischke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deploying air bags in DaimlerChrysler minivans have been blamed  
for the deaths of 14 children and adults, according to government 
data. The only other minivan airbag death on record so far happened 
in 1997 in a Mitsubishi Expo. 
</P>
<P>
	Cischke said most of those air bag deaths tracked by the  
government were in older model DaimlerChrysler minivans at a time 
when the former Chrysler Corp. dominated the minivan market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 67 percent of the minivans on the road were  
DaimlerChrysler minivans and they had traveled a collective 6.5 
million vehicle years -- three times as many as the closest 
competitor, Cischke said. 
</P>
<P>
	A NHTSA report on the minivan air bag tests also said  
DaimlerChrysler was replacing used air bag inflator systems in the 
1994 through 1997 minivans with a significantly less aggressive air 
bag inflator system.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Keeps Entertainers' Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is keeping $18,575 worth of  
gifts he received during 1998, including golf clubs, paintings, a 
couple of saxophones and the 100 greatest films of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's financial disclosure report for 1998 reveals many of  
the gifts he is keeping were from celebrities. The report was 
released Monday just after Clinton returned from a West Coast trip, 
where he gently prodded a dinner audience of top Hollywood figures 
to try to clean up the gory scenes depicted in films and television 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The gifts Clinton kept included a film cel from director Steven  
Spielberg's ``Animaniacs'' and a collection of the top 100 movies 
selected by the American Film Institute -- classics ranging from 
``Citizen Kane'' and ``From Here to Eternity'' to ``Forrest Gump'' 
and ``Pulp Fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife, Hillary, also counted as a gift the  
$2.6 million in legal fees paid by The Clinton Legal Expense Trust. 
That money went toward legal debts that, at their highest point in 
1998, ranged between $2 million and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, the Clintons held assets worth between $1.2 million  
and $5.5 million, the majority of which was in a blind trust owned 
by Mrs. Clinton. A White House official familiar with the first 
family's finances said the actual amount in the trust was closer to 
the lower end of the range. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, reported 1998  
assets of between $1.4 million and $1.7 million, including 
properties the vice president owns in Arlington, Va. and Carthage, 
Tenn., his salary and various family bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Clintons reported assets of up to $5.8 million, and  
in 1996, they reported assets ranging from $760,000 to $1.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the first family reported keeping $14,988 worth of  
personal gifts received in 1997. They included a cashmere shawl 
from designer Vera Wang and a set of leather-bound books from Oprah 
Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons kept cashmere this year, too: a sweater coat from  
Mongolia valued at $395. And the president has no excuse for 
playing bad saxophone -- he received music books and two of the 
instruments (value: $3,000) from Thomas Ernst of Germany, as well 
as a collection of compact discs and a photograph ($700) from jazz 
saxophonist Kenny G. 
</P>
<P>
	Other gifts included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Three golf drivers from Rudy Durand and actor Jack Nicholson,  
$1,377. 
</P>
<P>
	--A signed bat and Chicago Cubs jersey from slugger Sammy Sosa,  
$300. 
</P>
<P>
	--A framed Doonesbury cartoon inscribed by Garry Trudeau, from  
political consultant Robert Squier, $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	--A first-edition copy of ``Welcome to the Monkey House'' from  
Harvey Weinstein, $750. 
</P>
<P>
	--A framed oil painting from singer Carly Simon, $300.  
</P>
<P>
	--A videotape collection of AFI's top 100 movies, from Sumner  
Redstone of New York, $1,750. 
</P>
<P>
	--A portable DVD player and three movie discs from Tom Campbell  
of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., $1,019. 
</P>
<P>
	--A framed photo of the president and first lady from Hollywood  
mogul Lew Wasserman, $350. 
</P>
<P>
	--An oil painting titled ``The Lawmakers,'' from Paul Montrone of  
Hampton Falls, N.H. $2,000.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Air Threatens Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines' majority  
shareholder, Lucio Tan, urged the carrier's 8,000 employees on 
Tuesday to promise not to strike for 10 years as part of a plan to 
assure the carrier's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the majority of you decide not to undertake this with me,  
then we will simply have to hold our breath and watch as we lose 
our airplanes one by one, and ultimately witness the closure of 
PAL. No hard feelings. Sayonara,'' Tan said in a letter to 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Abel Capili, a director of PAL's groundworkers' union, said a  
majority of its 21 directors are against a strike prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the union's members accepted a 10-year strike ban  
in a referendum in September but union leaders later decided not to 
sign an agreement on the ban, PAL president Avelino Zapanta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Montecillo, secretary of PAL's flight attendants' union,  
said it also opposed a strike ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its rehabilitation plan, which involves deep cuts in  
staffing and aircraft, PAL must find $200 million in fresh equity 
to recapitalize the company by a June 4 deadline. Tan himself has 
pledged $100 million and is recruiting an investor group to provide 
the other half. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan is thought to be close to a deal, but has made clear that  
prospective investors want a guarantee that workers will not strike 
for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is running out on us,'' Tan, who holds 70 percent of the  
airline's stock, told employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan said the Securities and Exchange Commission will not extend  
its deadline and noted that creditors will seize their jets if the 
carrier is not recapitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Monday it would approve the airline's  
rehabilitation plan after a majority of creditors gave the green

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts is completing its  
withdrawal from the gambling industry with the sale of the Desert 
Inn hotel and casino for $275 million to Sun International Hotels 
Limited. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, announced Tuesday, gives Sun International its first  
Las Vegas resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood, which sold its Caesars World properties last month for  
$3 billion to Park Place Entertainment Corp., had been shopping the 
Las Vegas Strip property for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-cash transaction is subject to the satisfaction of  
various conditions contained in the purchase agreement, including 
regulatory approval. The transaction is expected to close by June 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Desert Inn is a 715-room hotel, casino, spa and country club  
situated on 25-acres on the Las Vegas Strip. The property includes 
a 140-acre championship golf course and a further 32 acres of 
undeveloped land on the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood acquired the property in 1998 as part of its  
acquisition of ITT. Since then, the company has said it wanted to 
dispose of its gambling properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun International operates casinos in Atlantic City, the Bahamas  
and Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall, but Trim Most Losses / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell after the Fed's announcement  
Tuesday that higher interest rates might be on the way, but an 
afternoon round of buying trimmed much of the losses. The long bond 
closed slightly higher, pushing its yield down. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/16  
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, edged lower to 5.88 percent from 5.89 
percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off between 1/8 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down 1/8 point to 7/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders sold off bonds immediately after the Fed said it would  
adopt a bias toward raising rates in the future, which would hurt 
the value of fixed-income investments like bonds. But bonds gained 
back some ground as traders concluded that a rate increase might 
not come until late this year or even next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's statement, which came after the regular meeting of its  
policy-setting committee, was mainly in line with the market's 
expectations, bond traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.64 percent as the  
discount fell 0.05 percentage point from the auction Monday to 4.52 
percent. Six-month yields were 4.82 percent, as the discount rose 
0.01 percentage point to 4.64 percent. One-year yields were 4.89 
percent as the discount rose by 0.04 percentage point from late 
Monday to 4.66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 from 4.80 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 point to 121 3/4. The average yield 
to maturity was unchanged from Monday's close at 5.38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Daimler Shareholders Get Good News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- While shareholder activists grilled  
the boards of DaimlerChrysler on corporate strategy and executive 
pay Tuesday, Karl Bauer sipped his free beer from a plastic cup and 
shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock price is the most important thing to me,'' said the  
civil servant from near Lake Constance, in southern Germany, as his 
buddies nodded agreement. ``As long as it's going up, they can earn 
what they want, they can do what they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally cautious German investors who just a year ago  
worried whether taking over Chrysler would tarnish Daimler-Benz's 
quality image -- and their portfolios -- seemed generally upbeat at 
this year's general meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The angst, that's all over,'' said one retiree, who declined  
to give his name. ``I think it's a success now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rosy financial picture presented six months after the  
trans-Atlantic merger was sealed helped spread the mood. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing strong sales so far this year, DaimlerChrysler raised its  
1999 revenue forecast by $3.2 billion Tuesday to $148 billion, up 6 
percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were cheered by the news, sending shares trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange up $1.75 to $94.18 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler stock has increased about 25 percent since it  
started trading last November, and the board proposed a dividend of 
$2.50 a share -- much more than old Daimler-Benz shareholders are 
used to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The promises we made have not only been kept, they have been  
exceeded,'' co-chairman Robert Eaton said at the start of the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the shareholders who turned out -- all but a handful  
German -- seemed satisfied that things were going well. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than half of the shareholders fit into the hall itself,  
with the rest making do with a huge white tent set up in a parking 
lot across the street. Outside under sunny skies, while the 
speeches droned from loudspeakers, crowds took turns looking under 
the hoods or sitting behind the wheel of fancy new Mercedes-Benz 
models on display. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my dream car,'' said Bavarian wholesaler Uwe Fischer as  
he climbed out of a plum-colored SLK convertible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some problems do exist. Co-chairman Juergen Schrempp conceded  
that sales for the two-seat Smart mini-car introduced last fall in 
Europe have been disappointing and profitability for the project 
was ``not yet in sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Adtranz high-tech rail unit also is still in the red. The  
European Union has accused the old Daimler-Benz of breaking 
antitrust rules -- charges Schrempp vowed to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's executive pay gap also caused some consternation.  
Traditionally, U.S. executives make much more than their German 
counterparts because their base salary is supplemented by bonuses 
and stock options, which can be extremely lucrative when the 
company is doing well and the stock is rising. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Eaton took home $16 million in salary, bonus and stock  
options from Chrysler while his Daimler counterpart, Schrempp, 
earned an estimated $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Dauensteiner, representing a group of about 250  
self-described ``critical shareholders,'' warned that adopting the 
U.S. system could harm Germany's social fabric, which relies more 
on egalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can live quite well on 5 million marks ($2.8  
million) a year in Germany,'' he said to scattered applause. ``The 
Americans should lower their demands to the German levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has proposed its own stock option plan for top  
executives, but left it off the agenda until next year's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, DaimlerChrysler has instituted a complicated  
``phantom stock'' plan that awards top managers the right to share 
in the profits when the company's stock appreciates. 
</P>
<P>
	No board member defended multimillion-dollar paydays or directly  
answered which way DaimlerChrysler salaries would go. But Hilmar 
Kopper, the supervisory board chairman, promised the company would 
adopt ``a performance-oriented remuneration system,'' winning 
applause of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if the manager brings in business and the company is  
doing well, why shouldn't he earn a lot?'' said Karl-Heinz Wolber, 
a print-shop worker. ``It creates jobs for Germans and jobs for 
Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Crashes Take Toll in Indy Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mike Borkowski began to spin, then he saw  
the wall approaching, almost in slow motion, and knew there was 
nothing he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, rookie.  
</P>
<P>
	``It felt really good for the first couple of laps, and I was  
just getting up to speed,'' Borkowski said after a hard hit against 
the second-turn wall on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash took him by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's very strange is it was very late in the corner, not  
where the car is on its full limits,'' he said. ``It just kind of 
came around all of a sudden like a real lazy, slow spin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Borkowski learned what veterans such as Scott Harrington and  
Billy Boat -- who also crashed -- should have known. The 2 1/2-mile 
track is not very forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much margin here,'' Borkowski said. ``Once a car  
comes around a little bit, you're sort of done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wrecks brought to four the three-day practice total. Boat  
also crashed Sunday, giving him four Indy practice mishaps since 
his rookie year of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Borkowski, 25, who was the SCCA Trans-Am rookie of the year in  
1997 and competed last season in Indy Lights for Team Rahal, is 
driving for the low-budget PDM Racing and looking for his first 
Indy Racing League start. 
</P>
<P>
	But without a backup, his hopes of qualifying Saturday or Sunday  
depend on how quickly his crew can repair the damage to the left 
side of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, in my career, I haven't crashed very much,'' he  
said. ``But you're going so fast, your brain learns to slow things 
down so what you see is a 2-second crash I could probably describe 
for 20 minutes. I remember every little detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his immediate reaction was to get angry, then worry  
about damage to the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel OK physically,'' Borkowski said. ``I just feel very bad  
for my guys. They've been working very hard and we're not a 
big-dollar team, so this was tough for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington bounced off the third-turn wall, hit it again as he  
went through the corner, made 2 1/2 spins and stopped in the middle of 
the fourth turn. Boat went into the wall coming out of the third 
turn and stopped in the north chute between turns 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Reigning Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever, who has worked with  
rookies as a car owner-driver the past three years, was watching a 
Speedway television monitor when Harrington crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he tells his drivers about safety, Cheever said, ``I  
tell them, `Crashing is not an option. Don't even consider it.' 
They have to leave themselves enough room until they understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever has been a practitioner of his own words, having crashed  
in practice at Indy only once in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very hard wall, and if you spin you could kill  
yourself, or nothing could happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boat wasn't sure what caused the latest crash. But he was upset  
about his equipment, and believes wrecks only make it more 
difficult for both driver and team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can get behind here real fast, and now we've got two bent  
race cars,'' he said. ``I knew early that I was in trouble. The car 
never attempted to turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said his car also had steering problems on a windy  
day, that eventually became a rain-filled one. Practice was 
interrupted for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a tailwind, which helped me carry a little bit of speed  
in the corner, but it didn't do that the lap before,'' he said. 
``Now I'm down to one car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray was the fastest for the third day in a row, turning a  
top lap of 224.843 mph. Among other fast drivers were rookie John 
Hollansworth Jr. at 221.669, defending IRL champion Kenny Brack at 
221.272 and two-time Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk at 221.119.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's government approved a law Tuesday  
allowing courts to prosecute sexual assault cases without the 
victim filing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts will also assume the costs of the trial under the new  
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's rights groups applauded the measure, arguing that most  
women in Peru do not file charges against their rapists for fear of 
retaliation, distrust of a male-dominated judicial system or a lack 
of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law guarantees that rapists will be punished even if  
women decide not to go ahead with charges,'' said Mayda Ramos, a

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Women bear a disproportionate

	``Globalization has been far from positive for the worker and  
even worse for women,'' conference chairperson Nancy Riche said in 
Rio De Janeiro. ``Women of the world know firsthand that

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Agriculture Secretariat will send  
$23.5 million in federal disaster aid to eight northern Mexico 
states to help farmers and ranchers through a serious drought, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid is to go to the border states of Sonora, Coahuila, Nuevo  
Leon and Tamaulipas, and the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango, 
San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most pressing problems is the effect the lack of rain  
has had on pasture for cattle, a situation Agriculture Secretary 
Romarico Arroyo called ``critical'' in statements to local media. 
</P>

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Global Exchange and at least three other  
human rights organizations said Tuesday the government's expulsion 
of hundreds of foreign observers violates Mexican and international 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the government expelled 144 foreign observers and 60  
have been expelled this year for allegedly meddling in Mexico's 
internal political affairs, Global Exchange said in a 70-page 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based organization said more than 350  
foreigners have been expelled, most of them from southern Chiapas 
state, since Jan. 1, 1994, when Zapatista rebels launched an 
uprising for greater democracy and more rights for Mexico's 11 
million Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those expelled appear to have been Zapatista  
sympathizers, and some had brought aid to pro-Zapatista 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernesto Ledesma, the Global Exchange coordinator in Chiapas,  
said all were expelled without a hearing. He maintained that 
violated Mexican law and contradicted Mexico's support of 
international treaties on human rights.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Central Bank said Tuesday that  
figures showing the economy would shrink by 7.9 percent in 1999

scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the tax department released Central Bank projections  
of an economic downturn far worse than what had previously been 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such figures don't constitute official information,'' the  
central bank said in a press statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why the tax department released the  
projections, which apparently were meant for internal government 
use. The department has been using the figures to calculate the 
year's tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez took office just 3 1/2 months ago, and  
coordination among the various government agencies has sometimes 
been rocky.

Tuesday that the economy is expected to shrink this year, but that 
she didn't know by how much.

<HEADLINE> Old Injury Haunts Dominik Hasek / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek will have more to worry about  
than flying slapshots when the Buffalo Sabres try to eliminate the 
Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Bourque won't be his main concern tonight. Same goes for  
Jason Allison or Sergei Samsonov. 
</P>
<P>
	No. The great goalie's biggest preoccupation is his health. A  
groin injury sidelined Hasek for 12 games during the season and 
hampered him in the Game 5 playoff loss to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hasek says he'll start Game 6 of the Eastern Conference  
semifinal. The series winner faces Toronto for the right to play in 
the Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres lead the series 3-2, and need a win to avoid another  
trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like a seventh game for us,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is the keystone for the defense-minded Sabres. The  
league's two-time MVP gave up four goals before Ruff pulled him 
after the second period in Boston's 5-3 win Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind, I favored my groin a little, but it won't happen  
anymore,'' Hasek said. ``I feel bad about it, because I have to 
play 100 percent all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek led the NHL in save percentage for the sixth consecutive  
year and shut out Boston for five consecutive periods before he was 
beaten by Don Sweeney midway through the first on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, 7-2 in the playoffs with a 1.75 goals-against average,  
claimed he's been playing hurt for the last 2 1/2 months. When the 
playoffs began, Hasek said the injury was healed. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused Monday to explain the apparent contradiction or offer  
excuses for his poor play in Game 5. His teammates said they were 
unaware of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the extent of his injury or how bad he's  
hurting,'' Brian Holzinger said. ``But this is the time when 
everybody plays through bumps and bruises. I'm sure he's going to 
find a way to play through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek skated and stretched with a couple of teammates for about  
20 minutes before the team's practice Monday morning. ``I had a 
good practice,'' Hasek said. ``I felt good, my head is clear and I 
feel ready for the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aching groin apparently was more distracting than disabling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just got to where he notices it again,'' said Ruff, adding  
that Hasek has been undergoing 40 minutes of massage therapy a day. 
</P>
<P>
	A goal by Samsonov giving Boston a 2-1 lead early in the second  
tipped off Ruff that something was wrong. ``That was a play that he 
would have raced out skating,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres blamed the loss more on a porous defense than leaky  
goaltending. Noting a two-man break gave the Bruins their fourth 
goal, Sabres forward Dixon Ward said, ``Even if you had three 
goalies, you wouldn't stop that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston defenseman Hal Gill said all goalies are vulnerable.  
``Once you get traffic, if they can't see the puck, they can't stop 
it,'' Gill said. ``Eventually, if you pester enough and get in his 
face enough and get enough shots, something's got to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins have never overcome a 3-1 deficit to win a series in  
18 tries, and they have had limited success against the Sabres in 
Marine Midland Arena.

<HEADLINE> Little Impeachment Fallout Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House vote to impeach President Clinton  
won't haunt Republican candidates in the 2000 congressional races 
because the public has long since moved on, the top House GOP 
election strategist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the National Republican  
Congressional Committee, told reporters that recent internal GOP 
polls showed interest in impeachment as a campaign issue 
diminishing since January, when one-third of voters polled by 
Republicans said it was a key factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters have put this behind them,'' Davis said. ``We're  
going to talk about the future -- our blueprint for the 21st 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the Democratic  
Congressional Campaign Committee, said last week that the 
impeachment vote would be ``most damaging'' to the GOP -- even if 
Democrats don't call attention to it -- and would help demonstrate 
that they are also out of the mainstream on issues such as 
education, health care and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes off the veneer of them being moderate in any  
manner,'' Kennedy said of December's House impeachment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis admitted that impeachment did ``smother'' the GOP message  
on other issues for a time. But since the Senate acquitted Clinton 
in February, he said, Republicans are ``closing the gap'' with 
Democrats on issues of importance to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, whose party holds a slim 222-211 majority in the House,  
said congressional Republicans are coordinating with some of the 
party's presidential contenders to develop a united campaign 
message for 2000. He wouldn't say which presidential hopefuls, but 
clearly was excited about the potential candidacy of Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outsider, and he's got the brand name,'' Davis said.  
``If we get any kind of help at the top of the ticket, we'll gain 
seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the House campaigns, Davis said the focus is on  
recruiting 30 to 50 ``blue-chip candidates'' to challenge 
vulnerable incumbent Democrats and to run in districts being 
vacated by Democrats. Those include seats now held by Reps. Ron 
Klink of Pennsylvania, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Robert Wise of 
West Virginia, Lane Evans of Illinois and Dennis Moore of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis acknowledged that some GOP incumbents are on shaky ground,  
including Rep. James Rogan of California, one of the most prominent 
House impeachment managers, Rep. Richard Baker of Louisiana and 
Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. But he said incumbents who survived in 
1998 are ``toughened up'' for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are doing some good recruiting, but we don't see  
anything that scares us,'' Davis said. ``We'll have our best team 
in the field. We are out recruiting heavily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis would not release fund-raising figures for the House  
campaign committee but predicted the GOP would best the Democrats 
``2-to-1'' in hard money contributions for specific races, with a 
lesser advantage in soft money donations used for party-building 
activities.

<HEADLINE> School Victims Address Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In soft, nervous voices, students who  
experienced violence firsthand today suggested to House lawmakers 
that more parental involvement and smaller class sizes would help 
stop future shootings at schools. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said that teachers should be empowered to deal with  
problems in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But the students also acknowledged that there is no way to  
guarantee that problems won't occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harassment has been around since you were a little kid,'' Adam  
Campbell, a student at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., 
told Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how you can totally stop harassment,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, stormed Columbine on  
April 20, killing 12 other students and a teacher before taking 
their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Atteberry, a student from Thurston High School in  
Springfield, Ore., told lawmakers that May 21, 1998, started like 
any normal school day when he was visiting with friends on his way 
to his first class. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know I'm laying down on the ground,  
paralyzed, my head filled by a deafening ringing sound,'' Atteberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized something terrible had happened when I saw the  
blood coming out of my side,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Atteberry spent five days in the hospital recovering from his  
injuries and said he still has a bullet lodged in his spine because 
doctors said it would be too dangerous to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thurston, student Kip Kinkel allegedly walked into the  
school's cafeteria and opened fire, killing two students and 
wounding more than 20. He is also accused of fatally shooting his 
parents a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel faces four aggravated murder charges and is scheduled to  
stand trial this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Those testifying at a subcommittee hearing also included a  
student from Heath High School in Paducah, Ky., whose brother was 
shot while at school in 1997; students who experienced bomb threats 
at two Maryland schools; and a Baltimore student who saw a youth 
threatened with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting victims testified before the early childhood, youth  
and families subcommittee of the Education and the Workforce 
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Mich. School Massacre Plot Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Four teen-agers plotted to buy and  
steal weapons for a massacre at their middle school that would top 
the death toll at Columbine High School, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was to be a Colorado-style shooting and bombing ... The  
goal was to kill more people than in Columbine,'' said St. Clair 
County Assistant Prosecutor Michael Wendling, referring to last 
month's school shooting in which two gunmen killed 13 people and 
then committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys also planned to rape girls at the Holland Woods Middle  
School, Wendling said at the arraignment for two of the suspects, 
both 13 years old. He would not elaborate on the charge outside of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers said the boys -- Daniel Fick and Jonathan  
McDonald -- have a clean record and that the Colorado shooting had 
created ``hysteria'' in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``His only problem at the school was talking in class and  
running in the halls,'' Jonathan's attorney, Frank Mitchell, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel's attorney, Steve Guilliat, said his client was not a  
troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what's on paper, this is not a bad kid,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	All four boys face adult charges of conspiracy to commit  
premeditated murder. If convicted, the older boys would 
automatically draw life prison sentences without possibility of 
parole. A judge would have the option of sentencing the younger 
boys to a lesser sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year-old boys were ordered held on $100,000 bail.  
Fourteen-year-olds Justin J. Schnepp and Jedaiah D. Zinzo were 
arraigned Friday and ordered held on $100,000 cash bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the students Wednesday after two classmates told  
an assistant principal that they overheard the boys plotting the 
shooting. The arrest came the day before a pipe bomb was found near 
the school Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief William Corbett said police were still  
investigating who left the bomb, saying he did not know if there 
was a connection between the alleged plot and the bomb, 
</P>
<P>
	In court Tuesday, prosecutors said the four boys planned to buy  
weapons, then use them to commit a robbery that would yield still 
more weapons. The boys had picked a specific time for the massacre 
and had a hit list of intended victims among the faculty and 
students at the school, Wendling said.

<HEADLINE>  Riley's Heat Blueprint Is a Bust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pat Riley is widely regarded as the best coach in  
the NBA, so the Miami Heat coach will be spared in the backlash of 
his team's first-round fizzle against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Miami's fans and critics clamor in consensus: Fire the  
players. And Riley may do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley thought he had a team ready to fill the championship void  
created by Michael Jordan's retirement. Instead, the Heat were 
eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs for the third time 
in Riley's four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston's last-second shot Sunday for the New York Knicks  
drove home the point: Miami needs a makeover. Riley's blueprint is 
a bust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'll sit down and talk about what we're going to do  
this offseason,'' Riley said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Riley should share in the blame, but his four  
championship rings with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s still 
carry considerable clout. Instead, Heat players will take the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	As is his custom, Riley laid low on the first day of the  
offseason, and he wasn't talking to the media Monday. So 
speculation began without him. The question is not whether he'll 
shake up the roster, but how. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player considered untouchable is center Alonzo  
Mourning, who had an MVP-caliber year and a fine series against the 
Knicks. But his teammates, including point guard Tim Hardaway, can 
only wonder whether they'll be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like going to war with this group of guys, and I don't want  
to see change,'' Mourning said. ``But this game is about change, 
and with Riles running the ship, if adjustments have to be made, 
he'll make them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks series confirmed that adjustments have to be made.  
The Heat became the first No. 1 seed from the Eastern Conference to 
lose against a No. 8 seed. Last year, Miami was the first No. 2 
seed from the East to be eliminated by a No. 7 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Miami lost both times to the despised  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was tough. This is going to be even tougher,'' guard  
Dan Majerle said. ``We play hard, but we just haven't been able to 
get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York underscored the Heat's deficiencies:  
They rely too much on outside shots and badly need a scorer at 
shooting guard or small forward. Miami has no reliable third option 
beyond Mourning and Hardaway, who struggled through a miserable 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway shot 27 percent against the Knicks and averaged 9.0  
points per game, barely half his average. He was shut out in the 
second half of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a bad stretch I hit, and I didn't come through for  
my team,'' he said. ``That's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his productivity curtailed, Miami averaged just 79.0 points  
against New York, the second-lowest figure in a five-game series in 
NBA history. The Heat set the record of 78.6 against the Bulls two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's biggest decision will be whether to keep Hardaway, the  
Heat's best clutch player the past four years. He has one season 
left on his contract, but turns 33 in September and is plagued by 
knee trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	If Riley decides to sacrifice defense for more offense, he might  
part with power forward P.J. Brown, who has the most trade value of 
any player except Mourning. Guards Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard 
have limited marketability after disappointing seasons curtailed by 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards Majerle and Terry Porter become free agents this summer.  
Both have expressed an interest in remaining with Miami, and 
they're the only players on the roster with experience in the NBA 
Finals. But Majerle is 33 and Porter 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, the scapegoats for the failure of 1999 will be  
selected. Riley's postseason record in Miami is 12-18, and with the 
offseason prematurely under way, coach Pat is unlikely to stand 
pat.

<HEADLINE> Van Gogh Collection Arrives in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vincent van Gogh died an unrecognized, penniless  
artist, a man so tortured that he shot himself to death. But van 
Gogh had a great friend who believed in him to the end and, perhaps 
more important, collected his works. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 paintings, drawings and etchings from the  
collection of Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet -- including works by 
Cezanne, Monet and Renoir -- will go on display at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art starting May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gogh, who committed suicide in 1890, was among the many  
talented, rising artists befriended by Gachet, a physician who 
often accepted art as a token of friendship or as payment for his 
medical services. 
</P>
<P>
	Gachet practiced homeopathic medicine and specialized in nervous  
disorders and mental illness, but van Gogh ``wasn't literally being 
treated by Gachet,'' said Susan Alyson Stein, curator of ``Cezanne 
to Van Gogh: The Collection of Doctor Gachet,'' which runs through 
Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gachet was there as a friend and companion, somebody to talk  
to. Van Gogh saw him as a kindred spirit, a man who resembled him 
not only physically but also mentally. Van Gogh said of him, `He 
seems to be suffering as much as I am.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gachet also posed for van Gogh. One of those sittings,  
``Portrait of Doctor Paul Gachet,'' an image of the doctor that van 
Gogh called ``a heartbroken expression of our time,'' sold for 
$82.5 million at Christie's in 1990, the highest price ever paid 
for a painting at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	That painting is not part of the Met exhibit, but a second, more  
abstract image of the melancholy doctor from the same same sitting 
is. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the artworks in the exhibit hung in the Gachet home in  
the village of Auvers-sur-Oise, 20 miles from Paris. The collection 
includes treasures such as van Gogh's ``Self-Portrait,'' Monet's 
``Chrysanthemums'' and Cezanne's ``Dr. Gachet's House at Auvers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Gachet's death in 1909, his son, Paul, kept the collection  
largely intact in the Auvers home for decades. When, after years of 
secrecy, ``it came to light, the Gachets were suspected of being 
forgers,'' Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the works were donated to the French government starting  
in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the exhibition consists of 50 paintings and  
drawings on loan from the Musee D'Orsay in Paris that had never 
before crossed the ocean. The other works originally owned by 
Gachet come from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, other museums, 
and European and American collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit also includes an urgent note from Gachet to van  
Gogh's brother, Theo, saying Vincent had shot himself and imploring 
Theo to come to Auvers. 
</P>
<P>
	One piece by Gachet himself has value beyond art: a charcoal  
portrait of a gaunt van Gogh on his deathbed. It is the last work 
in the exhibit.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Mideast Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Encouraged by Ehud Barak's wide margin of  
victory, President Clinton is calling on Israel's newly elected 
prime minister to pursue land-for-peace accords with the 
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday that was the path to security for Israel and  
that he intended to work energetically with Barak to reach those 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Interpreting Barak's easy victory over Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu as ``a strong mandate,'' Clinton made clear in a 
statement issued by the White House that he expected the 
conciliatory, new Israeli leader to pursue ``a just, lasting and 
comprehensive peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean not only concluding talks with the Palestinians  
that have not even begun on their demands for a state with its 
capital in Jerusalem, but negotiating with Syria over the Golan 
Heights, a strategic border enclave held by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Kipper, Middle East specialist at the Council on Foreign  
Relations and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 
said the election of the Labor Party prime minister would return 
strained U.S.-Israel relations back to normal and put the 
U.S.-brokered Mideast peace process back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more willingness by Barak to move forward in  
meaningful ways in the peace process,'' she said in an interview. 
``It probably will mean that, as a gesture, the Arabs will 
re-establish the offices and the contacts they have had with 
Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipper said that ``will be encouraging to Israeli public opinion  
and American mediation efforts and very helpful to the U.S. role in 
the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's King Abdullah, beginning a week of talks in Washington,  
told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``on all points we stand 
eye to eye'' and said his kingdom would ``stand by our friends in 
Israel and the Palestinians.'' Jordan became in 1994 the second 
Arab state after Egypt to conclude a peace treaty with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Lebanon front, the primary topic in peace talks would be  
the security belt Israel and friendly Lebanese militia maintain 
inside Lebanon's southern border to guard against cross-border 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu agreed in October to relinquish another chunk of West  
Bank territory to the Palestinians and sought negotiations with 
Lebanon over the security zone. 
</P>
<P>
	But Syria said any deal with Lebanon had to involve the Golan  
Heights. And the accord Netanyahu reached in October with Yasser 
Arafat with Clinton's mediation was sidetracked when the Israeli 
leader accused the Palestinians of not keeping their pledge to 
uproot terrorist cells on land they already held. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton telephoned Barak and Netanyahu on Monday after the  
outcome of the elections was clear. He said he thanked Netanyahu 
``for his dedicated service to Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the administration had remained neutral through the  
campaign. But there was no doubt American policy-makers preferred 
Barak, who takes a softer line toward the Arabs and whose party has 
already signaled it would accept a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	As military chief of staff, Barak had cautioned against  
relinquishing the Golan Heights, which Syria lost in the 1967 
Mideast War. But as foreign minister in a Labor government he 
supported its offer to swap the strategic plateau for peace terms 
with the Arab country. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on when Clinton might send his ``peace team''  
into action. Led by veteran mediator Dennis Ross, it had only 
limited success in trying to prod the skeptical Netanyahu into 
compromises with the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	A delay was likely for at least the two weeks Barak may need to  
select members of his new government. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the polls closed, Albright called anew for implementation  
of the October accords reached with the Palestinian Authority at 
the Wye Plantation in Maryland that would have Israel pull back 
from an additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank. She also said 
talks with the Palestinians on Jerusalem and statehood should be 
put on a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was informed of Barak's victory as he returned from Las  
Vegas, the last stop on a political weekend fund-raising trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon B. Alterman, who follows Middle East issues at the U.S.  
Institute of Peace, commenting prior to Barak's victory on the 
assumption he would be victorious, said ``it resurrects a very 
tight partnership between the government of Israel and the 
government of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been moving quickly to establish a  
partnership with the Palestinian Authority, Alterman said in an 
interview. For years, he said, the Arabs have been saying they were 
willing to deal with Israel, but that Netanyahu was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they have to decide what their real policy is and what  
concessions they are willing to support,'' Alterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Debra DeLee, president of the Americans for Peace Now, said  
``the big story of this Israeli election is that `Bibi's empire' of 
messianic settlers, religious zealots and political extremists 
didn't strike back -- it struck out -- while the forces of moderation 
scored a resounding victory.'' The Peace Now group favors a 
Palestinian state, with Jerusalem's future decided by Israel and 
the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Kemp, at the private Nixon Center, said Netanyahu ``did  
the unforgivable; he undermined relations with America, and Barak, 
I think will restore those relations.''

<HEADLINE> 'Ally McBeal' Spinoff Created </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Could there be an Ally Lite?  
</P>
<P>
	David E. Kelley, creator of the hit Fox series ``Ally McBeal,''  
said Tuesday that he began pushing for a half-hour spinoff after 
experimenting with the editing of the original. 
</P>
<P>
	The new series would feature the same characters, cast and  
theme: an unconventional Boston law firm filled with attorneys who 
break into song in the unisex bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But the spinoff would consist of unused and repeat footage shot  
for the hour-long series, as well as new scenes, all edited into 
half-hour stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it's going to happen,'' Kelley said.  
</P>
<P>
	While the original series intermixes drama with zaniness, the  
freestanding spinoff would have a distinctively comic bent, with 
its stories set in the firm and after hours. There would be no 
court scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, which unveils its fall prime-time schedule Thursday,  
declined to comment.

Heat's best clutch player the past four years. He has one season 
left on his contract, but turns 33 in September and is plagued by 
knee trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	If Riley decides to sacrifice defense for more offense, he might  
part with power forward P.J. Brown, who has the most trade value of 
any player except Mourning. Guards Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard 
have limited marketability after disappointing seasons curtailed by 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards Majerle and Terry Porter become free agents this summer.  
Both have expressed an interest in remaining with Miami, and 
they're the only players on the roster with experience in the NBA 
Finals. But Majerle is 33 and Porter 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, the scapegoats for the failure of 1999 will be  
selected. Riley's postseason record in Miami is 12-18, and with the 
offseason prematurely under way, coach Pat is unlikely to stand 
pat.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Who Shot Dad Gets Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A straight-A student who killed his abusive  
father with a shotgun as he lay on a sofa has been sentenced to a 
prison term in which he will be eligible for parole in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Dunagan, 19, could have gotten 70 years in prison for  
the 1997 killing of John Dunagan. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge who sentenced him Tuesday to one to three years said  
she had received scores of letters calling for leniency. Lancaster 
County Attorney Gary Lacey said the case was one of the most 
wrenching of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family went through what I think was fairly unbelievable  
abuse ... incessant and pounding,'' Lacey said. But he added, ``I 
do not think there was any legal justification for Matthew to kill 
his father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Karen Flowers said she would recommend that Dunagan serve  
his sentence in a community corrections center so he could continue 
attending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on the four-year 
scholarship he was awarded for getting straight A's in high school. 
He has been free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the elder Dunagan, who had been abusive for  
years, said after arguing with his wife one night that he might 
kill her. Matthew went to his room, got the shotgun, came back 
downstairs and shot his father twice in the chest as he lay on a 
couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was overwhelming fear in that house that night -- pure  
evil,'' defense attorney John Stevens Berry said. ``A holocaust of 
evil ... he became unable to cope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunagan was originally charged with murder, but he pleaded no  
contest in December to a reduced charge of manslaughter and use of 
a weapon to commit a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Before sentencing, Dunagan read a statement he had written on a  
piece of notebook paper expressing remorse for the killing.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Quits Hawaii Hula Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- When the dancing women of the Kodak Hula Show  
say aloha next month, it may be for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman Kodak Co. said Tuesday it is ending its sponsorship of  
the 62-year-old free tourist attraction at Kapiolani Park by the 
beaches of Waikiki. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is looking to attract younger people into  
photography, and the hula show mostly attracts older visitors, 
Kodak spokesman Jim Blamphin said. Kodak has hired a company to 
find a new sponsor for the hula show, its longest-running 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had 62 years in support of that show,'' Blamphin said. ``We  
would like to see it continue. We want it to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the show's performers said they had been told to start  
looking for another job while city officials look for a new 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The show features a cast of 40 men and women from the Royal  
Hawaiian Glee Club, including hula dancers dressed in traditional 
skirts made of green ti leaves with yellow leis around their necks 
and in their hair. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, the cast spells out ``Hawaii'' in giant red and  
yellow letters. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was the idea of former Kodak executive Fritz Herman,  
who saw it as a way to sell more film. Herman thought tourists had 
little opportunity to take pictures of hula dancers in daylight. It 
is still the only daytime show of its kind in Hawaii, said host 
Kimo Kahoano.

<HEADLINE> Phone Cos. To Aid Battered Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mobile telephone companies from around New  
York signed onto a program Tuesday to make old or unused cellular 
telephones available to abused women when they venture away from 
home or work. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is an expansion of a four-month ``Wireless at Work''  
effort by Bell Atlantic Mobile in New York City and Long Island to 
recycle phones. So far, that has resulted in some 2,000 cell phones 
being collected for distribution to domestic violence victims, 
community watch groups and others. 
</P>
<P>
	State Senate officials said Tuesday that other leading cellular  
phone providers have agreed to participate, including Frontier 
Cellular, Sprint PCS and AT&AMP;T. Between them, the companies operate 
in areas containing 95 percent of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Stott, Northeast region president of Bell Atlantic Mobile,  
said the introduction of a new generation of newer, smaller phones, 
plus the evolution of wireless phones from analog to digital, has 
created a supply of older used and sometimes never-used models. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they would collect donated telephones and  
refurbish them or donate new ones. The phones would be programmed 
to dial 911 emergency numbers at the touch of a button so women and 
other domestic violence victims can talk to police immediately if 
they sense they are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This little device here is a little device that's going to  
save lives,'' said state Sen. Charles Fuschillo, R-Nassau, at a 
state Capitol news conference while holding up a cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounted the case of an abused Long Island woman who felt  
that she got her life back when given one of the Bell Atlantic 
Mobile phones because it allowed her to feel safer when she goes 
out shopping or otherwise leaves home. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times a phone call can mean the difference between  
safety and injury or death,'' said Sherry Frohman, executive 
director of the state Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, cell phone carriers are obligated to carry  
911 transmissions to local emergency officials at no charge to the 
caller. The phones provided under the program are programmed to 
call 911 lines only and cannot access any other numbers, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic violence victims seeking phones were urged to call  
local cellular telephone providers, their state senator's office or 
domestic violence advocacy groups to find out more about the 
program. The state's domestic violence hotline at 1-800-942-6906, 
or for Spanish speakers at 1-800-942-6908, can also provide 
information about the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier Cellular and Motorola also announced Tuesday the  
distribution of 1,000 cell phones to domestic violence programs in 
the Albany area.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 16.52  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today after the Federal Reserve left  
interest rates unchanged but warned that rates are likely to rise 
in the coming months. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 
16.52 at 10,836.95, after having fallen as much as 110 points in 
the hour following the Fed's announcement. Broader stock indicators 
also closed lower, although most recovered some lost ground late in 
the session. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.94 to 2,557.90. 
Although the announcement from the Fed's Open Market Committee was 
largely expected, stocks tumbled within moments. Cyclical stocks, 
which rise and fall on the fortunes of the U.S. economy, were hit 
especially hard. ``I just think it's an indication of how nervous 
the market is,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities 
America. ``We're at lofty levels, and it doesn't take much to make 
people lose their nerve.''

	Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve decided today that  
inflation is not enough of a threat to justify an immediate 
increase in interest rates. But Fed officials put financial markets 
on notice that higher rates are likely in coming months, warning of 
the ``need to be alert'' to possible inflationary pressures. The 
Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members and 
regional bank presidents, ended closed-door discussions with a 
decision to leave the target for the federal funds rate, the 
interest that banks charge each other, unchanged. But Fed 
policy-makers announced they had revised their policy bias to show 
the central bank was leaning toward an increase in rates in coming 
months should inflationary pressures increase.

	New Home Construction Falls 10 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New construction of homes and apartments took  
the biggest slide in nearly five years last month. Analysts said 
the sharper-than-expected 10.1 percent drop in April occurred in 
part because unseasonably warm weather in the Northeast and the 
Midwest let builders get more projects than usual under way last 
winter. ``As a result, there is less activity in the pipeline this 
spring,'' said David Orr, an economist with First Union Bank Corp. 
in Charlotte, N.C. However, many economists also have been 
expecting a moderate decline in construction this year from a 
torrid pace in 1998.

renovation market continued to surge. Dayton Hudson Corp. saw a 23 
percent profit increase, helped by strength at its Target discount 
stores. Tiffany &AMP; Co.'s earnings rose 42 percent as demand for 
jewelry and fine household goods remained strong.

lawsuit, as long as Coke makes it clear that employees are free to 
join the case. U.S. District Judge Richard Story issued a ruling 
setting guidelines for communication with employees by both Coke 
management and attorneys for the four black employees who filed the 
suit. After a hearing on the issue, Story issued the ruling. The 
plaintiffs, one former and three current black salaried employees, 
sued Coke last month alleging that the company discriminated 
against black employees in pay, promotions, performance evaluations 
and terminations.

<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will recall about 279,000  
full-size sedans to replace a cruise-control switch that could 
short-circuit and create a fire. The recall affects the 1992 and 
'93 Lincoln Town Car, Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria 
sedans equipped with factory-installed cruise control. About 10,900 
of the recalled cars are in Canada. Ford said in a statement that a 
potentially defective cruise control deactivation switch could 
short-circuit, which in turn could overheat and catch fire. A short 
also could disable the cruise control system and blow the brake 
light fuse.

	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Second-quarter profits for Deere &AMP; Co., the

depressed commodity prices led to slower sales of its more 
profitable combines and tractors. For the three months ended April 
30, net income fell to $150.1 million, or 65 cents a share, from 
$365.2 million, or $1.45 a share, in the year-ago period. The

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Violence Bill Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican and Democratic senators were at a  
procedural stalemate on gun-control legislation only hours before a 
threatened deadline to either pass it or move on to something else. 
</P>
<P>
	Partisan bickering threatened to torpedo the sweeping bill  
intended to crack down on juvenile violence as senators argued over 
how to change the legislation and accused each other of trying to 
kill it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials who asked not to be named said today that  
senators of their party have agreed to eliminate all but perhaps 
two or three gun-control amendments and a few on other issues to 
make it clear that if the bill dies it was not for their lack of 
cooperation. But internal disagreements remained over which of 
dozens of Democratic amendments would survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing to pass a bill to make it harder for young people to get  
guns and to impose harsher penalties on those who use them in crime 
would seem the last thing Republicans or Democrats want sandwiched 
between the Colorado school shootings and an election year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott threatened to halt  
debate on the bill if Democrats and Republicans could not agree 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this juvenile justice bill done,'' Lott, R-Miss.,  
declared from the Senate floor in the fifth day of debate. ``If we 
can't get to some kind of agreement, we're not going to get to a 
conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority leader wants this bill to fade away without a  
roar or a whimper and without any Republican blame,'' said Sen. 
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	That committee's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has worked  
on the bill for two years. It is sweeping in its scope and takes on 
the volatile issue of gun control a month after two Columbine High 
School students in Littleton, Colo., murdered 12 colleagues and a 
teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5 billion bill also addresses other factors of juvenile  
violence, such as preventing alcohol shipments to young people and 
making it easier to prosecute violent minors under laws and 
punishments that apply to adults. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the gun issue, however, that threw the measure into  
jeopardy last week, as Republicans reversed course to require 
background checks of sales at gun shows less than 24 hours after 
passing an amendment making many such checks voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of amendments were still pending, which Hatch said Monday  
would take several days to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Democrats of insisting on dozens of amendments with  
the sole intent of forcing him to stop debate for lack of time, 
then blame Republicans for failing to curb violent children in the 
aftermath of the Colorado episode. In fact, senior Republican aides 
have said, Lott brought the 2-year-old bill to the floor expressly 
to let senators react to the shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats think they've found a good issue,'' Lott said.  
``We've got other legislation we've got to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There will come a time when this bill manager is going to get  
exasperated enough that I'm going to pull every doggone'' part of 
it off the floor for good, Hatch sputtered. ``I'm reaching that 
point. I'm not there yet, but I'm going to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, accused Republicans of refusing their  
amendments to goad them into filibustering the bill to death. Sen. 
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said Lott was trying to force the bill 
down the Senate's throat as he threatens to pull it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have it both ways,'' Wellstone said. ``It's just not  
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Democratic and Republican officials who demanded  
anonymity said Hatch and Leahy were working their way through an 
amendment they will sponsor that could strike compromises on an 
array of questions from gun control to expanding the purposes for 
which states can spend federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The aides reported progress over the weekend, but the amendment  
was not expected to take final shape until today, just hours before 
the Republican-set deadline for a final vote.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Defense Tough on O'Neal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Spurs may finally be shedding their  
``soft'' image after their attack on Shaq. And Shaq doesn't like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Four San Antonio players took turns guarding Los Angeles Lakers  
center Shaquille O'Neal in the rough opening game of their Western 
Conference semifinal series Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to guard Shaq is to break the rules that they NBA  
is supposed to enforce but they never enforce,'' the 7-foot-1, 
315-pound O'Neal said Tuesday after the Spurs 87-81 win over the 
Lakers Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to break me.''  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal wouldn't elaborate about what rules he thought were  
violated. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, he ran after referee Steve Javie but Lakers  
coach Kurt Rambis kept O'Neal from getting close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get a chance to say anything to him,'' O'Neal said.  
</P>
<P>
	Guarded at various points by Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Will  
Perdue and Malik Rose, O'Neal went to the foul line 14 times and 
made nine of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who'd been averaging a league-best 29.5 points in the  
playoffs before facing the Spurs, had 21 points and 15 rebounds in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was obviously a tough one for him,'' Robinson said  
Tuesday. ``He didn't get his average. So that was a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan led the Spurs with 25 points, and Robinson added 15  
points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 in the best-of-7 playoff series is Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who said the Spurs were prepared to use lots of fouls  
in their attempt to shut down O'Neal, expects the series to get 
even more physical as it goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the nature of the playoffs,'' Robinson said. ``But it's  
still about basketball. You've got to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson knows what it takes to succeed -- and fail. In his 10  
seasons in the NBA, the Spurs have been to the playoffs nine times 
but made it past the conference semifinals only once, in 1995 when 
the Spurs lost to Houston in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	That record and Robinson's sometimes disappointing postseason  
performance got the Spurs branded as ``soft'' in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, with the addition of veterans Mario Elie, Jerome  
Kersey and Steve Kerr, the Spurs added more playoff experience and 
physical and emotional intensity on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs won their first-round series with Minnesota 3-1,  
capping it with a hard-fought game that left Elie with a cut and 
stitches above his right eye and Robinson with a technical foul for 
a slapping and shoving match with Joe Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that San Antonio has won its series opener against the  
Lakers in another aggressive contest, does Robinson believe the 
label ``soft'' has been wiped away for good? 
</P>
<P>
	``If you say so,'' he said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Lakers shot only 38 percent Monday night, they  
still had chances to win in the final period and at one point 
pulled to within five points. The Spurs, shooting 42 percent for 
the game, committed nine turnovers in the fourth quarter and missed 
some critical free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to watch a lot of film and we're going to try to  
figure out some of those fourth quarter problems,'' Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis plans some changes for the Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do a much better jot at not being predictable with  
what we're going,'' he said. ``They knew exactly how they were 
going to double team and what they were going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis also expects a better game out of O'Neal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's going to play better,'' he said. ``There's no  
doubt in my mind.''

<HEADLINE> Golf Braces for Another `El Nino'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- There is no mistaking the kid.  
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia arrived for his professional debut in America  
toting a bag with the words ``El Nino'' stitched in gold, a stack 
of books to keep up with his homework and a smile for every Texas 
beauty who cooed his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe all the pretty girls,'' the 19-year-old  
Spaniard said Tuesday in accepting an invitation to play the 
Memorial Tournament. ``If they're like this at every tournament, I 
think I'll move here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no mistaking the talent.  
</P>
<P>
	From the left rough in the final round of the Byron Nelson  
Classic, his approach to the 18th green climbed over a tree, faded 
gently toward the green and stopped 10 feet behind the cup. The 
birdie put him in a tie for third -- better than Tiger Woods, Justin 
Leonard and 147 other players in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salesmanship Club of Dallas usually invites only the Nelson  
champion to its volunteers' party after the tournament. This time, 
it asked the kid to come by. Garcia walked in the door to an 
ovation that nearly blew the roof off the tent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once every 10 years, someone like this comes along,'' said  
Jerry Higginbotham, who may have stumbled into a gold mine when he 
was fired as Mark O'Meara's caddie and picked up by Garcia for the 
rest of what could be a fascinating year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a no-miss sign right on his forehead,'' Lee Trevino  
said the day after the Nelson. ``There is no denying this kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where the kid goes from here is anyone's guess.  
</P>
<P>
	An affiliate member of the European tour, he is eligible as a  
captain's pick for the Ryder Cup team. Suddenly, a teen-ager in the 
most pressure-packed event in golf doesn't seem so ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very impressed with his third place,'' European captain  
Mark James said. ``He's been playing pro tournaments for about 
three years, and he's very mature for a 19-year-old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four rounds in relatively easy scoring conditions does not make  
a star, but Garcia clearly has the ingredients -- fearless play, 
composure beyond his years, the short-game magic of Seve 
Ballesteros and the youthful exuberance of Woods three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the youngsters have great appeal. How long he'll hold  
that, I don't know,'' Trevino said. ``I remember one that always 
had a smile on his face and was tipping the hat, and now he's 
burying his clubs in the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia does not want to be compared to Woods, although that's a  
tall order. 
</P>
<P>
	Both had sterling amateur records. Woods' mark is unprecedented  
with his three straight U.S. Amateur titles, while Garcia won the 
British Amateur, was the first European to be low amateur in the 
Masters and had a 37-2 record in match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``His opponents would look at his eyes on the first tee and  
realize they were already 2-down,'' said Garcia's manager, Jose 
Marquina. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods tied for 60th in his first pro start, 11th the next and  
won in only his fifth try. Garcia tied for 25th in the Spanish Open 
and tied for third in the Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	That moved him up to No. 208 in the world rankings. He can break  
the top 100 by winning this week against a field in Germany that 
includes Woods, O'Meara and Ernie Els. It took Woods a record six 
weeks to get into the top 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they compare you with a good player, that means that you  
have something in your game,'' Garcia said. ``But I always want to 
be just myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There may be similarities in style, but a vast difference in how  
they prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods spent two years at Stanford and tested the professional  
waters primarily in the majors. His best was a tie for 22nd in the 
1996 British Open. Of course, that was the year Tom Lehman handed 
his claret jug to Garcia and said, ``Someday, you'll win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia may still be studying for his driver's license, but he  
played 80 amateur events in 20 countries, and 28 professional 
events as an amateur. One of those was the Nike Greensboro Classic 
last year, where he tied for third behind Joe Ogilvie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the whole deal,'' said Ogilvie, who was paired with  
Garcia the first two rounds in the Nelson. ``He'll win soon, and I 
think when he wins it will be by four, five or six strokes. He's 
got a game like Tiger had at the Masters when he blew everybody 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's goal is to get his European tour card and make the  
Ryder Cup team. Even before the Nelson, Ballesteros said the kid 
would be a good pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``New mind, new blood, no fear,'' Ballesteros said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Skeletons Returned to Tribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- After 70 years of study, the bones of  
nearly 2,000 American Indians have been returned to their 
descendants for burial in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University handed over the remains Tuesday in the  
largest and perhaps most scientifically significant transfer under 
a 1990 federal law that requires the return of Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great joy,'' said Ruben Sando, a lieutenant governor  
of Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico. ``I am very, very grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bones -- as well as objects to be returned from Phillips  
Academy in Andover next week -- were taken from excavations in the 
upper Pecos Valley in New Mexico by archaeologist Alfred Kidder 
between 1915 and 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they represent the foundation of scientific knowledge  
about the early cultures of the American Southwest, according to 
James Bradley, director of the Peabody Andover museum. 
</P>
<P>
	A century before Kidder began digging, Pecos Pueblo maintained a  
thriving trading center that interacted with the Plains Indians, 
other Pueblos and Spanish communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, disease and warfare decimated the Pecos Pueblo, and  
the Indians moved to the Jemez Pueblo in 1838. Jemez is now a small 
community of scattered adobe houses about 50 miles north of 
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidder traveled to the Southwest to try out a new archaeological  
technique he'd learned at Harvard called stratigraphic excavation. 
He uncovered a number of sites and found thousands of objects and 
remains dating from the late-12th to the mid-19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and  
Ethnology analyzed the remains in one of the first systematic 
studies of a population ever conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones were important for research into nutrition, trauma and  
disease, particularly osteoporosis, according to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act  
took effect in 1990, Bradley initiated the repatriation of the 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sent them a letter and said, `We have a lot of your  
stuff','' Bradley said. ``They said, `We know. Let's talk'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A ceremony Tuesday included solemn prayers, speeches, the  
symbolic transfer of a Pueblo bowl and the signing of a memorandum 
of repatriation of 1,912 human remains from the Pecos Valley in the 
care of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar return occurred last year, when the University of  
Nebraska returned 1,700 remains to various tribes, a move 
criticized by some scholars as detrimental to further research. 
</P>
<P>
	Descendants at the Jemez Pueblo planned a burial ceremony on  
Saturday in the Pecos Monument National Park.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs Tobacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Developing countries would save millions of lives  
without hurting their economies if they adopted a range of measures 
to control tobacco use, the World Bank said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, ``Curbing the Epidemic,'' the organization says  
governments should look at raising cigarette taxes, banning 
advertising and providing information on the health risks of 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around the world children suffer under the delusion that  
tobacco makes them appear sophisticated. The cruel truth is, it 
will kill them,'' said James Wolfensohn, president of the World 
Bank, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A comprehensive tobacco control policy is unlikely to harm  
economies or hurt poor farmers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any loss of tobacco-farming jobs would be over decades or  
more, not overnight. Adopting sound agricultural and trade policies 
can help farmers in poor countries compete fairly for the world 
market,'' the World Bank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to restrict the supply of tobacco, such as by banning it  
or restricting sale to minors is ineffective and likely to have 
undesirable consequences, the report said. It adds that it is 
necessary, however, to take action against smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued during the annual meeting of the  
191-nation World Health Organization. The governing body, which 
began its session Monday, is working on a draft world treaty on 
tobacco control and looking at other ways of reducing smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank, a global lending institution that aims to reduce  
poverty and finance investment contributing to economic growth of 
developing nations, says countries should consider applying taxes 
on tobacco items which would represent up to four-fifths of the 
cost of the product. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our conservative analyses state that a 10 percent increase in  
the real price of cigarettes worldwide would ... prevent a minimum 
of 10 million tobacco-related deaths,'' said Prabhat Jha, who led 
the report team. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 5 million deaths would be prevented by comprehensive  
bans on tobacco advertising and promotion, the report said.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Monitors Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- United Airlines officials, accused by a rival of  
predatory pricing two years ago, are closely monitoring a federal 
lawsuit accusing American Airlines of similar practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Greenwald, chairman and chief executive officer of United  
parent UAL Corp., said Tuesday he has not been notified of any 
federal investigation involving United since Frontier Airlines 
lodged the complaint with the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been aggressive, but careful. That's the best way I can  
put it,'' he said. ``We're hoping the Justice Department will stay 
with its existing policy as to what is predatory and what is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Frontier accused United of illegal practices, such as  
undercutting fares, to try to force the low-fare carrier out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	United officials denied the allegations then and again at its  
annual shareholders meeting Tuesday, when the issue was raised by a 
shareholder concerned by the federal lawsuit filed Thursday 
accusing American of trying to eliminate competition at its 
Dallas-Fort Worth hub. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein said at the time that  
other airlines were under investigation, but no names were 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, UAL's stockholders approved the nomination of  
James E. Goodwin to succeed Greenwald, effective in July. They also 
approved the appointment of former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary 
as a director. 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues raised during UAL's annual meeting ranged from the  
type of coffee pots used on flights to a recently adopted 
requirement that passengers be seated on jets five minutes before 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwald acknowledged some passengers may be miffed if they  
arrive at a gate within minutes of departure, only to find the jet 
doors have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
	United, which handles as many as 260,000 passengers a day, needs  
to improve its on-time performance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwald also said he hoped the industry makes enough  
improvements in customer service to thwart a proposed federal law 
that would give passengers more rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``United is taking that shot across the bow very seriously,''  
Greenwald said of the passenger rights' legislation. ``We've got a 
lot we can be doing to improve on passenger service.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Closing In on Red Wings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Nothing seems to scare the Detroit Red Wings like  
a goalie on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, it was Arturs Irbe. In 1995, it was Martin Brodeur. In  
1996, it was Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	And now it's Roy again.  
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche, once down 0-2, have rallied behind Roy  
for three straight victories and can eliminate Detroit with a win 
tonight in Game 6 of their second-round series. If a seventh game 
is needed, it would be Thursday night in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's say we approach it like it's our Game 7,'' Roy said  
after practice Monday. ``We don't want to think about Thursday's 
game. We want to think about tomorrow's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have a lot of confidence the way we're playing right  
now, the way we play on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, extending his NHL playoff record for wins to 106, had 36  
saves as the Avalanche beat Detroit 3-0 in Game 5 on Sunday, the 
first time the home team has won in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy has stopped 111 of the last 116 Detroit shots.  
</P>
<P>
	``Roy has been solid in the net,'' said Steve Yzerman, the Red  
Wings' captain, ``and they have gotten timely goals from all sorts 
of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy's 12th career playoff shutout tied him with Terry Sawchuk  
for fourth place in NHL history. His last shutout in the postseason 
came in Game 5 against Detroit in the Western Conference finals in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Patrick Roy, the net is getting smaller,'' Colorado coach  
Bob Hartley said. ``Patrick is outstanding. Everybody's talking 
about the Red Wings missing the net. Well, maybe there's no room to 
shoot at. Patrick is so solid. His positioning is so good that it's 
tough to see the mesh behind number 33.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there has been one thing that can give the Red Wings fits in  
the playoffs, it seems to be a goalie who can all but stand on his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, seeking its third straight Stanley Cup championship,  
has been fairly loaded with talent for several years now. But in 
1994, Irbe was spectacular in goal and the San Jose Sharks booted 
the Red Wings in seven games -- in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur helped the New Jersey Devils sweep Detroit in the 1995  
Cup finals, and Roy sent the Red Wings packing after six games in 
1996 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Goaltending is the most important position in hockey,''  
Colorado forward Joe Sakic said. ``When you have the best one, it 
makes it a lot easier on everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, here is Roy again.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been outstanding,'' said Colorado forward Jeff Odgers,  
who scored his first goal of these playoffs Sunday. ``He's the kind 
of guy that when he makes up his mind that he's going to do 
something, he says, `Listen, boys, this is the way it's going to 
be.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Patty is he'll say it and he'll lead by  
example. If you don't go out there and give it your all, you're not 
only letting the team down, you're letting him down because he 
gives such a great effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your goaltender is playing as well as Patty is, it gives  
everyone else confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been three years since the Red Wings have been on the  
brink of elimination, dating back to the 1996 Western Conference 
finals against Colorado. Down 3-1, the Red Wings rallied to win 
Game 5, but the Avs won Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit had advanced that year only because Yzerman scored in  
double-overtime in Game 7 of a second-round series against St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes when a goalie is hot, you try and be too perfect on  
your shots,'' said Detroit forward Brendan Shanahan, who missed the 
net on a breakaway in Game 5. ``You end up missing the net and you 
pass up opportunities to shoot and look for the easy tap-in goal 
with a pass. We can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are attempting to become the first team to win  
three successive Cup championships since the New York Islanders won 
four straight between 1980-83.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Chrysler To Answer EU Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG will respond in  
writing by mid-June to the European Union's allegations that it 
violated antitrust rules by preventing dealerships in some European 
countries from selling to non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-chairman Juergen Schrempp told the group's annual  
shareholders meeting that the company had not engaged in illegal 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no overall strategy to hinder cross-border sales to  
consumers, as the EU Commission claims,'' Schrempp said. ``We have 
always actively promoted the adherence to those rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged infringements took place in Belgium, the  
Netherlands, Spain and Germany from 1985-1996, before last year's 
takeover of Chrysler Corp. by Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Car companies in Europe regularly price the same cars  
differently in different countries to conform to local market 
conditions, prompting bargain-hunters to cross borders to buy their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The pricing practice is legal under EU rules but automakers  
frown on it because they end up losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp said that the EU allegations concerned only 10  
individual cases that occured in a period of more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have investigated most of the cases and are able to prove  
that these were business transactions with non-authorized 
resellers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, the EU fined rival Volkswagen AG $111 million  
for allegedly preventing German and Austrian customers from buying 
VW autos in Italy. VW has appealed the fine.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Welfare Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A U.S. Supreme Court ruling that  
thwarts state plans to provide lower welfare payments to new 
residents is a welcome message to the needy, advocates for the poor 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``California and other states now can take down their `Poor  
People Keep Out' signs,'' said Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's 7-2 decision Monday dashed the plans of California  
and 14 other states, and was a defeat for Congress and the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling in a case involving three newly arrived California  
residents, the court said the state's desire to limit their welfare 
payments would violate their constitutional right to travel. 
Although the word ``travel'' is not in the Constitution, the 
freedom to move from one state to another has long been considered 
a bedrock right. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state's legitimate interest in saving money provides no  
justification for its decision to discriminate among equally 
eligible citizens,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the  
right to choose to be citizens of the state wherein they reside,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	California's policy, enacted in 1992 but never enforced because  
of lower court rulings, would have given people who lived in the 
state for less than a year only the amount of welfare they would 
have received in their previous home state. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a mother and one child are eligible for $456 a  
month in California but only $275 in neighboring Arizona. The 
policy would have limited the California monthly benefits to $275 
for such a family's first year in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was unlikely to have a major effect on state budgets,  
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, the law was aimed at trimming roughly $11 million  
from the state's $2.9 billion annual welfare budget. Gov. Gray 
Davis, who supported the law, nonetheless had budgeted the money 
for this year in case the high court ruled the way it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not wild about the ruling, but I don't think it's going to  
create a problem,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Jack Madden, a spokesman for the state Office of  
Temporary Disability Assistance, said a similar law has been on the 
books for several years but was never implemented because of 
questions about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is unlikely to mean an increase for many Georgia  
recipients because the state's benefits are among the nation's 
lowest, said Joyce Goldberg of the Georgia Department of Human 
Resources. Georgia provides up to $280 per month for a family of 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	In the California case, three women had moved to the state to  
escape abusive family situations in Louisiana, Oklahoma and 
Colorado. The lawsuit said the limits on their benefits, coupled 
with California's high cost of living, could deprive them of the 
basic necessities of life.

<HEADLINE> Crude Down on Fear of Big Supplies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude and its products tumbled in futures trading Tuesday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange as investors bet weekly inventory 
figures would show supplies will be ample going into the peak 
summer demand period. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures rose sharply, while corn  
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude tumbled 5 percent, to its lowest levels in five weeks as  
market participants bet the American Petroleum Institute would 
report inventories last week grew as much as 2.5 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	World oil producers apparently have made good on their promises  
to cut output sharply beginning in April, but some of the major 
refiners have responded to rising crude prices by cutting back on 
their suddenly less profitable runs. Analysts say the refiner 
cutbacks likely have negated some of the effects of the producer 
cutbacks, although it is too early to determine how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, gasoline inventories appear to be ample going into the  
peak American driving season, which begins Memorial Day and lasts 
through Labor Day. Supplies have increased in four of the past five 
weeks, making inventories 3 percent higher than year-ago levels. 
Demand, meantime, has been weaker than it was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for June delivery fell 84 cents, or 4.6 percent, to  
$17.10 a barrel. June unleaded gasoline fell 1.93 cents to 49.15 
cents a gallon. June heating oil fell 1.99 cents to 40.40 cents a 
gallon. June natural gas fell 8.3 cents to $2.260 for each 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York as Brazil heads into more dicey winter growing months. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say temperatures will fall much below-normal in  
major growing regions, although they are unlikely to produce a 
freeze. Sustained freezing temperatures could damage coffee trees, 
particularly younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices typically become volatile at this time of year  
since Brazil is the world's largest grower. Some speculators are 
betting Brazil cannot have a third consecutive year of mild 
temperatures that have led to bumper harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally came despite a prediction from Brazil's government  
that farmers in the 2000-2001 harvest could harvest 40 million bags 
of coffee, easily topping its latest harvest, the biggest in 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee rose 7.5 cents to $1.169 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures retreated on the Chicago Board of Trade after the  
U.S. Agriculture Department reported 77 percent of corn acreage 
already has been planted, up 1 percent over last year and 9 percent 
over the five-year average. 
</P>
<P>
	The report dashed hopes that heavy recent rains would reduce the  
amount of corn acreage, at a time when global demand remains in the 
doldrums and inventories remain relatively large. Farmers typically 
have until June to get crops into the ground; later planting 
increases the risk of damage from early frost. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were pressured by National Weather Service  
forecasts for warm weather and normal to below-normal rainfall in 
Midwest growing regions over the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	July corn fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.21 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Suit Filed in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The family of a black woman shot by police  
while in her car filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the officers, 
claiming they rejoiced at her killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Riverside officers who shot 19-year-old Tyisha Miller  
on Dec. 28 were ``high-fiving each other in joy and glee,'' lawyer 
Johnnie Cochran told a news conference in announcing the filing of 
a federal civil rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the police, which include a fifth officer who was  
present at the shooting, have denied the charges. An investigation 
by the Riverside district attorney concluded that police were 
justified in using deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the police department nor the officers' lawyer returned  
calls seeking comment Tuesday. The lawsuit also names the city of 
Riverside as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller was apparently unconscious in a car at a gas station  
in Riverside, a community 60 miles east of Los Angeles, with the 
doors locked and a gun in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers responded to a 911 call from her cousin, and found Ms.  
Miller unresponsive, lying on the fully reclined driver's seat. 
They were unable to awaken her by shouting, banging the windows, 
shining lights or shaking the car, according to District Attorney 
Grover Trask. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers broke a window and tried to remove the gun, but  
shot her 12 times when she suddenly sat up and reached for the 
weapon, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran charged the officers yelled racial epithets and  
obscenities before and after shooting the woman. He said he based 
his allegations on information from an unidentified witness he said 
he presented to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and state attorney general are conducting separate  
investigations into possible civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and claims wrongful death,  
assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, 
violation of civil rights, conspiracy with racial animus, and a 
range of negligence.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Maps Cuts in Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are planning bills that would cut  
spending for the environment, education and other traditional 
Democratic priorities by billions of dollars next year, setting up 
months of conflict with President Clinton and among lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee, living within spending  
limits imposed by the 1997 balanced-budget pact, meets Wednesday to 
divide $538 billion among 13 bills covering all government 
agencies. That figure is nearly a third of the entire federal 
budget, including everything but automatic payments like Medicare 
benefits and interest to bond holders. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's plans, obtained by The Associated Press, map  
bills with domestic cuts so deep that even many Republicans wonder 
how they will ever be approved by the GOP-controlled Congress, let 
alone get signed by Clinton without a headline-grabbing veto fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The early reports about the Republican plan suggest their 2000  
budget is simply not tenable,'' said Sylvia Mathews, the White 
House deputy budget director. ``The level of cuts it would require 
would do enormous harm to critical areas that Americans care deeply 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy,'' said House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think of this as a placeholder, and hopefully we'll get''  
more money later, said Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., whose 
Appropriations subcommittee oversees labor, education and health 
programs that would be among those getting the deepest cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under GOP plans, Porter's bill would get $78.1 billion, $10.7  
billion less than this year. That measure is home to schools, job 
training and other programs that produce annual battles between 
Democrats and Republicans, and the proposed cut assures a nasty 
partisan fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other three, always controversial domestic spending  
bills, the committee would spend $30.5 billion for the Commerce, 
Justice and State departments, $2.8 billion less than this year; 
$11.3 billion for the Interior Department, or $2.7 billion less; 
and $66.2 billion for the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban 
Development departments, the Environmental Protection Agency and 
other agencies, $5.8 billion below this year's level. 
</P>
<P>
	These committee figures do not include additional billions in  
so-called emergency spending enacted this year -- money that does 
not count against spending limits. Even with that extra money, 
however, the fiscal 2000 bills come up short compared with this 
year, and even shorter compared with the amounts Clinton would like 
to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other, smaller domestic spending bills have just  
minor differences between GOP plans for 2000 and actual totals from 
the current year. Several of them could become law with relatively 
little controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one indicator of the pressure on Republicans to exceed  
spending limits, a bill approved Friday by the Appropriations 
panel's Treasury-Postal Service subcommittee totaled $13.7 billion 
-- more than $140 million above the amount leaders plan for that 
subcommittee to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the budget-balancing deal, an escalating, annual series of  
savings was planned in an effort to eliminate what looked like a 
parade of unending federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beginning of this year, many Democrats and some  
Republicans have said this year's spending limit would have to be 
breached because the required savings are too tough. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders have continued to insist publicly that  
the so-called spending caps must be obeyed. The Senate's spending 
plans are similar to the House's, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should stay within the caps,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a brief interview. ``We knew the 
caps would pinch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To spend beyond those limits means using the federal surplus,  
and that would mean spending Social Security surpluses Republicans 
have promised not to spend or leaving less money available to pay 
for the tax cut. Cutting taxes and protecting Social Security are 
both major GOP priorities, and jeopardizing either would outrage 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how Republicans plan to move all 13 annual  
spending bills through Congress without prompting a veto fight with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP aides said their strategy calls for spending weeks this  
summer focusing on the message that Republicans are honoring 
spending limits to protect Social Security and tax cuts. The goal 
is to identify the GOP with those goals, and to ensure that in the 
likelihood that the spending caps are broken, Clinton and 
congressional Democrats are to blame.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Title Eludes Columbine Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- One month after 12 classmates and  
teacher were slain, the Columbine High School girl's soccer team 
bid for a state championship was thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand fans filled the stands at the Englewood High  
School stadium to cheer on the Columbine team that had dedicated 
its season to the victims of the shooting attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fans was Patrick Ireland, a student who was shot in  
the April 20 attack. Ireland gained nationwide attention when 
television cameras caught him trying to escape from a window in the 
second-floor library, where most of the killings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all very confident and we were able to joke around  
before the game,'' said Columbine co-captain Angie Portincaso. ``We 
were sure we were going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Liz Wagner scored twice to lead the Green Mountain Rams over  
the Rebels 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	After the loss, the crowd gave the team a standing ovation.  
</P>
<P>
	Two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, stormed into  
Columbine High School at lunchtime April 20, killing the 12 
students and a teacher before turning their guns on themselves.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Fears Cut IRS Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- IRS enforcement actions aimed at collecting  
unpaid taxes have slowed drastically, partly because employees fear 
being fired under a new law that broadly boosted taxpayer rights, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few people are going to take the risk that if you make a  
mistake you'll be fired,'' said Robert Tobias, president of the 
National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 92,000 IRS 
workers. ``As a result, there is very little collection activity 
taking place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service seized property for overdue taxes  
108 times in the six months that ended March 31, compared with 
1,150 during the same span last year and 5,000 seizures two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnishments of wages and levies on bank accounts dropped to  
458,000 in the most recent six months from 1.8 million two years 
ago, while liens on property dropped from 272,000 to 98,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the IRS has relaxed requirements for  
installment agreements to pay off taxes and for 
``offers-in-compromise'' for taxpayers who have no hope of paying a 
large bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower enforcement statistics, first reported Tuesday in The  
New York Times, stem in part from a tight budget, complex 
procedural changes mandated by the new law that stopped some 
actions and shifting of employees temporarily to new duties, such 
as answering telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials acknowledged, however, that fear of new taxpayer  
protection laws was an equal factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interpretation of how it is actually going to work has  
been a real problem,'' said John Dalrymple, IRS chief operations 
officer. ``Initially, we were not as sensitive as to how much 
anxiety about this there was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The section of the law at issue increased penalties for 10  
offenses so that firing is immediate and cannot be appealed. 
Dismissal requires that the conduct be willful and involve such 
things as failing to obtain required approval for a property 
seizure, violating a taxpayer's constitutional rights, falsifying 
or destroying documents and concealing information from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a March memo to all IRS employees, Commissioner Charles  
Rossotti assured them they will get adequate training to adhere to 
the 1998 reform law and that their rights as workers won't be 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo from Rossotti includes ``important reminders'' for  
employees, the first of which stress the primacy of taxpayer rights 
and fair treatment of IRS workers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobias said no one has been fired under the new rules, and no  
action has been initiated that could lead to a dismissal. He gave 
the IRS credit for moving slowly so that proper training can occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, they would have rushed the regs into the field  
and called it a day,'' he said. ``One of the reasons for the delay 
is that the IRS is trying to get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dalrymple said it was too soon to tell if the IRS reform law  
will permanently reduce the agency's ability to collect unpaid 
taxes and deter cheaters. He noted that in 1970, a Supreme Court 
case led to a one-year halt in certain property seizures while the 
IRS figured out how to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a bill this large, it's real possible there  
will be consequences no one thought of,'' he said. ``It's not time 
to panic yet.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes $15B Kosovo Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House easily approved a $15 billion  
package Tuesday to pay for the bombing in Yugoslavia, recovery from 
killer storms in the Caribbean and the United States and a host of 
home-state projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 269-158. Majorities of both parties supported the  
measure, despite anger from conservatives over its cost and from 
liberals over its military spending and environmental provisions. 
Senate passage was possible by Wednesday, and President Clinton's 
signature was all but assured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to fight for special interests,'' House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told his colleagues, referring to 
complaints about some provisions. ``It's a time for Congress to 
promote the national interest. And this bill serves, in my opinion, 
the national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the package -- $12 billion -- covers U.S. costs of  
NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia, aid to refugees and to Balkan 
countries sheltering them, and extra money for weapons, training 
and other Pentagon accounts. Clinton wanted half that amount, but 
Republicans said the extra money was needed to rebuild armed 
services the president has allowed to wither. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's remarks, made early in the debate, spotlighted the  
leadership's determination to approve the bill, in contrast to his 
passive performance last month when the House refused to back the 
air war. Even so, opponents of U.S. policy in the Balkans spoke 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This war is rapidly becoming a debacle that rivals Vietnam  
itself,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill will be paid for from this year's expected $111  
billion federal surplus, which will come from Social Security. 
Because the GOP has pledged repeatedly to leave the pension 
program's surpluses alone, some conservatives soured on the 
package, citing projects they said should have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money for reindeer?'' said Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, referring  
to one provision. ``I mean, is Santa in trouble?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The package claims close to $2 billion in savings, to be used to  
cover part of the costs. Of that, drafters claim $1.3 billion in 
savings through cuts in food stamp money, but it would not have 
been spent anyway because the strong economy has cut back on the 
number of food stamp recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the wide-ranging measure had something for almost every  
lawmaker to dislike, it had broad appeal, partly because few 
legislators want to oppose money for troops during wartime. 
Underlining that, Congress added $1.8 billion to improve military 
pay and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contained $1 billion for a recent spate of  
hard-hitting natural disasters, chiefly last autumn's Hurricane 
Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	That storm -- considered the worst in the hemisphere's history --  
ravaged Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica, killing 
thousands and destroying hundreds of thousands of homes and 
businesses. Clinton requested the money in February, but lawmakers 
were in little hurry to approve it until it became a convenient 
vehicle for rushing the military funds through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $900 million would replenish the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency's budget so it can pay for this month's horrific 
tornadoes in Oklahoma and other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has $574 million to help American farmers,  
especially those facing low prices for hogs, wheat and other 
commodities. That included $70 million to help livestock producers, 
which was amended by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska, to include reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens and Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, got $26 million to  
buy out fishermen, processors and others in the commercial fishing 
industry in Glacier Bay National Park. In exchange, he dropped an 
effort to derail plans to phase out fishing there. 
</P>
<P>
	Western lawmakers won delays in plans to boost royalties for oil  
companies drilling on public lands and to toughen controls on 
mining on federal properties. Another would allow expanded milling 
sites, which critics say are badly polluted, at the Crown Jewel 
gold mine in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for Republicans and governors, the bill forbids the  
government from claiming any of a $246 billion legal settlement 
states have reached with the tobacco industry. Clinton wanted to 
use some of the money for federal anti-smoking and health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A stew of other provisions made the final package that had  
nothing to do with Kosovo or storms but everything to do with 
legislators attaching pet provisions onto a must-pass bill. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and House Majority  
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, each would be entitled to an additional 
$333,000 annually for office expenses. The Senate would be allowed 
to spend $10 million to bring 3,000 Russian political leaders to 
the United States for a month of observing the U.S. government and 
economy at work. 
</P>
<P>
	There was $6.5 million to monitor elections in East Timor, which  
is deciding whether to break free of Indonesia; $2.2 million for 
Utah to build sewers for the 2002 Winter Olympics; and $1.5 million 
to add water to the drought-stricken San Carlos Lake in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	An unspecified sum was provided to ferry families of victims of  
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 to the planned trial in the 
Netherlands of two Libyans suspected of downing the plane.

<HEADLINE> Feds Might End Sugar Price Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several lawmakers are pushing to phase out a  
federal price support program for sugar, the latest in a yearly 
fight over the price of candy bars, sodas and other sugary sweets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the sugar daddy of corporate welfare,'' said Rep. Dan  
Miller, R-Fla. ``It costs consumers a billion dollars a year. It's 
bad for companies that use a lot of sugar. It's bad economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is long overdue for an overhaul,'' said Rep.  
George Miller, D-Calif. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has 
introduced a Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a government loan rate program for sugar that  
amounts to a price support. The loan rate sets a floor under U.S. 
sugar prices, keeping them at about twice the world price. 
Currently, the world price for sugar is below 5 cents a pound while 
the U.S. price is 22 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have tried several times to end the program but each  
year the opposition to any repeal grows. 
</P>
<P>
	The present sugar program ``ensures a high domestic price for  
sugar far in excess of world prices,'' said Tom Schatz, president 
of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sugar program costs consumers at least $1.2 billion in  
higher costs for sugar and sugar-containing products,'' Schatz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar industry leaders complained that the proposal would crush  
sugar producers at a time when American farmers are struggling from 
low prices, particularly in the grain sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing is kicking American farmers while they're  
down,'' said Jack Roney, director of economics and policy analysis 
for the American Sugar Alliance.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Allows British Sex Slang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's film censors will permit a British  
slang term for sexual intercourse to remain in the title of a spy 
film being released next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Film Censors today announced that the word  
``shagged'' would be allowed to stay in the title of the movie, 
``The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Warner Bros. film is the sequel to the 1997 spoof, ``Austin  
Powers: International Man of Mystery.'' It opens June 24 in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a reversal for the film board, who last week  
said the word would have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The censors changed their minds after watching the film's  
trailer and deciding that ``the title does not reflect the contents 
of the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's educated Singaporeans are more mature and discerning  
enough to see the humor in it,'' the board said in a letter printed 
today in The Straits Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Sex is allowed in movies in Singapore that are considered  
``art,'' but those films ban anyone under 21 from attending. Movies 
for general distribution have nude scenes cut and offensive words 
spliced out.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Twins Enter NHL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Daniel and Henrik Sedin, the Swedish twins who are among the top  
prospects eligible this year, have decided to enter the NHL draft 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	International Management Group, which represents the Sedins,  
said the 18-year-olds who played on the Swedish national team this 
year, will make themselves available for the June 26 draft. 
</P>
<P>

Elite League, have played together all their lives. Both are 
considered prospects to be taken in the top ten of the draft.

	Their agent, Michael Barnett, said in a statement that they

<HEADLINE> Serb Soldiers Being Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Two Serb soldiers held as prisoners of  
war by the U.S. military in Germany were flying to Hungary today to 
be turned over to Yugoslav officials at the border, a Red Cross 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephane Hankins of the International Red Cross in Budapest,  
Hungary, confirmed that the two Yugoslav prisoners had been 
released and were on a flight to Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers were flying aboard a U.S. military plane. Later,  
they will be taken to the border south of Szeged, Hungary, by ICRC 
officials and handed back to Yugoslav authorities, the Red Cross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Germany, a Red Cross official met in private with  
each soldier and confirmed that they want to be released and go 
back to Yugoslavia, ICRC spokesman Urs Boegli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Sgt. Beth Alber, a spokeswoman for the U.S.  
European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, announced the release was 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the release,  
citing Geneva Convention rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The freeing of the Serb soldiers followed the release earlier  
this month of three U.S. Army soldiers captured March 31 along the 
Kosovo-Macedonia border, but there was no indication of any link 
between the two releases. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Serbs were turned over the U.S. military authorities in  
Albania by the Kosovo Liberation Army. They were flown from Albania 
to Germany where they were visited by ICRC representatives, in 
accordance with the Geneva Convention on treatment of POWs. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have frequently contrasted their strict  
compliance with the Geneva Convention with the actions of Yugoslav 
authorities who held the three U.S. soldiers as POWs for 32 days in 
Serbia. The Americans were denied access to Red Cross officials for 
weeks and were not allowed to communicate with their families. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Serbs was taken prisoner April 16, the other about  
two weeks later, Alber said.

	Barak Ousts Netanyahu in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Winning a crushing victory over  
hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barak promised 
today to forge a secure peace with the Palestinians, pull troops 
out of Lebanon in a year and heal the deep divisions among 
Israelis. After three years at Israel's helm, a tearful Netanyahu 
gracefully conceded defeat and said he would step down as leader of 
his Likud party. In an emotional speech, Barak, Israel's most 
decorated soldier, promised tens of thousands of supporters that he 
would continue the path of peace forged by former Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- New concerns about President Boris Yeltsin's  
health arose today after he apparently canceled a meeting with the 
Spanish prime minister. Yeltsin was at his country residence at 
Rus, 75 miles outside Moscow, the Kremlin said. Asked about 
Yeltsin's health, presidential aides said they had no information. 
Yeltsin was supposed to have met with Spanish Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar at the Kremlin, but the aides denied such a meeting was 
ever scheduled.

	Child Pornography Banned in Japan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's lower house of Parliament today banned the  
production and sale of child pornography and outlawed sex with a 
minor, answering mounting criticism over the country's lax 
sex-crime laws. The measure has been approved by the upper house, 
so today's vote made it law. The Justice Ministry said the new 
restrictions will take effect sometime in the fall. The vote 
follows growing international criticism that Japanese inaction on 
sex tourism and Internet child pornography was allowing the crimes 
to persist at home and abroad.

	Clinton Seeks Mideast Peace Deal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Encouraged by Ehud Barak's wide margin of  
victory, President Clinton is calling on Israel's newly elected 
prime minister to pursue land-for-peace accords with the 
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon. Clinton said yesterday that was 
the path to security for Israel and that he intended to work 
energetically with Barak to reach those goals. Interpreting Barak's 
easy victory over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as ``a strong 
mandate,'' Clinton made clear in a statement issued by the White 
House that he expected the conciliatory, new Israeli leader to 
pursue ``a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blocked last year by President Clinton,  
Republicans are trying again to give tax breaks to parents who send 
their children to private schools or teach at home. Clinton vetoed 
a similar bill in 1998 amid strong opposition by Democrat-aligned 
teacher unions. This year, Republicans added sweeteners such as tax 
incentives to finance school construction that appeal to Democrats 
and could help the GOP override a potential veto.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 9 million American children must  
deal with numerous adverse family conditions that rob them of their 
ability to become ``productive, adult participants in the 
mainstream of America's future,'' according to a survey released 
today. About one in seven children face at least four risk factors 
affecting their chance for success. Among them: growing up in a 
single-parent household or with parents who lack a high-school 
education or who do not have full-time jobs. The other risk factors 
are living in poverty, relying on welfare and lacking health 
insurance.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 16.52 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Tuesday as the Federal Reserve  
served notice to financial markets that inflation, while currently 
a glimmer in the continuing economic boom, could mean higher 
interest rates in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed left rates unchanged during a meeting of its  
policy-making Open Market Committee, but it warned that rates are 
likely to rise if long-quiet inflation reawakens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled as much as 112 points  
in the hour following the Fed's announcement, but recovered to 
close down 16.52 at 10,836.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell, although they also regained  
ground late in the session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 
6.17 to 1,333.32, and the Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.48 to 
close at 2,558.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks tumbled even though the Fed announcement was largely  
expected. Cyclical stocks, which rise and fall on the fortunes of 
the U.S. economy, pulled the Dow down from an early 77-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it's an indication of how nervous the market  
is,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
``We're at lofty levels, and it doesn't take much to make people 
lose their nerve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market players had anticipated that the Fed would at least issue  
a warning about higher rates since last Friday, when a jump in the 
consumer price index increased worries about inflation. Higher 
interest rates can put the brakes on an economy that's growing too 
fast, but they also deplete corporate earnings as it becomes more 
expensive for companies to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's announcement initially pushed bond prices lower as  
well. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, at 5.85 percent before the 
announcement, quickly rose to 5.89 percent before settling back at 
5.88. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market has already anticipated a rate rise, so this  
was a non-event,'' said Steven Goldman, market strategist with 
Weeden &AMP; Co. in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	While many investors spent Tuesday on the sidelines, waiting for  
word from the Fed, strong earnings reports from retailers and 
computer giant Hewlett-Packard stimulated buying in a number of 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney rose 4 7/16 to close at 50 1/8 after the company said  
it plans to outsource its credit card business and to offer a 
separate stock for its Eckerd drugstore business. The department 
store chain also reported first-quarter earnings that topped 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot rose 11/16 to 59 1/8 after it released earnings that  
beat Wall Street estimates by 4 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard rose for a second straight session after it  
reported a 34 percent increase in second-quarter profits. Its stock 
rose 7 1/4 to close at 96, buoying the Dow throughout the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news from Hewlett-Packard turned attention toward Dell  
Computer, an industry bellwether that typically beats earnings 
expectations. Dell rose 13/16 to 44 1/16 before releasing results 
after the close of trading that just matched analyst expectations. 
Dell tumbled in after-hours trading and appeared likely to fall 
when the market opened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said Tuesday's moderate volume indicated investors were  
taking time to digest the Fed's action. NYSE consolidated volume 
totaled 917.30 million shares, compared to 821.78 million in 
Monday's sluggish session. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
NYSE, with 1,611 down, 1,369 up and 563 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.73 to 634.19, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.22 to 782.72. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.10 to 442.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.26 percent.  
European indexes ended mostly higher as Germany's DAX index rose 
1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 0.7 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 ended up 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad Mulls De La Hoya Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Felix Trinidad has a $10 million offer to fight  
Oscar De La Hoya -- and not much time to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Bob Arum says he will withdraw his offer to Trinidad  
for a Sept. 18 unification bout with De La Hoya if the IBF 
welterweight champion doesn't accept it by 8 p.m. EDT Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Trinidad doesn't agree, Arum said De La Hoya will go ahead  
with a rematch against Ike Quartey on the same date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone to the limit,'' Arum said. ``We really want to make  
this fight. I think Don King wants to make this fight. But it looks 
like Trinidad's father doesn't want to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum sent King, Trinidad's promoter, a letter last week offering  
the $10 million plus $6.00 for every home above 1 million that buys 
the fight on pay-per-view for a fight that would unify Trinidad's 
title with the WBC 147-pound title held by De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said Tuesday he hasn't heard back from King, and is making  
plans to substitute Quartey for Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a situation where I'm offering him more than anybody  
who has ever fought Oscar has gotten,'' Arum said. ``For the 
opportunity to beat De La Hoya and become the premier welterweight 
in the world, I really should be charging the guy instead of paying 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father, Felix Trinidad Sr., said last week he wasn't  
happy with the $10 million offer and suggested that Trinidad would 
not fight De La Hoya for that purse. 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz said Tuesday that King wants to make  
the fight and will pursue a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya defends his title Saturday night against Oba Carr,  
and Arum said he would have Quartey at the fight to announce a 
rematch of their Feb. 21 fight if Trinidad doesn't agree to the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quartey is ready to get on a flight and come here,'' Arum  
said. ``He's waiting for my call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad defends his title against Hugo Pineda on May 29 in  
Puerto Rico, and Arum's offer is contingent on both fighters 
winning their bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is 34-0 with 29 knockouts while De La Hoya is 30-0 with  
24 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Former Ark. Gov. Must Pay for Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker has four  
years to pay the federal government $1 million for conspiring to 
dodge taxes through a sham bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, who pleaded guilty in February 1998, also was sentenced  
Monday to four years of probation and 832 hours of community 
service. He plans to appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Tucker hid the value of a cable TV business he  
sold in 1988. If its real value had been known, Tucker and business 
partner William Marks would have been liable for an additional $2.9 
million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no tax loss to the government that I benefited  
from,'' Tucker said after sentencing, arguing that the government 
owed him federal income tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Stephen Reasoner also ordered Tucker to pay  
a $6,000 fine and said the $1 million restitution must be paid 
before his probation ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's business dealings came under scrutiny as part of the  
federal investigation into the Whitewater land deal, a failed 
development in which President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
were investors. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 18 months of home detention after being convicted of  
fraud and conspiracy with James and Susan McDougal, Clinton's 
former business partners. Tucker had lied to arrange nearly $3 
million in fraudulent loans, prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	He is fighting to have that conviction overturned, saying a  
juror was biased against him. As part of his plea bargain in the 
cable case, prosecutors will not retry him if his initial 
conviction is thrown out.

<HEADLINE> Mich. School Massacre Plot Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Four teen-agers met under a bridge and  
hatched a plan for a massacre at their middle school that was to be 
deadlier than the attack in Colorado last month, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan included buying weapons they could use to steal more  
and raping girls at Holland Woods Middle School, prosecutor Michael 
Wendling said Tuesday at the arraignment for two 13-year-old 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a calculated plan. Their were maps obtained and there  
was discussion in relation to the maps as to how this incident 
would take place,'' Wendling told the judge. ``The goal was to kill 
more people than in Columbine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boys had picked a specific time for the attack and had a hit  
list of intended victims among the faculty and students, Wendling 
said. Police say they arrested the boys May 12 after classmates 
reported the plot to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief William Corbett said the plan was concocted during  
a meeting under the Blue Water Bridge that connects this city 60 
miles northeast of Detroit with Sarnia, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 13-year-olds -- Daniel Fick and Jonathan McDonald -- and two  
14-year-olds -- Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo -- face adult 
charges of conspiracy to commit premeditated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the 14-year-olds would automatically draw life  
prison sentences without possibility of parole, while a judge would 
have the option of giving the 13-year-olds a lesser sentence. All 
four were ordered held on $100,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the school board, David Devendorf, pleaded for  
the 13-year-olds to be kept in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents and the children of this community are afraid --  
they are very afraid,'' Devendorf said. ``You cannot believe the 
fear out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12,000-student district closed all 21 schools Friday after a  
pipe bomb was found near Holland Woods on Thursday night, and 
reopened them Monday under tight security. Corbett said police were 
still investigating who left the bomb, saying he did not know if 
there was a connection with the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of schools across the country have faced bomb threats and  
other copycat crimes following the April 20 massacre at Columbine 
High School in Littleton, Colo., in which 15 people, including the 
two gunmen, died. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan's attorney, Frank Mitchell, argued unsuccessfully for a  
low bond, saying the Colorado massacre had created a climate of 
``hysteria.'' He said his client's record was clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``His only problem at the school was talking in class and  
running in the halls,'' Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel's attorney, Steve Guilliat, said his client also had a  
clean record. ``Based on what's on paper, this is not a bad kid,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Keeps Entertainers' Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is keeping $18,575 worth of  
gifts he received during 1998, including golf clubs, paintings, a 
couple of saxophones and the 100 greatest films of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's financial disclosure report for 1998 reveals many of  
the gifts he is keeping were from celebrities. The report was 
released Monday just after Clinton returned from a West Coast trip, 
where he gently prodded a dinner audience of top Hollywood figures 
to try to clean up the gory scenes depicted in films and television 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The gifts Clinton kept included a film cel from director Steven  
Spielberg's ``Animaniacs'' and a collection of the top 100 movies 
selected by the American Film Institute -- classics ranging from 
``Citizen Kane'' and ``From Here to Eternity'' to ``Forrest Gump'' 
and ``Pulp Fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife, Hillary, also counted as a gift the  
$2.6 million in legal fees paid by The Clinton Legal Expense Trust. 
That money went toward legal debts that, at their highest point in 
1998, ranged between $2 million and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, the Clintons held assets worth between $1.2 million  
and $5.5 million, the majority of which was in a blind trust owned 
by Mrs. Clinton. A White House official familiar with the first 
family's finances said the actual amount in the trust was closer to 
the lower end of the range. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, reported 1998  
assets of between $1.4 million and $1.7 million, including 
properties the vice president owns in Arlington, Va. and Carthage, 
Tenn., his salary and various family bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Clintons reported assets of up to $5.8 million, and  
in 1996, they reported assets ranging from $760,000 to $1.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the first family reported keeping $14,988 worth of  
personal gifts received in 1997. They included a cashmere shawl 
from designer Vera Wang and a set of leather-bound books from Oprah 
Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons kept cashmere this year, too: a sweater coat from  
Mongolia valued at $395. And the president has no excuse for 
playing bad saxophone -- he received music books and two of the 
instruments (value: $3,000) from Thomas Ernst of Germany, as well 
as a collection of compact discs and a photograph ($700) from jazz 
saxophonist Kenny G. 
</P>
<P>
	Other gifts included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Three golf drivers from Rudy Durand and actor Jack Nicholson,  
$1,377. 
</P>
<P>
	--A signed bat and Chicago Cubs jersey from slugger Sammy Sosa,  
$300. 
</P>
<P>
	--A framed Doonesbury cartoon inscribed by Garry Trudeau, from  
political consultant Robert Squier, $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	--A first-edition copy of ``Welcome to the Monkey House'' from  
Harvey Weinstein, $750. 
</P>
<P>
	--A framed oil painting from singer Carly Simon, $300.  
</P>
<P>
	--A videotape collection of AFI's top 100 movies, from Sumner  
Redstone of New York, $1,750. 
</P>
<P>
	--A portable DVD player and three movie discs from Tom Campbell  
of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., $1,019. 
</P>
<P>
	--A framed photo of the president and first lady from Hollywood  
mogul Lew Wasserman, $350. 
</P>
<P>
	--An oil painting titled ``The Lawmakers,'' from Paul Montrone of  
Hampton Falls, N.H. $2,000.

<HEADLINE> Student-Built Satellite in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A newly launched satellite built by Boston  
University students to create 3-D images of the outer part of the 
atmosphere was in danger of running out of power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terriers satellite failed to fully orient its solar panel to  
face the sun and was relying on batteries that can last eight hours 
without recharging. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was ``potentially serious,'' the National  
Aeronautics and Space Administration said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers and an unrelated small defense communications satellite  
were launched late Monday on an Orbital Sciences Corp. Pegasus 
rocket dropped from a jumbo jet flying off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	All seemed well when the 274-pound Terriers made its first pass  
over the Boston University ground station early Tuesday. On the 
second pass about 1 1/2 hours later controllers noticed it was not 
properly oriented to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third pass controllers sent commands to reorient the  
spacecraft. Whether the commands worked was not expected to be 
known until sometime today, university spokeswoman Shauna LaFauci 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers was developed under a NASA program to increase  
students' access to space. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the work on the satellite was done at Boston University  
and a ground station was established there so students could 
control the craft as it gathered data on the ionosphere, the region 
of electrically charged gases in the upper atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Crashes Take Toll in Indy Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mike Borkowski began to spin, then he saw  
the wall approaching, almost in slow motion, and knew there was 
nothing he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, rookie.  
</P>
<P>
	``It felt really good for the first couple of laps, and I was  
just getting up to speed,'' Borkowski said after a hard hit against 
the second-turn wall on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash took him by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's very strange is it was very late in the corner, not  
where the car is on its full limits,'' he said. ``It just kind of 
came around all of a sudden like a real lazy, slow spin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Borkowski learned what veterans such as Scott Harrington and  
Billy Boat -- who also crashed -- should have known. The 2 1/2-mile 
track is not very forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much margin here,'' Borkowski said. ``Once a car  
comes around a little bit, you're sort of done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wrecks brought to four the three-day practice total. Boat  
also crashed Sunday, giving him four Indy practice mishaps since 
his rookie year of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Borkowski, 25, who was the SCCA Trans-Am rookie of the year in  
1997 and competed last season in Indy Lights for Team Rahal, is 
driving for the low-budget PDM Racing and looking for his first 
Indy Racing League start. 
</P>
<P>
	But without a backup, his hopes of qualifying Saturday or Sunday  
depend on how quickly his crew can repair the damage to the left 
side of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, in my career, I haven't crashed very much,'' he  
said. ``But you're going so fast, your brain learns to slow things 
down so what you see is a 2-second crash I could probably describe 
for 20 minutes. I remember every little detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his immediate reaction was to get angry, then worry  
about damage to the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel OK physically,'' Borkowski said. ``I just feel very bad  
for my guys. They've been working very hard and we're not a 
big-dollar team, so this was tough for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington bounced off the third-turn wall, hit it again as he  
went through the corner, made 2 1/2 spins and stopped in the middle of 
the fourth turn. Boat went into the wall coming out of the third 
turn and stopped in the north chute between turns 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Reigning Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever, who has worked with  
rookies as a car owner-driver the past three years, was watching a 
Speedway television monitor when Harrington crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he tells his drivers about safety, Cheever said, ``I  
tell them, `Crashing is not an option. Don't even consider it.' 
They have to leave themselves enough room until they understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever has been a practitioner of his own words, having crashed  
in practice at Indy only once in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very hard wall, and if you spin you could kill  
yourself, or nothing could happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boat wasn't sure what caused the latest crash. But he was upset  
about his equipment, and believes wrecks only make it more 
difficult for both driver and team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can get behind here real fast, and now we've got two bent  
race cars,'' he said. ``I knew early that I was in trouble. The car 
never attempted to turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said his car also had steering problems on a windy  
day, that eventually became a rain-filled one. Practice was 
interrupted for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a tailwind, which helped me carry a little bit of speed  
in the corner, but it didn't do that the lap before,'' he said. 
``Now I'm down to one car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray was the fastest for the third day in a row, turning a  
top lap of 224.843 mph. Among other fast drivers were rookie John 
Hollansworth Jr. at 221.669, defending IRL champion Kenny Brack at 
221.272 and two-time Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk at 221.119.

<HEADLINE> Little Impeachment Fallout Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House vote to impeach President Clinton  
won't haunt Republican candidates in the 2000 congressional races 
because the public has long since moved on, the top House GOP 
election strategist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the National Republican  
Congressional Committee, told reporters that recent internal GOP 
polls showed interest in impeachment as a campaign issue 
diminishing since January, when one-third of voters polled by 
Republicans said it was a key factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters have put this behind them,'' Davis said. ``We're  
going to talk about the future -- our blueprint for the 21st 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the Democratic  
Congressional Campaign Committee, said last week that the 
impeachment vote would be ``most damaging'' to the GOP -- even if 
Democrats don't call attention to it -- and would help demonstrate 
that they are also out of the mainstream on issues such as 
education, health care and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes off the veneer of them being moderate in any  
manner,'' Kennedy said of December's House impeachment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis admitted that impeachment did ``smother'' the GOP message  
on other issues for a time. But since the Senate acquitted Clinton 
in February, he said, Republicans are ``closing the gap'' with 
Democrats on issues of importance to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, whose party holds a slim 222-211 majority in the House,  
said congressional Republicans are coordinating with some of the 
party's presidential contenders to develop a united campaign 
message for 2000. He wouldn't say which presidential hopefuls, but 
clearly was excited about the potential candidacy of Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outsider, and he's got the brand name,'' Davis said.  
``If we get any kind of help at the top of the ticket, we'll gain 
seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the House campaigns, Davis said the focus is on  
recruiting 30 to 50 ``blue-chip candidates'' to challenge 
vulnerable incumbent Democrats and to run in districts being 
vacated by Democrats. Those include seats now held by Reps. Ron 
Klink of Pennsylvania, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Robert Wise of 
West Virginia, Lane Evans of Illinois and Dennis Moore of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis acknowledged that some GOP incumbents are on shaky ground,  
including Rep. James Rogan of California, one of the most prominent 
House impeachment managers, Rep. Richard Baker of Louisiana and 
Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. But he said incumbents who survived in 
1998 are ``toughened up'' for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are doing some good recruiting, but we don't see  
anything that scares us,'' Davis said. ``We'll have our best team 
in the field. We are out recruiting heavily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis would not release fund-raising figures for the House  
campaign committee but predicted the GOP would best the Democrats 
``2-to-1'' in hard money contributions for specific races, with a 
lesser advantage in soft money donations used for party-building 
activities.

<HEADLINE> Street Leads Philly Mayor Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A black politician trying to live down his  
past as a hot-tempered activist led the city's Democratic mayoral 
primary Tuesday over a white lawyer tied to controversial former 
Mayor Frank Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
	With 77 percent of precincts reporting from all over the city,  
John Street, a former City Council president, had 81,678 votes, or 
36 percent. Political insider Marty Weinberg had 68,982 votes, or 
31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state welfare secretary John White Jr. had 48,608 votes,  
or 22 percent, and three lesser-known Democrats split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	They were vying to succeed popular Mayor Edward G. Rendell, a  
Democrat who is credited with bringing the nation's fifth-largest 
city back from the brink of financial ruin. He is barred from 
seeking a third consecutive term. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will face businessman Sam Katz, who was unopposed in  
the GOP primary and is seeking to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a political unknown in January but raised more than  
$5.2 million and launched an unprecedented advertising blitz. 
Street raised more than $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Weinberg's TV commercials were aimed squarely at Street,  
the front-runner throughout the race. Weinberg reminded voters of 
Street's past as a community activist, showing old TV footage of 
Street shoving a reporter and throwing a cup of water on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg also played up Street's financial problems, pointing  
out that he defaulted on his student loans and declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The negative advertising led to criticism that Weinberg was  
playing to racial fears. Street mostly ignored the attacks, 
although he came out with an ad four days before the election that 
accused Weinberg of racial divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're real excited about a victory that's going to be a  
citywide victory, that's going to be a diverse victory for John 
Street,'' said George Burrell, co-chairman of the Street campaign, 
as the results rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 percent of Philadelphia's 1.5 million people are  
black, and black leaders repeatedly called for at least one of the 
three black candidates to drop out of the race to give the 
remaining ones a better chance. Their pleas were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, meanwhile, had to answer questions about his long  
political relationship with Rizzo, whose administration was blamed 
for police brutality and financial mismanagement. Weinberg defended 
Rizzo as a good man who made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the issues, there was surprising consensus.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the candidates promised to focus on the neighborhoods,  
whose residents felt neglected during the city's downtown building 
boom. The candidates said the mayor should play a bigger role in 
improving city schools and promised to build on Rendell's legacy of 
economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> Best Hopes To Avoid Fouls in Game 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Travis Best believes he can defend league  
scoring champion Allen Iverson. That is if he can stay in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Best, he has been spending most of his time on  
the bench during in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fouls have cut deeply into Best's playing time. He has played  
just 54 minutes in four playoff games, scoring only nine points 
while accumulating 19 fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Best played just 13 minutes in the Pacers' 94-90 victory over  
Philadelphia in Monday's opening game of the best-of-7 Eastern 
Conference semifinals, fouling out with 6:10 to play and his team 
leading 83-70. With Best on the bench, Philadelphia cut its deficit 
to two points twice in the final minute before the Indiana held on 
for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 in the series is Wednesday night in Market Square Arena,  
where the Pacers have won 11 consecutive playoff games and have 
defeated the 76ers 10 straight times. The series then shifts to 
Philadelphia for Game 3 on Friday and Game 4 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, who led the league with a 26.8 scoring average this  
season, had 35 points Monday. His 29.6 average in the playoffs is 
the highest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can stay aggressive and not worry about getting fouls the  
way I have, then I feel like I can stay with him,'' Best said 
Tuesday. ``I wouldn't say I could stop him, but I can definitely 
slow him up, definitely keep him from dominating the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best was on the court only 16 seconds Monday before he fouled  
Iverson. He picked up his second and third fouls in the opening 
three minutes of the second quarter, then returned to the bench 
where he remained until the fourth quarter. He later was whistled 
for three fouls within a two-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough. It's hard to get in the flow, and it's hard to  
stay aggressive. There are times you want to play defense the way 
you want to and you're afraid they're going to call a foul. That's 
just an added advantage for him or whoever else you're guarding,'' 
Best said. ``I know all of them weren't really fouls. I feel as 
though I'm a very good defender and one who knows how to avoid 
fouls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Bird said Best is making mistakes that produce some  
of the foul calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes he's playing great defense and sometimes he's  
reaching too much. He's quick and he wants to do well,'' Bird said. 
``He's using his hands a little bit too much. But I don't worry 
about Travis. He'll snap out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Philadelphia coach Larry Brown is hoping he can limit  
the effectiveness of Jalen Rose. The Indiana reserve scored a 
career-playoff high 27 points Monday and had a regular-season 
career high 28 against the 76ers last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he gains no special motivation from playing against  
Brown, who used him sparingly most of his final year coaching the 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is he's in Philadelphia and I'm in Indiana.  
We're just trying to do whatever we can to get our teams over the 
hump,'' Rose said. ``I just think it's their team, not necessarily 
him. I'd be lying to say I don't get motivated to play against his 
team some. But at the same time, he's not out there guarding me and 
I don't have to play against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he has respect for Rose and is pleased with his  
progress in the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about that, that was a long time ago,'' Brown  
said about any ill feelings Rose might have toward him. ``I respect 
Jalen. I respect what he's done with his career. I love the way 
he's playing. ... I just think Jalen is a competitor. He's gotten 
better. They're doing a lot of neat things for him and I'm happy 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what Rose is doing better, Brown responded, ``I don't want  
to get into that. He's getting to play, and look at the people he's 
playing with. ... I didn't use him right. Maybe he was a little 
younger. There's a lot of factors, but the bottom line is he's 
doing it now and that's great.''

<HEADLINE>  'Star Wars' Makes Midnight Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Undaunted by bad reviews, thousands of fans  
lucky enough to get tickets lined up outside theaters across the 
country Tuesday to see the new ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, the film debuted early Wednesday before 1,162  
moviegoers who paid $9.50 each for reserved seats at the Ziegfeld 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited 16 years for this,'' shouted James Coleman, 25,  
who waited outside the theater for two days to get his ticket. 
```Star Wars' has had such a heavy impact on my life. It's 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time. The 
only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to 
approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge,  
unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box 
office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But beyond that you're in 
a very competitive release period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than  
$100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through 
Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' 
for the film-opener crown. ``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 
million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, for No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star  
Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof. 
Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. The 
reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious. 
</P>
<P>
	The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who  
likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who  
called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' 
movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle. Roger  
Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an 
astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the  
entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the 
back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a generation earlier, when 
Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who 
would grow up to become Luke's absentee father. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so  
far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and 
video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons 
beyond recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead  
for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were 
lined up at midmorning Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an 
aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins Future in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins wrote a memorable  
chapter in their intriguing history this season. Too bad for them 
it was Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddled with millions of dollars in debt rung up under owners  
Howard Baldwin and Roger Marino, the Penguins filed for bankruptcy 
in October, borrowed to get through the season, then prayed for the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
	They nearly got it.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite an avalanche of distractions, including Hall of Famer  
Mario Lemieux's bid to bail them out of bankruptcy, the Penguins 
surprised top-seeded New Jersey in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins then were in position to eliminate Toronto, only to  
lose the final three games. Two were in overtime, both at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The end -- and it might be permanent -- came with Monday's 4-3  
overtime loss on former teammate Garry Valk's overtime goal at 
1:57. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the save must come not from goaltender Tom Barrasso, but  
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the judge, and the dozens of creditors who are owed  
anywhere from $26 million (Lemieux) to a few thousand dollars (a 
limousine company), can save the 32-year-old franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	If creditors approve Lemieux's reorganization plan by June 24,  
the Penguins will remain in Pittsburgh. If not, the court could 
choose an NHL plan that calls for an unidentified buyer -- 
presumably, billionaire Paul Allen -- to buy them for $85 million 
and relocate them, probably to Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	A third plan emerged Tuesday. SMG, the Penguins' landlord at the  
Civic Arena, and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh presented a plan that 
would make Lemieux a minority owner and consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a city-of-Pittsburgh perspective and a fan perspective,  
they should be rooting hard for our plan,'' SMG attorney Saul 
Burian said. ``Our plan, I believe, would produce a franchise that 
is in better financial shape than that which would result from a 
Lemieux plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, SMG and their investors would own most of the team under  
their plan. If Lemieux rejects it, he would be lumped in with other 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said the team needs to be run by someone in Pittsburgh.  
SMG is based in Philadelphia, and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh is part 
of a national broadcasting company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need an ownership team committed to one team in one market  
-- Pittsburgh,'' said Lemieux, the former Penguins superstar and 
sixth-leading scorer in league history. ``Our ownership group under 
my leadership will be committed exclusively to the Penguins and 
only the Penguins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, I'm coming to Pittsburgh for training  
camp in September,'' forward Rob Brown said. ``In my heart, I'll be 
in Pittsburgh next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will the Penguins?  
</P>
<P>
	Allegheny County Commissioner Mike Dawida said Pittsburgh would  
survive without the Penguins, ``but they are a sign that we can't 
be called major league anymore if we were to lose such teams. They 
bring people together in a positive way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm cautiously optimistic that we will maintain the team,''  
Dawida said. 
</P>
<P>
	If this was the Penguins' last season in Pittsburgh, at least  
they left behind memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Depleted not just in dollars but in talent following the  
offseason departure of Ron Francis, they probably would have been 
satisfied just to make the playoffs. They did much better. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL scoring champion Jaromir Jagr further emerged as the  
league's dominant player in the post-Lemieux and, now, post-Wayne 
Gretzky era. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Jagr, the Penguins were mostly without their  
customary cast of stars (Lemieux, Francis, Kevin Stevens, etc.) So 
they improvised, getting a career year from Martin Straka, a 
one-time castoff who made the All-Star game; and a big lift from 
rookie Jan Hrdina, who wasn't expected to make the team but became 
the No. 1 center. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Kovalev finished with 53 points after being dealt in  
November for longtime holdout Petr Nedved. Robert Lang and former 
career minor leaguer Kip Miller made major contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine also succeeded in selling defense to a  
team once known only for scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins slipped to the final spot in the conference  
playoffs by finishing 2-8-2. That sent them against top-seeded New 
Jersey, and the Penguins seemed destined for their third straight 
first-round elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr delivered a gutsy effort in Game 6, returning from a  
four-game layoff with a groin injury to score the tying goal late 
in regulation and the winner in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins won Game 7 in New Jersey to reach the second round  
for the first time since 1996. They won Game 1 in Toronto and were 
up 2-1 in the series, only to give back home-ice advantage by 
losing Game 4 at home in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins were timid in losing 4-1 in Game 5. They were  
anything but in storming to their quick lead in Game 6. Goaltender 
Curtis Joseph kept it from being much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group, at any point during the season, could have latched  
onto a reason to not do well,'' Constantine said. ``They refused to 
ever latch on to a real, legitimate excuse because they wanted to 
win a Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, perhaps, a city has begun to realize those cold winter  
nights might be much emptier without the former Stanley Cup 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to leave Pittsburgh,'' Jagr said. ``It would be  
sad.''

<HEADLINE> Joan of Arc Helps CBS Top Nielsens / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS can thank a 500-year-old heroine for its  
dominance in the ratings last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Its Sunday night movie about Joan of Arc proved a better draw  
than a train careening out of control or Diana Ross and Brandy, 
enabling CBS to earn an important Nielsen Media Research victory. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC came in second in prime-time ratings for the week, part of  
the May ``sweeps'' period during which viewership is closely 
watched to set local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three networks each scheduled ``big event'' movies on  
Sunday to lure viewers. CBS's movie about the French heroine burned 
at the stake for heresy in 1431 drew an average audience of 23.3 
million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first part of NBC's ``Atomic Train'' miniseries had 16.6  
million viewers. The story about the train hurtling toward Denver 
drew poor reviews and had to be edited hastily because of concerns 
over its depiction of science and sensitivities about the Littleton 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's movie, ``Double Platinum,'' featuring Ross and Brandy in a  
drama about a singer reuniting with her long-ago abandoned child, 
had 14.2 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	All ranked among the week's 17 most-watched shows. ``ER'' was in  
its customary spot at the top of the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.5 rating and 16 share. NBC had a 9.3  
rating and 16 share, ABC a 7.2 rating and 12 share and Fox a 6.1 
and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB, the only network to show year-to-year ratings growth,  
had a 3.3 rating and 6 share. UPN was at 1.8 and 3 and Pax TV had a 
0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.2 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.0 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 10-16, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 18.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.6; ``CBS 
Sunday Movie: Joan of Arc, Part One,'' CBS, 15.2; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
14.8; ``Mad About You'' special, NBC, 13.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 13.4; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Ally McBeal,'' 
Fox, 11.4; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: Atomic Train, Part One,'' NBC, 
11.3; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.1.

<HEADLINE> SEC Censures, Fines Datek Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have censured and fined  
Datek Online Brokerage Services Corp. for allegedly failing to keep 
customers' money separate in the first action of its kind against 
an online brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek and its former chief financial officer agreed in a  
settlement to the censure and fines, totaling $60,000, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek, based in Iselin, N.J., is one of the nation's biggest  
online brokerages, processing more than 500,000 trades a day. With 
online customers now accounting for about a quarter of all retail 
stock trades, the mushrooming industry is expected to be pulling in 
some 10 million amateur investors by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action could be followed by similar moves against  
other online brokerages. The market watchdog agency has been 
conducting an extensive review of Internet trading firms 
nationwide. In addition to looking for violations of securities 
laws, the auditors have been examining how well firms execute 
orders and warn customers of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt challenged the  
online brokerage industry to provide better warnings to its 
customers about the risks that come with investing on the Internet 
and to tone down advertisements that appear to promise quick 
riches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customer-protection rules apply to everybody,'' including  
online brokerage firms, said Henry Klehm, senior associate director 
of the SEC's Northeast regional office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was the agency's first enforcement action involving  
customer-protection rules against an online trading firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Datek case, the SEC alleged that the firm violated  
customer-protection provisions of the federal securities laws by 
failing in some cases to set up separate accounts for customers' 
money. Brokerages are not allowed to use customers' money in the 
firms' operations or to pay their own financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators also charged that Datek kept inaccurate books and  
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek and its former chief financial officer, Moishe Zelcer,  
neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement, under 
which they agreed to be censured, to pay civil fines of $50,000 and 
$10,000, respectively, and to refrain from future violations of 
securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Datek agreed to hire an independent consultant to  
review its internal policies, procedures and controls and to 
recommend changes that may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelcer also agreed to be suspended from the brokerage industry  
for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek, in a statement, said it ``responded quickly to address  
the concerns'' raised by the SEC. The firm noted, for example, that 
it replaced Zelcer last July.

<HEADLINE> Gang Presence Rising in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fear generated by tragedies like the Colorado  
high school shootings masks a decline in school murders overall, 
say researchers who acknowledge that the perception of danger is a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are safe, that is the reality,'' Kathleen M. Fisher of  
Pennsylvania State University told a session of the American 
Psychiatric Association on Tuesday. She also said that the rash of 
threats after the Littleton, Colo., killings heightened fear. 
``Americans are sickened by the specter of kid-on-kid shootings,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts are that schools remain safer than the streets and  
many American homes, sadly,'' Fisher said, citing government 
figures showing a decline in school murders since the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town Tuesday, a group of survivors of school violence  
told members of Congress of their experience, suggesting that more 
parental involvement and more counseling opportunities for troubled 
students would help stop future shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	They also sparked a discussion of gun control, with one student  
saying parents should not have a gun when there are young people in 
the house. ``There's no reason why a young person should have a 
gun, period,'' said Carla Williams, a student from Sandy Spring, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said teachers should be empowered to deal with  
problems in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Their assessment meshed with that of Dr. Lois T. Flaherty of the  
University of Maryland, who told the Psychiatric Association that 
students who commit violence tend to be males from problem 
families, have a history of abuse and neglect and are not doing 
well in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools with the lowest rates of violence tend to have clear and  
well-enforced rules, small to moderate class size and skilled 
teachers who work closely with administrators, Ms. Flaherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	One troubling statistic, Fisher said, shows a doubling of the  
presence of gangs in school since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	But having a gang in school doesn't necessarily mean the Crips  
and the Bloods are there, said Dr. Paul A. Kettl, also from Penn 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	When a group of students band together to confront others,  
that's a gang, he said, adding that students form these groups 
because they lack social support. They don't know what they want to 
make of themselves and no adult helps them, so they join with other 
adolescents and learn from each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet most school crime remains minor and there has been a decline  
in homicides in school, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 55 in-school murders in the 1992-93 school year, she  
said, citing statistics gathered by law enforcement and school 
officials, and 51 the following year. The toll then dropped to 20 
in 1994-95, rose to 35 then fell to 25. Last year it was 40 and so 
far this year, 24 youngsters have died in school homicides, the 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	Kettl said biological, psychological and social factors often  
are behind school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	As for violent entertainment, Kettl said, ``It's not a monkey  
see, monkey do'' sort of thing. But, he said, ``violent 
entertainment for people predisposed to violence is not a good 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited violent video games in particular, asking: ``Is it a  
good thing to practice homicide for entertainment? Gee, I don't 
think so.'' However, he admitted he had no data to prove the case. 
</P>
<P>
	And, noting the rash of threats in schools since April 20, when  
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, stormed Columbine High 
School in Littleton, killing 12 other students and a teacher before 
taking their own lives, he wondered if such violence is contagious. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no detailed data on imitations of these cases, Kettl  
said. But he said a California study found a slight increase in 
suicides among young people in the two weeks following reports of a 
prominent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty, who has studied violence in Baltimore schools,  
suggested a set of survival skills for youngsters: 
</P>
<P>
	--Travel in small groups.  
</P>
<P>
	--Stay away from dangerous areas such as street corners.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't walk too close to anyone.  
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid accidental bumping.  
</P>
<P>
	--Make the right eye contact, neither avoiding people, nor  
looking at them in a challenging way. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't wear gold or expensive clothing.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Lawmakers Approve Stadium Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After years of stalemates and some last-minute  
tinkering that threatened to kill the deal, the Massachusetts House 
and Senate approved a plan Tuesday for a new $225 million stadium 
for the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, $70 million in taxpayer money would go toward  
paying for roads, sewer and lighting on and around the stadium 
site. Approximately $1.4 million would be paid back annually over 
25 years to the state to defer the state's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Robert Kraft would build the stadium with up to 50  
percent of the cost being financed by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan aims to have the Patriots playing in the new stadium by  
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Paul Cellucci is expected to sign the bill into law,  
possibly prior to a meeting of NFL owners next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Statehouse debate came a little more than two weeks after  
Kraft pulled out of a $380 million stadium deal with Connecticut. 
Since then, the team has only said it looks forward to staying in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots spokesman Stacey James on Tuesday said the team was  
still withholding comment.

<HEADLINE> Mother Charged With Starving Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A young woman charged with starving her  
breast-fed baby to death was confronted Tuesday with autopsy 
photographs of her son's emaciated body -- his tiny ribs sticking 
out, baggy skin hanging off his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did he look thin to you?'' Assistant District Attorney Robert  
Holdman said, showing her the photos on cross examination at her 
manslaughter trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked the same to me,'' replied Tabitha Walrond, 21. ``He  
was alive. He didn't look like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she never realized her son was losing weight.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond sobbed as she described how her 2-month-old son,  
Tyler, died in a cab on the way to the hospital in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Faster, faster! ... Something's wrong with my baby!'''  
she said. ``He left me, he died in the cab. I felt him leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ms. Walrond starved the baby intentionally  
because she was mad that her ex-boyfriend had left her and gotten 
another woman pregnant. The defense claims Ms. Walrond experienced 
nursing problems because of breast-reduction surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond could get up to 15 years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyler's weight fell dramatically from nearly 8 pounds at birth  
to about 5 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The child's father, Keenan Purrell, testified earlier that he  
had urged Ms. Walrond to give the baby formula but she refused, 
saying he should only be breast-fed. Purrell, a 21-year-old 
security guard, accused her of killing his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond testified that chose breast-feeding because her  
family and doctors all told her ``breast is best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said no doctor examined Tyler after he left the hospital  
because Medicaid was slow to issue him a card, and her health 
clinic would not examine the baby until the bureaucratic problem 
was resolved.

<HEADLINE>  'Star Wars' Makes Midnight Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Undaunted by bad reviews, thousands of fans  
lucky enough to get tickets lined up outside theaters across the 
country Tuesday to see the new ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, the film debuted early Wednesday before 1,162  
moviegoers who paid $9.50 each for reserved seats at the Ziegfeld 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited 16 years for this,'' shouted James Coleman, 25,  
who waited outside the theater for two days to get his ticket. 
```Star Wars' has had such a heavy impact on my life. It's 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time. The 
only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to 
approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge,  
unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box 
office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But beyond that you're in 
a very competitive release period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than  
$100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through 
Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' 
for the film-opener crown. ``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 
million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, for No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star  
Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof. 
Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. The 
reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious. 
</P>
<P>
	The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who  
likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who  
called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' 
movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle. Roger  
Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an 
astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.'' 
</P>

	Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the  
entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the 
back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a generation earlier, when 
Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who 
would grow up to become Luke's absentee father. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so  
far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and 
video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons 
beyond recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead  
for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were 
lined up at midmorning Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an 
aspiring screenwriter.

	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Help Curb Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Customs Service would get more money  
to fight illicit drugs and Internet child pornography under a bill 
approved by a House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would authorize more than $2.4 billion in 2000  
and 2001 for the operations of Customs and two other trade 
agencies, with the emphasis on more people and better equipment to 
detect drug trafficking. The funding level for the two years is 
$400 million above what the administration requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would set aside $311 million over two years for 1,745  
new Customs officers along the borders and at major drug and 
money-laundering locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs' Child Pornography/Child Sexual Exploitation Program  
would see its budget increased from $2.4 million to $10 million, 
allowing it to increase its staff by 50 from the current 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The boost is needed, said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., chief  
sponsor of the anti-pornography money, because the Internet ``is 
quickly becoming the No. 1 choice of pedophiles as a means of 
preying upon children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old Customs program, which led to 228 arrests last  
year, concentrates on international Internet sex predators and 
traffic in child pornography. It turns over to the FBI domestic 
cases that it uncovers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited  
Children, there are 10,000 Web sites maintained by pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means trade subcommittee approved the bill by  
a 9-6 vote Tuesday, with Democrats voting against it because they 
objected to provisions that would change the overtime and night 
differential rules for Customs officers. The National Treasury 
Employees Union also strongly opposes the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor issues were also a major issue last year when a similar  
bill passed the House by a large margin but was never taken up by 
the Senate. This year the Republican leadership took out 
controversial provisions altering collective bargaining and duty 
rotation policies, but kept in the overtime changes, saying they 
are needed to bring Customs employees in line with other federal 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	NTEU President Robert Tobias said it was ``counterproductive to  
penalize the very people'' who were being asked to take on the job 
of keeping drugs off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., criticized the Democrats on the  
panel for voting against the legislation because of the labor 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting our children and their families from the scourges  
of drugs and child pornography should not be a decision based on 
union strong-arming,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1833.

<HEADLINE> Stars Ride Modano, Hull to Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Part psychologist, part hockey strategist.  
Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock has been both in the NHL playoffs, 
helping his team advance to the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	After splitting up the tandem of Brett Hull and Mike Modano for  
two games, the coach reunited the pair midway through the first 
period of Game 6 of their second-round series against the St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull ended up assisting on both Dallas goals, the second scored  
by Modano at 2:21 of overtime for a 2-1 victory Monday night. The 
Stars will have home ice in the conference finals against the 
winner of the Detroit-Colorado series. The Avalanche led 3-2 going 
into Tuesday night's Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting Hull and Modano back on the same line was Hitchcock's  
strategic move. The psychological part was not telling either 
player about the change until he did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to go back to that line. We just didn't want to  
create a circus with a lot of people talking to Hull,'' Hitchcock 
said. ``We didn't even tell Brett that we were going to make the 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull probably had an inkling something was up when he played  
alongside a different pair of skaters in each of his first two 
shifts. Then Hitchcock barked ``Modano! Lehtinen! Hull!'' and 
Dallas' money line was back on the ice at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brett had two good shifts so we made the change right away,''  
Hitchcock said. ``When you see people like Hull and Modano playing 
as well as they were, you've got to enhance their opportunity to 
win the game for you by making them play more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Hull and Modano leading the way, Dallas compiled the  
league's best regular-season record and won its first six playoff 
games. St. Louis ended the streak in Game 3, and Hitchcock 
responded by separating his top players for Game 4 in hopes of 
sparking one or both. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell skill people to dig in deeper all the time  
because it becomes redundant,'' Hitchcock said. ``So, we decided to 
put them in situations where they had to dig in. We felt if we 
couldn't get either up and running, then we weren't going to win 
the series, anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues foiled the plan, tying the series, but the Stars  
reclaimed the lead by winning at home Saturday night. They closed 
the series on their first chance, avoiding a winner-take-all Game 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis led 1-0 late in the third period when Hull controlled  
a lose puck and sent it to Derek Plante in the slot. Plante slid 
the puck past goaltender Grant Fuhr to tie the game with 6:02 left 
in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the extra period, Hull skated around the net with the  
puck and shot a low backhander into Fuhr's skates. Modano was 
stymied on his first rebound attempt, but a second try got through 
for his fourth goal and 11th point of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the game and the series was especially sweet for Hull,  
who never got past the second round during 10 seasons in St. Louis. 
He signed with Dallas last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be time I'll draw on the memories of this game,''  
Hull said. ``When I'm down, it'll make me feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis center Craig Conroy, who chased Hull on the  
game-winning assist, complimented his former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept battling and made things happen,'' Conroy said. ``That  
was the difference.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Adviser Wants Andro Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's drug policy adviser wants  
the federal government to investigate the health effects of 
androstenedione, the over-the-counter product used by baseball 
slugger Mark McGwire, who broke the single-season home-run record 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey wrote to the Drug Enforcement Administration and  
the Federal Trade Commission urging that they study recent Canadian 
and Swedish laboratory analyses of the product, known as andro. 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione is classified as a dietary supplement that the  
body metabolizes into testosterone, which is considered a steroid. 
It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL, and the men's and 
women's tennis tours, but is not banned by baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Andro soared in popularity last fall after McGwire revealed he  
used it to enhance his weightlifting regimen prior to last season, 
when he hit a record 70 home runs. Steroid experts warn there could 
be serious health consequences for teen-agers who take it to 
emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey asked the agencies to confirm tests by the Swedish  
Board of Customs and the Canadian Doping Control Lab, which found 
some andro products contained significant quantities of 
testosterone not mentioned on the label. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the case, a large number of Americans who are  
taking these products are unwittingly placing themselves in serious 
jeopardy,'' McCaffrey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	If their review backs up the Canadian and Swedish findings,  
McCaffrey urged that andro be reclassified as an anabolic steroid 
under the Controlled Substances Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know this substance serves as a steroid precursor, which  
alone is grounds for caution,'' McCaffrey said. ``Given the 
dramatic increases in youth use rates of andro, and the mere 
potential that such use may have severe health consequences, it is 
important that we act swiftly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited anecdotal information indicating young people are  
taking 200 to 300 times the recommended dosage, a practice known as 
``stacking,'' and some are exhibiting side effects ``similar to 
those found with steroids, such as heightened aggressiveness and 
problem acne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its wide availability over the Internet makes it vulnerable to  
misuse, he noted.

<HEADLINE>  School Victims Address Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Students who experienced school violence  
firsthand spoke in quiet, nervous tones Tuesday of shootings and 
bomb threats that left them scared and feeling helpless -- and they 
urged House lawmakers to work to prevent such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers made several suggestions to a House subcommittee,  
ranging from more parental involvement to more opportunities for 
troubled students to get counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	They also sparked a discussion of gun control, with one student  
saying parents should not have a gun when there are young people in 
the house. ``There's no reason why a young person should have a 
gun, period,'' said Carla Williams, a student from Sandy Spring, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Atteberry, a student from Thurston High School in  
Springfield, Ore., told how May 21, 1998, started like any normal 
school day when he was visiting with friends as he headed to his 
first class. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know I'm laying down on the ground,  
paralyzed, my head filled by a deafening ringing sound,'' Atteberry 
said. ``I realized something terrible had happened when I saw the 
blood coming out of my side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atteberry, who spent five days in the hospital, said he still  
has a bullet lodged near his spine because doctors feel it would be 
too dangerous to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurston High student Kip Kinkel has been charged in the  
shootings that killed two and injured more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Keene, a senior at Heath High School in Paducah, Ky.,  
said he still feels fear, anxiety and depression from the December 
1997 shooting by fellow student Michael Carneal that killed three 
students and injured five others as they ended an informal prayer 
meeting in the school's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain never leaves,'' Keene said. ``You can hardly control  
yourself sometimes because you're crying so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carneal pleaded guilty but mentally ill to murder and was  
sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The students had suggestions for the lawmakers. For instance,  
Brigid Moriarty of Olney, Md., said children need a place to ``vent 
their anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at other times, they met lawmakers' queries with silence and  
shoulder shrugs. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  School Victims Address Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Students who experienced school violence  
firsthand spoke in quiet, nervous tones Tuesday of shootings and 
bomb threats that left them scared and feeling helpless -- and they 
urged House lawmakers to work to prevent such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers made several suggestions to a House subcommittee,  
ranging from more parental involvement to more opportunities for 
troubled students to get counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	They also sparked a discussion of gun control, with one student  
saying parents should not have a gun when there are young people in 
the house. ``There's no reason why a young person should have a 
gun, period,'' said Carla Williams, a student from Sandy Spring, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Atteberry, a student from Thurston High School in  
Springfield, Ore., told how May 21, 1998, started like any normal 
school day when he was visiting with friends as he headed to his 
first class. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know I'm laying down on the ground,  
paralyzed, my head filled by a deafening ringing sound,'' Atteberry 
said. ``I realized something terrible had happened when I saw the 
blood coming out of my side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atteberry, who spent five days in the hospital, said he still  
has a bullet lodged near his spine because doctors feel it would be 
too dangerous to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurston High student Kip Kinkel has been charged in the  
shootings that killed two and injured more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Keene, a senior at Heath High School in Paducah, Ky.,  
said he still feels fear, anxiety and depression from the December 
1997 shooting by fellow student Michael Carneal that killed three 
students and injured five others as they ended an informal prayer 
meeting in the school's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain never leaves,'' Keene said. ``You can hardly control  
yourself sometimes because you're crying so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carneal pleaded guilty but mentally ill to murder and was  
sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The students had suggestions for the lawmakers. For instance,  
Brigid Moriarty of Olney, Md., said children need a place to ``vent 
their anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at other times, they met lawmakers' queries with silence and  
shoulder shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person has a bad heart, you cannot change it; only God  
can change a bad heart,'' said Adam Campbell of Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. That's where two fellow students, Eric 
Harris and Dylan Klebold, fired guns and set off homemade bombs, 
killing 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves last

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov, Hingis Are Top Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov will be the top seed for the  
French Open despite a recent run of six consecutive first-round 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis, the Australian Open winner, was made the No. 1  
women's seed on Tuesday, ahead of Lindsay Davenport and Monica 
Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Open, the clay-court major that begins May 24, bases  
its seedings on the current rankings of the ATP and WTA tours. 
</P>
<P>
	That accounts for Kafelnikov, who ascended to No. 1 for the  
first time in April, being the top seed, with Pete Sampras second. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a runner-up finish in last week's Italian Open,  
Patrick Rafter moves up to No. 3, with French Open champion Carlos 
Moya at No. 4 and Richard Karjicek at No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has played embarrassing tennis since winning the  
Australian Open in January and a tournament in London a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Italian Open, the Russian broke his run of six  
first-round defeats before losing in the third round to Gustavo 
Kuerten. Kuerten won the title in Rome and is seeded No. 8 for 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's draw, defending champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario  
is seeded No. 7. Jana Novotna is No. 4, Venus Williams is No. 5 and 
Steffi Graf is No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Frenchwomen are among the 16 seeds: No. 8 Mary Pierce, No.  
9 Nathalie Tauziat, No. 12 Sandrine Testud and No. 16 Julie 
Halard-Decugis. 
</P>
<P>
	Halard-Decugis, who advanced to the final of last week's Berlin  
Open, gained five ranking spots to capture her first seeding in a 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Open finalist Amelie Mauresmo and Anna Kournikova  
have slipped from the top 16 and will be unseeded at Roland Garros.

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Praise Late Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The late Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell  
was praised Tuesday by his former colleagues and the lawyers who 
practiced before him during his 15-year tenure on the nation's 
highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who served with him continue to miss him,'' Chief  
Justice William H. Rehnquist told a packed courtroom during a 
memorial ceremony for Powell, who died at age 90 last August. He 
retired in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist praised Powell's ``rare combination of ability,  
fair-mindedness and grace,'' and said that of the 16 Supreme Court 
members with whom he has served, only Powell and the late Thurgood 
Marshall would have been historic legal figures even if they had 
not served on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall was the great civil rights advocate who won the Supreme  
Court case that ended racial segregation in public schools. Powell 
was the Richmond, Va., school board president who helped avoid 
``massive resistance'' to that ruling, and later served as 
president of the American Bar Association and American College of 
Trial Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist drew laughter when he noted that Byron R. White, the  
only living retired justice, would have been remembered as an 
athlete. White, an All-America football player who led the National 
Football League in rushing while pursuing his law degree, smiled 
ruefully at the mention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest of us,'' Rehnquist said, might have been ``perhaps  
more affluent'' but certainly not as well known. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and Solicitor General Seth Waxman,  
the Clinton administration's highest-ranking courtroom lawyer, 
presented Supreme Court Bar resolutions that called Powell ``a 
careful, caring and supremely thoughtful jurist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A portrait of Powell was unveiled and will be hung in the  
Supreme Court building with those of other deceased court members.

	Senate Votes for Gun Locks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted 78-20  
Tuesday to require the sale of ``secure gun storage or safety 
devices'' with handguns. The provision also provides liability 
protections for a gun owner who uses a safety lock and whose gun is 
stolen and used in a crime. The gun lock proposal was crafted by 
Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and embraced by 
Handgun Control, a gun control advocacy organization. Senate 
Republicans last week first approved a provision for voluntary 
background checks in certain instances at gun shows. They then 
backtracked and muscled through a proposal they said would require 
checks for all sales. 

</P>
<P>
	House Passes $15B Kosovo Package  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House easily approved a $15 billion  
package Tuesday to pay for the bombing in Yugoslavia, and Senate 
passage was possible by Wednesday. President Clinton's signature is 
all but assured on the package, which includes $12 billion to cover 
U.S. costs of NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia. Clinton wanted half 
that amount, but Republicans said the extra money was needed to 
rebuild armed services. The bill, passed 269-158, also provides 
money for recovery from storms in the Caribbean and the United 
States and a host of home-state projects.

	'Star Wars' To Premier at Midnight  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The new ``Star Wars'' movie was set to open  
at midnight screenings around the country. Because of the intense 
adoration for the first three ``Star Wars'' movies, the new 
installment is considered critic-proof -- a good thing since the 
reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious. 
Not only is it critic-proof, it's a foregone conclusion that ``Star 
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest 
films of all time. The only question is whether it will approach 
the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America.

	Europeans May Ease Iraq Sanctions  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Britain and the Netherlands are willing to  
allow foreign oil companies to invest in Iraq if Baghdad cooperates 
with U.N. arms inspectors, diplomats said Tuesday. The revised 
British-Dutch draft resolution falls short of a Russian proposal to 
lift economic sanctions against Iraq once a system to monitor its 
weapons programs is in place. Still, the draft aims at a compromise 
between moderate members of the Security Council who want to 
improve life for Iraqis suffering under sanctions imposed in 1990 
and the United States, which has been more cautious in suggesting 
improvements to the U.N. program.

	Drug Cuts Sneezing, Wheezing  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A cure for the common cold may exist. An  
experimental cold remedy called tremacamra cut sneezing, runny 
noses and congestion nearly in half, researchers reported in 
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. But 
whether the drug will work on the many viruses known to cause colds 
has yet to be determined. Tremacamra works by blocking 
rhinoviruses, which commonly cause colds, from attaching to one 
particular molecule on the outside of cells that the virus needs 
for a biological anchor.

consumer prices, the Federal Open Market Committee said it has 
adopted a policy that tilts toward future rate increases. The 
Nikkei Stock Average fell 133.20 points to 16,245.42 in early

playoff-high with 34 points Tuesday night to carry the Knicks to a 
100-92 victory over the Atlanta Hawks in Game 1 of their 
second-round series. The Hawks went nearly seven minutes without a 
field goal in the third quarter and New York rebounded from an 
eight-point deficit to lead 80-73 by the end of the period. New 
York had put the game away with a 12-3 spurt in the fourth.

Colorado Avalanche beat them 5-2. Peter Forsberg scored twice and 
Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy continued his outstanding play as 
the Avalanche won their second-round series in six games. Milan 
Hejduk, Chris Drury and Joe Sakic also scored for Colorado. Nicklas 
Lidstrom and Darren McCarty scored for the Red Wings. Roy, 
extending his NHL playoff record for wins to 107, had 35 saves.

<HEADLINE>  Riley's Heat Blueprint Is a Bust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pat Riley is widely regarded as the best coach in  
the NBA, so the Miami Heat coach will be spared in the backlash of 
his team's first-round fizzle against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Miami's fans and critics clamor in consensus: Fire the  
players. And Riley may do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley thought he had a team ready to fill the championship void  
created by Michael Jordan's retirement. Instead, the Heat were 
eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs for the third time 
in Riley's four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston's last-second shot Sunday for the New York Knicks  
drove home the point: Miami needs a makeover. Riley's blueprint is 
a bust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'll sit down and talk about what we're going to do  
this offseason,'' Riley said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Riley should share in the blame, but his four  
championship rings with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s still 
carry considerable clout. Instead, Heat players will take the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	As is his custom, Riley laid low on the first day of the  
offseason, and he wasn't talking to the media Monday. So 
speculation began without him. The question is not whether he'll 
shake up the roster, but how. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player considered untouchable is center Alonzo  
Mourning, who had an MVP-caliber year and a fine series against the 
Knicks. But his teammates, including point guard Tim Hardaway, can 
only wonder whether they'll be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like going to war with this group of guys, and I don't want  
to see change,'' Mourning said. ``But this game is about change, 
and with Riles running the ship, if adjustments have to be made, 
he'll make them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks series confirmed that adjustments have to be made.  
The Heat became the first No. 1 seed from the Eastern Conference to 
lose against a No. 8 seed. Last year, Miami was the first No. 2 
seed from the East to be eliminated by a No. 7 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Miami lost both times to the despised  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was tough. This is going to be even tougher,'' guard  
Dan Majerle said. ``We play hard, but we just haven't been able to 
get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York underscored the Heat's deficiencies:  
They rely too much on outside shots and badly need a scorer at 
shooting guard or small forward. Miami has no reliable third option 
beyond Mourning and Hardaway, who struggled through a miserable 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway shot 27 percent against the Knicks and averaged 9.0  
points per game, barely half his average. He was shut out in the 
second half of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a bad stretch I hit, and I didn't come through for  
my team,'' he said. ``That's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his productivity curtailed, Miami averaged just 79.0 points  
against New York, the second-lowest figure in a five-game series in 
NBA history. The Heat set the record of 78.6 against the Bulls two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's biggest decision will be whether to keep Hardaway, the  
Heat's best clutch player the past four years. He has one season 
left on his contract, but turns 33 in September and is plagued by 
knee trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	If Riley decides to sacrifice defense for more offense, he might  
part with power forward P.J. Brown, who has the most trade value of 
any player except Mourning. Guards Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard 
have limited marketability after disappointing seasons curtailed by 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards Majerle and Terry Porter become free agents this summer.  
Both have expressed an interest in remaining with Miami, and 
they're the only players on the roster with experience in the NBA 
Finals. But Majerle is 33 and Porter 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon enough, the scapegoats for the failure of 1999 will be  
selected. Riley's postseason record in Miami is 12-18, and with the 
offseason prematurely under way, coach Pat is unlikely to stand 
pat.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raiser Will Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated five  
charges Tuesday against a Democratic fund-raiser accused of hiding 
illegal contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  
reversed a lower court's ruling that had thrown out the five 
false-statements charges against Maria Hsia, who steered thousands 
of dollars from a Buddhist temple to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also affirmed the lower court's ruling that  
Hsia must stand trial on another charge of conspiracy involving 
$65,000 in illegal contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said she was ``surprised and  
disappointed'' in the decision and some form of appeal was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased'' with the ruling, Justice Department  
spokesman Myron Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, was accused of  
disguising contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign and other 
politicians between 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges allege she solicited the donations and then  
orchestrated false filings to the Federal Election Commission. 
Prosecutors said the filings amount to false statements to the 
government because the contributors named were not the true source 
of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia, who has close ties to Gore, pleaded innocent. Her lawyers  
argued in court papers that she never made any claim about the 
names listed with the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	After former Little Rock, Ark., restaurateur Yah Lin ``Charlie''  
Trie, Hsia was the second figure charged by a special Justice 
Department campaign fund-raising task force investigating alleged 
abuses in the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court rejected U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman's  
findings last September that the government's case against Hsia was 
illogical and prosecutors did not show how Hsia ``knowingly 
caused'' false filings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not entirely clear what defects the district court found  
in the government's theory of causation,'' Judge Stephen F. 
Williams wrote for the appeals court. ``The false statements here 
are the political committees' reports identifying certain listed 
names as sources of specific contributions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also rejected Friedman's finding that Hsia's conduct  
was largely shielded by the First Amendment protection for 
political expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who was appointed by President Reagan, was joined in  
the ruling by Judges Judith W. Rogers and David Tatel, both 
appointed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's ruling could boost government prosecutors in at least  
two other cases alleging that Democratic fund-raisers made false 
statements to campaign regulators. Those cases involve Trie and 
Thai businesswoman Pauline Kanchanalak. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie had filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Hsia  
against the government's appeal. However, the appeals court 
rejected his arguments that the FEC reporting forms were 
``fundamentally ambiguous'' and did not request identification of 
the actual source of contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thus reject all arguments that the statements alleged in  
the indictment were 'literally true,''' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia is on trial in Los Angeles on separate tax evasion charges.

<HEADLINE> The Familiar, Fresh Shine at Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- It happens every year: about halfway  
through the Cannes Film Festival, the amorphous buzz along the 
Croisette starts to take a discernible shape. Here's what it's 
saying about who's shining in the Riviera sun: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PEDRO IS THE NEW ROBERTO:   	
</P>
<P>
	Last year it was Roberto Benigni, the Italian director-actor,  
who had the buzz. This year, it's the almost-as-colorful Spanish 
director, Pedro Almodovar. 
</P>
<P>
	Almodovar's ``All About My Mother'' seems to be the unanimous  
choice among Cannes-watchers for the Golden Palm, the festival's 
top award. It is the 13th film by the man best known for ``Women on 
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and many say it's his best. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of an appealing youth in the beginning of a film could  
easily sink any attempt at lightness. Somehow Almodovar manages to 
achieve the perfect balance between tragedy and humor with a 
quartet of absorbing women who form an offbeat family: a grieving 
single mother, a transvestite, an impressionable young nun and a 
lesbian actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked his secret, the engaging Spaniard is about as modest as  
Benigni. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just talent,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Fans of old Hollywood will appreciate the film's clever tributes  
to ``All About Eve'' and ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' 
Unfortunately, those using the simultaneous English translation at 
the premiere may have missed these references: the title of 
``Streetcar'' became something like ``A Tramway About Feelings,'' 
and Blanche's famous line, ``I have always depended on the kindness 
of strangers,'' sounded like ``I've always counted on people being 
nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WELCOME, TIM AND SUSAN:   	
</P>
<P>
	Some grumbled that the Hollywood star quotient of this festival  
was low. So everyone was glad on Tuesday to see the arrival of Tim 
Robbins and the star-studded cast of ``Cradle Will Rock'': Susan 
Sarandon, Hank Azaria, Vanessa Redgrave, Joan Cusack, Emily Watson 
and Ruben Blades. 
</P>
<P>
	The period film, which also stars Bill Murray and Joan's brother  
John, recounts the true story of a 1930s theater troupe in New York 
risking their careers to perform a play about labor unrest, against 
a background of anti-communist censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	First-time Cannes visitor Azaria, best-known for TV work in  
``Mad About You'' and ``The Simpsons,'' says he was excited by the 
principle the film is based on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not often that actors get to put their beliefs on the  
line,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BEST ACTOR AND ACTRESS:   	
</P>
<P>
	British actor Bob Hoskins gives an enthralling performance as a  
sinister bachelor -- that's putting it mildly -- in Atom Egoyan's 
engrossing ``Felicia's Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hilditch, ostensibly a cheerful catering manager, Hoskins  
spends evenings cooking elaborate meals with the help of old videos 
of his mother's cooking show. Only slowly does the film reveal the 
true horror lurking behind his amiable facade. Both Egoyan and 
Hoskins do a memorable job of pacing the performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecilia Roth has made a deep impression as Manuela, the single  
mother in Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' portraying strength 
and weakness and despair and optimism all at once. A regular in the 
Spaniard's films, this appears to be her big break. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NEW FACES:   	
</P>
<P>
	Two fresh and interesting faces are those of Penelope Cruz, the  
beautiful young nun in Almodovar's film, and Elaine Cassidy, the 
Irish girl who makes extreme naivete plausible in ``Felicia's 
Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least Cruz won't be unknown for long: she plays Matt Damon's  
love interest in an upcoming Billy Bob Thornton film.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Closing In on Red Wings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Nothing seems to scare the Detroit Red Wings like  
a goalie on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, it was Arturs Irbe. In 1995, it was Martin Brodeur. In  
1996, it was Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	And now it's Roy again.  
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche, once down 0-2, have rallied behind Roy  
for three straight victories and can eliminate Detroit with a win 
tonight in Game 6 of their second-round series. If a seventh game 
is needed, it would be Thursday night in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's say we approach it like it's our Game 7,'' Roy said  
after practice Monday. ``We don't want to think about Thursday's 
game. We want to think about tomorrow's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have a lot of confidence the way we're playing right  
now, the way we play on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, extending his NHL playoff record for wins to 106, had 36  
saves as the Avalanche beat Detroit 3-0 in Game 5 on Sunday, the 
first time the home team has won in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy has stopped 111 of the last 116 Detroit shots.  
</P>
<P>
	``Roy has been solid in the net,'' said Steve Yzerman, the Red  
Wings' captain, ``and they have gotten timely goals from all sorts 
of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy's 12th career playoff shutout tied him with Terry Sawchuk  
for fourth place in NHL history. His last shutout in the postseason 
came in Game 5 against Detroit in the Western Conference finals in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Patrick Roy, the net is getting smaller,'' Colorado coach  
Bob Hartley said. ``Patrick is outstanding. Everybody's talking 
about the Red Wings missing the net. Well, maybe there's no room to 
shoot at. Patrick is so solid. His positioning is so good that it's 
tough to see the mesh behind number 33.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there has been one thing that can give the Red Wings fits in  
the playoffs, it seems to be a goalie who can all but stand on his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, seeking its third straight Stanley Cup championship,  
has been fairly loaded with talent for several years now. But in 
1994, Irbe was spectacular in goal and the San Jose Sharks booted 
the Red Wings in seven games -- in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur helped the New Jersey Devils sweep Detroit in the 1995  
Cup finals, and Roy sent the Red Wings packing after six games in 
1996 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Goaltending is the most important position in hockey,''  
Colorado forward Joe Sakic said. ``When you have the best one, it 
makes it a lot easier on everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, here is Roy again.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been outstanding,'' said Colorado forward Jeff Odgers,  
who scored his first goal of these playoffs Sunday. ``He's the kind 
of guy that when he makes up his mind that he's going to do 
something, he says, `Listen, boys, this is the way it's going to 
be.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Patty is he'll say it and he'll lead by  
example. If you don't go out there and give it your all, you're not 
only letting the team down, you're letting him down because he 
gives such a great effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your goaltender is playing as well as Patty is, it gives  
everyone else confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been three years since the Red Wings have been on the  
brink of elimination, dating back to the 1996 Western Conference 
finals against Colorado. Down 3-1, the Red Wings rallied to win 
Game 5, but the Avs won Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit had advanced that year only because Yzerman scored in  
double-overtime in Game 7 of a second-round series against St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes when a goalie is hot, you try and be too perfect on  
your shots,'' said Detroit forward Brendan Shanahan, who missed the 
net on a breakaway in Game 5. ``You end up missing the net and you 
pass up opportunities to shoot and look for the easy tap-in goal 
with a pass. We can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are attempting to become the first team to win  
three successive Cup championships since the New York Islanders won 
four straight between 1980-83.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Mexican Unions Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leaders of a union local representing  
thousands of low-wage California workers and Mexican labor leaders 
on Tuesday signed a mutual assistance pact aimed at curbing the 
strength of corporations that operate on both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement links Service Employees International Union Local  
1877 and Section 87 of Mexico's telephone workers union with 
commitments to support one another's negotiations by picketing, 
distributing fliers and other actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This demonstrates to the corporate world and targets that we  
have that our union's fingers reach across the world,'' said Mike 
Garcia, president of Local 1877, which represents 22,000 California 
janitors and other service workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance underscores a trend of cross-border labor alliances  
that has grown as unions try to keep pace with companies that do 
business in more than one country. Communications workers, 
steelworkers and dock workers in recent years have worked out 
similar agreements to join in international actions, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to change the attitude of international corporations  
through these types of alliances because of their anti-union 
policies,'' said Francisco Hernandez Juarez, secretary general of 
Sindicado de Telefonistas de la Republican Mexicana, parent of 
Section 87. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he plans to ask his U.S. allies to send organizers into  
border communities to help maquiladora workers organize. The 
maquiladora industry, which assembles finished goods from parts 
shipped into Mexico from other countries, is one of the 
fastest-growing sectors of the Mexican economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement unites unions that have been leaders in their  
respective countries. Service Workers International has enjoyed 
dramatic growth in recent years by targeting traditional non-union 
service jobs ranging from janitors and home healthcare providers to 
doctors. Mexico's telephone workers have been influential in 
shaping Mexican labor policy, said Harley Shaiken, labor analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a growing phenomenon. As the economy has gotten more  
global, unions have understood their strength depends on 
international solidarity,'' said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a professor 
of labor and industrial relations at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement isn't even the first act of cooperation between  
Local 1877 and Section 87 of the Sindicado de Telefonistas de la 
Republica Mexicana. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Section 87 members picketed Hewlett-Packard Co. offices  
in Mexico City to support the U.S. local's campaign to boost wages 
for janitors cleaning Hewlett-Packard offices in Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican local's members primarily are janitors employed by  
Telefonos de Mexico, the former state-owned telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Other unions have forged similar international agreements in  
recent years. The Communications Workers of America has solidarity 
agreements with telecommunications workers in Mexico, France and 
Germany. And the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, has negotiated 
agreements on workplace standards in the U.S. and Mexico with 
Camden, N.J.-based Campbell Soup Co., analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also reflects the significance of cultural and  
economic ties linking U.S. Hispanics with workers in Mexico. A 
majority of Local 1897's members are Hispanic, many of them 
immigrants from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Such pacts, however, carry significant risk of misunderstandings  
and cultural mistakes and create tension between unions, said 
Bronfenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Global solidarity only works if it goes both ways and it's  
sincere. It has to be mutual,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Motorists Scoop Up Dropped Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- Drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike jumped  
from their cars to scoop up cash after an armored car spilled bills 
and loose change when its rear door opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coin Depot Corp. car spilled an undetermined amount of money  
Monday night, state police spokesman Sgt. Al Della Fave said. 
</P>
<P>
	When police arrived, ``there were people scurrying about all  
different ways, scooping the money up,'' Della Fave said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police recovered more than $2,200, but didn't know how much was  
taken. A Coin Depot Corp. official didn't return a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	Della Fave said people who took $500 or less from the car could  
be charged with theft and sentenced to 18 months in jail if 
convicted. Those who took more could be sentenced to three to five 
years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> High Tech Cos. Lack Trained Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- High tech companies in Silicon Valley  
can't find enough qualified workers to fill job openings and it's 
hampering the industry's growth, a study released Tuesday found. 
</P>
<P>
	That employee shortage is translating into a $3 billion loss for  
local high tech companies, according to a study by Joint Venture: 
Silicon Valley Network, a group of public organizations and private 
businesses working to improve the economic vitality and quality of 
life in Silicon Valley, where most of the top high tech businesses 
in the U.S. are headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study confirms that the area's high tech industry is not  
growing as fast as it could be because there simply are not enough 
skilled people to fill the jobs,'' said Ruben Barrales, president 
of the group. ``If Silicon Valley wants to remain the capital of 
high tech, we need to become the top producer of qualified high 
tech workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 160,000 high tech positions -- roughly  
one-third of the high tech industry demand in Silicon Valley -- are 
filled by recruits from outside the region, by long-distance 
commuters -- or they go unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Smith, who conducted the study with the management  
consulting firm A.T. Kearney , said the ``gap'' between demand and 
supply in the local high tech work force means employers have to 
pay higher salaries, have to spend more on recruiting, and lose 
money during long gaps without employees. Smith said those costs 
amount to between $6,000 and $8,000 per employee, or an annual 
total of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The study projects that the area workforce shortage will  
increase to 200,000 positions by the year 2010, driven in part by a 
lack of interest among area high school students in high tech 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes just one week after Immigration and  
Naturalization Service's announcement that the U.S. is about to run 
out of available visas for foreign workers with high-tech skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Joint Venture managers said their findings do not necessarily  
point to a need for more visas. Instead, said Barrales, Joint 
Venture will be focusing on improving training and education 
programs at local schools.

<HEADLINE> OECD Growth Seen Dipping in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Economic growth in the world's most developed  
countries is expected to slow slightly in 1999, the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic situation for the world and the OECD area as a  
whole now looks more favorable than it did six months ago,'' the 
OECD said in its semi-annual economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-based research organization said the economies of  
world's 29 richest countries will expand by 2.2 percent in 1999 
versus 2.3 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of a wide-spread financial crisis have subsided, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``Calm and confidence have returned in financial markets as the  
worst fears about the ramifications of the Russian crisis last 
August haven't been realized and the crisis in Brazil has largely 
been confined to the region,'' the OECD said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the somewhat rosy outlook, the OECD said the global  
economy isn't out of the woods yet. Foreign investor confidence 
isn't yet repaired in emerging economies, crimping efforts of 
countries such as Brazil to recover swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of more problems in Brazil or Russia and a  
longer-than-expected slowdown in China are the main risks, the OECD 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group forecast that economic growth in OECD countries will  
slow to 2.1 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, inflation will be subdued in the next 18 months, while  
import oil prices are likely to steady around $15 per barrel, the 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in world trade was expected to show a robust recovery in  
the second half, helped by stabilizing domestic demand in Asia. 
However, world trade growth as a whole will slow to 3.9 percent in 
1999 from 4.5 percent in 1998, before recovering to 5.6 percent in 
2000, the OECD said. 
</P>
<P>
	The OECD underscored the importance of the surprising strength  
in the U.S. economy in its overall outlook, but questioned how much 
longer temporary factors -- such as lower commodity prices and a 
rising dollar -- can combine to create rapid growth with low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, however, the OECD said the outlook remains bleak, with  
the economy likely to shrink for the second year running in 1999 
and show no growth until after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep reform of Japan's financial markets, coupled with reforms  
to improve labor-market flexibility, deregulation and more 
corporate restructuring are necessary to restore growth, the OECD 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	April's reduction in interest rates throughout much of Europe  
should bolster growth in the region. But within the euro zone, 
policymakers are facing a troubling gap between the weak 
performances of the German and Italian economies and the rest of 
the area, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Liability Bill Stalls in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to prevent an outbreak of lawsuits  
resulting from year 2000 computer problems stalled in the Senate 
today, for the second time the victim of an unrelated political 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 53-45 to proceed with debate on the Y2K bill,  
seven short of the 60 needed. 
</P>
<P>
	While many Democrats want legislation to prevent frivolous  
litigation, most voted against the motion to proceed because they 
say the Senate should first finish work on a juvenile justice bill 
that has become a vehicle for Democrats to push gun-control 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he  
wanted to go back to the Y2K bill, but only after the juvenile 
justice bill is completed. He said Republicans were trying to pin 
blame on the Democrats in the event the justice bill fails. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Democrats  
``want to play games on this (Y2K) bill and they want litigation.'' 
If the Y2K bill dies because of what he called political games, 
``let them explain it to the business community in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also defeated a similar motion to proceed several  
weeks ago, on that occasion because they objected to the Republican 
leadership's attempt to limit the kinds of amendments they could 
offer to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	While political fighting has held up action on the bill, there  
has been a bipartisan effort, led by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., to compromises 
some of the more disputed aspects of the legislation and make it 
more acceptable to the administration, which has opposed extensive 
changes to tort law. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would provide for a 90-day cooling-off period  
before Y2K lawsuits could be filed, encourage mediation and limit 
punitive damages for defendants with fewer than 50 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The House last week passed its version of the bill. The  
administration has threatened a veto, saying it goes further than 
the Senate bill in restricting legitimate claims based on Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kmart Announces $1B Stock Buyback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp.'s years of retrenchment are over, and  
the nation's No. 3 retailer plans to add 30 to 50 stores a year as 
it rides the growth in the discount retail business, chief 
executive Floyd Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also told shareholders at their annual meeting Tuesday that  
the company will buy back $1 billion in stock over the next several 
years, a response to what he said is the serious undervaluing of 
its shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like you, we are frustrated that our stock price is  
undervalued by many in the financial community,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that its price-earnings ratio is about half the average  
of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the market isn't interested in buying, you can be sure that  
we are,'' he said. ``Kmart is taking this dramatic action today as 
evidence of our strong confidence in the growth and future 
performance of this company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, chairman since June 1995, presented shareholders with a  
glowing overview of the company's recent performance. He noted that 
the company: 
</P>
<P>
	--Has posted 12 consecutive quarters of earnings increases,  
thanks partly to strong private merchandise sales from Martha 
Stewart, Sesame Street and Jaclyn Smith lines. 
</P>
<P>
	--Has refurbished all of its stores within the last three and a  
half years, freeing up cash for renewed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Will complete the conversion of traditional Kmart stores to Big  
Kmart stores, with a year-end total of more than 1,850 Big Kmarts 
in the chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In answer to one shareholder's question, he said Kmart was  
interested in finding a national retail chain to help it expand its 
grocery offerings. He said the company has been discussing the 
project with potential partners, which he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy-based Kmart is the nation's third-largest retailer, behind  
Wal-Mart and Sears Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had earnings last year of $518 million on sales of  
$33.7 billion. Kmart has 2,162 stores in all 50 states, Puerto 
Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix Suns guard Rex Chapman underwent surgery  
Tuesday to free a nerve in his right foot. 
</P>

	Dr. Gustavo Armendariz performed the surgery and said Chapman  
must keep weight off his foot for two weeks but was expected to be 
able to gradually return to normal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, hampered by a number of injuries, played in only 38  
games in the abbreviated 50-game season. He averaged 12.1 points,

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Disapproval of Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are well-positioned on education and  
Social Security, the two issues the voters care most about, 
according to an internal GOP poll that also says it could be ``a 
political disaster'' for Republicans to oppose prescription drug 
coverage for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that in the months since President Clinton's  
impeachment trial ended, congressional Republicans have whittled 
away at their deficit against Democrats in a hypothetical election 
matchup, and now trail by 4 percentage points. At the same time, 
both the country as a whole and swing voters disapprove of the job 
the GOP-controlled Congress is doing by double-digit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, made available to The Associated Press, were  
produced in a poll of 800 registered voters taken for the 
Republican National Committee last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, was  
taken in the days immediately following the Littleton, Colo., high 
school shootings and after a month of U.S.-led bombing in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that 55 percent of those polled believe the country is  
on the wrong track, compared to 38 percent who said the country is 
generally going in the right direction. Other surveys in recent 
months have found the opposite -- more people believing the country 
was on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey contains positive news for Republicans: Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole both come out ahead of Vice 
President Al Gore in a hypothetical race for the White House. Gore 
outpolled Arizona Sen. John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	On the congressional front, however, the findings were less  
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters' current issue agenda favors the Democrats,''  
pollster Fred Steeper wrote in an analysis that was circulated by 
the House GOP campaign committee. Education and social security 
rank ahead of seven other issues in importance to voters in the 
current survey. The Democratic Party holds significant leads in 
both issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both tax simplification and tax cuts, an issue area in which  
the Republicans hold the advantage, rank well behind education and 
Social Security,'' Steeper wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis suggested Republicans challenge Democrats on these  
issues, ``rather than relegating them to defensive issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that voters ranked improving education and  
protecting Social Security as the two issues that most concerned 
them. Democrats led Republicans by 21 points on Social Security and 
15 percent on education. 
</P>
<P>
	On Medicare, the survey found that 70 percent of those surveyed  
would vote for a Democrat who favored prescription drug coverage, 
and only 24 percent would vote for a Republican who opposed it 
because it was too costly. Republican opposition ``could be a 
political disaster,'' the findings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have tiptoed into education this year, passing  
legislation to loosen regulations on federal aid to schools. Both 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., have said they wouldn't seek to overhaul Social 
Security unless there was cooperation from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Republicans in Congress have been pushing  
``lockbox'' legislation to safeguard Social Security surplus funds, 
and the poll analysis said that commanded strong support, with 87 
percent in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Also scoring well was a GOP call to allow individuals to invest  
a portion of their Social Security taxes individually. ``The 
individual investment idea is so popular that it is a possible way 
to counter the popularity of increasing the minimum wage,'' Steeper 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation to raise the minimum wage is expected on the House  
floor later this year, and GOP leaders there have signaled they 
will allow an increase to pass as part of a measure that grants 
concessions to businesses that would be affected. A fight to block 
the increase is possible in the Senate though. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found that when asked which idea was a better aid to  
working people, 60 percent favored the individual investment, and 
32 percent chose an increase in the minimum wage.

<HEADLINE>  School Victims Address Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Students who experienced school violence  
firsthand spoke in quiet, nervous tones Tuesday of shootings and 
bomb threats that left them scared and feeling helpless -- and they 
urged House lawmakers to work to prevent such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers made several suggestions to a House subcommittee,  
ranging from more parental involvement to more opportunities for 
troubled students to get counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	They also sparked a discussion of gun control, with one student  
saying parents should not have a gun when there are young people in 
the house. ``There's no reason why a young person should have a 
gun, period,'' said Carla Williams, a student from Sandy Spring, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Atteberry, a student from Thurston High School in  
Springfield, Ore., told how May 21, 1998, started like any normal 
school day when he was visiting with friends as he headed to his 
first class. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know I'm laying down on the ground,  
paralyzed, my head filled by a deafening ringing sound,'' Atteberry 
said. ``I realized something terrible had happened when I saw the 
blood coming out of my side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atteberry, who spent five days in the hospital, said he still  
has a bullet lodged near his spine because doctors feel it would be 
too dangerous to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurston High student Kip Kinkel has been charged in the  
shootings that killed two and injured more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Keene, a senior at Heath High School in Paducah, Ky.,  
said he still feels fear, anxiety and depression from the December 
1997 shooting by fellow student Michael Carneal that killed three 
students and injured five others as they ended an informal prayer 
meeting in the school's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain never leaves,'' Keene said. ``You can hardly control  
yourself sometimes because you're crying so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carneal pleaded guilty but mentally ill to murder and was  
sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The students had suggestions for the lawmakers. For instance,  
Brigid Moriarty of Olney, Md., said children need a place to ``vent 
their anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at other times, they met lawmakers' queries with silence and  
shoulder shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person has a bad heart, you cannot change it; only God  
can change a bad heart,'' said Adam Campbell of Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. That's where two fellow students, Eric 
Harris and Dylan Klebold, fired guns and set off homemade bombs, 
killing 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel our schools have done as well as they can because you  
cannot change or control teen behavior,'' added Campbell, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said Atteberry and Campbell seemed to  
be saying, ```Hey, there's not much you can do.' You don't give 
much hope that you can reach these high-risk kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers had other suggestions regarding school violence, such  
as introducing more moral teachings into schools and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Donald Payne, D-N.J., said that when he was in school and  
students got angry, ``The best you did was have a fist fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., said, ``Gun control laws didn't  
work in Columbine, sadly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others wondered aloud about the causes of school violence, and  
still others said they wanted to do something, but they weren't 
sure what. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing we can't do is give in to the feeling of  
helplessness about this wave that is sweeping across the country,'' 
said Rep. David Wu, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The students testified before the Education and the Workforce  
Committee's early childhood, youth and families subcommittee, 
chaired by Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del.

<HEADLINE> U S West, Global Shares Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Solomon Trujillo and Robert Annunziata have a  
common vision of uniting a conservative Baby Bell and a risky, 
undersea cable network. Unfortunately, some of their investors are 
having trouble seeing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Trujillo, chief executive of U S West Inc., and Annunziata,  
chief executive of Global Crossing Ltd., watched shares of both 
their companies fall Monday after announcing plans to combine their 
telecommunications companies in a complex $37 billion stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are still trying to sort the deal out,'' Robert  
Wilkes, a telecom analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. ``And 
if you don't understand something, the first impulse is to sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U S West Inc., a Baby Bell in 14 West and Midwest states, is  
hooking up with Global Crossing, a Bermuda-based upstart that is 
building an undersea cable network to wire the continents for 
high-speed data and voice communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not intuitively obvious,'' said Kevin Moore, an  
analyst with B.T. Alex Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of U S West fell $4 to $58.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. They stayed down throughout the day, despite a report by 
financial news TV network CNBC that Qwest Communications 
International Inc., the No. 4 long-distance company, may try to 
break up the deal with a counter bid for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	A Qwest spokesman declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Global Crossing, meanwhile, dipped $1.43 3/4 to $59.93 3/4  
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have at times been slow to embrace the rapid  
consolidation and transformation in the telecommunications 
industry, which is quickly becoming entwined in cable, 
entertainment and Internet businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For U S West shareholders, the deal with Global Crossing is a  
big change from the staid business of connecting a call between, 
say, a Denver resident and the dry cleaner downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of existing holders of U S West, who have been  
conservative types, are selling (their shares) because of the 
uncertainty of being associated with a company like Global 
Crossing, which is a new, unseasoned company,'' said Wilkes. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the price for ``out-of-the-box'' thinking.  
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Ebbers, chief executive of MCI WorldCom Inc., for  
example, had similar problems in 1997, convincing shareholders that 
WorldCom could make seven acquisitions in three years, and then buy 
MCI, the No. 2 long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is growing at an even faster pace. Founded by  
Gary Winnick, a Los Angeles financier, Global Crossing went public 
in August and has seen its stock increase sixfold since then. The 
company's deal with U S West is its third in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Annunziata, the founder of Teleport Communications, which was  
bought by AT&AMP;T Corp., joined Global Crossing earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-part deal will start with U S West spending $2.4 billion  
to acquire 9.5 percent of Global Crossing's shares. When the merger 
closes, in the second half of 2000, the two companies will each own 
control half of the new company, which will keep the Global 
Crossing name and be based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	To allay investors concerns about risk, the new company will  
have two tracking stocks. The G-stock will reflect the performance 
of the high-growth Internet assets, while the L-stock will track 
the traditional Ma Bell telephone assets and pay a hefty dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West shareholders will get 1.2 shares in the new company for  
each share they currently own. They will also receive special 
dividends ranging from 24 1/2 cents to $1 in each of the quarters 
leading up to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing shareholders will receive 1 share in the new  
company for each share they currently own. 
</P>
<P>
	With the merger of Global Crossing and U S West, there is only  
one Baby Bell still unwed: Bell South. 
</P>
<P>
	The altar bells may be ringing soon -- in perhaps in another  
unlikely match. 
</P>
<P>
	New technology is changing the way people communicate, forcing  
companies in different industries to come together. Just two weeks 
ago, AT&AMP;T agreed to spend $58 billion to buy MediaOne, the 
fourth-largest cable company, and plans to offer phone service 
through cable wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street is already making bets on who the next targets will  
be. In addition to Bell South, other telecom companies frequently 
mentioned as possible merger partners include long distance company 
Sprint Corp. and wireless phone service company Nextel Inc.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Buys Into HomeGrocer.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- First there was books, then music and video, then  
prescription drugs, pet supplies, auctions and greeting cards. Now 
Amazon.com is placing its bets on the fledgling online grocery 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant Internet merchant announced Tuesday that it will spend  
$42.5 million for a 35 percent stake in HomeGrocer.com, which 
operates an online grocery-delivery service in the Seattle and 
Portland, Ore., areas. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest move by Seattle-based Amazon to build itself  
into an Internet shopping hub. In less than a year, it has gone 
from exclusively selling books to being an online retailing 
powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this signals an ongoing effort of Amazon to capture as  
much wallet share as possible,'' said Michael May, an analyst at 
the New York-based Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. 
``They want to sell as many products to as many customers as they 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Online grocery sales ``are just getting started right now,'' May  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jupiter said that online sales were $63 million in 1997 and are  
expected to rise to $3.5 billion annually by 2002, less than 1 
percent of the total grocery sales tallied nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market is still growing slowly, compared with other  
Internet businesses. Consumers remain apprehensive about buying 
groceries online -- they worry if the tomatoes will be ripe or if 
the chicken will be properly stored for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many sites only offer non-perishable items, which  
means that shoppers still must go to the supermarket to buy milk, 
meats and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	HomeGrocer, however, does offer all types of goods -- more than  
11,000 in total. It operates its own warehouses, unlike 
supermarket-linked online grocery services. 
</P>
<P>
	``The HomeGrocer.com team is literally changing the lives of  
customers by taking the drudgery out of grocery shopping,'' said 
Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. ``They have a fanatical 
eye for customer experience. Their shoppers pick out better produce 
than I could for myself. The delivery people refuse to be tipped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about 10,000 customers in and around Seattle, HomeGrocer  
began service in Portland on Monday and is moving to have 
operations in half a dozen cities by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The next expansion probably will be this summer in California,  
said Beth Gillespie, a company spokeswoman 
</P>
<P>
	For Amazon, the deal could eventually lead to shared delivery  
services, with Amazon including books, CDs and other merchandise in 
HomeGrocer deliveries, especially those to regular customers, May 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon also could get access to customer records and profiles of  
the 14-month-old Web-based grocery operation, which could help 
target potential buyers for Amazon's widening range of products, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	David Risher, Amazon vice president for product development, is  
joining HomeGrocer's board of directors under the deal, the latest 
in a string of splashy investments by Amazon and the second 
high-profile stake landed by HomeGrocer to finance expansion in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barksdale Group, headed by former Netscape Communications  
Corp. President James Barksdale, put $5 million into HomeGrocer and 
took a board seat on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon, the Internet's top seller of books, music and video,  
bought a 46 percent stake in drugstore.com, an online pharmacy 
business in Redmond, in February and a 50 percent share in Pets.com 
in March. One day later, Amazon started an online auction business.

<HEADLINE> `Star Wars' To Premier at Midnight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arriving in a meteor shower of hype and  
dodging reviews from the Dark Side, the new ``Star Wars'' movie was 
set to open, appropriately, when the stars are out, at midnight 
screenings around the country early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best place to be right now in the whole world,''  
said Chris Chaplin, 30, who had a ticket to the midnight show at 
Mann's Chinese Theater but was waiting in line hours before the 
doors swung open to get a good seat. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time. The 
only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to 
approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge,  
unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box 
office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But beyond that you're in 
a very competitive release period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than  
$100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through 
Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' 
for the film-opener crown. ``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 
million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, for No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star  
Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof. 
Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. The 
reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious. 
</P>
<P>
	The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who  
likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who  
called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' 
movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle. Roger  
Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an 
astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the  
entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the 
back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a generation earlier, when 
Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who 
would grow up to become Luke's absentee father. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so  
far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and 
video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons 
beyond recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead  
for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese, where the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22  
years ago, more than 100 people were lined up at midmorning 
Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> Golf Braces for Another `El Nino'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- There is no mistaking the kid.  
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia arrived for his professional debut in America  
toting a bag with the words ``El Nino'' stitched in gold, a stack 
of books to keep up with his homework and a smile for every Texas 
beauty who cooed his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe all the pretty girls,'' the 19-year-old  
Spaniard said Tuesday in accepting an invitation to play the 
Memorial Tournament. ``If they're like this at every tournament, I 
think I'll move here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no mistaking the talent.  
</P>
<P>
	From the left rough in the final round of the Byron Nelson  
Classic, his approach to the 18th green climbed over a tree, faded 
gently toward the green and stopped 10 feet behind the cup. The 
birdie put him in a tie for third -- better than Tiger Woods, Justin 
Leonard and 147 other players in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salesmanship Club of Dallas usually invites only the Nelson  
champion to its volunteers' party after the tournament. This time, 
it asked the kid to come by. Garcia walked in the door to an 
ovation that nearly blew the roof off the tent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once every 10 years, someone like this comes along,'' said  
Jerry Higginbotham, who may have stumbled into a gold mine when he 
was fired as Mark O'Meara's caddie and picked up by Garcia for the 
rest of what could be a fascinating year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a no-miss sign right on his forehead,'' Lee Trevino  
said the day after the Nelson. ``There is no denying this kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where the kid goes from here is anyone's guess.  
</P>
<P>
	An affiliate member of the European tour, he is eligible as a  
captain's pick for the Ryder Cup team. Suddenly, a teen-ager in the 
most pressure-packed event in golf doesn't seem so ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very impressed with his third place,'' European captain  
Mark James said. ``He's been playing pro tournaments for about 
three years, and he's very mature for a 19-year-old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four rounds in relatively easy scoring conditions does not make  
a star, but Garcia clearly has the ingredients -- fearless play, 
composure beyond his years, the short-game magic of Seve 
Ballesteros and the youthful exuberance of Woods three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the youngsters have great appeal. How long he'll hold  
that, I don't know,'' Trevino said. ``I remember one that always 
had a smile on his face and was tipping the hat, and now he's 
burying his clubs in the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia does not want to be compared to Woods, although that's a  
tall order. 
</P>
<P>
	Both had sterling amateur records. Woods' mark is unprecedented  
with his three straight U.S. Amateur titles, while Garcia won the 
British Amateur, was the first European to be low amateur in the 
Masters and had a 37-2 record in match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``His opponents would look at his eyes on the first tee and  
realize they were already 2-down,'' said Garcia's manager, Jose 
Marquina. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods tied for 60th in his first pro start, 11th the next and  
won in only his fifth try. Garcia tied for 25th in the Spanish Open 
and tied for third in the Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	That moved him up to No. 208 in the world rankings. He can break  
the top 100 by winning this week against a field in Germany that 
includes Woods, O'Meara and Ernie Els. It took Woods a record six 
weeks to get into the top 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they compare you with a good player, that means that you  
have something in your game,'' Garcia said. ``But I always want to 
be just myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There may be similarities in style, but a vast difference in how  
they prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods spent two years at Stanford and tested the professional  
waters primarily in the majors. His best was a tie for 22nd in the 
1996 British Open. Of course, that was the year Tom Lehman handed 
his claret jug to Garcia and said, ``Someday, you'll win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia may still be studying for his driver's license, but he  
played 80 amateur events in 20 countries, and 28 professional 
events as an amateur. One of those was the Nike Greensboro Classic 
last year, where he tied for third behind Joe Ogilvie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the whole deal,'' said Ogilvie, who was paired with  
Garcia the first two rounds in the Nelson. ``He'll win soon, and I 
think when he wins it will be by four, five or six strokes. He's 
got a game like Tiger had at the Masters when he blew everybody 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's goal is to get his European tour card and make the  
Ryder Cup team. Even before the Nelson, Ballesteros said the kid 
would be a good pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``New mind, new blood, no fear,'' Ballesteros said.

<HEADLINE>  Kafelnikov Gets Top Seed in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov will be the top seed for the  
French Open despite a recent run of six consecutive first-round 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis, the Australian Open winner, was made the No. 1  
women's seed on Tuesday, ahead of Lindsay Davenport and Monica 
Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Open, the clay-court major that begins May 24, bases  
its seedings on the current rankings of the ATP and WTA tours. 
</P>
<P>
	That accounts for Kafelnikov, who ascended to No. 1 for the  
first time in April, being the top seed, with Pete Sampras second. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a runner-up finish in last week's Italian Open,  
Patrick Rafter moves up to No. 3, with French Open champion Carlos 
Moya at No. 4 and Richard Karjicek at No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The only change to the rankings came after the seedings were  
annouced when American Todd Martin withdrew from the year's second 
Grand Slam tournament with a shoulder injury. With Martin, who was 
seeded 11th, out of the tournament, 17th-ranked Thomas Enqvist of 
Sweden moved up to the 16th seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has played embarrassing tennis since winning the  
Australian Open in January and a tournament in London a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Italian Open, the Russian broke his run of six  
first-round defeats before losing in the third round to Gustavo 
Kuerten. Kuerten won the title in Rome and is seeded No. 8 for 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's draw, defending champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario  
is seeded No. 7. Jana Novotna is No. 4, Venus Williams is No. 5 and 
Steffi Graf is No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Frenchwomen are among the 16 seeds: No. 8 Mary Pierce, No.  
9 Nathalie Tauziat, No. 12 Sandrine Testud and No. 16 Julie 
Halard-Decugis. 
</P>
<P>
	Halard-Decugis, who advanced to the final of last week's Berlin  
Open, gained five ranking spots to capture her first seeding in a 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Open finalist Amelie Mauresmo and Anna Kournikova  
have slipped from the top 16 and will be unseeded at Roland Garros.

<HEADLINE> CFO of Salt Lake Games Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The chief financial officer for the  
committee organizing the 2002 Winter Olympics has resigned, 
president Mitt Romney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark S. Tanner told Romney on Friday that he is quitting to  
become chief financial officer at Salt Lake-based Mrs. Field's 
Cookies on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	While Romney described Tanner's departure as normal turnover for  
a business, others knowledgeable about the situation said Tanner 
felt left out of the loop by the new management brought in after 
the Olympic bribery scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only does Romney describe himself as ``the chief financial  
operator'' for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, but he also 
hired another financial expert as chief operating officer last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a month after taking over in February, Romney described  
mistakes in the $1.45 billion budget that Tanner helped put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	The games will cost about $40 million more because of wrong  
assumptions concerning federal funding and the cost of supplies. 
Information technology also will cost $25 million more than 
budgeted, Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Olympics have been engulfed in scandal ever since  
it was disclosed that members of the International Olympic 
Committee were given cash and other gifts from Salt Lake during the 
city's campaign to land the 2002 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Violence Bill Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican and Democratic senators are at a  
procedural stalemate on gun control legislation only hours before a 
threatened deadline to either pass it or move on to other 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Partisan bickering threatened to torpedo the sweeping bill  
intended to crack down on juvenile violence as senators argued over 
how to change the legislation and accused each other of trying to 
kill it. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing to pass a bill to make it harder for young people to get  
guns and to impose harsher penalties on those who use them in crime 
would seem the last thing Republicans or Democrats want sandwiched 
between the Colorado school shootings and an election year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott threatened to halt  
debate on the bill if Democrats and Republicans cannot agree by the 
end of business today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this juvenile justice bill done,'' Lott, R-Miss.,  
declared from the Senate floor in the fifth day of debate. ``If we 
can't get to some kind of agreement, we're not going to get to a 
conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority leader wants this bill to fade away without a  
roar or a whimper and without any Republican blame,'' said Sen. 
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	That committee's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has worked  
on the bill for two years. It is sweeping in its scope and takes on 
the volatile issue of gun control a month after two Columbine High 
School students in Littleton, Colo., murdered 12 colleagues and a 
teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5 billion bill also addresses other factors of juvenile  
violence, such as prohibiting alcohol sales on the Internet and 
making it easier to prosecute violent minors under laws and 
punishments that apply to adults. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the gun issue, however, that threw the measure into  
jeopardy last week, as Republicans reversed course to require 
background checks of sales at gun shows less than 24 hours after 
passing an amendment making many such checks voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of amendments were still pending, which Hatch said Monday  
would take several days to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Democrats of insisting on dozens of amendments with  
the sole intent of forcing him to stop debate for lack of time, 
then blame Republicans for failing to curb violent children in the 
aftermath of the Colorado episode. In fact, senior Republican aides 
have said, Lott brought the 2-year-old bill to the floor expressly 
to let senators react to the shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats think they've found a good issue,'' Lott said.  
``We've got other legislation we've got to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There will come a time when this bill manager is going to get  
exasperated enough that I'm going to pull every doggone'' part of 
it off the floor for good, Hatch sputtered. ``I'm reaching that 
point. I'm not there yet, but I'm going to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, accused Republicans of refusing their  
amendments to goad them into filibustering the bill to death. Sen. 
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said Lott was trying to force the bill 
down the Senate's throat as he threatens to pull it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have it both ways,'' Wellstone said. ``It's just not  
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Democratic and Republican officials who demanded  
anonymity said Hatch and Leahy were working their way through an 
amendment they will sponsor that could strike compromises on an 
array of questions from gun control to expanding the purposes for 
which states can spend federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The aides reported progress over the weekend, but the amendment  
was not expected to take final shape until today, just hours before 
the Republican-set deadline for a final vote.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Shareholders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Citing strong sales in the first four  
months, DaimlerChrysler raised its 1999 revenue forecast today and 
said it intended to double its income in the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first general shareholders meeting of the newly merged  
automaker, co-chairmen Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton cited the 
strong performance as evidence that transatlantic integration was 
not hampering corporate growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company's extremely positive results confirm our  
commitment to focus on the day to day business,'' Eaton said at the 
start of the company's first shareholder meeting. ``The promises we 
made have not only been kept, they have been exceeded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said revenues were up 9 percent to $49.4 billion  
in the first four months of 1999, compared to the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp said he expected the strong showing to continue through  
1999, enough to raise DaimlerChrysler's sales forecast by $3.2 
billion to $148 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the next 10 years we want to double the revenues,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 15,000 of the automaker's 1.4 million shareholders gathered  
at Stuttgart's Hanns-Martin-Schleyer sports hall today, where 
Daimler-Benz held its annual meetings before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the fancy new Mercedes models on display outside were  
joined by shiny Jeeps and Chrysler minivans -- although the German 
and U.S. brands were kept on opposite sides of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the hall, managers were expected to be grilled during the  
day about another gap -- between U.S. and German executive pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, U.S. executives make much more than their German  
counterparts because their base salary is supplemented by bonuses 
and stock options, which can be extremely lucrative when the 
company is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Eaton took home $16 million in salary, bonus and stock  
options from Chrysler while his Daimler counterpart, Schrempp, 
earned less than $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has proposed its own stock option plan for top  
executives, but left it off the agenda until next year, saying only 
that ``remuneration would be discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, it has instituted a complicated ``phantom  
stock'' plan that awards top managers the right to share in the 
profits when the company's stock appreciates. That will allow 
DaimlerChrysler to raise total compensation for executives without 
having to seek shareholder approval and risk criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	A leftist umbrella group of 250 ``critical shareholders'' called  
Schrempp's salary ``shameless'' on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Group spokesman Alexander Dauensteiner estimated Schrempp's  
annual pay at $2.9 million or about $333 an hour ``whether he's 
lying in bed or leading a board meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, though, worry that if DaimlerChrysler doesn't keep U.S.  
pay levels competitive, it could result in a drain of high-level 
U.S. managers. 
</P>
<P>
	While many shareholders had expected the new company to embrace  
U.S. disclosure standards, DaimlerChrysler didn't release the 
compensation plans of its five top-paid executives in the group's 
1998 annual report. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Dubiel, of the U.S.-based Institutional Shareholder  
Services, believes DaimlerChrysler tries to have the best of both 
worlds: ``It seems like they are adopting U.S. pay and German-style 
disclosures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with housekeeping chores like appointing an auditor and  
electing the supervisory board, shareholders also are expected to 
raise questions on Daimler's defense industry contracts and issue 
demands to make cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars.

<HEADLINE> Toyota To Recall 800,000 Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling nearly 800,000  
cars, including 2,700 in its expensive Lexus line in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, Japan's biggest carmaker, will recall 797,707 vehicles  
made between July 1995 and August 1998, spokeswoman Michiko Ueda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Japan's second-largest auto recall after one by Nissan  
Motor Corp. in May 1996 that affected more than 4 million vehicles, 
Kyodo News agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toyota recall affects 10 models, most available only in  
Japan. But one model is also sold in the United States and Britain 
as the Lexus GS300. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those in the U.S., the recalled Lexus cars  
include 2,200 in Britain, Ueda said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars have a faulty connection in the suspension that can  
make them undriveable. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing all the cars will take about three months and cost about  
$110 million, Ueda said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lexus GS300 is sold in Japan as the Crown, where it is  
widely used by taxi drivers and police departments.

<HEADLINE> Avs Defense Overwhelms Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The game was only 12 seconds old when Detroit  
forward Sergei Fedorov skated into the left circle and fired a hard 
shot that Patrick Roy turned aside. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last clean shot the Red Wings would have at the  
Colorado goaltender for a long, long time Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Detroit finally scored, late in the second period,  
the Avalanche already had built a 4-0 lead. They would eventually 
win 5-2, ending Detroit's hopes for a third consecutive Stanley Cup 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so sad to see it end,'' Detroit forward Brendan  
Shanahan said. ``I hate to see the Cup going someplace else this 
year. That's going to be the hardest part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly believed we were going to win this, even being down  
3-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were several keys to Colorado's ability to eliminate the  
Red Wings in six games, but two stand out: defense and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit was frequently frustrated by the Avalanche's trapping  
defense. And when the Red Wings did get through, there was Roy, 
looming larger with each passing period as Colorado came back from 
an 0-2 start to win the next four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, no team's going to win 10 Cups in a row,'' Shanahan  
said. ``We got big breaks the years that we won it. This time, we 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sad skating off, knowing we weren't going to win it  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After losing the first two games on their home ice, Colorado  
coach Bob Hartley asked the Avalanche players to stop taking so 
many dumb penalties -- and they did. 
</P>
<P>
	It also didn't help the Red Wings that goaltender Chris Osgood  
had a gimpy right knee, although that didn't seem like much of a 
factor while backup Bill Ranford was winning the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings also played Games 3-5 without center Igor  
Larionov, out with a broken pinky on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to stay healthy and get lucky,'' Detroit forward Doug  
Brown said. ``Those were a couple of elements we had in the past 
that we didn't have this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit won the first game 3-2 in overtime and skated to a 4-0  
win in Game 2, also in Colorado. But it was all Avalanche after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado scored three goals in a span of 2:15 en route to a 5-3  
win in the third game and took a 6-2 win in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood, not yet 100 percent, came back, but the series returned  
to Denver where the Avalanche won 3-0 in the fifth game as Roy 
earned his 12th career playoff shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great team,'' Roy said. ``They should be proud of  
themselves. It's not easy for them, but they've done a great job 
these past four years. They lost to New Jersey in the (Cup) finals, 
they lost to us in the conference finals and they won two Stanley 
Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course they should be proud of themselves.''  
</P>
<P>
	Colorado went 2-4 at home and 6-0 on the road in the first two  
rounds of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The home ice didn't mean anything, obviously for us,'' Detroit  
coach Scotty Bowman said. ``We battled down the stretch (during the 
regular season) with Colorado. Even with our (personnel) changes, 
we never could catch them. They always seemed to be four or five 
points ahead of us.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez Hit Streak at 30 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arizona's Luis Gonzalez extended his  
hitting streak to 30 games with a two-run, first-inning home run 
off San Francisco's Chris Brock on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-game streak matches the longest this decade, set in 1997  
by both Boston's Nomar Garciaparra and Cleveland's Sandy Alomar 
Jr., then again last year by Baltimore's Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez's streak is the longest in the National League since  
Jerome Walton also hit in 30 straight in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez becomes the 37th player in major league history to have  
a hitting streak reach 30 games. Eleven of those failed to get a 
hit in their next game.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Euro, Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen and the  
euro Tuesday after failing to maintain a bounce after the Federal 
Reserve announced it was leaning toward raising interest rates in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen also was boosted by statements by the International  
Monetary Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, who expressed 
optimism about Japan's prospects for recovering from its worst 
recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But considering where the dollar was 24 hours earlier, ``We're  
really talking about flat trade,'' said Lisa Finstrom, a senior 
currency futures analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0680 in late trading in New York, up  
from $1.0665 late Monday. The dollar fell to 123.20 Japanese yen 
from 123.49 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Markets Committee met Tuesday but did not  
announce any changes in key interest rates as a way to control the 
still chugging U.S. economy and the possibility of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	It warned, however, of a ``need to be alert'' to possible  
inflationary pressures and thus the Fed's action. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent the dollar higher against the yen and the euro. Stocks  
and bonds plummeted just after the announcement, with the Dow Jones 
industrial average falling from 60 points higher to down 110 
points. Higher interest rates can support a country's currency but 
lighten returns on equities and Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds mostly recovered, with the Dow down 16.52 at  
10,836.95 at the close. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar already was marginally weaker against the yen and  
euro before the Fed announcement. Investors had taken profits with 
the dollar up 3 yen and somewhat higher against the euro since May 
10. In addition, Camdessus' remarks helped put a platform under the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar had traded on a pretty firm tone so positioning  
took a little out of the dollar's sail'' ahead of the announcement, 
Finstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4989 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.5030, and 1.4654 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4593. The British pound rose to $1.6207 from $1.6184. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the euro countries are no longer traded separately  
and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8312 German marks, down from 1.8339; 6.1425 French francs, down 
from 6.1501; and 1,811.59 Italian lire, down from 1,814.88.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Merger Moves Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The proposed $5 billion merger between  
Unum Corp. and Provident Companies Inc. moved forward Tuesday as 
the Federal Trade Commission announced an agreement to resolve its 
antitrust concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 4-0 vote, the FTC accepted the agreement that calls for the  
merged insurer, UnumProvident, to make its historical data on 
individual disability claims available to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC had alleged that the merger would violate antitrust laws  
by eliminating competition between two of the leading providers of 
disability coverage and increasing the likelihood of collusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Unum in Portland and Provident in Chattanooga,  
Tenn., said the agreement keeps the merger on track to be completed 
by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of the merger hailed the consent agreement as a victory  
for consumers that will ensure more competition, a wider range of 
products and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly what I've been working on for the past six  
months,'' said George Ginthner, an insurance broker from Buffalo, 
N.Y., who sought unsuccessfully to intervene in next month's merger 
hearings before insurance regulators in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginthner said he hoped the FTC would have blocked the merger,  
``but realistically, that wasn't in the cards. The FTC didn't feel 
that the domination of the market was overwhelming. Obviously, I 
think it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, UnumProvident would be required to supply  
claims data solicited by the Society of Actuaries and other 
industry groups. The FTC noted that the merger would lessen the 
incentive for the combined company to submit data that would be 
shared with others. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirement, which is to remain in force for 20 years, would  
ensure that adequate claims data is available to current 
competitors and new entrants into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC set a 60-day public comment period. The deal also  
requires approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
shareholders of the two companies and insurance regulators in 
Maine, South Carolina, New York and Delaware -- states where Unum 
has a major presence.

<HEADLINE> Scalpers Peddle `Star Wars' Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As if shelling out up to $9 for a movie  
ticket isn't rough enough, how about spending $100 -- or more? 
</P>
<P>
	It's what scalpers are asking for tickets to Wednesday's opening  
of the ``Star Wars'' prequel as they peddle seats to screenings 
long sold out across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible,'' said Tom Sherak, head of 20th Century's  
domestic film group. ``This is just what we didn't want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director-producer George Lucas and 20th Century Fox initially  
decided against advanced ticket sales to prevent scalping, but 
relented under pressure from theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
	When tickets went on sale May 17, each customer was limited to  
12 tickets, although there has been no formal way to stop scalpers 
from returning to snag more tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition for tickets has been especially fierce on the  
Internet. The online auction house eBay has posted hundreds of 
listings for tickets to ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace'' whose face value had doubled or tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a $8.50 ticket to the first showing in a theater in  
Bellevue, Wash., was up for bids starting at $15.00. Two seats at 
an advance showing of the film in Washington, D.C., were bidding at 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice, however flagrant, should have no effect on the  
movie's take at the box office, said Paul Dergarabedian, an 
entertainment analyst with Exhibitor Relations Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a ticket is being scalped, it had to be bought first. The  
theaters are basically going to sell every ticket that's 
available,'' he said. ``The loser is the moviegoer, who gets lost 
in the shuffle and will have to pony up a lot of money to see this 
film.''

<HEADLINE> Bank One Bets on Internet for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bye-bye, brick and mortar. Hello, virtual  
banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Bank One Corp., the nation's fifth-largest bank,  
said Tuesday that the trend of mergers and consolidation in the 
banking industry is giving way to the Internet as the surest future 
source of profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, itself the product of a merger last year, is moving  
quickly to become a national player in Internet banking with a 
comprehensive array of services that most banks have yet to offer, 
the executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow your customer,'' Bank One chief executive  
John McCoy said. ``I've always loved this business for the last 20 
years, but we aren't going to be like that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related announcement, First Union Corp., the sixth-largest  
bank, announced it is realigning its senior executive team and 
appointing an 18-year bank veteran to take charge of its electronic 
commerce businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	David Carroll, now president of First Union of Florida, will  
become executive vice president in charge of Internet and 
``alternative delivery channels'' -- businesses that the bank called 
a key corporate priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll has been credited with leading First Union's ``Future  
Bank'' strategy that offers banking by telephone, computer and 
automatic tellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to fully leverage the various skills we have  
throughout First Union to build an Internet strategy and capability 
second to none in the financial services arena,'' said John 
Georgius, First Union president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking executives across the nation are tentatively exploring  
their options for virtual banking. The explosion of Internet use 
and the rise of such Wall Street darlings as the retailer 
Amazon.com and Charles Schwab Corp.'s online brokerage has many 
reexamining whether the concept of acquiring more branches, 
automated teller machines and banking satellites is the way to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	One Internet bank, Netbank Inc. of Alpharetta, Ga., has become a  
major player in just a year. With just 42 employees, the company 
had profits last year of $4.5 million on sales of $18.8 million. 
Because of its low overhead, it has signed up thousands of 
customers by offering higher interest rates on CDs and other 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Bank One was created last year through the  
combination of First Chicago NBD Corp. and Banc One Corp. It has 
about 2,000 branches in 14 states, mostly in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	It recently launched www.bankone.com, a site offering customers  
the chance to open and review accounts, receive and pay bills 
online, apply for credit cards and loans, invest online, buy 
insurance and get news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The features make it one of the most comprehensive banking sites  
in the nation, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers them the opportunity to provide their services  
anywhere (in the world),'' Salomon Smith Barney analyst Henry 
Dickson said. ``Right now, that might not be the most profitable 
way of doing things, but it's something they have to offer because 
it's another way to reach customers who want convenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One is betting it can vault into national consciousness by  
signing long-term agreements with Internet portal companies such as 
Yahoo! and Excite Inc. Portals are the entry points for users to 
venture onto the Internet. The agreements guarantee that Web 
surfers looking for Internet banking on those sites will be 
directed to Bank One. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One also expects to sign up additional credit card  
customers online. It will generate additional revenue from customer 
fees for online banking. And it will collect fees from companies 
that will sell insurance and other products on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bank One merger was completed late last year, McCoy  
said it would be at least 18 months before he considered acquiring 
another bank. Even after that period is up, an acquisition may not 
be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what is happening on the Internet, I'm not sure that we  
will ever have to buy another bank,'' he said. ``There may come a 
time where we don't need to provide the brick and mortar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Union has about 2,400 branches in 12 states, mostly on the  
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Under First Union's ``Future Bank'' program, customers use a  
telephone or computer to get information about account balances, 
advise whether checks have cleared, or transfer money between 
accounts. Customers also can apply for loans by phone or get help 
with investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it's too early to tell just how much banks can  
profit from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot will depend on how efficiently they offer products and  
whether increased competition will cause fees to fall and thereby 
lower profits, they say. Most predicted, however, that banks will 
need to maintain some branches for those customers who want to do 
their business face-to-face.

<HEADLINE> Inventors Scammed of $60 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Ten people were charged Tuesday with  
scamming thousands of inventors out of more than $60 million by 
failing to deliver on promises to help patent and market their 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said no invention was ever brought to market by the  
defendants, who allegedly were connected to a network of companies 
that swindled 34,000 inventors nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patenting and marketing services they provided were  
worthless,'' U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said. ``The big dreams of 
small inventors were exploited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies at the center of the investigation sent mass  
mailings nationally, promising to help inventors patent and market 
their inventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the inventors came up with such ideas as a  
man's suit that could be air conditioned with cool water, a stomach 
exercise machine, a tritium night-vision scope for rifles, and a 
``binge buster fork'' with a tiny timer that signals when to stop 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is in these 34,000, there were probably some very  
good ideas,'' Stern said. ``I'm not sure about the air-conditioned 
suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the companies told inventors they were very  
selective about the inventions they promoted, but in fact accepted 
nearly all of them. They would routinely tell inventors that their 
ideas were worth at least $30,000 and then ask for promotion and 
marketing fees of up to $10,000, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing studies provided by the companies were allegedly  
boilerplate, without analysis specific to each invention. 
</P>
<P>
	In federal indictments unsealed Tuesday, prosecutors named  
Ronald Boulerice, 60, as leader of the network. He was president 
and owner of American Inventors Corp., of Westfield, which closed 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Boulerice also controlled American Institute for  
Research and Development; Massachusetts Patent Services; Washington 
Financial Group; and United Patent and Trademark Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The others charged -- including John Samson, 59, who was vice  
president of American Inventors and president of American 
Institute; and Boulerice's twin daughters, Laurie and Lisa 
Boulerice, 35 -- occupied a range of positions for the companies, 
from top management to salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulerice faces the heaviest load of criminal counts, including  
mail fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and tax evasion. He could 
face 135 years in prison if convicted of all charges, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent Tuesday and was held overnight. Samson, who  
also pleaded innocent, was released on $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventors have lodged multiple lawsuits against the businesses.  
Prosecutors said they will seek return of the inventors' money, but 
doubt that much of the money can be recovered.

<HEADLINE> Texas Classes To Resume After Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLEN, Texas (AP) -- When the board of the Allen Independent  
School District convened its regularly scheduled meeting, the only 
real item on the agenda was an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after administrators canceled the remaining two weeks  
of school because of a rash of bomb threats, the superintendent 
changed course Monday by rescheduling classes on a staggered 
schedule today. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision did not sit well in the Dallas suburb. Some parents  
were angry about the mixed messages and said they might not send 
their children back for the final two weeks of classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only concern is that this wasn't done Friday,'' said Joe  
Bellino, an organizer of a parents group called Concerned Parents 
for Safe Schools. ``Board members, I'm sorry, but you dropped the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School superintendent Barbara Erwin said the board's decision  
last week had only meant that normal class schedules were canceled 
for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	That distinction may have been lost on the public, as parents  
struggled to get an answer to simple questions like when their 
children might return their text books or take a final exam. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Erwin said the school district will operate on a staggered  
schedule during the next two weeks, with no more than one-third of 
the district's pupils attending on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Port Huron, Mich., classes resumed under tight  
security Monday at Holland Woods Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Four students, ages 12 to 14, were arrested last week and  
charged with conspiring to kill students and teachers with guns and 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	One mother, Sandy Sigman, dropped off her 13-year-old daughter,  
Amanda, and said she was ``disgusted and saddened and angry that we 
have come to a point when our kids are scared to come to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan investigators said they did not know whether there was  
any link between the accused plotters and a pipe bomb found outside 
the school Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, a homemade bomb exploded in a trash can in the  
Ankeney Junior High School cafeteria in Beavercreek, Ohio, a suburb 
of Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	A security guard and a janitor who handled the device after it  
exploded got minor chemical burns on their hands. A 16-year-old boy 
was charged with inducing panic. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Minturn, Colo., an eighth grader has been suspended after  
students told the principal she planned to acquire guns and shoot 
up the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old girl's name was not released. No criminal  
charges had been filed Monday, authorities said. Minturn is about 
75 miles east of Denver.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Put on Back Burner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite prodding from some GOP rank and file  
lawmakers, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Tuesday campaign 
finance legislation isn't likely to reach the House floor before 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get the appropriations process done sooner, if we get a  
lot of things off our table and there's an empty spot there, it 
could be sooner. But it doesn't look like it right now,'' the 
Illinois Republican said in an interview in his Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other changes, the legislation would eliminate so-called  
soft money -- large, unregulated donations that political parties 
and others solicit to finance political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have been seeking support for a petition to force the  
issue to the floor, but no Republican has signed it, and without at 
least some GOP support, it cannot prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP advocates of campaign finance overhaul legislation  
met with Hastert recently to urge him to move up his schedule for 
floor action, but came away without a commitment. Some referred to 
the petition at the meeting, and one, Rep. Zach Wamp of Tennessee, 
said afterward he had told Hastert, ``Please don't put me in the 
position of having to sign the discharge petition. But I would like 
to stay consistent, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Hastert said it was the right of any advocate  
of campaign finance legislation to sign the so-called discharge 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Because they deal with the flow of legislation to the House  
floor, such petitions are customarily organized by members of the 
minority party, and lawmakers from the majority party who sign them 
are viewed with displeasure by their own leadership and most party 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is, I've given folks a promise that they will  
have their legislation on the floor in September. ... If that's not 
soon enough for them, then they have a right to do something 
else,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've given them a commitment and my word to do it, and I  
intend to stand by that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and other Republicans have expressed concern that  
outlawing soft money could cause serious damage to Republicans in 
political campaigns, since labor unions would still be permitted to 
provide assistance to Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., a prominent supporter of campaign  
finance legislation, wrote Hastert during the day to urge him to 
allow votes on the bill before the Memorial Day recess at the end 
of this month or early next month.

<HEADLINE> Philly Mayor Candidate Remains Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- There's been no brotherly love lost in the  
race to be Philadelphia's next mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates have dredged up racial animosity, hinted at  
fiscal irresponsibility and aired negative TV ads with embarrassing 
images almost two decades old. And those are just the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters went to the polls today to choose among five Democrats  
who hope to succeed Edward G. Rendell as mayor of the nation's 
fifth largest city. The winner will face businessman Sam Katz, who 
was unopposed in today's Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Big-league political consultants have been involved in the race,  
which experts say could be one of the most expensive mayoral 
contests in U.S. history, running up to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Weinberg, who is white, emerged from obscurity a few  
months ago to mount a serious challenge to former City Council 
President John F. Street, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls showed another black candidate, former state welfare  
secretary John White Jr., 50, gaining momentum in recent weeks. The 
other two candidates are state Rep. Dwight Evans, 45, who is black, 
and Happy Fernandez, 60, a former council member who is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, 62, making his first bid for elective office, expects  
to do well in the blue-collar rowhouse neighborhoods of this city 
of 1.5 million people, more than 40 percent of them black. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, eight of every 10 white Philadelphia voters have  
voted for white candidates. Blacks have shown a greater willingness 
to cross racial lines, but they also tend to vote most often for 
other blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more registered blacks than whites in the Democratic  
Party, although precise numbers are unreliable since city voters 
don't have to declare their ethnicity on registration forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, who used a nearly $4 million advertising campaign to  
move from last place in the polls into a close second, has employed 
a hard-nosed strategy that some criticize as mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
	He sent a flier to voters that featured a picture of a bullet on  
the cover and said: ``Protect your family. Elect Marty Weinberg 
mayor. Not John Street!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg also began running television advertisements that use  
18-year-old images of Street, then a young councilman and community 
activist, shoving a television reporter to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In another ad, Street is shown throwing water in the face of  
police officer. Each advertisement asks: ``John Street for mayor? 
You decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg has also run commercials that cite Street's past  
financial problems, including bankruptcy, and ask voters, ``Does 
this sound like someone who should be in charge of $2.7 billion?'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a campaign stop Monday, Weinberg told reporters his  
commercials are taking their toll on Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hurting him,'' Weinberg said. ``His handlers of the last  
few years have tried to clean him up. It doesn't sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders have responded by repeatedly urging one or two of  
the black candidates to drop out of the race in order to give the 
third a better shot at winning. 
</P>
<P>
	They even sent a letter to Evans that said: ``By remaining in  
the election campaign you are one of Martin Weinberg's greatest 
assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street, who had stayed relatively positive throughout the  
campaign, finally responded over the weekend with a TV commercial 
accusing Weinberg of racial divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of this city are tired of the negativity,'' said  
Street, 55. ``They're going to punish the negativity. They're just 
not buying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the GOP's Katz also has gone negative, unleashing attack  
ads against Weinberg and White. U.S. Rep. Robert Brady, the 
Philadelphia Democratic chairman, recently called the spots 
``gutter politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a very nasty and very dirty campaign,'' said  
Rendell, who oversaw Philadelphia's recent economic recovery but is 
barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He has endorsed 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates have spent some time tackling more substantive  
issues, including the city's wage taxes, education, crime and 
Rendell's legacy.

<HEADLINE> Education Plan Will Ensure Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Education Secretary Richard W. Riley says the  
administration will propose that school districts receiving federal 
funds for poor students be required to make sure all schools have 
the same class-size ratios, qualified teaching staff, course 
offerings and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Monday marking the 45th anniversary of a landmark  
school desegregation ruling, Riley said the plan -- among others to 
be announced Wednesday -- would narrow gaps between the rich and 
poor and between minority and white students. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals would involve changes in the Elementary and  
Secondary Education Act, a 34-year-old law Congress is expected to 
renew this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is incumbent upon us to build upon the legacy of Brown,''  
Riley said, referring to the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. 
Board of Education of Topeka, Kan. The ruling ended deliberate 
racial division of the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Although schools with high poverty and minority student  
populations had made some strides, those schools also offer fewer 
classes that help prepare their students for college, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House conference Monday, Americans for a Fair Chance  
and other civil rights and student groups pledged to improve 
programs that encourage women and minority students to attend 
college.

<HEADLINE>  India's Gandhi Quits Party Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sonia Gandhi resisted appeals from  
bereft supporters Tuesday to retract her resignation as leader of 
India's once dominant Congress party, leaving the party in turmoil 
four months before a national election. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi quit Monday after a revolt by three party leaders  
who said her Italian birth was a political liability and questioned 
her suitability to be prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside her high-security mansion, hundreds of supporters  
shouted slogans and burned effigies of the three leaders -- Sharad 
Pawar, Purno Sangma and Tariq Anwar. Riot police pushed back huge 
crowds trying to force their way into Mrs. Gandhi's home to beg her 
to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Shocked by Mrs. Gandhi's dramatic resignation, Congress  
officials across the country flooded her with their own 
resignations, saying they too would quit if she didn't reverse her 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those who have met Sonia Gandhi have come back with the  
impression that she is quite firm in her resolve not to reconsider 
her decision,'' Congress Party spokesman Ajit Jogi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist  
Bharatiya Janata Party introduced the issue of Mrs. Gandhi's 
foreign birth, saying they would make her Italian origins a 
campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Congress party dissidents then followed with a demand  
that India's Constitution should be amended to allow only citizens 
born in India to become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Editorial writers portrayed Mrs. Gandhi's resignation as a ploy  
to solidify her support in what they described as a power struggle 
between her and a faction led by Sharad Pawar, a veteran regional 
political boss from Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Gandhi was unlikely to withdraw her resignation until the  
challenge to her leadership within the party was resolved and the 
dissenters compromised,'' said The Pioneer newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A split in the Congress party appeared a possibility. Several of  
Mrs. Gandhi's supporters said they expected Pawar to break away 
from the Congress and ally with leftist and centrist groups after 
the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Mrs. Gandhi is expected to travel to Sriperumbudur  
near the southern city of Madras where her husband, former Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated by a suicide bomber during 
a 1991 election rally. That pilgrimage had been expected to launch 
her election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With elections scheduled for September, the disarray in the  
Congress party has further set back its campaign, which had already 
been harmed by recent blunders. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Mrs. Gandhi tarnished her image as a national leader  
when she was perceived as being responsible for toppling Vajpayee's 
government. She then failed to assemble an alternative coalition, 
forcing the country into an unwanted election, and critics in her 
party blamed her for mismanaging the affair.

<HEADLINE> Post-Partum Depression Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Emory University researchers have found that  
depression in new mothers could have a long-term effect on their 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
	They reported Monday that both depressed mothers and their  
babies have increased amounts of the hormone cortisol in their 
blood -- an indication of stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortisol levels in the babies systems remained high months  
later, even after the mothers received treatment and their own 
hormone levels returned to normal, Dr. Yolanda P. Graham said at a 
convention of the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	She said having high cortisol levels can make people vulnerable  
to overreacting to stress later in life and that the infants in the 
study will be followed to see whether their hormone levels 
eventually drop to more normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called postpartum depression affects 10 percent to 20 percent  
of new mothers. Several studies have shown changes in the behavior 
of children, including infants, as a result of contact with the 
depressed mother, the Emory researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham explained that depressed mothers tend to react in one of  
two ways, either by ignoring their new baby or by overcompensating 
-- smothering it with attention. Either behavior can cause stress 
for the baby, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Her study involves 14 mothers who suffered postpartum depression  
and she wants to increase that to 20. She also is looking at a 
similar number of mothers who did not suffer depression.

<HEADLINE> Nursing Home Chain To Lay Off 7,300 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- One of the nation's largest nursing home  
operators says deep cuts in Medicare reimbursements forced 7,300 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Mariner Post-Acute Network, which also announced a  
second-quarter loss of about $79 million on Monday, said the 
layoffs will occur in the 29 states in which it operates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariner, which has 400 nursing homes with 50,000 beds, plans to  
eliminate 11 percent of the jobs in its work force of 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 300 (layoffs) are corporate, the rest are rehabilitation  
therapists,'' company spokeswoman Kym Spell said Tuesday. ``We are 
not closing any homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Mariner stock tumbled 20 percent Tuesday, or by 56 1/4  
cents, to close at $2.12 1/2 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariner officials cited Medicare caps on the amount of physical,  
occupational and speech therapy patients can receive in a year in 
its decision to close Boston-based subsidiary Prism Rehab Services. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were dedicated employees providing superb rehabilitative  
care to thousands of Medicare beneficiaries,'' said Keith B. Pitts, 
Mariner's chairman and CEO. ``These were difficult decisions for 
our company, but the government's cuts left us no other choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes nationwide are reeling from Medicare changes in  
which they get paid fixed daily fees for treating patients rather 
than being reimbursed for the actual cost to the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariner says it now receives $90-a-day less per customer.  
</P>
<P>
	Mariner was formed last year in a merger between Atlanta-based  
Paragon Health Network and Mariner Health Group of Connecticut. The 
bulk of its operations are in Texas, California, Florida and North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs are expected to be complete by May 31.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Disapproval of Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are well-positioned on education and  
Social Security, the two issues the voters care most about, 
according to an internal GOP poll that also says it could be ``a 
political disaster'' for Republicans to oppose prescription drug 
coverage for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that in the months since President Clinton's  
impeachment trial ended, congressional Republicans have whittled 
away at their deficit against Democrats in a hypothetical election 
matchup, and now trail by 4 percentage points. At the same time, 
both the country as a whole and swing voters disapprove of the job 
the GOP-controlled Congress is doing by double-digit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, made available to The Associated Press, were  
produced in a poll of 800 registered voters taken for the 
Republican National Committee last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, was  
taken in the days immediately following the Littleton, Colo., high 
school shootings and after a month of U.S.-led bombing in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that 55 percent of those polled believe the country is  
on the wrong track, compared to 38 percent who said the country is 
generally going in the right direction. Other surveys in recent 
months have found the opposite -- more people believing the country 
was on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey contains positive news for Republicans: Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole both come out ahead of Vice 
President Al Gore in a hypothetical race for the White House. Gore 
outpolled Arizona Sen. John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	On the congressional front, however, the findings were less  
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters' current issue agenda favors the Democrats,''  
pollster Fred Steeper wrote in an analysis that was circulated by 
the House GOP campaign committee. Education and social security 
rank ahead of seven other issues in importance to voters in the 
current survey. The Democratic Party holds significant leads in 
both issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both tax simplification and tax cuts, an issue area in which  
the Republicans hold the advantage, rank well behind education and 
Social Security,'' Steeper wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis suggested Republicans challenge Democrats on these  
issues, ``rather than relegating them to defensive issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that voters ranked improving education and  
protecting Social Security as the two issues that most concerned 
them. Democrats led Republicans by 21 points on Social Security and 
15 percent on education. 
</P>
<P>
	On Medicare, the survey found that 70 percent of those surveyed  
would vote for a Democrat who favored prescription drug coverage, 
and only 24 percent would vote for a Republican who opposed it 
because it was too costly. Republican opposition ``could be a 
political disaster,'' the findings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have tiptoed into education this year, passing  
legislation to loosen regulations on federal aid to schools. Both 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., have said they wouldn't seek to overhaul Social 
Security unless there was cooperation from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Republicans in Congress have been pushing  
``lockbox'' legislation to safeguard Social Security surplus funds, 
and the poll analysis said that commanded strong support, with 87 
percent in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Also scoring well was a GOP call to allow individuals to invest  
a portion of their Social Security taxes individually. ``The 
individual investment idea is so popular that it is a possible way 
to counter the popularity of increasing the minimum wage,'' Steeper 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation to raise the minimum wage is expected on the House  
floor later this year, and GOP leaders there have signaled they 
will allow an increase to pass as part of a measure that grants 
concessions to businesses that would be affected. A fight to block 
the increase is possible in the Senate though. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found that when asked which idea was a better aid to

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kyriacos Demetriou, a haircutter whose  
old-fashioned barbershop was recreated in the Museum of the City of 
New York when he retired three years ago, died Friday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Mr. Kay, Demetrioutook over the Broadway Barbershop in  
the 1950s. The shop, founded in 1904, was the oldest in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers and magazines described Mr. Kay, who gave lollipops  
to his younger customers and straight-razor shaves to his older 
ones, as a throwback to the days before unisex salons, stylists and 
blow-driers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Kay's barbershop, with its old, shiny appliances and a radio  
tuned to a classical station, was visited by numerous celebrities. 
He told of cutting Yul Brynner's hair -- when the actor had hair. He 
also trimmed and shaved Humphrey Bogart and George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Kay, who was born in Cyprus but grew up in England, began  
working as a shoeshine boy outside a barbershop in London's West 
End before learning to cut hair. In his 20s, he won a contest 
selecting England's best barber. He moved to New York shortly 
before World War II.

</P>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Alfredo Dias Gomes, author of some of  
Brazil's best soap operas and the screenplay for the only Brazilian 
film to win the Cannes Film Festival's top award, died Tuesday in a 
car crash. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	A taxi carrying the writer and his wife made an illegal left  
turn and collided with an oncoming bus. His wife and the taxi and 
bus drivers had minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dias Gomes wrote the screen play for ``O Pagador de Promessas''  
(The Payer of Vows), which in 1962 won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes 
Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best known of his several highly popular soap operas  
was ``Roque Santeiro,'' which was banned by the country's military 
regime in the 1970s because it painted an unflattering picture of 
an army colonel. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Robert Goldman    	
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Four-time world bridge champion Robert ``Bobby''  
Goldman, who also won 19 North American titles and was influential 
in shaping the form of competitive tournaments, died Sunday of a 
heart attack. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman, who didn't take up bridge until attending Drexel  
University, moved to Dallas in 1968 to join the Dallas Aces, a 
professional team formed to compete for world titles. Goldman 
represented the United States from 1969 to 1974, winning world 
championships in 1970, 1971, and 1979, and mixed teams in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman taught bridge and supported the game through Internet  
sites as well as authoring several books on the game, helping to 
shape the way that competitive bridge is now played. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Thomas E. Johnson    	
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Thomas E. Johnson, a reporter for more than a  
decade for the Amarillo Globe-News, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, 
The Associated Press and The Dallas Morning News, died Thursday 
night. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's father became managing editor of the Globe-News in  
1949, and the younger Johnson worked with him there during his 
school years. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson joined the staff of the Avalanche-Journal in 1961. He  
later worked at Associated Press bureaus in Austin and Washington. 
The Morning News hired Johnson in 1968, and he covered everything 
from crime to personality features. 
</P>
<P>
	He received an award for outstanding journalism achievement from  
the Southwest Journalism Review, two awards for continued 
excellence from the Headliners Club in Austin and a reporting award 
from United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson left the Morning News in 1973 to work as a freelance  
writer. He later taught computer programming and became a computer 
programmer for Credit Suisse-First Boston in New York and Boston. 
He retired earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son, a daughter and two sisters.

                            *John Parris    	
</P>
<P>
	SYLVA, N.C. (AP) -- John Parris, a journalist who chronicled  
mountain life for The Asheville Citizen-Times after stints as a war 
correspondent in World War II, died Monday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Parris began his newspaper career at age 13, covering sports for  
the weekly Jackson County Journal. Parris worked for United Press 
International and The Associated Press in London and New York 
during the war, when he landed with troops in North Africa. He 
returned home and resumed his newspaper career covering athletics 
at Western Carolina University. 
</P>
<P>
	Parris was best known for columns entitled ``Roaming the  
Mountains'' that ran in the Citizen-Times for 42 years. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Joseph F. Smith    	
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Joseph F. Smith, a former congressman, state  
senator and Philadelphia Democratic Party chairman, died Friday of 
respiratory failure. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith once satisfied labor leaders who questioned his decision  
to run for Congress on the Republican ticket by saying, ``Look, I'm 
Joe Smith today, I was Joe Smith yesterday, and I'll be Joe Smith 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the state Senate in 1970, where he served for  
10 1/2 years. He spent 1 1/2 years in Congress after a special election 
to fill a vacant seat. He lost the seat to Rep. Thomas M. Foglietta 
when reapportionment forced them to run against each other.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened mixed. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is down eight points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a slim lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up three points and the S&AMP;P 500

</P>
<P>
	The meeting began within the past hour, but we aren't expected  
to hear from the Fed until shortly after 2:15 Eastern time this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Fed usually announces any decision it makes

<HEADLINE> Mutual Funds Not Trendy Any More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was bound to happen sooner or later: Mutual  
funds aren't trendy any more. 
</P>
<P>
	After enjoying a long vogue as the bull-market place to be,  
funds have lately shown signs of falling out of fashion. They look 
slow and stodgy to some fast-money traders who now aim for quicker 
payoffs trading stocks directly on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retail investor is seeking new ways to invest,'' says  
Steven Eisman, financial services analyst at the investment banking 
firm of CIBC World Markets. ``Day trading through Internet brokers 
has attracted individual investors away from mutual funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But before you rush to jump on this ballyhooed bandwagon, stop  
to reflect on your long-term goals and how you set out to 
accomplish them in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	To some thoughtful observers, the recent market action that has  
enticed people into direct trading actually makes funds more 
appealing than ever, reinforcing the case for the diversification 
they provide. 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, the stock market of the past few months appears  
to have been a benign environment. Through early May, the broad 
indexes of stock prices -- the Wilshire 5000 and the Russell 3000 -- 
showed gains for the year of about 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But beneath that relatively calm and happy facade, the markets  
have experienced fierce turbulence as money has jumped in and out 
of individual stocks and industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rapid gyrations and rotation that have characterized the  
equity market in recent months have tended to shorten the time 
horizon of many investors,'' says John L. Manley Jr., a strategist 
at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. ``Volatility tends to feed on itself, 
drawing investors into a short-term trading mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This can dramatically increase the risks an investor faces.  
After the first quarter of 1999, for example, it seemed clear that 
blue-chip growth stocks, the big winners in '98, were trouncing 
small stocks again. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in April, small-stock indexes outperformed the  
blue-chip-dominated Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rapid rotation in market preferences serves as a reminder  
of the importance of remaining diversified,'' says Jeffrey Molitor, 
an analyst with the Vanguard Group, the second largest fund firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large-cap growth stocks have done so well for so long -- and  
value, small-cap and international investments have performed so 
weakly -- that some investors began to question the wisdom of 
diversifying,'' Molitor observes in a commentary at Vanguard's Web 
site (www.vanguard.com). ``Why keep money in bonds or international 
or value stocks when nothing can catch the performance of the 
market's largest, most influential companies? 
</P>
<P>
	``But investors forget that it's very tough to call the timing  
of when the market will turn and favor a different sector or style. 
When the market moves, it can move so sharply that trying to make 
any type of timing call is pretty foolish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, no trading. How about simply buying and holding one or two  
individual stocks with bright promise, rather than putting your 
money in a fund that may hold 75 or 100 stocks or more? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, consider the misadventure that befell professional  
investors enamored of one promising stock, McKessonHBOC Inc., which 
late last month said its past earnings had to be restated downward. 
``The market opened and the stock was cut in half,'' notes the 
money-management firm of Cohen, Klingenstein &AMP; Marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our newest holding,'' the firm said in a regular  
letter to clients. ``It was in the immediate past issue of this 
newsletter that we explained about what we liked about the company 
and why we bought it. 
</P>
<P>
	``During April,'' the firm added, ``the large-cap growth indexes  
were virtually unchanged. Yet among the 32 stocks in our portfolio, 
15 moved more than 10 percent during the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``For most of these stocks there was no important news to  
justify such a revaluation of a firm's worth. Fortunately, of our 
big movers, 10 were up and five were down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, diversification paid off in spades. Concludes  
Molitor at Vanguard, ``if you start out with a fundamentally sound 
program that reflects your long-term objectives and time horizon, 
the market's twists and turns won't keep you up at night.''

<HEADLINE>  Riley Says He Won't Revamp Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat practice court was empty, and the  
players headed for home after meeting with their coach one final 
time. Pat Riley leaned back against the bleachers and surveyed the 
silent gymnasium, a long offseason staring him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 48 hours earlier, Riley was shouting to be heard above  
the din at Miami Arena. Now his words reverberated off the gym 
walls, and he sounded angry, arrogant, defiant and determined. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no need to revamp the roster, Riley said, and no need to  
sulk. He characterized the Heat's season-ending Game 5 loss Sunday 
to the New York Knicks as a temporary setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not despondent, because I don't want the players to be  
that way,'' Riley said Tuesday. ``It's the end of a year, but I've 
recovered. I am full of spit and vinegar today. I'm ready to 
roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Riley actually laughed. But he frowned when discussing  
criticism that the team has underachieved and should be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	``While you're looking for heads to roll, there will be nobody's  
hide and there will be nobody's head rolling,'' he said. ``I have 
incredible faith in my personnel, period. To win a championship? 
Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley defended Tim Hardaway and Jamal Mashburn, who played  
poorly in the first-round series that saw the eighth-seeded Knicks 
knock off the top-seeded Heat. He said he wants aging free agents 
Dan Majerle and Terry Porter to return next season. And he noted 
that the Heat would still be playing if not for Allan Houston's 
last-second basket Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One bounce of the ball with eight-tenths of a second left in a  
game is not going to deter me from staying with these guys,'' Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will augment the talent we have on this team. Somewhere  
along the way we may make one deal that helps us. We might. But I 
will not give away core players to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley passed up a chance to acquire Latrell Sprewell this year  
and Mitch Richmond last season, both times because of his 
reluctance to trade power forward P.J. Brown. Now, there's 
speculation that only center Alonzo Mourning will be off limits in 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Considerable criticism has been directed at Hardaway, who shot  
27 percent against the Knicks and was shut out in the second half 
of the final game. But Riley said he wants the 32-year-old point 
guard back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a bad series. That doesn't mean he should go to  
Siberia,'' Riley said. ``You've got to be realistic about what 
Tim's done for this team over the last 3 1/2 years. He had a bad 
series. Instead of burning him at the stake, you should have more 
compassion for one of our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said the Heat need better leadership and more maturity,  
but it can come from the current roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think our players police each other enough. It's been  
left to me, and I do a good job of it. But that isn't the way it 
works in an ideal situation,'' he said. ``When it comes to being a 
great team, there's a rite of passage when a coach can look at his 
guys and know they'll take care of business on their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, notorious for his demanding training regimen, said  
offseason workouts will be the most strenuous yet. He noted that 
because of the NBA lockout, his team has played in only four of the 
past 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This summer is going to be unlike any they've ever had,''  
Riley said. ``We will make this team better. We will find something 
to help. But I think we have enough right here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The hiring of a respected sports marketing  
company to recruit more 2002 Winter Games sponsors was a smart 
move, according to the chairman of the International Olympic 
Committee's coordination commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss lawyer Marc Hodler, whose allegations of bribery against  
his colleagues triggered the biggest Olympic scandal in history, 
said he has little doubt Salt Lake City can recover. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to the hiring of International Management Group,  
which handled sponsorship sales for the 1992 Winter Games in 
Albertville, France, the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, 
and the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never let me down,'' Hodler said of Cleveland, Ohio-based  
IMG, which he has dealt with for decades as the senior IOC member 
and the former head of the international skiing federation. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG has agreed to recruit sponsors for the SLOC and U.S. Olympic  
Committee, and will be paid only on commission for any sponsors it 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler is in Salt Lake City with 17 other members of the  
coordination commission to scrutinize budgets, venues and plans for 
the games that begin on Feb. 8, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the commission's priorities, he said, is to help  
the scandal-tarnished organization find ways to raise more money 
and cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	He endorsed SLOC President Mitt Romney's approach of winnowing  
down the main budget to the essentials and planning to spend for 
frills only if the revenue comes through. The SLOC is still 
operating from a $1.45 billion budget, although a hiring freeze and 
other frugalities are already allowing the committee to delay 
borrowing from a line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney has said he will ask the IOC this week to renegotiate its  
contract to cut SLOC's hosting costs; to defer royalty payments on 
merchandise, sponsorships and tickets; and to let SLOC go after 
technology sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City has had some good news recently; a sponsor and  
two suppliers last week signed letters of intent that could be 
worth $30 million. But the committee is still saying it is $350 
million short of revenue to meet the full budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am quite certain there will be no problem,'' Hodler said.  
``We have the same interest in our present position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Jean-Claude Killy, the Olympic ski champion and now IOC  
member from France, the coordination commission's financial task 
force was briefed Monday by SLOC officials on their problems 
raising money from jittery sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy met with three experts who are reviewing SLOC's books: IOC  
financial director Thierry Sprunger; Bjorn Brenna, head of finance 
for the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer; and Pat Glisson, 
Atlanta's financial chief for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he was pleased with progress the IOC has made in  
dealing with the scandal and repeated that Salt Lake City was a 
victim of unscrupulous committee members and agents promising 
blocks of votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler did not admit to any regret for blowing the whistle on  
corrupt IOC members last December -- a move that led to the 
resignations of SLOC's vice president and president, the purge of 
10 IOC members, wrenching reform at IOC and six separate 
investigations. The Justice Department and Utah attorney general's 
office are still investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed previous reports that Dave Johnson, then the  
No. 2 official of SLOC and a bid leader, telephoned him last Nov. 
19 or 20 to tell him ``some important documents'' regarding a 
scholarship program were stolen from the committee and turned over 
to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `What should we do?'''  
</P>
<P>
	Days later, KTVX-TV broke the news that Johnson sent a letter to  
the daughter of the late IOC member Rene Essomba of Cameroon, 
ending a $10,000-a-year scholarship. That was the first documented 
proof of abuse of power within the IOC and the first element in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had heard rumors for a long time, but we never really had  
facts,'' said Hodler, who helped write the IOC's old ethics code. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Johnson, a longtime friend, told Hodler  
IOC members were involved. Hodler said he was told there were no 
direct cash payments. He said he advised Johnson to ``come 
completely clean'' and was ``disappointed'' when it was later 
revealed Johnson lied to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages left for Max Wheeler, Johnson's lawyer, were not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said he hoped to meet with Johnson while in Salt Lake  
City.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover Bone Mass Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Scientists have discovered a gene that appears to  
control bone density, opening the way to possible new treatments 
for crippling osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the biotechnology company Chiroscience R&AMP;D  
found the gene in a small group of South Africans suffering from an 
inherited disease that is the opposite of osteoporosis -- these 
patients can die because their bones grow too dense and large. 
</P>
<P>
	A mutation in the gene appears responsible for making bone grow  
out of control. Chiroscience hopes to harness the protein this gene 
produces and turn it into a drug that might increase the bone mass 
of people with osteoporosis, the disease that makes bones brittle. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing a drug, however, takes years -- and osteoporosis  
experts urged caution Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More immediately, doctors who treat Afrikaners, South Africans  
of Dutch descent who suffer from sclerosteosis, the large-bone 
disease, hope the discovery will lead to a genetic test to help 
their patients in planning children. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have found is really the holy grail of bone biology,''  
said Chiroscience researcher Jeffrey Van Ness in announcing at a 
biotechnology meeting here that the company had successfully mapped 
the ``bone mass gene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while this may be the first gene discovered in the complex  
process of bone building, nobody knows what role it could play in 
osteoporosis, said Dr. Conrad Johnston of Indiana University, an 
adviser to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. He cautioned that 
many genes may play a role in osteoporosis, and that studies of 
other large-bone diseases have found more bone is not always better 
-- sometimes it's fracture-prone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly if you discover a gene that increases amounts of  
bone, it is very interesting and should lead to lots of good 
research,'' Johnston said. But ``whether it will lead to any 
treatment is highly speculative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osteoporosis afflicts 10 million Americans, mostly elderly  
women. They're at risk of severe injury, such as breaking a hip, 
along with chronic pain and stooped posture as spinal vertebrae and 
other bones fracture. The disease costs $14 billion annually in 
medical bills and lost productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone is living tissue: Cells called osteoclasts dissolve  
worn-out bone while other cells called osteoblasts replace it with 
new bone. During childhood, new bone builds faster than old bone 
dissolves. People hit their peak bone mass in their mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
	But as people age, bone removal exceeds new bone formation. When  
that happens too fast, or when people didn't build up enough strong 
bone when young, osteoporosis results. 
</P>
<P>
	Some treatments, including estrogen and the popular nonhormonal  
drug Fosamax, can slow bone loss and help restore a little bone. 
But no drug can reverse osteoporosis by building large amounts of 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sclerosteosis is an incurable rare disease that is the opposite  
-- bones, even the skull, grow very dense. By middle age, skull 
pressure often causes incurable headaches, even sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiroscience worked with Dr. Peter Beighton of the University of  
Cape Town to study the genes of a small group of Afrikaners with 
sclerosteosis. Only a few other people around the world have ever 
gotten the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Afrikaners who suffer from it inherited a mutated bone mass gene  
from each parent. Chiroscience pinpointed the problem gene on 
chromosome 17, mapped it and say they discovered that a single 
mutation appears to be the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	Beighton said in a statement that creating a genetic  
sclerosteosis test should be a priority so Afrikaner couples will 
know if they're at risk. About one in 20,000 are thought to be, and 
two Afrikaner children are born with sclerosteosis every year. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging a test was possible, Chiroscience on Tuesday  
stressed efforts to try to turn the gene's protein into a drug to 
help grow bone in osteoporosis patients.

<HEADLINE> Deere Profit Falls 56 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Second-quarter profits for Deere &AMP; Co., the  
world's largest farm-equipment maker, tumbled 56 percent as 
depressed commodity prices led to slower sales of its more 
profitable combines and tractors. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended April 30, net income fell to $150.1  
million, or 65 cents a share, from $365.2 million, or $1.45 a 
share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings still exceeded Wall Street expectations of 60 cents  
a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 15 percent to $3.47 billion from $4.07 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Deere said it has reduced production of high horsepower,  
high-margin equipment as a result of the Asian economic crisis that 
has sharply reduced demand for farm commodities and in turn cut 
into farm income. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moline, Ill.-based company said it expects worldwide sales  
of all its equipment to fall by 18 percent to 20 percent this year 
from last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's earnings came a day after farm equipment makers  
Case Corp. and New Holland NV announced plans to merge into a $12 
billion company that would put the combined venture on a sales par 
with Deere. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin-based Case focuses on the larger horsepower tractors  
and combines for big farmers; New Holland makes smaller tractors 
and hay and forage equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Deere were down 31 1/4 cents to $40.50 in late morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

	NATO: Serbs May Be Hiding Evidence  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO officials said today there is  
growing evidence that the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan 
Milosevic is digging up mass graves and trying to hide the evidence 
of war crimes against Kosovo Albanians. David Scheffer, a U.S. 
ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, also said the evidence 
was increasing that the Serbs have used ethnic Albanians as human 
shields during the NATO air campaign that began March 24.

	Clinton Won't Rule Out Ground Force  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that NATO allies  
``will achieve our objectives one way or the other'' in the 
conflict with Yugoslavia and he refused to rule out any option, 
including using ground troops. But Clinton said the air war has 
``accomplished quite a bit,'' and the White House has maintained 
that Clinton has no intention of deploying ground troops. The 
statement came amid reports that Britain was pressing NATO to 
consider a ground attack.

Yugoslav officials say President Slobodan Milosevic's government is 
``open'' to G-8 proposals for ending the nearly 2-month-old 
conflict with NATO and is ``ready to cut a deal'' if the alliance 
stops the bombing. The G-8 plan calls for an international security 
presence in Kosovo, which the Western powers interpret as a 
well-armed military force with NATO at its core.

speaking fees. Gore and his wife, Tipper, reported assets worth at 
least 1.4 million. Elizabeth Dole was one of two Republicans to 
released financial reports. The former head of the U.S. Red Cross 
and the wife of the former Kansas senator, Dole reported assets of 
$6.5 million, most of which was derived from stocks.

<HEADLINE> Indian Skeletons Returned to Tribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The bones of nearly 2,000 American  
Indians were handed over to a New Mexico tribe Tuesday by Harvard 
University for proper burial, decades after they were brought here 
for study. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest and perhaps the most scientifically  
significant transfer under a 1990 law federal that requires the 
return of Indian artifacts, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great joy,'' Ruben Sando, a lieutenant governor of  
Jemez Pueblo, said during a ceremony for the return of the remains. 
``I am very, very grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bones -- as well as burial objects that will be returned from  
Phillips Academy in Andover next week -- were excavated between 1915 
and 1929 from the site of an abandoned Pueblo Indian community in 
the upper Pecos Valley of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	For 70 years, scientists at Harvard's Peabody Museum of  
Archaeology and Ethnology pored over the bones in one of the first 
systematic studies of a population ever conducted. The bones were 
important for research into nutrition, trauma and disease, 
particularly osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones and the burial objects -- which included clothes,  
pottery, toys and porcelain -- helped form the foundation of 
scientific knowledge about the early cultures of the American 
Southwest, according to James Bradley, director of the museum at 
Andover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ancestors have contributed significantly to science and  
the archaeological world,'' said Raymond Gachupin, governor of the 
Pueblo of Jemez. ``We also feel good about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pueblo Indian community had been a thriving trading center a  
century before archaeologist Alfred V. Kidder began digging. It was 
eventually decimated by disease and warfare. Kidder uncovered 
artifacts and bones dating from the late-12th to the mid-19th 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	After the federal Native American Graves Protection and  
Repatriation Act took effect in 1990, Bradley moved to return the 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sent them a letter and said, `We have a lot of your  
stuff,''' Bradley said. ``They said, `We know. Let's talk.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Years of negotiations and preparation followed, culminating in  
Tuesday's ceremony with representatives of the Pueblo of Jemez 
tribe and the commissioner for New Mexico Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Reburial will take place privately Saturday in the Pecos  
Monument National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the University of Nebraska returned 1,700 sets of  
remains to various tribes, a move criticized by some scholars as 
harmful to further research.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Says GOP Must Face Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenging Vice President Al Gore to debate  
Social Security, Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes said 
Tuesday that GOP candidates must begin addressing key issues or 
risk losing to Democrats in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's have an open, honest conversation,'' Forbes said in a  
speech to small business owners. ``Not here in Washington, but in 
the heart of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes warned fellow Republicans that they must begin addressing  
issues that are important to the American people, particularly in 
light of a GOP poll made public Monday which indicated a belief 
among voters that Republicans were not focusing on issues that they 
care most about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans may climb a mountain simply because it is there,''  
Forbes said, ``but they will not vote for a political party simply 
because it is there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' proposal to replace Social Security with a private  
retirement system follows his call in March for reforming the 
health care system. He plans to detail his vision of conservatives' 
role in the 2000 election during a speech Wednesday in New York. He 
speaks this weekend in Georgia on education reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller said the series of speeches  
reflects Forbes' basic campaign plan: Build a good organization and 
then focus on the ``politics of substance.'' Many of Forbes' 
opponents, most notably front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush and 
Elizabeth Dole have been criticized for not discussing 
substantively issues like Social Security and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes called a Clinton administration plan to reform Social  
Security ``pension fund socialism.'' He challenged Gore to debate 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech -- which echoed many themes from his failed 1996  
presidential bid -- Forbes called for the privatization of Social 
Security. He said those who wanted to continue using Social 
Security system would be able to. He also stressed that the 
government must provide a safety net for all citizens, regardless 
of their participation. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' plan would use the Social Security surplus to help  
establish a new system of personal savings, or Personal Retirement 
Accounts, and take the money in the trust fund ``off-budget'' so 
that Congress could not appropriate it for any other purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	By allowing people to invest their retirement funds privately,  
Forbes said the potential returns, both monetary and otherwise, are 
far beyond what the current system of government withholding 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
	It would create ``the kind of real, personal wealth that could  
lift millions of Americans out of poverty and give their children a 
head start in life,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal includes ending a tax penalty for those who  
continue working between the ages of 65 and 69. People who work 
beyond regular retirement age lose some benefits if their 
work-related earnings exceed a ceiling set this year at $15,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes argued that by allowing people to invest their retirement  
funds in the stock market, it would allow ``people, not the 
government to own it.'' He also stressed that placing funds in the 
market would prove more lucrative than the current system, despite 
the inevitable ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you're not doing well, over time, you'd still come out  
ahead,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that these retirement savings, and the ability to  
bequeath them to children or a spouse would be ``the biggest 
empowerment issue we've seen in years ... even bigger or as big as 
home ownership.''

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Congratulate Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- World leaders heartily congratulated Israel's  
prime minister-elect, Ehud Barak, signaling international belief 
that his Labor-led government will push forward the Middle East 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your success brings hope for peace,'' French President Jacques  
Chirac said in a message to Barak. ``I am convinced that with your 
support, decisive progress will be made in the coming months that 
will lead in the direction of the much-desired peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke of his renewed hopes for  
the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is someone I know well, admire hugely,'' Blair said in  
Sofia, Bulgaria, where he was on a two-day tour of the Balkans. 
``It is a remarkable result which gives him the mandate to move 
forward the peace process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, a former Israeli military chief of staff, unseated  
Benjamin Netanyahu in national elections Monday. Half an hour after 
TV exit polls projected a double-digit lead for Barak, Netanyahu, 
49, conceded defeat and said he would also step down as Likud Party 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasser Arafat, who watched the TV broadcasts at his headquarters  
in Gaza City, said he hoped Barak would push peace forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the choice of this democratic election and I give my  
best wishes to Mr. Barak,'' Arafat said after meeting with U.S. 
diplomats to discuss the results. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton telephoned Barak and Netanyahu, who he praised  
as having worked to improve relations between Israel and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to working closely with Ehud Barak and his new  
government as they strive to reach that goal with their Palestinian 
and Arab partners,'' Clinton said in a White House statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest umbrella organization of American Jewish groups  
congratulated Barak and urged him to focus his efforts on uniting 
the people of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that together we strive to heal the divisions  
and end the strife that are so detrimental and costly,'' the 
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations 
said in a letter to Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Barak's election raises  
``high expectations'' for new momentum in Middle East peacemaking. 
Schroeder said Barak was coming to power at a time when ``courage, 
decisiveness and initiative'' were needed to move peace efforts 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters that he  
hoped Barak would achieve peace with the backing of the Israeli 
people, Kyodo News agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have my hopes on the new prime minister's abilities,''  
Obuchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government expressed ``heartfelt congratulations,''  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said. ``We hope the election 
of Barak can promote the Middle East peace process,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Help Curb Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of U.S. Customs officials pursuing  
Internet sex predators and other cyber-criminals would triple under 
a spending bill a House panel approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, promoted by Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., would  
boost spending for Customs' Child Pornography/Child Sexual 
Exploitation Program from $2.4 million to $10 million in 2000, 
allowing it to increase its current staff of 26 by 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who exploit children on the Internet think they can  
hide in cyberspace,'' said U.S. Customs Commissioner Ray Kelly. 
``They are wrong. We will find them and bring them to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old Customs program, which led to 228 arrests last  
year, concentrates on international Internet sex predators and 
traffic in child pornography. It turns over to the FBI domestic 
cases that it uncovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's such a proliferation of child pornography on the  
Internet that law enforcement can't handle it,'' said Senior 
Special Agent John MacKinnon, who demonstrated at a news conference 
the many Web sites and chat rooms used by sexual predators. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited  
Children, there are 10,000 Web sites maintained by pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has also introduced legislation that would make it  
easier for Customs to use wiretaps to obtain evidence against 
pedophiles and those involved in child sex tours. ``I'm absolutely 
not concerned with entrapment,'' she said. ``Child pornography is 
illegal in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-pornography money is part of a bill authorizing $2.4  
billion in fiscal year 2000 and 2001 for Customs Service drug and 
other enforcement activities. The measure was approved by the House 
Ways and Means trade subcommittee by a 9-6 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The funding, more than $400 million above what the  
administration requested, provides $311 million over two years to 
place 1,745 new Customs employees along the borders and at major 
drug and money-laundering locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs spending bill easily passed the House last year but  
never cleared the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's bill eliminates language in last year's that would  
have required the Customs Service to change collective bargaining 
and duty rotation policies, which met strong opposition from the 
National Treasury Employees Union. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and the union still protest provisions in this  
bill that Republicans said would bring the overtime and night 
differential pay of Customs officers in line with other federal 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is counterproductive to penalize the very people you are  
asking to do the critical job of reducing the flow of drugs onto 
our streets and into our schoolyards by cutting their pay,'' union 
President Robert Tobias said.

<HEADLINE> Pessimism Abounds About Beef Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Efforts to defuse the United States'  
confrontation with Europe over restricted U.S. beef exports are 
unlikely to prevent American retaliation, the top official of the 
World Meat Congress said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe has been working to keep out American beef for 11  
years. They've really dug in their heels on the issue. It would be 
uncharacteristic for them to change now,'' said Philip Seng, 
president of the U.S. Meat Export Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Seng also oversees this year's congress as head of the  
International Meat Secretariat, which defends producers' interests 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the key opponents in the decade-long dispute -- the  
European Union's Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler and U.S. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman -- address the conference of 
officials from 30 meat-producing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men are expected to hold talks Wednesday and Thursday on  
the conference's fringes. 
</P>
<P>
	American resolve to punish the EU for its refusal to accept  
hormone-treated U.S. beef was underlined Tuesday with a formal 
application to the World Trade Organization to approve $202 million 
in retaliatory tariffs on EU imports June 3, the WTO's deadline for 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Seng considers U.S. retaliation inevitable.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think at this point there's any point in compromise.  
All the scientific studies, and all the different WTO judgments, 
have gone 100 percent in our favor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation EU has banned imports of hormone-treated American  
beef since 1989, and last week ignored a WTO edict to start 
accepting the product immediately. The EU is insisting on proof 
that the U.S. techniques, designed to boost the volume, quality and 
flavor of beef, don't pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Len Condon, vice president for international trade for the  
American Meat Institute, estimated U.S. beef producers lose $500 
million in trade to Europe -- more than double the U.S. government 
estimate.

<HEADLINE> 'Great Santini' Author Honors Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Pat Conroy has written a tribute to the father he  
vilified in ``The Great Santini,'' the novel that launched his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Conroy wrote in the June issue of Atlanta magazine that his  
military pilot father, Don Conroy, changed for the better after the 
book came out in 1976. The elder Conroy died of colon cancer a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father answered my first novel by setting out to prove I  
was a liar of the first magnitude,'' the author said. ``He worked 
night and day in turning himself into a father even his own 
children would love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time Conroy has written publicly about his  
reconciliation with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Conroy made his father notorious as the model for the title  
character of ``Santini,'' a tough, disciplinarian military pilot. 
Robert Duvall played the character in a movie based on the novel.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Future in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins wrote a memorable  
chapter in their intriguing history this season. Too bad for them 
it was Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddled with millions of dollars in debt rung up under owners  
Howard Baldwin and Roger Marino, the Penguins filed for bankruptcy 
in October, borrowed to get through the season, then prayed for the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
	They nearly got it.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite an avalanche of distractions, including Hall of Famer  
Mario Lemieux's bid to bail them out of bankruptcy, the Penguins 
surprised top-seeded New Jersey in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins then were in position to eliminate Toronto, only to  
lose the final three games. Two were in overtime, both at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The end -- and it might be permanent -- came with Monday's 4-3  
overtime loss on former teammate Garry Valk's overtime goal at 
1:57. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the save must come not from goaltender Tom Barrasso, but  
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the judge, and the dozens of creditors who are owed  
anywhere from $26 million (Lemieux) to a few thousand dollars (a 
limousine company), can save the 32-year-old franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	If they approve Lemieux's reorganization plan by June 24, the  
Penguins will remain in Pittsburgh. If not, the court could choose 
a NHL plan that calls for an unidentified buyer -- presumably, 
billionaire Paul Allen -- to buy them for $85 million and relocate 
them, probably to Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally don't want to leave this city,'' defenseman Jiri  
Slegr said. ``I like it. But it is a part of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, I'm coming to Pittsburgh for training  
camp in September,'' forward Rob Brown said. ``In my heart, I'll be 
in Pittsburgh next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will the Penguins?  
</P>
<P>
	If this was their last season in Pittsburgh, at least they left  
behind memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Depleted not just in dollars but in talent following the  
offseason departure of Ron Francis, they probably would have been 
satisfied just to make the playoffs. They did much better. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL scoring champion Jaromir Jagr further emerged as the  
league's dominant player in the post-Lemieux and, now, post-Wayne 
Gretzky era. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Jagr, the Penguins were mostly without their  
customary cast of stars (Lemieux, Francis, Kevin Stevens, etc.) So 
they improvised, getting a career year from Martin Straka, a 
one-time castoff who made the All-Star game; and a big lift from 
rookie Jan Hrdina, who wasn't expected to make the team but became 
the No. 1 center. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Kovalev finished with 53 points after being dealt in  
November for longtime holdout Petr Nedved. Robert Lang and former 
career minor leaguer Kip Miller made major contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine also succeeded in selling defense to a  
team once known only for scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins slipped to the final spot in the conference  
playoffs by finishing 2-8-2. That sent them against top-seeded New 
Jersey, and the Penguins seemed destined for their third straight 
first-round elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr delivered a gutsy effort in Game 6, returning from a  
four-game layoff with a groin injury to score the tying goal late 
in regulation and the winner in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins won Game 7 in New Jersey to reach the second round  
for the first time since 1996. They won Game 1 in Toronto and were 
up 2-1 in the series, only to give back home-ice advantage by 
losing Game 4 at home in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins were timid in losing 4-1 in Game 5. They were  
anything but in storming to their quick lead in Game 6. Goaltender 
Curtis Joseph kept it from being much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group, at any point during the season, could have latched  
onto a reason to not do well,'' Constantine said. ``They refused to 
ever latch on to a real, legitimate excuse because they wanted to 
win a Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, perhaps, a city has begun to realize those cold winter  
nights might be much emptier without the former Stanley Cup 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to leave Pittsburgh,'' Jagr said. ``It would be  
sad.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Woman Wins Right To End Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who was left paralyzed from the  
neck down after being shot by her mother won the right Tuesday to 
be taken off life support. If she dies, her mother could face 
murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgette Smith, 42, can be removed from the ventilator keeping  
her alive after 5 p.m. Wednesday, Judge Richard Conrad ruled. He 
said that will give prosecutors time to take testimony from her 
before she dies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Smith has made a difficult choice, a choice which she has  
the right to make,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Lucerne Medical Center, Lisa Schultz, said the  
hospital will comply with the order. Ms. Smith's daughters, 
22-year-old Candace Smith and 19-year-old Joeleen Hill, supported 
their mother's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith's lawyers had asked the judge last week to let doctors  
disconnect the ventilator, saying she didn't want to go on living 
in her condition. The judge met with Ms. Smith and studied her 
medical history to make sure that she was mentally competent to 
make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said they will probably seek a murder  
indictment against Shirley Egan if her daughter dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan's lawyer, Bob Wesley, objected to the request to end  
life support because of the state's plan to present murder charges 
to a grand jury if Ms. Smith dies. However, he told the judge ``Ms. 
Egan does not want to see her daughter suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith can speak with some effort but is unable to swallow  
and needs a feeding tube. She has no control over her bladder or 
bowels and runs a high risk of pneumonia, infections, ulcers and 
bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan, 68, is already charged with attempted murder. She  
allegedly shot her daughter in the neck in March after overhearing 
talk about putting her in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith and her boyfriend had been caring for Ms. Egan, who is  
frail and blind in one eye. Investigators said Ms. Egan also fired 
at the boyfriend but missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators spent 45 minutes questioning Ms. Smith at the  
hospital just before the judge's decision.

<HEADLINE> Woman Seeks To Outlaw Infidelity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Inspired by President Clinton's tryst with  
Monica Lewinsky, a divorcee fed up with unfaithful spouses wants to 
make infidelity a crime in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Adulterers in California, which has a no-fault divorce policy,  
could be forced to make a public apology and pay for therapy if 
voters approve her ballot proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Onate-Palacios wrote the initiative because of the  
suffering she believes infidelity has caused people -- including 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-married 52-year-old woman hasn't told her husband  
about it, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have plans to tell him. But how am I going to tell him?  
He'll say, `You're crazy,''' Mrs. Onate-Palacios said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been married to her current husband for six years.  
</P>
<P>
	The presidential sex scandal had ``just a little bit'' to do  
with the proposal, said the mother of two. Infidelity has been an 
issue for her in the past, but she wouldn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Onate-Palacios paid the required $200 initiative filing  
fee, but she doesn't have any money to wage a campaign. When 
forwarded to the secretary of state, she will have to gather 
419,250 voter signatures to get it on next year's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for volunteers,'' she said. ``If this goes ...  
(potential adulterers) are going to be thinking twice about it. I 
think there are going to be millions who believe in my idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting the proposition on the ballot could be difficult, as  
Californians have never been much for legislating morals, Field 
Poll director Mark DiCamillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem to me to conform to the main tenet of  
Californians' attitude, which is a kind of openness, sense of 
tolerance and acceptance of lifestyles,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Put Beck on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Chicago Cubs closer Rod Beck, on the 15-day  
disabled list with a bone spur in his pitching elbow, said Tuesday 
he's not confident in his rehabilitation program and would just as 
soon have surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm not on the DL and they want me to rest, that's one  
thing. But it seems like a waste of two weeks,'' Beck said before 
the Cubs's game against the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs placed Beck on the disabled list following Monday's 8-1  
victory over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck has said surgery is inevitable, but expressed hope before  
being deactivated that he could postpone it until the offseason. 
Those sentiments had changed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided for it. They've decided against it,'' Beck said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trainers will work with Beck on a program of heat and stretching  
in an attempt to improve the elbow's range of motion. He won't 
throw during the rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see if not throwing for a while helps. If it does, we  
can hold off any surgery,'' manager Jim Riggleman said. ``If after 
a period of time that's sufficient he still feels bad, then we'll 
probably have surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck would miss 8-to-12 weeks if he undergoes surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	``In most situations, you do what you can to avoid surgery,''  
Riggleman said. ``A lot of times, guys pitch all year when they 
know surgery's inevitable. Then you clean it out during the 
offseason and you can be available all next season as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck is 2-4 with four blown saves and a 10.54 ERA. He was booed  
Sunday at home, when he retired just one of four Atlanta batters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bone spur is an old injury that dates to Beck's days in San  
Francisco. Riggleman said Monday the Cubs knew about it when they 
signed him to a one-year, $4 million deal before last season. After 
Beck's 51 saves helped Chicago to the NL wild-card berth, he signed 
for two more years at $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said he never considered having the problem corrected  
between seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go see doctors just to see doctors,'' Beck said. ``You  
don't say when you've saved 30 games a year, `Let's go fix it.' If 
you're effective, you don't mess with it. But now I'm not 
effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman said right-hander Terry Adams likely would get the  
first call in a closing situation, with lefty Felix Heredia also 
getting opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs also have tried unsuccessfully to acquire Rick Aguilera  
from the Minnesota Twins.

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad Mulls De La Hoya Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Felix Trinidad has a $10 million offer to fight  
Oscar De La Hoya -- and not much time to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Bob Arum says he will withdraw his offer to Trinidad  
for a Sept. 18 unification bout with De La Hoya if the IBF 
welterweight champion doesn't accept it by 8 p.m. EDT Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Trinidad doesn't agree, Arum said De La Hoya will go ahead  
with a rematch against Ike Quartey on the same date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone to the limit,'' Arum said. ``We really want to make  
this fight. I think Don King wants to make this fight. But it looks 
like Trinidad's father doesn't want to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum sent King, Trinidad's promoter, a letter last week offering  
the $10 million plus $6.00 for every home above 1 million that buys 
the fight on pay-per-view for a fight that would unify Trinidad's 
title with the WBC 147-pound title held by De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said Tuesday he hasn't heard back from King, and is making  
plans to substitute Quartey for Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a situation where I'm offering him more than anybody  
who has ever fought Oscar has gotten,'' Arum said. ``For the 
opportunity to beat De La Hoya and become the premier welterweight 
in the world, I really should be charging the guy instead of paying 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father, Felix Trinidad Sr., said last week he wasn't  
happy with the $10 million offer and suggested that Trinidad would 
not fight De La Hoya for that purse. 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz said Tuesday that King wants to make  
the fight and will pursue a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya defends his title Saturday night against Oba Carr,  
and Arum said he would have Quartey at the fight to announce a 
rematch of their Feb. 21 fight if Trinidad doesn't agree to the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quartey is ready to get on a flight and come here,'' Arum  
said. ``He's waiting for my call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad defends his title against Hugo Pineda on May 29 in  
Puerto Rico, and Arum's offer is contingent on both fighters 
winning their bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is 34-0 with 29 knockouts while De La Hoya is 30-0 with  
24 knockouts.

</P>
<P>
	If Trinidad doesn't agree, Arum said De La Hoya will go ahead  
with a rematch against Ike Quartey on the same date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone to the limit,'' Arum said. ``We really want to make  
this fight. I think Don King wants to make this fight. But it looks 
like Trinidad's father doesn't want to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum sent King, Trinidad's promoter, a letter last week offering  
the $10 million plus $6.00 for every home above 1 million that buys 
the fight on pay-per-view for a fight that would unify Trinidad's 
title with the WBC 147-pound title held by De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said Tuesday he hasn't heard back from King, and is making  
plans to substitute Quartey for Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a situation where I'm offering him more than anybody  
who has ever fought Oscar has gotten,'' Arum said. ``For the 
opportunity to beat De La Hoya and become the premier welterweight 
in the world, I really should be charging the guy instead of paying 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father, Felix Trinidad Sr., said last week he wasn't  
happy with the $10 million offer and suggested that Trinidad would 
not fight De La Hoya for that purse. 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz said Tuesday that King wants to make  
the fight and will pursue a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya defends his title Saturday night against Oba Carr,  
and Arum said he would have Quartey at the fight to announce a 
rematch of their Feb. 21 fight if Trinidad doesn't agree to the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quartey is ready to get on a flight and come here,'' Arum  
said. ``He's waiting for my call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad defends his title against Hugo Pineda on May 29 in  
Puerto Rico, and Arum's offer is contingent on both fighters 
winning their bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is 34-0 with 29 knockouts while De La Hoya is 30-0 with  
24 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> 9 Million Kids Face Family Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 9.2 million American children are  
dealing with numerous adverse family conditions that rob them of 
their ability to become ``productive, adult participants in the 
mainstream of America's future,'' according to a survey released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in seven children face at least four out of six risk  
factors affecting their chance for success, the 1999 Kids Count 
survey reported. Among them: growing up in a single-parent 
household or with parents who lack a high school education or who 
do not have full-time jobs. The other risk factors are living in 
poverty, relying on welfare and lacking health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Many high-risk children come from poor families and live in  
inner-city or rural neighborhoods cut off from good job 
opportunities, quality schools and strong community support, said 
Douglas W. Nelson, president of the Annie E. Casey Foundation that 
sponsors the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``These millions are the children of the families who are still  
struggling to transition from welfare to work,'' he said today at a 
news conference. ``These are the children of moms and dads who have 
too little education and work experience to succeed in the changing 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Children growing up with multiple family risk factors are more  
likely to fail than the average American child. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said a child from a family with four risk factors is 26  
times more likely to drop out of school than a child from a no-risk 
family; likewise, a girl in a four-risk category is 160 times more 
likely to end up a teen mother than her no-risk female counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	California has the largest number of highly vulnerable children  
-- about 1.5 million kids from that state had four or more risk 
factors. Wyoming had the least, with 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia has the largest share of kids in the  
high-risk category, at 39 percent, followed by Louisiana, at 22 
percent, and Mississippi, at 21 percent. Utah, with 5 percent, has 
the smallest share. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and Hispanic children are more likely than white children  
to grow up in families with multiple risks, the survey said. Nearly 
30 percent of all black children and 25 percent of Hispanic 
children are in the high-risk category, compared with 6 percent of 
white children. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in four high-risk children live in a rural area and  
one in three live in poor, urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kids Count survey is released annually by the Casey  
Foundation, a children's advocacy group based in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey uses 10 factors to gauge conditions affecting young  
people, including rates for poverty, infant mortality, high school 
dropouts, teen births, and violent crime arrests for juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey reported a slight dip in the national child poverty  
rate over an 11-year-period. In 1996, the most recent year 
available for the survey, 20 percent of the nation's children were 
impoverished, compared to the 21 percent who lived below the 
poverty rate in 1985. Alaska, New Hampshire and Utah had the least 
poor children; Louisiana had the most.

<HEADLINE> Candidates for 2000 Report Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's assets topped the $1  
million mark last year, including $40,000 he earned from two books 
and allowing a zinc company to mine the mineral from his Tennessee 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination,  
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, reported personal wealth of 
a minimum of $5.1 million -- through corporate board memberships, 
book deals and speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Gore's personal financial disclosure report, released Monday,  
he and his wife Tipper reported an income of $300,000, including 
Gore's $175,400 salary as vice president. The Gores reported assets 
worth at least $1.4 million and liabilities of $600,000, leaving 
them with a minimum net worth of $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 1998 assets include his salary, various family bank  
accounts and properties the vice president owns in Arlington, Va., 
and Carthage, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the leading Democratic presidential hopeful, reported  
$20,000 from a division of Union Zinc Inc. for a mineral lease on 
his Tennessee property. He also reported royalties of $15,564 from 
his book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and $5,000 in writing fees for 
a foreword to a cookbook to be written by his mother, Pauline. 
</P>
<P>
	He reported legal services from his longtime friend, James Neal  
of Nashville, as a gift valued between $30,000 and $45,000. He also 
said he paid $15,160.59 in legal expenses to Neal in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore listed the assets from the estate of his late father,  
Albert Gore Sr., worth between $266,000 and $565,000. Gore is 
executor of the estate, which was left to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's $2.6 million income came from a variety of sources. He  
made 64 speeches last year, collecting $1.6 million. He also earned 
at least $430,000 as a consultant to financial companies including 
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., J.P. Morgan Services and the Gartner 
Group. The former professional basketball player also collected 
$53,490 from his NBA pension. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bradley's New York Times bestseller, ``Values of  
The Game,'' paid him $137,000. Bradley also listed as assets more 
than $1 million in BankAmerica stock, farmland in Missouri, and a 
summer vacation home in Athens, bringing his net worth to a minimum 
of $5.8 million, with liabilities of $565,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, only two released their financial information  
Monday, Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole reported assets of $6.5 million, most of it derived from  
stocks of a wide range of companies, including Walt Disney, 
Microsoft, and Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant that produces 
Viagra, a product pushed in ads by her husband -- former Senate 
majority leader and GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole. She also has 
a $1 million interest in Bob Dole Enterprises, her husband's 
speechmaking and consulting firm. Dole took out a loan against her 
life insurance policy, making her liabilities at least $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	She earned $1.6 million from 43 speeches in 1998, and donated it  
all to the Elizabeth Dole Charitable Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander made more than a $1  
million last year from the merger of a child care company that he 
helped found with a $5,000 investment in 1987. Overall, he earned 
more than $2 million in 1998, including almost $1 million from 
serving on corporate boards and hosting a television program on the 
Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	All the presidential hopefuls gave money to charity, although  
Dole and Alexander gave far more than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's $1.6 million donation to the charitable foundation of  
which she is president was by far tops. Alexander was a distant 
second, giving away $106,000. Bradley gave $28,000 to a Newark 
church, while Gore, widely criticized for giving only $353 to 
charity in 1997, donated $15,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, commentator Patrick Buchanan,  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and conservative activist Gary Bauer, 
requested 45-day extensions for filing their forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, who is reportedly worth about $1  
billion, filed his disclosure forms Monday with the Federal 
Election Commission but declined to make them public. The agency 
said Tuesday it would take several days before it released the 
information.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Florida Species Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- The federal government has unveiled its  
most aggressive effort ever to save plants and animals -- a 
2,000-page blueprint to save the American crocodile and 67 other 
creatures living in the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, signed Tuesday by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,  
outlines what is needed to restore the habitats of endangered and 
threatened species living in 26,000 square miles across south 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Such plans usually focus on one threatened plant or animal at a  
time or a few species in one ecosystem. The new plan is 
unprecedented because it covers 68 species in 23 habitats. 
</P>
<P>
	In a place as diverse as the Everglades, it makes sense to try  
to handle the situation as a whole, Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some environmentalists called the plan light on specifics. Jay  
Slack, a field supervisor with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
which created the plan, said details will be released in stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the plan could not be determined. It will require  
the government to buy land, and will urge local governments to be 
more careful about preserving parks and open spaces. Property 
owners will be urged to be aware there could be rare birds such as 
scrub-jays in their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan does include some specifics. For instance, it calls for  
more monitoring of the delicate nests of the American crocodile on 
the southern tip of Florida. It also calls for the purchase of 
hardwood hammocks in the Keys to protect the Schaus Swallowtail 
butterfly from insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is tied to a $7.8 billion proposal -- called the  
Everglades Restudy -- due to go before Congress in July. That plan 
seeks to undo damage done to the Everglades by pollution and 
manmade canals and levees, and to ensure enough water for cities, 
farms and the environment for the next half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	The species protection plan doesn't require congressional  
approval. It will guide managers of the Everglades Restudy in how 
to protect wildlife as they revamp the water system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miccosukee Indian Tribe, which makes its home in the  
Everglades, called the species protection plan an unnecessary 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department is ``hoping we won't notice their dismal  
failure to do what Congress told them to do 10 years ago to save 
the Everglades where these endangered species live,'' said Dexter 
Lehtinen, the tribe's attorney.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps 70; Nasdaq Falls Slightly / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as strong  
earnings from Hewlett-Packard helped investors overcome their 
nervousness in advance of today's Federal Reserve meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 70.20 at 10,923.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 3.81 at 1,343.30, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 0.58 at 2,561.26. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two sessions, stocks have slipped as fears of  
inflation rattled the market. On Monday, the Dow fell 59.85 to 
close at 10,853.47. 
</P>
<P>
	An unexpected jump in the consumer price index last Friday  
raised expectations that the Fed would consider pushing rates 
higher at its Open Market Committee meeting today to try to bring 
inflation under control. By Monday afternoon, however, many 
analysts had taken the position that the committee would only issue 
a warning about inflation, and stocks began a gradual recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in  
St. Petersburg, Fla., said the days of intense speculation may have 
insulated the market from any wild swings once the Fed reaches a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A new wave of solid corporate earnings further settled the  
market. Late Monday, Hewlett-Packard reported a 34 percent increase 
in second-quarter profits, soundly beating Wall Street 
expectations. Its stock was up 5 3/4 today at 94 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news from Hewlett-Packard also turned attention toward  
Dell Computer, an industry bellwether scheduled to report earnings 
today. Dell rose 7/16 to 43 11/16 and was the most actively traded 
issue on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 204 million shares, 
ahead of Monday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.19 at 639.11, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.35 at 786.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.26 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.1 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Execs' Pay Irks US Airways Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The top two executives at US Airways made a  
combined $70 million last year and stand to benefit even more from 
a cash incentive program proposed by the board of directors, 
infuriating flight attendants who have been without a contract for 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The $34.2 million paid to Stephen Wolf, chairman of US Airways  
Group, and the $36 million paid to Rakesh Gangwal, chief executive 
officer, came despite a 17 percent drop in the value of the 
company's stock during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The total compensation, which includes salary, bonus, stock  
grants, stock options and add-ons such as free financial planning, 
dwarfs the pay received by the leaders of the country's top three 
airlines. US Airways is No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, United Airlines Chairman Gerald Greenwald received  
compensation totaling $4.3 million, according to the UAL Corp. 
proxy statement. Donald Carty, the new chairman of American 
Airlines, received $9.6 million, while Leo Mullin, president of 
Delta Airlines, received compensation totaling $19.5 million, 
according to their companies' proxies. 
</P>
<P>
	During the US Airways annual meeting in Charlotte, N.C., on  
Wednesday, the board of directors is asking stockholders to approve 
a long-term incentive plan for the airline's senior management. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the plan, the top 30 executives at US Airways will  
be eligible for cash payments of up to 500 percent of their average 
salaries if they meet performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the incentive plan is to encourage behaviors that  
create superior financial performance and to strengthen the 
commonality of interests between (plan) participants and owners in 
creating superior stockholder value,'' the airline's proxy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current terms, both Wolf and Gangwal would be eligible  
for annual bonuses equal to 220 percent of their average salaries. 
That would make them eligible for cash payments of around $1 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's flight attendants complain that the $70 million  
already received by Wolf and Gangwal would cover the annual pay of 
2,000 flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's asking us to lower costs within the airline at the same  
time he's raising them significantly through his own pay and 
compensation package. We're also criticizing the numbers he pulls 
in: Does he really need that?'' said Jeff Zack, spokesman for the 
Association of Flight Attendants, which represents US Airways' 
9,000 flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's last contract expired in December 1997, but since  
then negotiations have bogged down over improvements in pay and 
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways refused to comment on the flight attendants'  
complaints or the incentive plan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to discuss the labor negotiations,'' said  
airline spokesman David Castelveter. ``Those are best left behind 
closed doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf is a longtime airline executive who is known for his red  
suspenders, penchant for fine wines and hobby of collecting Jaguar 
automobiles. His career has taken him from American Airlines to Pan 
Am, Continental, Republic, Tiger International and United Airlines 
before he joined US Airways in January 1996 when it was known as 
USAir. 
</P>
<P>
	In his more recent jobs, he has favored taking a lower salary in  
exchange for company stock. When he started at US Airways, for 
example, his salary was $452,000 but he received 1.3 million stock 
options -- 500,000 of which could be exercised at $12.19 the day he 
started. That was less than the stock's $12.65 closing price that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a business plan that has included a new pilots'  
contract, the purchase of a fleet of Airbus Industrie airplanes and 
a new marketing plan, US Airways stock rose to $62.50 per share at 
the end of 1997. Last year, however, it fell to $52 per share, a 
drop of 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the overall increase in the stock's price left Wolf  
with a pool of unexercised stock options worth $56 million at the 
end of 1998, according to the US Airways proxy. Gangwal's options 
were worth $36 million.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Candidates Report Their Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley may be trailing Vice President Al  
Gore in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, but 
when it comes to personal wealth the former New Jersey senator wins 
by a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Democrats were among several other presidential  
candidates who released their personal financial disclosure forms 
Monday. Bradley reported personal wealth of a minimum of $5.1 
million -- through corporate board memberships, book deals and 
speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Gore, meanwhile, reported an income of $300,000, including  
his $175,400 salary as vice president. He and his wife, Tipper, 
reported assets worth at least 1.4 million and liabilities of 
$600,000, leaving them with a minimum $800,000 net worth. Their 
1998 assets include properties the vice president owns in 
Arlington, Va., and Carthage, Tenn., his salary and various family 
bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reported $20,000 from a mineral lease on his Tennessee  
property, and royalties of $15,564 from his book, ``Earth in the 
Balance.'' He also reported assets from the estate of his late 
father, Albert Gore Sr., worth between $266,000 and $565,000. Gore 
is executor of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's $2.6 million income came from a variety of sources. He  
made 64 speeches last year, collecting $1.6 million. He also made 
at least $430,000 working as a consultant to financial companies, 
including Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., J.P. Morgan Services and the 
Gartner Group. The former basketball star also collected $53,490 
from his NBA pension. 
</P>
<P>
	Book sales also helped Bradley last year. His New York Times  
bestseller, ``Values of The Game,'' paid him $137,000. Bradley also 
listed as assets more than $1 million in BankAmerica stock, 
farmland in Missouri, and a summer vacation home in Athens, 
bringing his total net worth to a minimum of $5.8 million with 
liabilities of $565,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Republicans, only two released their financial  
information on Monday, Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole reported assets of $6.5 million, most of which was derived  
from stocks of a wide range of companies, including Walt Disney, 
Microsoft, and Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant which produces 
Viagra. She also has a $1 million interest in Bob Dole Enterprises, 
her husband's speechmaking and consulting firm. Dole took a loan 
against her life insurance policy which made her liabilities at 
least $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole earned $1.6 million from 43 speeches in 1998, and donated  
all of that money to the Elizabeth Dole Charitable Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander made more than a $1  
million last year from the merger of a child care company that he 
helped found with a $5,000 investment in 1987. Overall, he earned 
more than $2 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also made almost $1 million from serving on corporate  
boards and hosting a television program on the Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	All the candidates gave money to charity, although Dole and  
Alexander gave far more than their opponents. Dole's $1.6 million 
donation to the charitable foundation of which she is president was 
by far tops among presidential hopefuls. Alexander was a distant 
second, giving $106,000 in donations last year. Bradley gave 
$28,000 to a Newark church last year. Gore, widely criticized for 
giving only $353 to charity in 1997, gave away $15,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Several candidates, including former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
commentator Patrick Buchanan, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and 
conservative activist Gary Bauer, requested 45-day extensions for 
filing their forms. Publisher Steve Forbes, who is reportedly worth 
about $1 billion, declined to make his disclosure forms public on 
Monday, but did file them with the Federal Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Cop Testifies in Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An officer accused of torturing a prisoner at a  
police station borrowed black leather gloves just before the 
alleged attack and returned them covered with blood, the gloves' 
owner testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Justin Volpe said he was ``sorry about the gloves'' when  
he gave them back, Officer Mark Schofield told jurors Monday at the 
federal brutality trial of Volpe and four other policemen. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA testing confirmed the blood probably came from the prisoner,  
Abner Louima, according to court papers. Louima was arrested on 
Aug. 9, 1997, as police tried to disperse an unruly crowd outside a 
Brooklyn nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Schofield said he provided the gloves to investigators as  
evidence about a week after the arrest, following a heated 
telephone conversation with his sergeant, Michael Bellomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The sergeant, Schofield testified, said ``he didn't want to see  
anybody go to jail. ... I told him, `That's absurd. I had nothing 
to do with anything. I'm going to internal affairs.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Schofield admitted he came forward only  
after department investigators had launched a highly publicized 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say a raging Volpe -- mistakenly thinking Louima  
punched him in a melee outside the nightclub -- rammed a stick into 
Louima's rectum and mouth while Officer Charles Schwarz held him on 
the bathroom floor. The alleged attack caused bleeding from severe 
internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, Schwarz and two other officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas  
Wiese, also are charged with violating Louima's civil rights by 
beating him en route to the 70th Precinct stationhouse. Bellomo, 
the sergeant, is charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, involving a black Haitian immigrant and white  
officers, has raised tensions between police and minorities. A 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed on Louima's behalf alleges that 
wayward cops were shielded by a police code of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Schofield, 27, is the second former 70th Precinct officer to  
testify for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Detective Eric Turetzky, 28, testified that he saw  
Schwarz lead a handcuffed Louima toward the bathroom. He said he 
later spotted Volpe marching Louima away from an area outside the 
bathroom, waving what appeared to be a broken broom handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Schofield said Monday that he, too, remembered Schwarz leading  
Louima toward the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	And later that night, Schofield testified, he overheard Volpe  
saying to two fellow officers, ``I broke a man down.''

<HEADLINE> Campbell Soup Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Third-quarter earnings at Campbell Soup Co.  
rose slightly despite flat sales in its flagship soup and sauces 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said Tuesday that earnings for the three months ended  
May 2 from continuing operations were $162 million, or 37 cents a 
share, compared to $157 million, or 34 cents a share, during the 
same period a year earlier. The year-ago earnings exclude a 
restructuring charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings were in line with Wall Street analysts' expectations,  
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $1.49 billion, a 5 percent drop from  
the 1998 figure of $1.57 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said sales in its soups and sauces division were flat  
at $1.01 billion, adding that the results were affected by the 
company's decision in January to eliminate quarter-end promotions 
for its retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale F. Morrison, Campbell president and chief executive  
officer, said that with an agreement last month to sell its Fresh 
Start Bakeries business, the company has completed a plan begun in 
1996 to sell off its less profitable businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our portfolio is focused on businesses that have attractive  
returns and growth potential -- soup, sauces and beverages, biscuits 
and confectionery, and away from home,'' Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell is the world's largest maker and marketer of soup. It  
also makes the Pepperidge Farm line of cookies and crackers, Prego 
sauces and Godiva-brand chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Campbell fell $1.12 1/2 to $41.81 1/4 in afternoon trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Rural Portugal Shows Some Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POVOA DAO, Portugal (AP) -- Moss covers the crumbling granite  
houses of this centuries-old village, abandoned but for two hardy 
souls who recollect livelier times of harmonica music and card 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	These days Povoa Dao has the spooky feel of a medieval ghost  
town. Like much of inland Portugal, it was drained of life by a 
decades-long exodus to more prosperous cities by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	But efforts to check the flow are starting to take effect as  
frazzled city-dwellers discover the appeal of a quieter life in the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrepreneurs are picking up on the trend, and bringing work  
into rural areas to cater to the urban crowd. Here in Povoa Dao, a 
construction company has bought the village and is renovating the 
houses for weekend tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Soares, 74, and his wife, Mercinda, have lived here alone  
the past six years, since their last elderly neighbors left to join 
grown-up children who had been lured away by city life. 
</P>
<P>
	Secluded and desolate, the village in northern Portugal has  
never had running water or electricity. A slippery-smooth Roman 
path winds through it, leading down to a Roman bridge over the 
River Dao. Along the way, at all but one of the 42 houses, oak 
doors dangle from rusted hinges. 
</P>
<P>
	Povoa Dao was once a bustling place with 200 residents. Its  
demise reflects a migratory trend in which 700,000 people moved 
from the interior to Lisbon, Oporto and other coastal cities over 
the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal's modern progress has been lopsided. It is a short  
drive from the booming economy of the coast to strikingly 
undeveloped and sparsely populated rural areas. Of Portugal's 9.8 
million people, fewer than 500,000 live in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Development was hobbled -- and poverty entrenched -- by a 41-year  
dictatorship and then a decade of paralysis after the 1974 
soldiers' revolution that toppled it. 
</P>
<P>
	The dictatorship wanted to keep rural workers meek and servile.  
The socialist government that followed seized the property of 
wealthy landowners and handed it to the workers in what proved a 
disastrous reform policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty first began driving people from Povoa Dao in the 1960s.  
After membership in the European Union in 1986 propelled Portugal 
into fast-track economic development, the coastal cities sucked 
more marrow out of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, Lisbon has rapidly evolved into a modern  
European capital with fast-food chains, Internet cafes and glitzy 
shopping malls, while Soares still uses handmade wooden farm tools 
in Povoa Dao. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the tide is turning, officials say. People who left the  
countryside are coming back in search of the quality of life they 
initially pursued by leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	An EU-financed project to revive moribund rural areas is  
focusing on tourism to entice people back to the regions hit 
hardest by what social scientists call ``human desertification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nuno Jordao, head of the eight-year-old program, says the  
government doesn't have hard numbers yet, but he insists a 
statistical analysis now under way will document a trend already 
noticed by locals in rural areas. He says rural rebounds already 
have been documented in Britain, France and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are clear signs of a move back to rural areas,'' he said  
in an interview in Lisbon. ``Cities are saturated; there's too much 
stress and pollution. The rural exodus has stopped and the flow is 
now in the opposite direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandre Oliveira, a civil engineer in his 20s who is  
overseeing Povoa Dao's renaissance, says the project was undertaken 
because similar commercial projects in recent years ``have drawn 
great demand from the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renovation of the village's houses is expected to be completed  
before next April, at which time Povoa Dao will be marketed as a 
weekend getaway for stressed-out city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for them in a new home provided by the developers will  
be Mrs. Soares, a frail-looking woman who still manages to carry 
daunting loads on her head. She was born in one of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband is a robust man who works in the fields from dawn  
till dusk. The sun has turned his complexion nut-brown. The 
fingernails of his muscular hands are encrusted with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	They eat what they grow and use their monthly state pension of  
27,000 escudos ($145) to buy whatever they cannot produce 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A resourceful couple -- and cheerful, despite their hardships --  
the Soares, always refused to leave Povoa Dao. They cherish 
memories of brighter times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd get out the flute and the harmonica and dance around,''  
Mrs. Soares recalled with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I miss Sundays when we'd sit outside and play cards,'' her  
husband added. 
</P>
<P>
	He is thrilled by the idea of a new influx of people. ``The more  
the merrier.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Answer: This host has a brand new sidewalk  
star. The question: Who is Alex Trebek? 
</P>
<P>
	The Emmy-winning quiz-show host celebrated his 15th anniversary  
aboard TV's ``Jeopardy!'' with an unveiling of his star along the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 fans, including fellow Canadian actor Alan Thicke,  
cheered as Trebek unveiled the Hollywood Boulevard honor Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alex is a gifted man,'' Thicke told the crowd. ``Gifted  
because he works four hours a week and makes $11 million a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trebek hosted the game shows ``Wizard of Odds,''  
``Concentration'' and ``To Tell the Truth'' before ``Jeopardy!'' 
came along. 
</P>
<P>
	A special ``Jeopardy!'' show celebrating Trebek's star on the  
Walk of Fame will be broadcast Friday, featuring previous sidewalk 
star recipients Jane Seymour, Garry Marshall and Graham Nash 
matching wits for charity.

<HEADLINE> Lobo's Long Opts Out of NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico swingman Lamont Long has  
decided to take his name off the list of early entries for the NBA 
draft and return to the Lobos for his senior season, coach Fran 
Fraschilla announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great boost for our program,'' Fraschilla said. ``He  
has a chance to be the top guard in the country next year. He felt 
he had a chance to enhance his draft status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long, a 6-foot-4, 190-pound guard-forward, had said he would  
apply for the NBA draft this June if he were be picked in the 
middle-to-high first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people that were coming out this year and  
that would drop my status, so I decided to come back,'' Long said 
during a news conference with Fraschilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Long has said he likely would have left if former Lobos coach  
Dave Bliss had stayed at New Mexico. Bliss took the head coaching 
job at Baylor in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, who took over the Lobos soon after Bliss resigned,  
said Tuesday the coaching change played a ``minor'' role in 
persuading Long to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Long was New Mexico's second-leading scorer last season,  
averaging 16.8 points and 6.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Fraschilla announced he would discipline junior  
forward Damion Walker for an incident involving a vehicle break-in. 
He would not reveal what the discipline entailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we're going to let the legal system handle  
itself,'' Fraschilla said. ``He embarrassed himself and the 
program. Rather than maliciousness, he showed an error in judgment. 
He realizes that he definitely showed poor judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker and another UNM student were arrested last week after a  
university employee reported he saw them breaking into a UNM van. 
Walker claimed he needed to move the van, which was blocking his 
car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have dropped fourth-degree felony charges of  
breaking and entering and conspiracy but may be refile if they find 
sufficient evidence to re-open the case.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Exchange Drops Secrecy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are  
going to have to share a little bit more -- or risk having their 
names stricken from the trading board. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in September, Japan's largest exchange will require the  
1,800 companies whose shares are traded there to disclose routinely 
information about earnings and business operations, the exchange 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, companies only have to release such information at  
the exchange's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Those that fail to comply must submit a plan for improvement.  
The exchange said those plans would also be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that still fail to improve could be removed.  
</P>
<P>
	Secrecy is a notorious problem in the Japanese market, with  
investors often not learning about problems at a company until the 
bankruptcy administrators move in.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Storms Hammer Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Strong storms barreled through central Michigan and Indiana,  
dumping heavy rain, downing trees and knocking out power to 
thousands of people. One person was killed and a boy was critically 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 200,000 homes and business in the two states lost  
power in Monday's storms, which also struck the Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport and cut electricity to the United Parcel 
Service, Signature Flight Support and Mesaba Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds up to 115 mph knocked down a new home in Wyoming, Mich.,  
killing a man inside. Another worker who was trapped for an hour 
was in fair condition at a Grand Rapids hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In Linton, Ind., 75 miles southwest of Indianapolis, a falling  
tree limb hit 6-year-old Evan Whitty as he left baseball practice 
Monday evening. He was hospitalized in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern Indiana city of Bristol, lightning sparked a  
fire that gutted eight units in an apartment complex. One 
firefighter was hospitalized with smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	High wind, hail and rain pelted Lansing, Mich., snapping utility  
poles built to withstand 100-mph winds along Interstate 496, 
closing the freeway and snarling rush-hour traffic. Three large 
trees fell on the Capitol lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a freight train came through,'' said Kevin  
Webb, manager of Woodworks and Design Co. in Lansing. ``It sucked 
the windows right out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing schools were closed today because of power failures.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the storm system pounded parts of Iowa and Illinois.  
Some 80,000 Chicago-area customers lost power for parts of Sunday 
or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wauconda, north of Chicago, more than half of the 116 homes  
in two mobile home parks were ruled either uninhabitable or 
severely damaged. The roof at St. John's Lutheran School In the 
suburb of Country Club Hills was damaged Monday morning as 160 
youngsters crouched down in a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, residents of Manchester headed for home as swollen  
streams and creeks began to recede after heavy rain that fell 
Sunday. Five counties in the state were declared disaster areas 
following weekend storms blamed for at least two deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people were evacuated from Manchester and power was  
shut off in the downtown area Monday afternoon after rising water 
began to eat away at the Quaker Mill dam on the Maquoketa River. 
Some residents were allowed to return several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	In Independence, Iowa, where the Wapsipinicon River was at a  
record 10 feet above flood stage this morning, only the tops of 
street signs remained visible.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Reach Stanley Cup Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Garry Valk, a walk-on at Maple Leafs training  
camp, is now the toast of the town. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had anything like this before,'' the forward said  
after his two goals gave the Leafs a 4-3 win over Pittsburgh on 
Monday night that moved Toronto into the Eastern Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing street hockey you want to score a big goal  
in the Stanley Cup playoffs. All these years of hard work really 
paid off for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While goaltender Curtis Joseph was the key man in the series for  
Toronto, the Leafs' third line of Valk, Sergei Berezin and Yanbic 
Perreault came up big Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezin scored a goal and assisted on the game-winner and  
Perreault continued his incredible dominance on face-offs, winning 
17 of 28. Two of his faceoff wins led to goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Perreault won 67 of 114 face-offs overall (57 percent), but was  
dominant in the last three games of the series, winning 40 of 59 
(67.7 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Leafs chairman Steve Stavro savored Toronto's first trip to the  
semifinals since 1994 all the more because his team is the lone 
Canadian squad remaining in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys have given it everything they've got,'' Stavro  
said. ``Pat (Quinn) and the whole organization have done a 
tremendous job with this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The unsung guys have just been outstanding,'' added GM Ken  
Dryden. ``That's what you often need to be successful in the 
playoffs. This team was only starstruck once -- at the closing of 
Maple Leaf Gardens. Maybe they were a bit at the start of the 
Philly series, but not any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto's playoff newcomers have learned a lot in two vastly  
different series against Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We faced two clubs that play defense in different regards,''  
Quinn said prior to Game 6. ``One plays physical, the other is a 
solid skating, positional team. To be able to adapt and change as 
we have speaks a lot about the mental side of our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the same Toronto team that wasn't supposed to go much  
beyond a round or two, precisely because such a big question mark 
hung over its ability to work the corners and the slot. But the 
Flyers brought out the toughness in the NHL's highest-scoring team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we could score goals and still play a good defensive  
style,'' Sylvain Cote said.

<HEADLINE> Street Leads Philly Mayor Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A white lawyer tied to controversial former  
Mayor Frank Rizzo was in a close race in the city's Democratic 
mayoral primary Tuesday with a black politician trying to live down 
his past as a hot-tempered activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Weinberg, a white political insider, and John F. Street, a  
black former City Council president, led the field of six Democrats 
trying to succeed popular Mayor Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat who 
is credited with bringing the city back from the brink of financial 
ruin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell is barred from seeking a third consecutive term.  
</P>
<P>
	With 11 percent of precincts reporting, Weinberg had 12,195  
votes, or 38 percent. Street had 10,689 votes, or 33 percent, while 
John White Jr. had 6,010 votes, or 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was doing well in the blue-collar rowhouse  
neighborhoods of the nation's fifth-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Street was running strong in his base in northern Philadelphia.  
But he had to battle with White and a third candidate for the black 
vote. More than 40 percent of Philadelphia's 1.5 million people are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders repeatedly called for at least one of the three  
black candidates to drop out of the race to give the remaining ones 
a better chance. Their pleas were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will face businessman Sam Katz, who was unopposed in  
the GOP primary and is seeking to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a political unknown in January but raised more than  
$5.2 million and launched an unprecedented advertising blitz. 
Street raised more than $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Weinberg's TV commercials were aimed squarely at Street,  
the front-runner throughout the race. Weinberg reminded voters of 
Street's past as a community activist, showing old TV footage of 
Street shoving a reporter and throwing a cup of water on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg also played up Street's financial problems, pointing  
out that he defaulted on his student loans and declared bankruptcy.
