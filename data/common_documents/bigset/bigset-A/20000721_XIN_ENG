BERLIN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Salvatore Commesso of Saeco beat
Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakstan on Thursday in Germany on the
18th leg of the Tour de France but American Lance Armstrong
retained the overall leader's yellow jersey, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Italian crossed the line in six hours eight

<HEADLINE> Top seed Norman Ousted at Stuttgart Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Magnus Norman was
eliminated from the Stuttgart Open men's tennis tournament on
Thursday with a 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 failure against German wild
card player Daniel Elsner.
</P>
<P>
Elsner, who was playing his first regular tournament on the ATP
Tour this year, upset the Champions Race leader and defending
champion of the tournament with big ground strokes and cruised
into the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Elsner kept the Swede far behind the baseline with blazing
ground strokes from both sides and allowed few points on his serve,
especially in the third set.
</P>
<P>
Norman hit a backhand wide on the first set point of the second
set and then dropped his serve in the seventh game of the third
set to fall behind for good. Elsner used his third match point,
hitting a service winner, to end the battle after more than two
hours.
</P>
<P>
Elsner now faces Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic, who ousted
Fernando Meligeni of Brazil 6-3, 6-2 in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Rainer Schuettler also advanced as his German Davis
Cup teammate Tommy Haas, sixth seed of the tournament, retired
with a rib injury in the second set. Schuettler was leading 7-5,
2-1 when Haas had to give up in pain.
</P>
<P>
Another fallen seed was Karim Alami of Morocco who lost to
Argentina's Gaston Gaudio 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Woods Sets Early Lead at British Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Tiger Woods shot a 5-under 67 to
take the early clubhouse lead in the first round of the British
Open on Thursday in the first round of the British Open
Championship at St Andrews, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Coming off a historic victory in the U.S. Open and needing
only the British title to complete wins in all four major
championships, Woods started slowly but came back to make five
birdies in seven holes and move into the lead.
</P>
<P>
Woods was in trouble only once, when he had to hit out of knee-
high grass on the famous No. 17 Road Hole. But he managed to get
his shot near the front of the green and putted in for par.
</P>
<P>
Journeyman British pro Ian Garbutt also threatened to upstage
Woods for a while, making four straight 3s on the front side that
included an eagle on the fifth hole. Garbutt, playing in his first
Open since 1993, was 7 under through 12 holes, but faltered and
ended with a 68.
</P>
<P>
Former Open winner Tom Lehman was in a pack of players also a
stroke behind Woods on a warm day with light winds that made
perfect scoring conditions on the Old Course. Open officials
helped by giving the hard, dry fairways and greens a good
overnight watering.
</P>
<P>
Tied with Garbutt and Lehman on 68 were Japan's Shigeki
Maruyama, Americans Dennis Poulson and Scott Dunlap and Ireland's
Padraig Harrington.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Portuguese Industrialist Association expected that
about 700 to 800 Portuguese factories would be closed over the
coming 10 years under the fierce competition in Europe, forecasting
that most of them would move to southern Mediterranean coastal
countries, particularly Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
There were partnership agreements between the three countries
and the European Union allowing certain privileges to the
Portuguese factories which would promote business and open new
markets there.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Qatar's Industrial Development Bank has begun granting
credits to Saudi nationals to fund industrial projects in Qatar in
a move to treat them on equal terms as local business people.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) General Secretariat invited
Saudi commercial and industrial sectors to take advantage of the
funding offers made by the Qatari bank to achieve the GCC
integrated economy strategy.
</P>
<P>
The move was one of a series of measures taken by the GCC to
vitalize inter-GCC economic activities, streamline credit granting
and develop common GCC industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- All indices of the monthly Cabinet Economic Group's
release were positive, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid told
reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the period from July 1999 to March 2000, Egypt's imports
moved down 9.75 percent while exports surged 23.36 percent as
compared to the last corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate in May shrank 3.45 percent from the previous
month while population growth on annual basis went down 24.36
percent during the l986-l996 period from the previous period.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen's foreign debt reached 6.14 billion dollars by
December 1999, accounting for 98 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP), according to Yemeni financial sources.
</P>
<P>
The debt reschedule process helped reduce debt from 10.53
billion dollars in l995, when it accounted for 215.5 percent of the
GDP, to 5.7 billion dollars in 1997, or 87.1 percent of the GDP,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A world trade center will be opened in Trabzon on the
southeastern Black Sea coast of Turkey to boost regional commercial
relations.
</P>
<P>
Adil Yazici, governor of Trabzon province, said that Trabzon was
an important trade center in history and a link on the famous Silk
Road.
</P>
<P>
"The foundation of the trade center will be laid this year.
Trabzon will have a very important function regarding commercial
cooperation, especially among the Black Sea littoral states," the
he added.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- According to a survey conducted by the Wind Energy
Department of Istanbul Technical University, a total of 23 new wind
farms is either being planned or installed in the Aegean and
Marmara Region alone in Turkey. The power capacity totals 550
megawatts (MW).
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that after making feasibility studies in the
Aegean and Marmara region on opening wind farms, those companies
have come to believe that the region is highly suitable for wind
energy facilities and decided to submit their projects to the State
Planning Organization and the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Satisfied With Annan's Letter Relating to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government Friday
expressed satisfaction with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's letter to the Security Council president Mignonette
Patricia Durrant relating to Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated July 20, asked for support in handling the
retaliation measures taken by the Turkish Cypriot side against the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and a new checkpoint
the Turkish army set up in Strovilia village in southeast Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has taken measures in early July to
restrict UNFICYP's movement in northern Cyprus, to retaliate the
Security Council's renewal of the mandate of UNFICYP without asking
for their prior approval.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops stationing in Turkish Cypriot area have set
up a new checkpoint in Strovilia, inhabited by some 15 Greek
Cypriots, thus changing the military status quo in the area.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Annan said the restrictions "have adversely
affected UNFICYP's operational effectiveness" and asked for the
status quo to be restored in Strovilia.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures have added an additional burden to UNFICYP,
as it has already been stretched very thin along the 180-kilometre
cease-fire lines.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Cyprus government
spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said that "the responsibility now
lies with the Security Council, which has the obligation to take
the necessary measures to restore the status quo in Strovilia."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Greek Cypriot side will raise the matter at the
Cyprus talks scheduled to resume in Geneva on July 24, Papapetrou
said this issue is not part of the talks, but in view of the
developments, "the president will take advantage of every
opportunity that arises to promote our diplomatic effort for the
restoration of the status quo in Strovilia."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Turkey maintains some 35,000 troops on the
northern of island where the Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a
breakaway regime, recognized only by Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers on Friday pulled
another five corpses out of the wreckage of a clothing factory in
Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria that caved in after a
fire, bringing the death toll to 21, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of them were firefighters of the Alexandria Fire and
Disaster Brigade, including its chief and his deputy, six were
factory workers while the remaining three have yet to be
identified, the officials were quoted as saying by the country's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
However, they did not know how many were still trapped under the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
The rescue workers have not located any more bodies in the
wreckage by Friday evening and said they were preparing to end the
search if their efforts fail to locate more bodies among the
twisted remains of the six-story building, according to the
officials, who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six people, including three firefighters, were injured in
the initial blaze, which was believed to have been started by an
electrical short circuit.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Alexandria Fire and Disaster Brigade were
inspecting the inside of the building, in the Sidi Gaber
neighborhood of Egypt's second largest city, when it collapsed

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Boulton, 35, member of one of the families with the
biggest participation in the country's entrepreneurial field, was
kidnapped July 15 near the city of Valencia (the capital of the
Venezuelan state of Carabobo) by 12 persons dressed in military
uniforms and armed.
</P>
<P>
De la Calle answered to journalists' questions about the
Venezuelan president's statements that the decisions of his
government are "autonomous and respectable".
</P>
<P>
"Kidnapping deserves reproach here, in Colombia, or in any
country of the world, and violates the fundamental rights of the
human being," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that a kidnapping cannot be justified with political
convictions, and that "Guerrillas must be made aware that this
crime does not contribute to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
President Chavez warned Thursday that his position toward the
Colombian guerrilla will change radically if it is proven that the
rebels are behind the kidnapping of the Venezuelan businessman
Boulton.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has supported the peace talks between Colombian
Government and rebel guerrilla forces and provided place for the
talks.

<P>
The explosions of the volcano were felt in the San Antonio de
los Cobres locality of the province of Salta, and an immense cloud
of ashes was seen at a height of 4,000 meters, but the wind
currents pushed it toward the province of Jujuy, instead of Salta.
</P>
<P>
The Lascar is the most active volcano in the central part of
the Andean mountain range and is located some 50 kilometers away
from the border with Argentina in the province of Salta.
</P>
<P>
A great amount of ashes fell on the city of Salta in 1993, and
much of the province territory,when the Lascar had a very
spectacular eruption.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Parties' Leaders to Accompany President to Geneva Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Cyprus' political
parties will accompany President Glafcos Clerides to Geneva for the
third round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks due to resume later
this month, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Clerides will make clear at the talks the
Greek Cypriot views and positions, in response to the ideas
presented July 12 by Alvaro de Soto, advisor to the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to the two sides of the divided
island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will tell de Soto that a settlement on Cyprus must
stick to a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula based on U.N.
resolutions, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
De Soto's ideas reportedly speak of a "common state" and a
partnership with two constituent-states, instead of a federal
republic, and refers to the need for political equality between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
He suggested two constitutions and citizenships for the two
split communities of Cyprus and adopted a negative stance regarding
Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession course, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
He also refers to an equitable solution, instead of a just
solution, and makes no mention of sovereignty, according to the
local media.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriot politicians argued that as the de Soto ideas
include "seeds of confederation," they sided more with the views
set out by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 after a Turkish invasion
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks on Cyprus issue have
been held since December 1999, aimed at preparing the ground for
substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks started on July 5 in Geneva, but
adjourned in July 12. It is scheduled to resume on July 24.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, supported by party leaders, is expected to seek
clarification about sovereignty, and will stress the need for the
country's unity.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots are demanding the recognition of their
breakaway regime in northern Cyprus, now recognized only by Turkey,
and seeking a confederation of two states.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges Funds to Combat AIDS in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday pledged
4.5 million U.S. dollars to help fighting AIDS in Rwanda in the
year 2000, according to reports reaching here from Rwandan capital
Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Thurman, director of office of the National AIDS Policy
in the United States, who was in Kigali for a five-day visit,
hailed the Rwandan government for investing much in the fight
against HIV/AIDS, which is increasing and spreading widely in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government felt that since AIDS is a big problem in
Rwanda, it should be given the first priority," said Thurman, who
was also Clinton's special advisor on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda is one of the African countries in the sub-Saharan
Africa whose population is greatly stormed by the AIDS disease,
and we deemed it necessary to increase aid to that effect," Sandra
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. disbursed 1.5 million dollars last year to combat the
AIDS epidemic that has turned out to be the leading killer disease
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the U.S. government on Wednesday
released 1 billion dollars annual loan to help in the fight of
AIDS in the sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to a special report from the White House in
Washington, 70 percent of the 34 million people affected with AIDS
are from the sub-Sahara Africa.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21(Xinhua) -- The United Nations on Friday
was forwarding a ministerial declaration on the critical
importance of closing the digital divide to Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori as the Group of G-8 opened its summit in
Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Makarim Wibsono, President of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council(ECOSOC) asked the Prime Minister of the Summit host
country to communicate to the other member countries the contents
of a declaration approved on July 7 at a ministerial-level meeting
of ECOSOC.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration voices consensus among developing and developed
countries, as well as countries with economies in transition, that
information and communication technology(ICT) is central to the
new knowledge-based world economy, and plays a critical role in
accelerating growth, promoting sustainable development and
eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration also warns that the information technology
revolution can very likely lead to further widening disparities
between and within countries, and that the majority of the world
population still lives in poverty by the ICT revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration, the end result of months of intergovernmental
discussions and private-public sector interchanges, also outlines

<HEADLINE> French Public Prosecutor Asks for Release of Russian Yacht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A public prosecutor in the
western French port city of Brest Friday asked the French judicial
authorities to release the Russian yacht ``Sedov'' which was
seized last week at the request of a Swiss company which claims
repayment of debt by Russia.
</P>
<P>
The assistant public prosecutor of the Tribunal of Grand
Instance of Brest, Yves Le Du, said that the Swiss company, Noga,
had made a ``lion's choice'' by asking for the seizure of ``Sedov
'' when it came to Brest to participate in a local sea festival.
</P>
<P>
Noga, an export-import company based in Geneva, accuses Russia
of failing to pay it 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for the food it sent
to the country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Noga said that Russia agreed to renounce its immunity of
jurisdiction in the contract which allowed it to pursue the
Russian state everywhere if the contract was not respected.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, Russia should have paid Noga oil and
other primary materials in exchange for the food and money it
received. But Russia has failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
The case was brought to an arbitrary court in Stockholm and the
Tribunal of Grand Instance of Paris, which ordered the seizure of
the properties of 70 organs of the Russian state in Russia and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the French judicial authorities have already
seized some banking accounts of the Russian embassy in Paris, the
Russian commercial chamber in Paris and the Russian representation
at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's court hearing held in Brest, the prosecutor Le
Du described the contract signed between Russia and Noga as ``
sulphurous''
</P>
<P>
He also disputed the claim by Noga that Russia has agreed to
renounce its immunity of jurisdiction if it breaks the contract.
</P>
<P>
``This is a question of interpretation of the clause which
does not stipulate that Russia agrees to let all its properties,
mobile or not, be seized in its territory or elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``Sedov'' belongs to the Murmansk Military Technology
University and has 176 people, including 100 cadets and 20
teenagers from Moscow, on board when it arrived in Brest last week.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer representing Murmansk Military Technology University,
Michel Quimper, said that the yacht is not a property of the
Russian state but is one of ``a public establishment with the
vocation of scientific teaching.''
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal of Grand Instance of Brest will give next Monday
its final verdict on whether to lift the seizure on ``Sedov'' or
not.

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies G-8 Debt Conditions too Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain denied on Friday that rich
nations were holding back debt relief to the poor by imposing
impossibly tough conditions.
</P>
<P>
International Development Secretary Clare Short said the case
for debt relief, expected to dominate a meeting of the Group of
Eight(G-8) leaders in Japan, was a two-way street which required"
better government in poor countries".
</P>
<P>
"You can't just throw money at a country that is buying lots of
arms and perpetuating war. We've got to help them resolve their
conflicts before they get their debt relief," Short told the BBC
radio.
</P>
<P>
She said 20 of the world's poorest countries would be "on track
" for debt relief by the end of the year and would win a complete
write-off soon after if, in return, they maintained their own
government programs to tackle poverty.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 leaders boasted in a last year summit that it would
wipe out as much as 100 billion U.S, dollars of debt owed by 40
poor countries if they followed reforms supervised by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
But debt relief campaigners say only 11.5 billion U.S. dollars
has been delivered. They are pushing the G-8 leaders, currently
holding a summit in Okinawa, Japan, to speed up the process.

<HEADLINE> Annan recommends to Extend Mandate of U.N. Mission in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday recommended to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Georgia(UNOMIG) for a further period
of six months until January 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said no major
progress in the framework of the Geneva peace process was achieved
during the last six months, but the results of Coordinating
Council sessions held on July 11 had opened the prospect for
constructive engagement between Georgian and Abkhaz sides.
</P>
<P>
Though domestic considerations always place constraints on
political leaders engaged in a conflict settlement process, no
progress can be achieved without demonstration of substantial
political will from both sides, Annan noted.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General called upon both sides to engage fully
in the negotiating process within the framework of the parallel
strategy proposed by his Special representative, which ensures
that time and attention will be given to practical issues of
refugee return, security and economic rehabilitation and the
fundamental question of Abkhazia's political status.
</P>
<P>
The most critical element of the package is Abkhazia's
political status, and if this element is not included in the
negotiating process, the entire process may be jeopardized, Annan
noted.
</P>
<P>
Both sides, most particularly the Abkhaz side, must muster the
political will to engage resolutely in negotiations on the status
issue, the U.N. chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slow progress, it is evident that UNOMIG continues
to play an essential role in the search for a peaceful solution to
the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict through its sustained efforts to
further the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan emphatically reminded the Georgian and Abkhaz sides that
the security of UNOMIG military and civilian personnel was
primarily their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
 UNOMIG was established in 1993 to verify compliance with the
1993 ceasefire agreement between the Government of Georgia and the
Abkhaz authorities.
</P>
<P>
 Following the signing in May 1994 by the two sides of the
Agreement on a Ceasefire and Separation of Forces, the Security
Council authorized the increase in UNOMIG's strength and expanded
its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The current mandate of UNOMIG expires on July 31, 2000.

PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said on Friday that the French language is a counter-power
to resist cultural uniform in the world.
</P>
<P>
He told a world congress of French language teachers here that
if French is no longer ``the language of power,'' it still has the
mission of refusing to accept a weakening of cultural identities
and encouraging the freedom of each culture to create and express
itself.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the some 900,000 French language teachers
around the world as ``the motor of cultural diversity.''
</P>
<P>
The 10th World Congress of the International Federation of
Teachers of French drew 3,500 representatives from around the
world and came to a close on Friday after holding one week of
sessions.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan will convene on July 26 a high-level meeting at the U.N.
headquarters in New York to formally launch an unprecedented
collaboration between corporations, labor and civic society to
help promote a fairer distribution of the benefits of
globalization, U.N. officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bringing together top leaders from all three sectors, the
meeting will launch the operational phase of the Global Compact
which Annan announced in January last year and in which he urged
business to work with the world body and other partners to further
universal goals in the area of human rights, labor and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The high-level event will include chief executive officers and
other top executives from nearly 50 corporations, including such
global entities as Daimler Chrysler, Unilever, Deutsche Bank and
Nike.
</P>
<P>
The Global Compact is an outgrowth of a speech made by Annan
in Davos, Switzerland in January 1999. In it, Annan warned of a
backlash against globalization unless it was embedded in social
values and reflected the common objectives of all segments of the
world's population.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the business community to join the United
Nations in adding stronger social and environmental pillars to
sustain the global economy.

President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill, but the
margin of victory in the Senate and in the House was not big
enough to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has promised to sign an earlier version of the
Republican bill if Congress also passed an acceptable prescription
drug benefit for Medicare recipients. But Republicans have refused
that deal.
</P>
<P>
The issue will likely be a centerpiece of this year's election
campaign debate over how to use the projected budget surplus
between the Republian Party and Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Republican sponsors sought to portray their confrontation over
the "marriage penalty" bill with Clinton as a choice between more
government spending and a return of growing tax overpayments to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether he will or won't grant America's families
the tax relief they deserve," said Republican Senator William Roth,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "Let's divorce the
marriage penalty from the tax code once and for all."
</P>
<P>
The measure would cut taxes for about virtually all married
couples, beginning this year, at a cost of 292 billion dollars
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The marriage legislation was part of last year's 792 billion
dollars tax cut that Clinton vetoed.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean, DPRK FMs to Hold First-ever Meeting in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of South Korea
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will hold
their first-ever meeting in Bangkok next week to seek cooperation
in the international community.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Lee Joung-
binn and his DPRK counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, are scheduled to meet
next week in Bangkok on the sidelines of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is seen as a move to maintain the good atmosphere
created by the summit between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and DPRK leader Kim Jung Il last month in the DPRK capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
"As this will be the first South-North foreign ministerial
dialogue, we believe that it will be a good opportunity to discuss
foreign relations of the two Koreas after the historic summit and
to seek ways of cooperation between Seoul and Pyongyang in the
international community," said Choi Young-jin, assistant minister
of South Korea's Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will both attend the one-day annual meeting
of foreign ministers of the ASEAN forum, Asia's sole political and
security consultative body.
</P>
<P>
The forum groups ASEAN member states and its "dialogue partners
" -- China, South Korea, Japan, the European Union, Russia, India,
Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for the DPRK to participate in Asia's
main regional security forum meeting.
</P>
<P>
The first South-North foreign ministers' talks are significant
in the sense that it will be a starting point for the two Koreas
to seek ways of enhancing cooperation abroad in the process of
implementing the reconciliation agreement sealed last month, South
Korean government officials said.

<HEADLINE> Two Thirds of International Sports Federations Sign Up for WADA Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Two thirds of the Olympic
International Sports Federations (IF) have signed agreements
allowing out-of competition tests to be conducted within their
sports, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced on Thursday
in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, 19 have signed the agreements with WADA, which is
still negotiating the terms of testing agreements with the nine
other federations.
</P>
<P>
On June 20, the WADA Executive Committee agreed to the wording
of the contract the IFs have to sign with WADA in order for WADA
to be able to conduct the out of competition tests. After one
month of negotiations, the following is the current status of
discussions with the 28 IFs.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the progress over the past month, WADA Chairman
Richard W. Pound said, "We commend the IFs that have signed up for
the testing program. It is encouraging that 19 of the IFs appear
to be anxious to address this problem by joining the program so
quickly. We hope the remaining IFs will follow suit as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
"What is particularly gratifying is that some IFs have amended
their policies so quickly to allow out-of competition testing for
the first time. This is a true accomplishment for the Olympic
Movement. We hope their examples will stimulate other IFs to act
accordingly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, WADA announced its goal of conducting 2,500
random, unannounced, out-of-competition tests by December 31, 2000,
with the majority of these tests, about 2,150, to be conducted
prior to the Sydney Olympic Games. In the past month, WADA
already has conducted more than 400 tests, bringing WADA about one-
fifth of the way toward its goal. Another 400 tests are scheduled
to be conducted over the next ten days.
</P>
<P>
WADA has appointed the Drug-Free Sport Consortium (DFSC) to
conduct the tests, which are being conducted in a manner
compatible with International Standards for Doping Control (ISDC)
and in accordance with each IF's anti-doping regulations.
</P>
<P>
The DFSC consists of three national anti-doping agencies: the
Australian Sport Drug Agency (ASDA), the Canadian Center for
Ethics in Sport (CCES), and the Norwegian Confederation of Sports
(NIF). In order to provide the world-wide reach needed for sample
collection, the DFSC has partnered with International Doping Tests
and Management (IDTM).

<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Lance Armstrong looked to win his
second victory in Tour de France after winning the individual time
trials Friday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion crossed the finish line at the end of
the 19th stage in Mulhouse in eastern France after a 58.5
kilometer ride from Freiburg, Germany, 25 seconds ahead of his
nearest competitor, Jan Ullrich of Deutsche Telekom. France's
Christophe Moreau was third, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
With a lead of six minutes, two seconds ahead of Ullrich,
Armstrong looked virtually unbeatable with just two days to go
before the Tour finishes in Paris on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 87th Tour de France concludes this weekend with a mostly
flat 254.5-kilometer race Saturday to the west, then _following a
late-night transfer by Orient Express train to their Paris hotels _
a largely ceremonial final 138-kilometer dash within the French
capital.

BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese police officer
today called for concerted efforts of the international community
to effectively control chemicals used to make drugs.
</P>
<P>
An Guojun, a officer from the narcotics control bureau of the
Ministry of Public Security, made the remark at the ICPO-Interpol
International Heroin Conference, which closed here today.

He said that "it's hard for any individual country to bring
such crime under control as it usually involves a number of
countries and regions."
</P>
<P>
The officer proposed that members of the International Criminal
Police Organization (ICPO) should cooperate more closely in the
fight against narcotics and establish a better a control system on
precursor chemicals as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Talks to Resume Within Months: Egyptian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Osama al-Baz, political advisor to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said here on Friday that peace
talks between Syria and Israel may resume within the coming few
months.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is committed to the peace
process and it is up to Israel to work for the resumption of peace
negotiations, al-Baz told reporters upon returning from Syria where
he attended a ceremony Thursday that marked the end of the 40-day
mourning period for late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, died in June at the age of 69
after ruling Syria for three decades.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baz stressed that Bashar al-Assad is ready to continue the
peace process and urged Israel to take this opportunity and not to
put obstacles in the way of resuming the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Mubarak would meet with al-Assad in the coming
period.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held a telephone conversation on Friday, during
which they discussed the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations
at Camp David presidential retreat in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke off in January after a
brief resumption following a freeze of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands that Israel withdraw from all land it occupied in
the 1967 Mideast War, including the Golan Heights and the northeast
bank of the Sea of Galilee, while Israel refuses to cede any access
to the lake, its major water source.

<P>
New Delhi's position was conveyed during an hour-long meeting
between K.V. Rajan, Secretary (East) of India's External Affairs
Ministry, and 18 Arab Ambassadors here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries were urged not to be "oversensitive" or
react to speculative media reports following the recent visit by
senior Indian leaders to Israel, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi was surprised and disturbed at the "unfair" and "
unwarranted" speculation in certain quarters that India's
developing relations with Israel somehow would have implications
for New Delhi's relations with the Arab world, Rajan was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Syrian head of mission Saddik Saddikni was
quoted as telling the press: "We are satisfied with the
discussions," adding that "our major thrust is to continue cordial
relations with India."
</P>
<P>
According to the Sudanese Ambassador, certain clarifications
were sought from the Indian side on reports of nuclear cooperation
between New Delhi and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rajan responded that the Indian government has made categorical
and unambiguous denials on this issue, the PTI said.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Warns Refugees Against Joining Tanzanian Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Friday warned refugees hosted in
Tanzania against joining the country's forthcoming parliamentary
and presidential polls scheduled for October this year.
</P>
<P>
"Refugees are not Tanzanian citizens, they should not attempt
to register themselves as voters or participate in the voting
process," the UNHCR said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will hold on October 29 its second multiparty
presidential and parliamentary elections in which President
Benjamin Mkapa will run for his second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party chaired by
Mkapa also named Zanzibar Minister for Communication and Transport
Amani Abeid Karume as CCM's only candidate for the Zanzibar
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Agency alerted the refugees that if they are offered
money or other incentives to either register or vote, they should
refuse to accept them and report to either Tanzanian authorities
or the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very dangerous to them to ignore the warning," the
UNHCR said. "The Electoral Law of Tanzania stipulates that any
person who registers as a voter while he is not entitled to do so
is liable to a fine of up to 20,000 Tanzanian shillings (about 25
U.S. dollars) and or up to two-year imprisonment."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that there are some 450,000 refugees,
mostly from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
Rwanda, presently sheltered in western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program announced on Thursday that it has no
choice but to slash food rations to the refugees by 40 percent due
to a severe lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR called on the refugees to respect the hospitality of
Tanzanians by not interfering in their internal affairs. "UNHCR
hopes that some day they will be able to exercise the voting
rights in their own countries of origin when conditions will
permit their return," it said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports 300,000 Child Soldiers Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday began a closed-door session to discuss the issue of
children and armed conflicts, which involved 300,000 child
soldiers across the globe.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council will discuss a report by U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, who said, "The number of children under the
age of 18 who have been coerced or induced to take up arms as
child soldiers is generally thought to be in the range of 300,000.
"
</P>
<P>
"In the internecine conflicts of recent years, children have
increasingly been victimized as both the targets and the
perpetrators of violence," the report said. "Almost one half of
the world's 21 million refugees are children, while it is
estimated that another 13 million children have been displaced
within the borders of their own countries."
</P>
<P>
Most modern conflicts are taking place within countries, and
most of the victims are innocent civilians. Over the past decade,
some five million civilians were killed in the intrastate armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Each year, between 8,000 and 10,000 children are the victims
of landmines," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on Member States to hammer out specific measures
to protect children in armed conflicts, including setting the
minimum age for compulsory recruitment or direct participation in
hostilities at 18.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Leaders Concerned About Conflicts in Debt-ridden Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations Friday expressed deep
concern about the military conflicts in the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPCs) that ask for debt relief.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here after their summit, the G-7 leaders
said, "We are concerned by the facts that a number of HIPCs are
currently affected by military conflicts which prevent poverty
reduction and delay debt relief."
</P>
<P>
The statement called on these countries to end their
involvement in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"We agree to strengthen our efforts to help them prepare and
come forward for debt relief, by asking our ministers to make
early contact with the countries in conflicts to encourage them to
create the right conditions to participate in the HIPC initiative,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the G-7 launched the HIPC initiative at a summit in
Cologne, Germany, to deliver faster, broader and deeper debt
relief, releasing funds for poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 hailed the efforts being made by the HIPCs to develop
comprehensive and country-owned poverty relief strategies through
a participatory process involving civil society.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also expressed their determination to work
together to ensure that as many countries as possible reach their
decision points, in line with the targets set in the Cologne
summit, giving due consideration to the progress of economic
reforms and the need to ensure that the benefits of debt relief
are targeted to assist the poor and most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 comprises the United States, France, Italy, Germany,
Britain, Canada and Japan.

<HEADLINE> France's Industrial Output Rises in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 21 (Xinhua)-- France's industrial production in
May increased by 0.7 percent over April and by 4.7 percent over
the same month last year, said the French official economic
statistics institution INSEE on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial production in April dropped by 0.3
percent compared with March.
</P>
<P>
The return of dynamism is mainly due to a 2.3 percent increase
in consumption of French products by domestic and foreign buyers,
said the INSEE.
</P>
<P>
French economists expect the industrial activities could
accelerate in the coming months because of rising dynamism in
domestic consumption and soaring exports.
</P>
<P>
France posted a 12.3 billion franc (1.8 billion U.S. dollars)
trade surplus in May, eight times that in April, because of the
sale of 18 Airbus aircraft and several satellites.

<HEADLINE> China Releases Report on Overseas-Funded Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A report on the past decade of
development of overseas-funded enterprises in China has been
released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1998, the numbers of companies and employees and
investment in the sector all recorded average year-on-year growth
rates of 33 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures revealed in the report, a total of 227,800
overseas-funded enterprises had been set up in China by the end of
1998, involving an investment of 774.2 billion U.S. dollars and
employing 5.87 million employees.
</P>
<P>
Among the overseas-funded enterprises, joint ventures make up
the majority. But the number of firms exclusively funded by
overseas investors has shown a huge increase in recent years, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report disclosed that 75 percent of the overseas-funded
enterprises are in the manufacturing industry, while only 2.4
percent are engaged in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1998, some 86.6 percent of overseas-funded
enterprises were clustered in eastern China, but the number of
such enterprises set up in the western areas within the decade
grew at a yearly rate of 44.7 percent, 14 percentage points higher
than in the east," the report says.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States
and Japan are the biggest overseas investors in China's inland
regions.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the United States alone set up over 19,000
enterprises in China, ranking first among overseas investors.
These firms involved a total capital of 25.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's entry to the World Trade Organization will provide the
overseas-funded enterprises with more opportunities for further
development, as the country is making its investment policies more
open and transparent to meet the WTO standards, the report said,
predicting that more overseas investment will flock into a variety
of fields, such as banking, insurance, stocks, legal services,
accounting and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The report was published by the China Social Sciences
Documentation Publishing House.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Imports of Snow Brand Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine has issued a notice banning
imports of Japanese-made Snow Brand dairy products, which are said
to be bacteria-tainted.
</P>
<P>
The notice says that all the imported Snow Brand products will
be confiscated and destroyed, and urges that customs inspections
be tightened in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Since June this year, more than 14,000 people have fallen ill
from consuming bacteria-tainted milk in the Osaka area of western
Japan. Investigations show that the Snow Brand Milk Products Co.
Ltd. is responsible for this incident.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the milk contains certain bacteria that can
produce toxins that can trigger vomitting and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
A small quantity of Snow Brand dairy products has been imported
into China, sources say.
</P>
<P>
The ban is based on the Foodstuffs Sanitation Law of the People
's Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> Air Ticket Price Not to Climb with Rising Oil Price: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China will not comprehensively
lift air ticket prices in spite of the fourfold increase of oil
prices in the first half of this year, according to an official
with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) here today.
</P>
<P>
The oil price hike has added 1.27 billion yuan to the oil cost
of domestic airlines, accounting for 31 percent of the total cost,
compared to the previous 22 percent, according to Hai Liancheng,
director of the finance department of CAAC.
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to raise the ticket price. On the contrary,
we will make efforts to upgrade profits through improving
efficiency and lowering expenditure," said Hai.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't deny the possibility of raising the ticket
prices on some popular air routes.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the gross air transportation
turnover reached 5.56 billion ton-kilometers in the first half of
2000, while the volume of passengers and cargo hit 31.4 million
persons and 894,000 tons, up 15.1 percent, 12.7 percent and 15.3
percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> China to Loosen Control Over Air Ticket Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China will moderately loosen the
control over air ticket prices and let them change with the market
situation, according to an official with the General
administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) here today.
</P>
<P>
With the gradual perfection of regulations and market order,
China's civil aviation authorities will become supervisors of air
ticket prices instead of directly fixing them, Hai Liancheng,
director of the CAAC finance department, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noted that Chinese passengers will have the
chance to enjoy preferential prices soon, since airlines are to
decide the prices themselves.
</P>
<P>
CAAC gave permission for ticket price discounts to attract
more passengers in 1997, which was warmly welcomed by air
travelers.
</P>
<P>
However, the measure finally caused negative price competition
among airlines, due to inadequate market regulations. As a result,
the industry suffered a loss of 2.4 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, CAAC resumed the system of fixed prices, helping the
sector turn losses into profits.
</P>
<P>
"But this is merely a temporary policy. How to perfect the
price policy is a vital part of the reform of China's civil
aviation, and our final target is to establish a flexible pricing
system under macro control," said Hai.

<P>
Under this new policy for stimulating scientific research, the
family of the late Professor Yu Min received a 90,000-yuan
allowance from the university, the Guangming Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest individual sum of money ever granted by the
university. It was a reward for Yu's strenuous work in writing a
linguistic paper, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The university administration said that the granting of
allowances will be linked to individual workloads, research
projects and papers published in academic journals.
</P>
<P>
This will greatly increase the income of researchers, said Yuan
Guiren, president of the university, adding that the concerned
regulations should be made clearer, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The university's Vice-President Shi Peijun said that 20 percent
backbone researchers have shared 80 percent of the total allowance.

<HEADLINE> France to Adopt Vigilant Measures Against Money-Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy, Finance
and Industry Laurent Fabius Friday asked the country's central
bank to adopt extra vigilant measures against the financial
operations of the 15 countries and territories which are found non-
cooperative in the fight against money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
The 15 countries and territories were pinpointed by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a
report on money-laundering released last month.
</P>
<P>
Fabius asked the governor of the central bank, the Bank of
France, Jean-Claude Trichet, and the banking and insurance
commissions of the bank "to take all measures in their power to
implement and control the effective application of the appeal for
vigilance," according to a communique of the Ministry of Economy,
Finance and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at persuading the 15 countries and
territories to implement necessary reforms to comply with the 40
recommendations by an OECD-affiliated group, the Group of
Financial Action on Laundering of Capitals, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed at asking these countries and territories to "
adopt a constructive attitude in the field of international
cooperation and exchange of information."
</P>
<P>
If these countries and territories refuse to accept the OECD
proposals, France and its European Union (EU) partners will take
measures of direct sanctions, including financial sanctions, said
the communique.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized
countries who met early this month in Fukuoka, Japan, threatened
to impose sanctions on those countries accused of financial
delinquency if they don't correct their policies in one year.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states' finance, interior and justice ministers
will work out, at a meeting to be held on October 17 in Luxembourg,
concrete measures against the countries which refuse to cooperate
in the fight against money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
The 15 countries and territories accused by the OECD are the
Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, the Dominican Republic,
Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue,
Russia, Panama, the Philippines, Saint Kitts-and-Nevis, Saint
Vincent and Grenadines.

<HEADLINE> Belgian King Hails Community Closeness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Belgian King Albert II said here
Friday that relations between the country's Flemish-speaking and
French-speaking communities have improved recently.
</P>
<P>
In a National Day speech delivered on Friday, the king
attributed the good and stable ties of the country's two major
peoples to the current coalition of Flemish- and French-speaking
liberal, social and green parties.
</P>
<P>
Belgium got rid of the rule by the Netherlands in 1830. In the
following year, Belgium became independent as Leopold I was
proclaimed king of Belgium. July 21 was set as the country's
national day.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Belgium has developed into two parts: the French-
speaking Wallonia region and the Flemish-speaking Flanders region.
The two peoples, with different languages, cultures and historical
experiences, have not been getting along well.
</P>
<P>
However, Belgium's political scene is now relatively stable
despite feuds between the two ethnic groups. The Liberal-led
ruling coalition has announced a number of major policy
initiatives, including public services reform, judiciary
proceedings and new food and veterinary controls.
</P>
<P>
Despite some disagreements, these initiatives have not given
rise to insuperable divergences between the coalition partners,
largely thanks to the skills of Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt.
</P>
<P>
For Belgium, community relations have always been important for
national stability, security and economic development.

LHASA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 325 college and technical
secondary school students in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region went to pastoral areas today to spread basic scientific
knowledge.

more science and technology-minded, so that they can battle
diseases more effectively and protect the environment. He noted
that superstition and pseudoscience still wield a great deal of
influence in Tibet.

HONG KONG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Internet publication and
Internet bookstores in the Chinese mainland, though somewhat late
in initiation, has great potential for future development, a
Chinese official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Xin Guangwei, chief of the Information Division of the Press
and Publication Administration of the People's Republic of China,
was speaking at the Asian Publishing Conference held at the Hong
Kong Book Fair 2000.
</P>
<P>
Though somewhat backward as compared to western countries,
China's E-publication has made big progress in the past few years,
Xin said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there had been more than 730
publishing houses throughout the Chinese mainland, of which more
than 200 ones have websites, making up 30 percent of the total, he
said.
</P>
<P>
More than one seventh of the newspapers nationwide have gone on-
line, and Internet bookstores have reached some 100, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's E-bookstores are operated by publishing houses,
state-owned bookstores and non-governmental bookstores, among
which state-owned and non-governmental bookstores, are the main
operators, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xin, as a cyber-fan who often buys books via Internet
bookstores, spoke highly of the mainland's Internet bookstore
operators, saying that the services of mainland Internet
bookstores are 80 percent satisfactory.

<P>
Speaking of the prospect of the mainland Internet publication
and Internet bookstores, Xin believed the future is brilliant
though there are some unfavorable factors ahead.
</P>
<P>
"One of the unique favorable factors for the mainland to
develop Internet publication and Internet bookstores is the strong
objective demand for Internet publication and distribution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abundant human resources and lower cost of labor force in the
mainland also make it convenient for book delivery in the urban
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Relative low cost in setting up storage warehouses is another
favorable factor for the development of Internet bookstores in the
mainland, according to Xin.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid change of the consumption and reading concepts
of the readers of the new generation, surfers using e-commerce are
rising fast, gradually solidifying the foundation for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of the Chinese mainland Internet surfers has
topped 10 million and computers have become a new necessity of
many urban families, Xin said.
</P>
<P>
Xin also stressed the government's unprecedented enthusiasm and
strong support for information industry.
</P>
<P>
A series of policies beneficial to the development of
information industry were drawn up in various localities, which is
another important factor for promoting the expansion of the
Internet and Internet bookstores, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xin also talked about a number of unfavorable factors hindering
the development of Internet publication and Internet bookstores in
the Chinese mainland, such as press professionals' lack of a basic
understanding of the Internet and the impact of the Internet upon
publication and distribution.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese mainland is at a developing stage, the social
environment for Internet expansion is less than satisfactory,
which finds expression in the limited use of credit cards,
incomplete financial system, deficient mail delivery and
distribution system and unwanted business credit.
</P>
<P>
"These are the important factors affecting the development of
the Chinese mainland Internet publication and Internet bookstores,
" Xin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China is to establish three large
airline groups, based on its top three airlines -- Air China,
China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines, according to
an official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
here today.
</P>
<P>
Xia Xinghua, director of the department of policy and
regulation of CAAC, said that the three new groups will involve
the ten airlines administered by the CAAC, including Air China,
China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China Northern

</P>
<P>
In addition to the ten companies, China has 24 local airlines.
</P>
<P>
According to Xia, the three groups expect to have assets worth
more than 40 billion yuan each, and almost equal market shares,
which will be conducive to healthy competition among them.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no timetable for the formation of the
groups, but "the faster the better".

<HEADLINE> China Investigates Illegal Health Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health (MOH) has
found that nearly 80 kinds of health food products exaggerate
their curative effects in its latest investigation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the MOH has prohibited the production of these
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing the names of these health foods today, Zhao Tonggang,
director of the MOH law and supervision department, said that the
actions of these food producers have severely violated the Food
Hygiene Law of the People's Republic of China and the Health Food
Management Regulations of the People's Republic of China, cheated
and misled consumers, and disturbed the health food market.
</P>
<P>
The Health Food Management Regulations of the People's Republic
of China state that health food should not hint that it can cure
diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhao noted that some enterprises simply pursue profits,
with no regard to laws or regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao also pointed out that some products claim that they "can
improve sexual function", but until now, "the MOH has not approved
any such health food".
</P>
<P>
The MOH also revealed its investigation findings of disposable
medical and sanitation products, finding that 93.7 percent are
qualified. Among the 5,211 cosmetics checked, 81 percent of the
imported cosmetics were up to the standard, and 68 percent of the
China-made ones were qualified.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Hails Decisive Victories in Anti-Falun Gong Drive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua, China's official news
agency, published a commentary today, saying that the government
has won decisive victories in its one-year old campaign against
the ``Falun Gong" cult.
</P>
<P>
It warns that the campaign, which was launched by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 22, 1999,
and is being led by the CPC, will be a long-term, tortuous and
complicated one.
</P>
<P>
``Falun Gong" is a "poisonous torrent" moving against the trend
of the times, and has caused thousands of its followers to go mad
or even commit suicide, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the anti-science, anti-humanity and anti-
society cult has been turned into an anti-government political
organization and a tool for overseas anti-China forces, which has
exposed the ugly face of the cult leader Li Hongzhi and his ``
Falun Gong" group.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, since May this year, the cult leader
has came out from behind the curtain to publish his instructions
via the Internet and repeatedly spelt out his hackneyed remark
about the "final chance for 'consummation'" to urge his followers
to come out "against the pressure", and risk direct confrontation
with the government.
</P>
<P>
"The law of the human world is in contradiction with that of
the Cosmos," Li is quoted as saying, urging his followers to go to
Beijing to promote ``Falun Gong" by "refusing to be confined by
the law of the human world."

<P>
As a result of Li's agitation, the number of Falun Gong members
participating in illegal gatherings in the Tiananmen area has
increased, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Some other Falun Gong followers have pressured the government
to rehabilitate the cult, and some have distributed leaflets
supporting Falun Gong or openly practiced its rituals, according
to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
All these things show that Falun Gong has come to the end of
its tether and is putting up a deathbed struggle, Xinhua comments.
</P>
<P>
Since the government banned the cult a year ago, more and more
crimes committed by Falun Gong have come to light, it says.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, more than 1,500 people have died
and over 600 have gone mad as a result of practicing Falun Gong
and the personality cult created by the cult leader.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Falun Gong members have held 78 illegal
demonstrations around government compounds and news media offices.
</P>
<P>
At the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights, held in April this year, Li and other cult leaders noisily
supported the anti-China proposal made by the United States in the
disguise of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The facts show that Falun Gong is an evil force which is anti-
science, anti-humanity, anti-society and anarchistic. It is also a
trouble-making group that attempts to challenge the Party and the
government, and disturb social stability and national prosperity.
In short, it is a complete evil cult, Xinhua comments.

In the past year, the government has dealt with Falun Gong by
cracking down on backbone Falun Gong elements and helping ordinary
practitioners return to normal life through education, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The Party and the government have issued a series of important
decisions on the issue of Falun Gong, which have been cordially
welcomed by the majority of former Falun Gong practitioners and
the general Chinese public. So far, 98 percent of the
practitioners have resumed their normal lives and regained their
dignity, it says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the rehabilitation of the Falun Gong
practitioners has been done with the overall participation of
Party organizations, government departments, schools, work units,
communities and family members.
</P>
<P>
The international community is in agreement that cults are a
harmful factor damaging the social environment, and criminal
activities by cults must be eradicated by law, according to the
Xinhua article.
</P>
<P>
Since Falun Gong was banned, the Chinese government has
punished backbone members of the cult, and has also issued an
order to arrest the cult leader Li Hongzhi, it notes.

As of the end of June this year, courts at different levels
have handled 162 Falun Gong cases involving 141 people, of whom
123 were given criminal penalties, and 15 were released without
being penalized.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the China is determined to carry out the
anti-Falun Gong campaign through to the end, as Li Hongzhi and his
followers are not reconciled to their defeat.
</P>
<P>
The cult has changed its tactics for confrontation with the
government, sent agents underground, and formed the so-called "
second echelon", in order to pose a long-term challenge to the
Party and the government, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that there is still a small number of die-hard
Falun Gong practitioners, the article says that to educate these
people will take a long time.
</P>
<P>
The article also urges everyone to take note of the profound
social background and complicated international background behind
the issue of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The soil and the greenhouse for breeding Falun Gong are yet to
be eliminated in China, while foreign hostile, anti-China forces
have never stopped their efforts to "westernize" and "disintegrate
" China, it says.
</P>
<P>
It urges the general public to make great efforts to advocate
science, improve the quality of the people through popularizing
modern science, and strengthen and improve ideological work, so as
to win an overall victory in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Host 3rd Global Habitat Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will host the Third
Global Forum of Parliamentarians on Habitat on July 25-28 which
will gather no less than 200 delegates representing about 50
countries.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Biazon, chairman of the Philippine Senate's Urban
Planning, Housing and Resettlement Committee, said Friday that the
delegates will discuss how responsive law making and effective
policy development can help in solving the world's habitat problem.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1987 and boasting a membership of 177 countries, the
Global Parliamentarians on Habitat is an organization of
individuals committed to the Habitat Agenda adopted by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Biazon, who is also co-chair of the Third Global Forum of
Parliamentarians on Habitat, said in a press conference that
delegates will discuss ways to alter the state of homelessness of
at least 100 million people in the world.
</P>
<P>
The four-day forum will also address the issue of providing
adequate shelter, food, water, and decent employment to more than
1 billion people in situation of abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to Biazon, another major agenda of the meeting is to
shape a more sustainable economy and environment for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly are not promising immediate solutions to these
problems. What is important is that we have a common realization
and understanding of the extent of our problems and the urgency
required of our actions," said the senator.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the delegates will also assess and evaluate
the legislative work that has been accomplished since the Habitat
Agenda was adopted by 171 governments at the second United Nations
Conference on Human Settlements held in Istanbul, Turkey in 1996.

<HEADLINE> G7 Leaders Hail Ukraine Closing Troubled Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Seven (G7) major industrial countries Friday welcomed Ukraine's
decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on December 15
this year.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said in a statement that the G7 will continue to
cooperate with the Ukrainian government in addressing the problems
related with the permanent shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1986, a reactor explosion at the Chernobyl power
plant sent out waves of radiation that spread over 12 of Ukraine's
26 states, covering an area of 50,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
About 3.2 million Ukrainians, including one million children,
were affected in the worst nuclear disaster in history. So far,170,
000 of them have died of radiation-related illnesses and 70,000
others have become disabled for life.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, Ukraine closed one of the two working
reactors at the Chernobyl power plant and in December that year it
declared that the entire Chernobyl station would be closed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The G7 leaders urged the Ukrainian government to accelerate its
power sector reforms, which will attract more investment in the
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to assisting Ukraine
in preparing and implementing energy projects based on the
principles of least cost.
</P>
<P>
The G7 comprises the United States, Japan, France, Italy,
Germany, Canada, Britain.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-Funded Firms Contribute 44 Percent of China's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in
China contribute 44 percent of the country's exports, according to
the latest research report.
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the Private Economy Research Center
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises have made increasing contributions
to the country's exports, with their total exports growing at an
annual 31 percent since 1991, the report says.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises make up 15 percent of the country's gross
industrial product. "It is hard to imagine China keeping its
annual economic growth rate of 10 percent without contributions
from overseas-funded enterprises," the report says.
</P>
<P>
The proportion coming from overseas-funded enterprises in China
's annual revenues is about 14 percent, below that of the state-
owned and collective-owned enterprises, but higher than the
contribution of the private and self-employed sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to figures revealed in the report, overseas-funded
enterprises employ 5.8 million people, accounting for three
percent of the country's total employees.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises, totalling about 230,000 at present,
fall into two categories: those set up by foreign enterprises and
those from China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Reaching Israeli-Palestinian Deal Possible: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
told one of his ministers here Friday morning that it is possible
to reach an agreement with the Palestinians at Camp David, despite
the difficulties in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Environment Minister Dalia Itzik, who had phone
conversations with Barak Friday morning, said that Barak made this
estimation, although it is clear, he admitted, that the negotiation
is difficult and complicated.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit, attended by Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, began on July 11 and
tried to resolve all the core issues between the two sides,
including the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Itzik did not say whether Barak's optimistic remarks had
relations with the Jerusalem sovereignty sharing proposal, which
was revealed early Friday by Rabbi Michael Melchior, the minister
without portfolio and one member of the Israeli delegation to Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
It appears recently that the intractable Jerusalem issue had
been the major stumbling block in the peace talks, due to both
sides' uncompromising stands on the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided capital,"
while the Palestinians want to see at least the eastern part of the
city, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war, as the
capital of their own future state.
</P>
<P>
Melchior told Israel Radio Friday that Barak is inclined to
agree to share sovereignty with the Palestinians in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S.-presented proposal, Israel would annex
several Jewish settlements near Jerusalem, including Ma'aleh
Adumim, the largest one on the West Bank, into a bigger Jerusalem
municipality.
</P>
<P>
In return, Palestinian National Authority could share
sovereignty in Arab East Jerusalem, while Israel will maintain
security control over the areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel will agree to establish some safe passages for providing
Arab pilgrims access to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holiest Muslim site
in the stone-walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the status quo in the Old City, which is full of
famous religious sites of the three world religions --
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, will be maintained for several
years, during which a final solution could be found.
</P>
<P>
The model is something like granting administration-plus
sovereignty of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians, the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Palestinians are considering the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Itzik said she had briefed the prime minister about the public
reactions to the proposal and an opinion poll showed that most
Israelis do not support such a plan.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was published by Israel's Yediot Aharonot
newspaper Friday morning, indicated that 70 percent of Israeli
interviewees were opposed to handing over sovereignty of any part
of the city to the Palestinians, while only 27 percent said they
would not oppose such a handover.
</P>
<P>
The poll interviewed 525 Israeli Jews and had a margin of error
of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ariel Sharon, leader of the major opposition Likud
party, blasted Barak for his reported concessions regarding
Jerusalem, and accused the prime minister of breaking his election
promise not to divide the Holy city.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a member of the right-wing Likud,
also told Israel Radio that if the report were true, it would be
a "flagrant, unequivocal" violation of the commitment Barak gave to
the people of Israel concerning Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the most dovish
figures in Barak's cabinet, retorted that it is an illusion to
consider these Arab villages and neighborhoods as part of a "united
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Beilin said those neighborhoods are not parts of Jerusalem for
any Israelis and the issue should not be standing in the way
between the Jewish state and a peace accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We definitely don't need these villages," he told Israel's Army
Radio.

CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Petroleum Co. (TPAO) and the U.S. Arco
company have halted an off-shore joint exploration in the western
Black Sea as no oil or gas was found, Anatolia News Agency reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The work started in July 1999 to drill two wells, 70 kilometers
off Igneada on the Black Sea and 80 kilometers off the Bosphorus
outlet, at a cost of 45-50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
TPAO holds stakes in overseas deals such as the Mega Project in
Azerbaijan, operated by ALOC. The company owns 12,000 of the 100,
000 barrels daily production under Mega Project.
</P>
<P>
TPAO is also actively involved in exploration and production of
carbon reserves in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iraq, Algeria and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Phileleftheros newspaper, Cyrus's leading daily,
has reached a cooperation deal with the Lambrakis publishing group
of Greece, one of the largest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for joint specialized publications here
and in Greece, the launching of an Internet Portal in Cyprus and
the building of a modern printing complex in Nicosia for newspapers
and magazines, the Financial Weekly newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Lambrakis publishing group now controls eight newspapers and
22 magazines. It also have business interests in related fields
such as television, film production, press agencies, books,
bookshops and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1922, it became a public company with a listing on the
Athens Stock Exchange as from November 1998, and a market
capitalization of 3 billion euros (2.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Phileleftheros, which has the largest circulation on the island,
is also negotiating the acquisition of other local newspapers and
publications to add to existing magazines in the group.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has earned an annual income of 15 million U.S.
dollars in flower exports to Russia, Ukraine and Moldova in recent
years, Anatolia News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lutfi Gobus, chairman of the Turkish Flower Exporters
Association, said that Turkey had exported 140 million branches of
flowers every year, obtaining an income of 20 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the flower trade sector had been suffering a crisis
in recent years, adding that the demand from Britain, one of the
major importers of Turkish flowers, had also sharply dropped.
</P>
<P>
"The producing and exporting companies have started to prepare
for the year 2001, establishing new greenhouses in a bid to
increase production and improve quality," Gobus said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one of the major problems of the Turkish flower
sector was slow transportation, he suggested to make more extensive
use of air cargo.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank has agreed to finance a number of
technology projects in Egypt, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank will finance the establishment of training centers in

skills of government employees and acquaint them with the latest
technology, World Bank Director for Egypt and the Middle East
Khalid Ikram said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also conduct an analytic study, which may last two

<HEADLINE> Scientists Raise New Theory on Mass Extinction of Life 250 Million Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have claimed
that the mass extinction of living things some 250 million years
ago didn't occur in two or three phases as previously thought, but
all at once.
</P>
<P>
The new theory is of great significance to finding answers to
the mystery of mass extinction, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. magazine Science today published the theory, raised by
a research group led by Jin Yugan, a research fellow at Nanjing
Institute of Geology and Paleontology affiliated with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, China's highest learning institution of
natural sciences.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented mass extinction 250 million years ago has
long perplexed scientists. The extinction was responsible for the
deaths of half of the marine life and one third of the onshore
life killed in a total of six mass extinctions over the past 600
million years.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, scientists believed that the mass extinction 250
million years ago was caused by the sinking sea level, which
worsened environmental conditions and led to the mass destruction
of life. They surmised that living things died in two or three
separate disasters between 263 million and 251 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese scientists cast doubt on that theory after
their discovery of abundant fossils in the 1970s at Meishan
Mountain in Chengle County, east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Using carbon dating technology, Jin's group believes that there
was only one catastrophic event in that period.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, Jin and his colleagues have
systematically studied 333 kinds of fossils in Meishan,
determining that most of the fossils belonged to certain strata.
</P>
<P>
In these strata, carbon isotopes, an indicator of the
extinction of life, decreased sharply. In addition, microspheres --
evidence of volcanic eruption or extra-terrestrial impact -- were
hundreds of times the level of other stratum.
</P>
<P>
Jin's group includes Wang Yue, Wang Wei, Shang Qinghua and Cao
Changqun. Support has been lent by D. H. Erwin of the National
Museum of Natural History with Smithsonian Institution of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese researchers believe its most likely that the mass
extinction was caused by volcanic eruption or extra-terrestrial
impacts, perhaps from meteorites.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 million years ago, catastrophes known as Siberian Trap
volcanism devastated the earth. The mass extinction can be
compared with the deaths of dinosaurs during the transition from
the Mesozoic to Cenozoic eras 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The extinction led to the transition from the Paleozoic to
Mesozoic eras, in which ecosystems changed profoundly and new
living species emerged.
</P>
<P>
The theory posited by Jin and his colleagues adds weight to the
belief that disasters and the ability to survive are equally
important to the evolution of living things, posing a new
challenge to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.

<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai composite index
advanced 9.15 points or 0.46 percent on Friday to 1,996.34 points
from last week's 1,987.19 points.
</P>
<P>
The turnover this week was 3.18 billion yuan, which was 35
percent less than that of last week's 97.27 billion yuan,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Composite Index crossed over the 2000-point target
on Wednesday morning at the stock market open. The index was
pushed upwards to a new high of 2,004.46 points by big-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
Investors felt excited when the market index had their dream
come true -- "2000 points in year 2000". It took ten years for the
Chinese stock market to reach this historic milestone. The
Shanghai Composite Index was one of the benchmarks off the Chinese
stock market. The index climbed over 1,000 points in 1992 when
here were only eight listed A share companies on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, investors are still concerned and want to take profits
as the index is on the historical high level.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the IPO market pressure also made investors be
concerned about the secondary market. Each day from Tuesday to
Thursday, two new a shares debuted on the Shenzhen or Shanghai
stock market and three companies issued their new A shares on the
two bourses on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
During this week, H shares had a good performance, which may be
related to positive news about H shares developments, disclosed by
CSRC's vice-president Gao Xiqing in a symposium.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the market will probably cross
the 2000 points again next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua)-- The Shanghai B-share market
inherited its strong performance last week and consolidated around
58 points, which was the best level in the year.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index rose 0.9 points or 1.57 percent to 58.35 at
the end of the week, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover was 78.99 million US dollars, which was
25.65 million US dollars or 48.09 percent more than the total of
last week.
</P>
<P>
The market maintained well its positive note and traded in
remarkably steady fashion after an early burst that was incited by
strong earnings news and favorable comments from government
officials about the state of the economy and the structural
acceleration of reform.
</P>
<P>
Buying interest has tapered off in the late sessions, but the
market held to tight trading ranges with no real sense of going
far down, as healthy leadership had been the stabilizing
influences.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the B-share market will
continue to do just fine next week as the broader Shanghai stock
market has been supported by a solid contribution from wide
sectors to test continually the landmark 2000 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market failed
to stay on the positive side and posted four straight losing
streaks with the only exception on Monday, when it consolidated
with an upward move.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index fell 1.39 points or 1.24 percent to 113.89 at
the end of the week, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover was 389.48 million HK dollars, which was
142.55 million HK dollars or 57.73 percent more than the total of
last week.
</P>
<P>
The market had moved in corrections as most of the stocks'
under-performance was owing to some sellers, who had gradually
turned their eyes to shares under the Special Treat and Particular
Transfer sectors for bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
Still no major disruption behind the week's weak tone. Sellers
had pretty much remained on the sidelines to this point, not
willing to press their luck against the bulls, which have been
emboldened by the notion of strong earnings news and favorable
comments from government officials about the state of the economy
and the structural acceleration of reform.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the B-share market is likely to
end its cautious move next week and spike higher taking comfort in
the acknowledgment that the economy and the corporate earnings
profile appear to be improving steadily.

People today.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions,
briefed the guests on China's political and economic situation as
well as the work of China's trade unions.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the socialist market economy and the
profound changes in the economic and labor sectors, the trade
unions' responsibility to safeguard the interests of the workers
should be stressed, Wei said.

countries based on the principles of independence, equality,
mutual respect, and non-interference into each other's internal
affairs, Wei said.

<P>
IMF President Klaus Zwichel said member delegates have seen for
themselves in this current visit the tremendous changes that have

<HEADLINE> China to Contribute More in Global Fight Against Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official vowed
here today that China would contribute more in the worldwide
campaign against narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fengrui, bureau chief of narcotics control under the
Ministry of Public Security, made the remark at the closing
ceremony of the four-day 5th ICPO-Interpol International Heroin
Conference.
</P>
<P>
As a country neighboring the notorious drug-producing Golden
Triangle and Golden Crescent, China, with a reported drug
population of over 680,000, feels the urgency to fight narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Fully aware of its duties and responsibilities in the anti-drug
cause, China is willing to join hands with the international
community to tackle this problem, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has gone all out and made some headway
in helping its drug-producing neighbors to switch from growing
opium poppies to other legal and profitable plants, hoping to draw
local farmers out of poverty and get to the source of the drug-
production problem.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its efforts in this regard, but the road is
a long one, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, China will strengthen its communication of
information and law-enforcement cooperation with other countries
to keep the illegal drug trade in and out of China to a minimum.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese prosecutors nationwide
investigated 908 "extra-grave" cases of malfeasance or abuse of
power in the first six months this year, said Li Baotang, director
of the department handling such crimes under the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, here today.
</P>
<P>
The "extra-grave" cases are those involving high-profile
officials, at least one million yuan in loss, loss of human life
or serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Of the malfeasance cases and crimes violating personal and
democratic rights of citizens, 125 involved officials at or above
the county-head level, said Li at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
These cases were only a fraction of the 3,126 such cases
registered with prosecutors' offices in China in the first half of
this year, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The number of such cases investigated rose by 50 percent over
the same period last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Through handling these cases, prosecutors helped to recover 63.
57 million yuan of economic losses for the state.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, prosecutors investigated 1,496 cases that
involved judges, prosecutors themselves and policemen, who were
accused of abusing their official duties or torturing suspects to
get confessions, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also handled 572 cases that involved law
enforcement officers in administrative departments such as

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Chinese were killed by
food poisoning during the second quater this year, announced an
official of the Ministry of Health (MOH) today.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Tonggang, director of the MOH department of Health Law and
Supervision, said MOH has received 39 reports of severe food
poisoning, with 2,222 people poisoned and 25 people killed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of the incidents occurred in June. Most of
the people were poisoned by food contaminated with bacteria or
toxic chemicals. Over half of those poisoned were students eating
in school dining halls.
</P>
<P>
"The number of people poisoned in April-June is four times that
of the January-March period this year," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the severe food poisoning cases share
similar characteristics: producers and processors of the
contaminated food pay little attention to the processing,
transport, storage, and sale of the products.
</P>
<P>
MOH has asked health departments at various levels to take
steps to eliminate hidden factors contributing to food poisoning,
and to educate workers in the industry about sanitary handling of
food.
</P>
<P>
Health and catering industry departments will hold a
comprehensive check-up of catering enterprises, stressing the
sanitation of processing places, Zhao said.

BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Iran have the
potential to expand their bilateral cooperation in both the
diplomatic and economic fields, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Korn
Dabbarangsi told new Iranian Ambassador to Thailand Rasoul Eslami,
who paid a courtesy call on him on Friday, that, along with the
potential to expand diplomatic and economic cooperation, the two
countries could also share and exchange knowledge and experiences
in various areas, particularly in the public health.
</P>
<P>
Korn also proposed that Iranian energy firms and investors
forge closer ties and expand cooperation with their Thai
counterparts, and jointly set up a regional market depot in
Thailand to be a center for bilateral trade and investment, as
Bangkok is a key economic and communication hub of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian envoy then said that the Thai proposals were in
line with the mandate of the Iranian Embassy to Thailand in
promoting diplomatic and economic relations between the two Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Eslami also stated that a recent agreement between the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) and an Iranian energy
development project on a joint venture was a good start of the
planned expansion of bilateral investment to other fields in the
future.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Lebanon Ascertain Israel Stealing Water From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) and Lebanese army teams verifying border encroachments
have confirmed that Israel was stealing water from Lebanon's
Wazzan River near the Israeli-Lebanese border, An Nahar newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a major transgression, water is being pumped through two
four-inch pipelines into northern Israel from a station set up in
the foothills of Mount Hermon, which is still under Israeli
control, the teams claimed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Amin Hotait, who heads the Lebanese army
verification team, has demanded the cessation of this kind of
invasion and called for international pressure to stop it.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL deputy commander Lieutenant General James Sreenan and
Hotait have agreed to resume ground verification checks on Friday
in the river region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military announced in Jerusalem Thursday that the
government had lodged 49 complaints over stone-throwing attacks
from the Lebanese side of the border on Israeli troops and farmers
last week.
</P>
<P>
It also claimed that the Lebanese authorities were doing nothing
to stop such attacks that had been mounted in the presence of
Hezbollah guerrillas, who have taken effective control of south
Lebanon after the May 24 Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah's second-in-command Sheikh Naim Kassem
announced Thursday in southern Beirut that the guerrilla group will
not lay down arms because "Zionist threat still exists." He also
rejected any conditioned aid to south Lebanon, saying "any
assistance with strings attached is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Israel said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Thursday night that there was on justification for the presence of
armed Hezbollah guerrillas in the south after the Israeli
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Identify Govt Servants Involved in Al-Ma'unah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Heads of government
departments in Malaysia have been ordered to conduct
investigations to identify their staff involved in the Al-Ma'unah
deviant group, Chief Secretary to the government Abdul Halim Ali
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Investigations must be carried out because some of them (civil
servants) are involved in a subtle way. The investigations will
take time but what's important is that action will be taken
against such supporters (of Al-Ma'unah) who have clearly shown
that they are ready to resort to violence which can affect the
peace and stability in the country," Bernama news agency quoted
him as telling reporters in Lumut, some 290 kilometers northwest
from here.
</P>
<P>
The government is also monitoring the involvement of civil
servants in other deviationist movements because "there are groups
whose actions run counter to the law," he said, adding police have
also been directed to prove the activities of such groups.
</P>
<P>
The official said that so far police have yet to submit any
report on the involvement of government servants in the Al-Ma'unah
group or in the arms heist carried out by the group in Gerik in
the northern state of Perak on July 2.
</P>
<P>
He said that of late there have been attempts by certain
quarters to influence government servants including armed forces
personnel into opposing the government.
</P>
<P>
Activities aimed at tarnishing the government's image or
eroding the people's confidence in the government can be regarded
as "high treason and a violation of the principle of loyalty" that
must be upheld by all members of the public service including
servicemen, he said.

<HEADLINE> Freed Malaysian Hostages Turned Over to Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government chief
negotiator Robert Aventajado on Friday expressed optimism that
three remaining Malaysian hostages will soon be released by their
Abu Sayyaf captors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after turning over four Malaysians who have been freed
by the Abu Sayyaf to Malaysian Ambassador Mohammad Arshad at a
brief ceremony here Friday afternoon, Aventajado said the
government has already obtained commitment from the rebel group's
leader to free the rest of the Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
The four freed Malaysians looked haggard when presented to the
media. After being released early Friday morning, they were flown
in from the southern Philippine island province of Sulu aboard a
12-seater private plane.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, however, stressed that no ransom had been paid to
secure the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Arshad said the Abu Sayyaf agreed to release the Malaysian
hostages in exchange for the undertaking of livelihood projects in
Muslim communities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian envoy also expressed gratitude to Philippine
President Joseph Estrada and Aventajado for their efforts in
securing the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"It's not yet time to celebrate for there are still hostages
left,"the envoy added. "(The government negotiators) cannot still
rest on their laurels."
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Abu Sayyaf leader Commander Robot and he promised
me that he will release the three other Malaysian hostages soon,"
Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
When asked by reporters why most of the hostages being released
are Malaysians, Aventjado said: "We cannot dictate on the Abu
Sayyaf regarding the release of the hostages."
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said the four are scheduled to be flown back to
Kuala Lumpur Saturday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Gray Ends his Career after Failing in the US Olympic Trails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- American 800-meter record
holder Johnny Gray decided to retire after failing to qualify for
the event's semifinals Thursday at the US Olympic trials in
Sacramento, California in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Gray, trying to join the American squad for a
historic fifth Olympic berth, lost his heat, posting a time of one
minute 53.21 seconds, 10 seconds slower than his record of 1:42.60.
After leading for 500 meters, the ailing Gray faded so badly that
he finished last in his first-round heat.
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive time he ran over 1:50 since
straining a calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
Gray, an Olympian in 1984, '88, '92 and '96, attempted to tie
Carl Lewis for most appearances by a male on U.S.track and field
teams. If Gray had made it, he would have been the first to
compete in five games. Lewis missed the 1980 Olympics because of
the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games.
</P>
<P>
Gray's only medal was bronze in the 1992 games. He has also
won seven national championships and two Pan American Games gold
medals, the first in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Accept Sharing Sovereignty Over East Jerusalem: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
had agreed to share sovereignty with the Palestinians over East
Jerusalem, which may clear the way for reaching a comprehensive
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, a senior Israeli official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Michael Melchior, minister without portfolio and one of
the Israeli negotiators at Camp David, confirmed through telephone
interview by Israel Radio that Israel will accept such a bridging
proposal made by the United States pertaining the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, Israel would annex several Jewish
settlements near Jerusalem, including the largest one in the West
Bank Ma'aleh Adumim, into a bigger Jerusalem municipality.
</P>
<P>
In return, Palestinian National Authority could share
sovereignty in Arab East Jerusalem, while Israel will maintain
security control over the areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel will also agree to grant some safe passage for providing
Arab pilgrims access to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holiest Muslim site
in the stone-walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the status quo in the Old City, which is swarmed with
famous religious sites of the three world religions, Christian,
Muslim, or Jewish, will be maintained for several years, during
which a final solution could be found.
</P>
<P>
The model is something like granting administration-plus
sovereignty of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians, the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
Melchior stressed that the proposal is definitely within the red
lines of Barak, who said that Jerusalem will remain united and
under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
There was no report that the Palestinians had accepted the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit, attended by Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, began on July 11 and
tried to resolve all the core issues between the two sides,
including the thorny Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
It appears recently that the issue had been the major stumbling
block in the peace talks, due to both sides' uncompromising stands
on the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided capital,"
while the Palestinians want to see at least the eastern part of the
city, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war, as the
capital of their future state.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud
Abu Zeid said about 66 percent of the North Sinai Development
Project to cultivate 400,000 feddans (168,000 hectares) of land
were implemented to create new communities and attract more
inhabitants from the densely-populated Delta.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank has agreed to offer necessary financing and
training for technology projects in Egypt and the establishment of
many training centers, said a senior bank official. The bank will
also conduct a two-month analytical study on the effects of Egypt's
partnership with Europe and the ability of various economic sectors
to withstand market liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Cairo Airport customs officials seized rare national
documents that date back to 1880 when they suspected a consignment
exported to Germany. The consignment was said to consist of 11
parcels containing shishas(water pipes). A National Library
official said the seized material were national documents and
manuscripts whose value was estimated at 4.232 million Egyptian
pounds (1.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Seventeen people were killed after a six-story clothes
factory was gutted by fire and then collapsed in the Mediterranean

brigade Major-General Mohamed Raga'i and his deputy.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Accept Sharing Sovereignty in East Jerusalem: Minister EDS: Updates with Palestinian Proposals </HEADLINE>

while the Palestinians want to see at least the eastern part of the
city, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war, as the
capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
So far, there was no report that Palestinians had accepted the
proposal. However, some Palestinian officials had said before that
the
bridging proposal is too close to Israel's stands. They also
claimed that without full sovereignty in East Jerusalem, there
would be no deal.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian officials also suggested a solution to the
Jerusalem issue in sovereignty sharing model, according to a report
published by Israel's Jerusalem Post daily Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan submitted by Bassam Abu Sharif, an adviser to
Arafat, the Palestinians will be offered some functional
sovereignty in East Jerusalem, especially the old city and its
Muslim and Christian religious sites, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
That functional sovereignty, Sharif said, will include
religious, political, and civilian-matter sovereignty, while the
Israelis could keep the security responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Sharif argued that the proposal will let both sides have limited
sovereignty in East Jerusalem without dividing the city and the
Palestinians could claim East Jerusalem as the capital of its
future state.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders, thus, could return to their constituents with a
claim that they had not compromised on this sensitive issue, Sharif
said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Conclude Billion-dollar Attack Helicopter Tender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is expected to finalize its
long-awaited multi-billion-U.S.-dollar attack helicopter tender on
Friday and choose between its strategic ally the United States and
regional rival Russia, which has made a joint offer with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Industry Executive Committee, chaired by Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, will convene to conclude the tender
of the co-production of 145 attack helicopters later Friday, the
country's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The winning company will be selected by taking into
consideration such matters as local and joint production,
technology transfer and financing.
</P>
<P>
After eliminating France's Eurocopter and U.S. Boeing company,
the remaining three bidders, the Russian-Israeli Kamov/IAI, the
Italian Agusta and the U.S. Bell Helicopter-Textron are competing
to win the tender.
</P>
<P>
Because of difficulties in making a decision, the tender has
already been delayed four times.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that some powerful factors had prompted the
Turkish government to postpone the bid, such as political
considerations, as well as public and budgetary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has come under heavy pressure from the bidding companies
and their countries, which have been lobbying intensively for
winning the lucrative defense project.
</P>
<P>
While the Clinton administration and the U.S. lawmakers tried to
woo Ankara by praising the country in human rights and supporting
its efforts to join the European Union, senior officials from
Russia and Israel have gone to the Prime Ministry on several
occasions in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was gearing up for the bid. This week, 38 American
senators wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, saying
that they were giving their full support for strong defense
cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that the U.S. Bell company holds an
important advantage in the tender.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that apart from Washington's political weight,
Turkey's experience of arms purchases from the U.S., working with
Bell in particular, will make the company a front-runner among the
bidders.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Italian relations have still not reached the desired
levels since Rome refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan, chieftain
of the outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who hid
himself in Italy, to Turkey in 1998, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that if Ankara gives the tender to the Russian
company, it will arouse criticism from within NATO, a U.S.-led
western military alliance of which Turkey is a member.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, did not rule out the possibility of delaying
the tender once again on Friday because of budgetary pressures
stemming from the stand-by deal signed between Turkey and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year loan package approved by the IMF, Turkey
pledged to reduce its chronic inflation and budget deficits,
undertake a comprehensive privatization program and reform
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Seeks Int'l Help to Tackle Dengue Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
sought international help for diagnosis and treatment of dengue
fever which was said to have assumed an alarming proportion, the
Bangla-language daily Ittefaq reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting laboratory sources, the daily said at least 10 people
were killed by the disease in the capital alone in two weeks, and
around 60 percent of 500 patients have been tested dengue positive.
</P>
<P>
The reagents essential to test dengue have been exhausted, the
sources told the newspaper. Prof. Nazrul Islam of Virology
Department and Prof. Ruhul Amin of Microbiology Department of
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University said they have run out
of reagents.
</P>
<P>
"The reagents we have in hand can last one more day at the most,
" they said.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim said steps have been
taken to bring reagents from abroad through the World Health
Organisation (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Reports from different hospitals and clinics throughout the
Dhaka city suggested that dengue fever is spreading at an alarming
rate.
</P>
<P>
A WHO report said Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions
are the areas where dengue fever has taken the most serious turn.
Before 1970, only nine countries had experienced DHF (Dengue
Hemorrhagic Fever) epidemics, but the number had increased
fourfold by 1995. Some 2.5 billion people worldwide are at risk of
catching dengue fever.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Launches Massive Skills Development Project for Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
initiated a massive skills development project with the aim to
address the issues of skill mismatch and unemployment among urban
and rural youth, the Ministry of Vocational Training and Rural
Industries said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"A competency based training system will be introduced by the
project to ensure trainees acquire the correct competence needed,"
said the ministry in a statement, adding nearly 70 percent of
training courses offered by vocational training institutions are
not up-to-date, resulting in a severe mismatch between the supply
of skills by these institutions and the needs in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the project worth some 38.5 million U.S.
dollars will extend for a period of six years from 2000 onwards
with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, Nordic
Development Fund and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
</P>
<P>
In June the foundation stone was laid for the National
Technical Education and Vocational Training Secretariat which is
part of the skills development project.
</P>
<P>
The project will provide employable skills training for 100,000
urban and rural youth from low income families through 200
vocational training centers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Welcomes Malaysian Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on Friday
welcomed the release of four Malaysian hostages held by the Abu
Sayyaf in Jolo, saying that it continues to work to secure the
freedom of the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora also made it clear in a
press statement that the government continues to stick to its no-
ransom policy, belying speculations that money changed hands
during the Malaysians' release.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado confirmed the
release of the hostages, saying that the four Malaysians were
released early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Abu Sayyaf also released two Malaysians and a
German. The freed seven hostages were among the total number of 21
hostages abducted by the extremist Abu Sayyaf on April 23 from
Malaysian resort of Sipadan and then moved to Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful in the next few days we may have a breakthrough.
But we don't want to do anything to (negatively) affect the course
of the negotiations," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government does not discount the possibility of
third parties negotiating with the Abu Sayyaf, but reiterated that
they do not have the government's approval.
</P>
<P>
"That's without our knowledge and certainly without our
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora pointed out that the governments of the European
hostages have promised to support the Philippine government's no-
ransom policy. "They said they will not do anything to violate the
no-ransom policy," he said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK to Become New Market for Thai Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) will soon become a new interesting market for Thai
trade and investment, as Pyongyang is opening up its door to the
international community, Thai Farmers' Bank Research Center said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok-based research center said in a report that the
international community had been increasingly interested in the
DPRK market following the success in the recent inter-Korea peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK could also become a new key market for Thai trade and
investment, as Thai Deputy Commerce Minister Gornpot Asavinvichit
is scheduled to visit the country in late July to explore ways to
expand bilateral trade and investment, it said.
</P>
<P>
This would be a good opportunity for Thailand to seek closer
business ties and cooperation with Pyongyang, whose economy is
expected to be strengthened following its recent decision to open
its door wider to the international community, it stated.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports having potential to penetrate the DPRK market
include sugar, frozen shrimps, television sets and parts,
computers and accessories, other electrical appliances, textile
products, and semi-processed products, according to the research
center.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK market, with 22 million consumers, has also become an
interesting place for Thai investors who are eyeing to relocate
their factories of consumers' products, farm and cattle products,
and processed food, as well as machines and tools used in the
agricultural sector to the country, which still lacks of
experiences and is lagged behind in the areas, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thai investors could also invest in the hotel business in
Pyongyang, given its prospect of attracting more foreign arrivals
in the future, it noted.

<HEADLINE> NGOs Call on G-8 for Debt Relief Initiative for Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from
Japanese and foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) Friday
urged the Group of Eight (G-8) countries to grant a full debt
waiver to poor countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The call was made when the representatives met with Japanese
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori before leaders of the G-8 nations kick
off their three-day annual summit in Nago, Okinawa Prefecture of
Japan, on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
They asked Mori to pick up at the summit issues ranging from
debt relief for poor countries to infectious diseases, Japanese
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 leaders should renew their commitment to implementing
the debt cut pact agreed at last year's summit in Cologne, Germany,
said a representative of Jubilee 2000, a worldwide group pushing
for debt cancellation for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Pecoul, a member of a medical relief NGO, called on the
G-8 nations to map out a comprehensive plan involving governments,
private sectors and the NGOs for tackling infectious diseases in
poor countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Mori told the NGO members that globalization, debt relief,
infectious diseases and the environment are important issues to be
discussed at the G-8 summit, promising that he would reflect
opinions presented by the NGOs at the upcoming summit discussion.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United States and Russia.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Nigeria Vow to Strengthen Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean and visiting Nigerian
presidents Friday agreed to further promote economic exchanges and
cooperation in various areas between the two nations, a South
Korean presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting here, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and
his Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo agreed to expand
bilateral trade and investment, according to the spokesman, Park
Joon-young.
</P>
<P>
Kim briefed the Nigerian president on the outcome of the inter-
Korean summit in Pyongyang last month and praised Nigeria's
support for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo expressed full support for Kim's engagement policy
towards Pyongyang and congratulated him on the successful inter-
Korean summit.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, the first Nigerian president to visit Seoul since the
two countries established diplomatic ties in 1980, will meet with
South Korean business leaders in his three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 410 million
U.S. dollars in 1999. South Korea imports oil from Nigeria and
exports machinery, electronic goods and automobiles to the African
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the world's seventh-largest producer of petroleum
and the largest country in the Africa, with a population of 120
million.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Finance Minister Vows to Keep Banking Secrecy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Finance Minister Kaspar
Villiger has stressed that Switzerland's banking secrecy laws are
not up for discussion.
</P>
<P>
His comments came during a meeting in Zurich Thursday with his
Austrian counterpart Karl-Heinz Grasser. The two men were in the
Swiss city to sign a protocol on double taxation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They discussed banking secrecy laws, which exist in both
countries, and said the protocol represented a "coalition to
maintain banking secrecy for the benefit of the investor."
</P>
<P>
Villiger repeated there was no question of Switzerland
relinquishing its banking secrecy, although he said Switzerland
understood that the European Union (EU) wanted to clarify the tax
on interest earned.
</P>
<P>
Grasser said that keeping banking secrecy did not represent a
problem for his country, as Austria itself has both a system of
tax at source and banking secrecy.
</P>
<P>
In June, the EU countries concluded a draft to deal on the
taxation of cross-border savings. Under the proposals, the EU
members would be able to exchange information on non-resident
account holders to reduce tax evasion and help combat fraud and
organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
The deal is dependent on the EU persuading third countries,
such as Switzerland, which is not an EU member, to adopt similar
measures.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been seen as a potential threat to
Switzerland's banking secrecy, because close economic ties between
Berne and Brussels are thought to give the EU considerable
leverage.

BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC), China's largest commercial bank, has seen a major
improvement in its business operations in the first half of this
year, with profits increasing 4.5 billion yuan (about 542 million

A spokesman for the ICBC said by the end of June, the
outstanding amount of all deposits in the ICBC had exceeded 3
trillion yuan, while that of loans reached 2.47 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first six months, the bank had largely
improved the structure of its loans, with a larger share of its
newly-increased loans put into the State's key construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ICBC's investment in less-developed western
parts of the country doubled from the same period last year,
giving firm support to the State's western expansion strategy.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of housing and other consumption loans also rose
by a big margin, of which individual housing loans increased 21.7
billion yuan, 13 billion yuan more than the same period last year.

</P>
<P>
The index tracks the developments of A-shares listed on the

</P>
<P>
Today's total trading volume in the Shanghai bourse was 11.2

</P>

Mutual funds released their investment portfolios today,
showing that they had lowered their positions, compared to the
last quarter. But their weights were still focused on telecom
companies, with the proportion of transportation and petroleum
shares increasing greatly.
</P>
<P>
The move did not influence the market, according to Homeway.
The Shanghai Composite Index still lingered at the high level, and
some Special Treatment shares and the shares held by big players
performed actively.

<HEADLINE> China's T-Bond Market Bearish Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's treasury bond trade was
slack Friday with the turnover contracting sharply to 969 million
yuan, 6.76 million yuan less than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to information from Homeway, a leading online
financial news provider, all bonds stayed inactive, up or down no
more than 0.02 percent around current price levels, except for
009905, a 3.28 percent bond due 2007, which tumbled 0.10 percent
at 102.00 yuan with the biggest trading value of 481 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The domestic stock market closed up again following Thursday's
correction, which has partly led to the bearish outlook of the T-
bond market.
</P>
<P>
China's bond repurchase market performed well, helped by the
money demand on new stock subscriptions. The turnover on three-day,
seven-day, 14-day and 28-day repo transactions rose slightly by
116 million yuan to 7.47 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Pension and Subsidy Payments Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Retirees and laid-off workers
could get all their pension benefits and subsidies in arrears
before the end of August, according to a government regulation
issued recently.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Ministry of
Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued the
regulation, which also stipulated that all delayed social benefits
for the laid-off workers must be paid.
</P>
<P>
It urged all departments and localities to make sure that the
pensions and subsidies will be fully paid to the retirees and laid-
off workers.
</P>
<P>
The regulation requires all localities to help strengthen the
collection of social insurance, especially in foreign-funded
enterprises, private enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that eastern regions and central cities must
deliver pension payments before the end of September through
social security bodies via post offices or banks, instead of
through their former work units.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for other regions to complete the transition is
the end of this year, according to the ministries.

<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city Shanghai today launched a ban on drug abuse,
gambling and prostitution in entertainment arcades.
</P>
<P>
The city's law-enforcement body will focus on these illegal
activities in video arcades, karaoke bars, sauna and massage
parlors, as well as beauty salons, tea houses, bars and hotels,
according to a notice released by the municipal police and the
other two governmental organs overseeing the cultural market in
today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The city relevant authorities will not authorize new
entertainment businesses, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Electronic game arcades and web bars cannot be located less
than 200 meters from primary or middle schools, and cannot admit
adolescents except during holiday periods, the Shanghai-based
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China has held a three-month comprehensive check on
entertainment business throughout the country, which was jointly
organized by the ministries of Culture and Public Security.

<HEADLINE> China's Monogamy System Under Challenge: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's monogamous society is
being threatened by increasing reports of bigamy, concubinage,
illegal cohabitation, and extra-marital affairs, China's legal
experts and experts on women's issues have warned.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the mistress phenomenon has been on the rise in
recent years, said Hu Kangsheng, deputy director of the
Legislative Affairs Commission under the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He cited statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Women's
Federation showing complaints it handled from angry wives amounted
to 219, 235 and 348 yearly from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Illicit concubinage is posing a serious threat to China's
statutory rule of monogamy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Bao Er Nai," which literally means "keeping a second wife" in
Cantonese, refers to providing financial and material support to
mistresses. Some mistresses are kept under pretense of being maids
or secretaries.
</P>
<P>
People from various social strata have engaged in the practice,
ranging from overseas businessmen, heads of enterprises, corporate
managers, and even some Party and government officials, according
to officials from south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The alarming trend has led to the deterioration of families and
even murder, posing a threat to social stability, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
"It also disrupted the implementation of the state's family
planning policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bigamy is prohibited by law in China. But, Hu pointed out,
since bigamists don't tend to broadcast their activities, it's not
easy to gather evidence necessary to convict them.
</P>
<P>
Some legal experts have suggested that stipulations be added to
the Marriage Law that would protect spousal rights. Others think
the Marriage Law should state that fidelity and cohabitation
between spouses should be mandatory.
</P>
<P>
Whether marital loyalty should be put under legal control or
moral surveillance remains a controversial topic in China.

the doors of the EU will be opened to Greek Cypriot part of the
island as a member.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to remain at
Camp David for close to another week, but is still pessimistic that
a deal will be reached by the end of the summit, Israeli officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has not finished and we are still in the midst of
it," said one senior official at Camp David. "We will not carry on
any negotiations with the Palestinians until we receive some clear
answers from them on several matters on the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic twist of events Thursday morning, minutes after
the U.S. said it had failed to broker an agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians during nine days of negotiations, U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the sides had agreed to
remain at Camp David and continue negotiating.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Thursday took
command at Camp David following U.S. President Bill Clinton's
departure for the G-8 summit in Okinawa, Japan. Albright began by
meeting with the American team in order to work out her plan of
action for the weekend, until the president's return early next
week.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to talk separately with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat later in the day,
but no separate meetings were planned, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said that the time until Clinton returns, next
Monday or Tuesday, will be devoted primarily to dealing with "non-
core" issues such as water and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) does not necessarily expect
widespread, violent conflicts with the Palestinians to break out
immediately if the Camp David summit fails, a senior defense
official told Ha'aretz Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is very possible that the Palestinians will instead try to
maintain relatively quiet in the territories until mid-September,
when they plan to declare statehood, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the last two violent clashes between the
IDF and the Palestinians, the Nakba (Catastrophe) Day riots of May
1998 and last May, ended with a large number of Palestinian
casualties, and without the Palestinian National Authority being
able to show that anything had been gained from the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Former Israeli President Ezer Weizman met with Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein in Jordan Thursday and both men expressed
optimism about the peace talks being held at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The king hosted a luncheon to mark the end of Weizman's
presidency and emphasized that Weizman would always be a welcome
guest in the kingdom. Abdullah complimented Weizman, noting that he
is considered as a man of peace in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The king added that he wants to strengthen his country's ties
with Israel and improve the economic and industrial ties between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Warns Against Scheme to Overthrow Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Amid rising struggle among
political groups in the country, Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Friday that certain people are trying to unseat
him from the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
"There are some obstinate people who want to unseat the
President. Please go ahead. But the president could only be ousted
if he commits treason," Wahid was quoted by Antara news agency as
saying without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plot to overthrow him is conducted by those
who have political ambitions and asked the people to stay calm and
not to be influenced by their activities.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's statement came amid a showdown between him and the
parliament following his decision to ignore the motion for
interpellation on Thursday over his decision to sack two cabinet
ministers in April which triggered anger and disappointment among
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Wahid refused to answer the motion, saying the
country's constitution does not provide for such a motion.
</P>
<P>
But some MPs, mostly from major parties in the House, have
strongly urged the president to give a clear answer soon to the
parliament over his decision to dismiss the two ministers, namely
Minister of Investment Laksamana Sukardi of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle and Minister of Trade and Industry
Jusuf Kalla of the Golkar Party, who were accused of having
committed corruption practices.
</P>
<P>
But, the former ministers denied Wahid's accusation and
challenged the President to provide clear and strong evidences.
</P>
<P>
The House, after failing to get straight answer from Wahid over
the motion, has set the deadline for the President to give a
written comprehensive response by July 21 (Friday), but until
Friday afternoon the answer is still not available at the
parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean exports to the United
States in the first half of this year hit 14.97 billion U.S.
dollars, up 33.3 percent over the same period last year, the Korea
Trade-Investment Promotion Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea ranked first among the top 10 countries exporting
to the United States in the growth rate of exports, followed by
Mexico with 27.3 percent, China 21.8 percent, France 19.5 percent
and Canada 19 percent, the Agency cited the latest statistics
released by the U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korean products' market share in the United
States edged up 0.1 percentage point to 3.1 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the rise of country's market share to
good export performances of automobiles, computers, computer parts,
video cassette recorders (VCRs) and other appliances.
</P>
<P>
In addition, South Korean imports from the U.S. reached 11.3
billion dollars in the first five months of this year, up 28.5
percent from the same period a year earlier.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- World bronze medalist Chris
Huffins held the first-day decathlon lead on Thursday at the U.S.
Olympic trials in Sacramento, California in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He managed to do this despite cramping in the 400 meters, the
final race of the first day in decathlon competition.
</P>
<P>
Huffins had 4,563 points. The 1999 collegiate champion Tom
Pappas, who has made rapid improvements recently, had 4,451 points
heading into Friday's final five events. Both are likely to score
more than 8,500 points in the 10-event competition.
</P>
<P>
Some decathlon experts believe that Pappas will surpass Huffins
on Friday because three of Pappas' best events are on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Defending Olympic champion Dan O'Brien, as expected, did not
start the competition because of a foot injury.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Maltese Ties to Be Advanced: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that China will work together with Malta to further
advance their traditional friendship and deepen bilateral
cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Meeting this morning with visiting Foreign Minister Joseph Borg
of Malta in Zhongnanhai, the central government compound, Zhu
spoke highly of the development of the Sino-Maltese relations and
the Maltese government's pursuit of the One-China principle.
</P>
<P>
China and Malta, always sympathizing with and supporting each
other in world affairs, have cooperated closely in this regard,
and the Chinese government is active in developing the friendly
relationship with Malta, said the Premier.
</P>
<P>
Borg, who is here at the invitation of Chinese foreign minister
Tang Jiaxuan, said he held productive talks with Tang Thursday.
Since the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between the two
countries, bilateral cooperation has been advancing continuously,
Borg said, citing the sound political relations between the two
countries and their mutual understanding and support in the world
arena as well.
</P>
<P>
Malta will continue to uphold the One-China principle and
support China's accession to the World Trade Organization, the
foreign minister promised.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Fengyun 2 meteorological
satellite, launched by China last month, sent back its first
infrared and water vapor nephograms, or cloud pictures, yesterday,
according to today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, projected into orbit on June 25, started
operation early this month and has sent back visible light cloud
pictures to the State Satellite Meteorological Center.
</P>
<P>
The three detection wave bands of visible light, infrared ray
and water vapor enable the satellite to conduct around-the-clock
monitoring of China's climate, marine temperatures, atmosphere,
snow cover, fires, sand and dust storms and the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Lishan, a researcher with the Shanghai Institute of
Technical Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the
infrared ray and water vapor detection can be used at night and in
cloudy and rainy conditions.

<HEADLINE> Sex Education Lags Behind in Chinese Schools (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Material covered in sex education
classes in Chinese high schools lags far behind the actual sexual
awareness of young people, according to today's overseas edition
of the official People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited statistics from the Beijing Maternity Hospital,
saying that half of the women seeking abortions there were
unmarried and 14 percent were under age 20. The information was
collected by Dr. Suo You with the Beijing Institute for the
Protection of Mother's and Children's Health.
</P>
<P>
The data revealed that many teenagers wanting abortions are far
advanced in their pregnancies before they turn up at the hospital.
Dr. Suo said that the young people who are sexually active are
most often not well-informed about contraception.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pregnant teens mistook fetal movement for
intestinal problems, Dr. Suo found.
</P>
<P>
In a national survey conducted by the Shanghai Academy of
Social Sciences, 3,000 teenagers in major Chinese cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan were asked pointed
questions about sex.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, eight out of ten teenagers said they didn't know
much about it. China has no official curriculum for sex education,
and though health textbooks contain chapters on the reproductive
system, embarrassed teachers simply ignore the subject, the survey
showed.

<P>
Education expert Min Lefu said that society, families and
schools all bear the responsibility of telling kids the truth
about sex.
</P>
<P>
A typical answer by Chinese parents to the where-did-I-come-
from question is "We found you on the road." Some parents worry
why their children are asking questions about sex to begin with,
thinking they must be under a bad influence.
</P>
<P>
Young people's general ignorance of the facts of life has
aroused concern in China. Recently the Beijing Museum of Natural
History held an exhibition on adolescence and puberty, and high
schools and primary schools in the capital took student groups to
the show. Museum records show the facility received up to 7,000
visitors daily.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the museum said that provinces of Shandong, Hebei,
Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Yunnan and Harbin have invited the
exhibition to tour.
</P>
<P>
"If we still refuse to explain the scientific facts of sex,
kids will easily be misled by some unreliable sources in the media,
" the paper quoted a woman who took her child to the exhibition as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The national survey found that other than textbooks with
inadequate information on sex, youngsters get their answers from
movies and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A father who declined to give his name said, "We might save a
lot of energy if we could talk about sex as a natural part of our
bodies, like our eyes and our hearts."

Sichuan Province, a senior heritage official said any construction
which endangers cultural relics must be banned.
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers must obtain approval from the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) within a designated 12-
square-kilometer area near Sanxingdui, an important relics site in
Guanghan County, SACH Deputy Director Zhang Bai said.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists theorize that Sanxingdui might be the ruins of
the largest oriental city in the world, dating back from 2,875 to
4,070 years. Many treasured relics of the ancient Shu Kingdom are
contained in the ruins.

being seriously damaged to pave the way for urban construction and
infrastructure building.
</P>
<P>
Among the cities are Anyang in central China's Henan province,
where the capital of the Shang Dynasty was located and the
earliest Chinese characters on animal bones were discovered. The

</P>
<P>
The three performances in this southern Chinese city will
include two symphony concerts and a special performance to
popularize music knowledge among youngsters.

<P>
-- Stamp-collecting Popular in China
</P>
<P>
Stamp-collecting is gaining popularity in China, with the
number of collectors reaching 18 million.
</P>
<P>
The widely practiced hobby has "not only promoted the expansion
of China's postal service but also contributed to socialist,
cultural and ethical progress of the country", a senior official
of the All-China Philatelic Federation (ACPF) said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day national congress of the federation
starting from July 18, Luo Shuzhen, president of ACPF, said that
the congress plans to further advance the stamp-collecting.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Intends to Host World Disarmament Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
holding discussions with the United Nations Asia Pacific Center
for Disarmament on the possibility of New Zealand hosting an
international disarmament conference early next year.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Friday by New Zealand Minister for
Disarmament and Arms Control Matt Robson in his speech at the
opening ceremony of a new nuclear monitoring station.
</P>
<P>
The new station is located at Kaitaia on the northernmost part
of the country's North Island. It is the third nuclear monitoring
station operated by New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, which was released here by the New Zealand
government, Minister Robson said his country has fought hard to
support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and it can
continue to "lead the world in nuclear disarmament."
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand has a moral authority when it comes to world
nuclear disarmament. We went nuclear free in the 1980s," he said.
</P>
<P>
If New Zealand can host the conference, Robson said, it will
use the conference as an opportunity to promote a nuclear weapon
free Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
"We already have nuclear free zones in the South Pacific, South
East Asia, Latin America and Africa. It's a case of joining forces
and sending a strong message to the Northern Hemisphere," he said.

WELLINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 6 million travelers
crossed New Zealand borders during the year from July 1999 to June
2000, a new milestone in international passenger movements.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand with a population of just over 3.8 million saw 3.
003 million arrivals and 3 million departures in the 12 months,
according to Statistics New Zealand's Friday's media release.
</P>
<P>
Overseas residents accounted for three-fifths of these
movements while the remaining two-fifths were New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
In the last 15 years arrivals and departures have increased by
four million, reflecting rapid growth in international tourism.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, there were just 102,000 arrivals and departures
in 1951. It took 23 years to reach the first million mark in 1974
and another 11 years to reach two million. Since 1985 the average
annual growth rate has been 7.5 percent, or about one million
every three to four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the Group of
Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations began talks in Nago,
Okinawa, Friday afternoon to discuss global economic and financial
issues.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders' meeting was held a few hours before the Group
of Eight (G8) leaders gather at a working dinner Friday evening,
officially kicking off the three-day G-8 Okinawa summit.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan and the United States. The G-8 is the G-7 plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders are expected to release a chairman's statement
at the end of their summit later Friday to call on Japan to carry
on with its appropriate macroeconomic policies and continue to
stimulate domestic demand through fiscal and financial policies.
</P>
<P>
The statement will also confirm the G-7's stern attitude toward
international financial crimes, including money laundering, and a
quickening of measures to help heavily indebted poor countries (
HIPCs).
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders will send a message to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), expressing their desire that a new round of
multilateral trade negotiations be started within this year.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to unveil a decision not to approve a
reduction of Russia's external debts, but suggest a discussion of
a rescheduling of debt repayments at a meeting of the Paris Club
in autumn.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 chairman's statement, to be delivered by Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori, is said to be equivalent to the economic
declarations of past summits.

<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China will focus on developing
both traditional Chinese medicine and bio-engineered medicine in
the coming five years, hoping to become one of the world's
pharmaceutical giants.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) said that

pharmaceutical industry, the nation has clear advantages in some
aspects, and medicine manufacturing is one of its most promising
industries, the People's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Chinese academic institutes and 140 manufacturers are
researching and developing bio-medicine. More than 20 kinds of
high-tech drugs have been churned out with three billion yuan (361
million U.S. dollars) worth of annual output, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the SETC, the nationwide
pharmaceutical industry in 1999 saw profits of 11.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four enterprises gained returns of over 100 million yuan
each. Tianjin Pharmaceutical Group, 999 Enterprise Group and
Tianjin Smith-Kline Beecham (SB) Pharmaceutical Corporation were
ranked as the top three.

<P>
Meanwhile, the 1999 sales revenue in the pharmaceutical trade
reached 252.5 billion yuan, with 22 largest traders selling goods
valued at more than one billion yuan, the newspaper said.
</P>

Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group, 999 Enterprise Group and China
National Pharmaceutical Corporation were the top three in terms of
sales revenue.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Summit Journalists Complain About High Hotel Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Journalists from all over
the world to cover the Okinawa Summit of the Group of Eight (G-8)
major countries to be held here in the city of Nago complained a
lot about high costs for hotel accommodation.
</P>
<P>
At a hotel reception desk, journalists found that a double
room costs about 260 U.S. dollars, and the price for a three-bed
room is charged around 310 dollars. Because of the shortage of
nearby hotel rooms, many journalists are forced to pack themselves
into the three-bed or, even worse, five-bed rooms.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the high costs of hotel accommodation, some
journalists find it extremely difficult to book hotel rooms close
to the summit site at affordable prices. They cannot but check in
hotels which are located so far away that it will take them at
least one hour by shuttle bus to reach the International Media
Center (IMC), the working site where journalists cover the G-8
summit.
</P>
<P>
They said that the host country should try to provide the
working press with acceptable logistics, for it was Japan's
decision to locate the bulk of the meetings in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
An official working for the G-8 accommodation reservation
center explained that the summit takes place at a time when
seasonal demand for lodging by vacationers peaks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Okinawa Governor Keiich Inamine said that hosting the
G-8 summit here was a meaningful event in this prefecture. "The
summit will attract the attention of the whole world, and the
coverage of the summit by the world press will, as a side product,
help promote Okinawa as a traditional culture and tourism
attraction to the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 consists of the United States, France, Italy, Japan,
Germany, Britain, Canada and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The IMC, which is open round the clock, is located some eight
kilometers northwest of the Bankoku Shinryokan, the site for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The journalists, though shrugging at the hotel room costs, are
generally satisfied with the 22,100-square-meter IMC, which has a
working area fully equipped with IDD telephones, Internet
accessing computers, fax machines, and snack food stands.
</P>
<P>
It has a seating capacity of 500 people in the working area,
while the main press conference hall, a capacity of 750 people.
About 1,000 foreign and 3,000 domestic journalists are here to
cover the summit.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Foils Rebel Attempt to Blow Up Oil Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- An attempt by the Tamil Tiger
rebels to blow up oil tanks of the Sri Lanka Petroleum Corporation
in Colombo has been foiled, the official Daily News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A special police team conducting investigations into rebel
activities on Thursday arrested a suspected suicide bomber of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who had allegedly come to
blow up the oil tanks, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior investigator the suicide bomber
Maheswaran, who had come to Colombo from Mannar in northern Sri
Lanka on July 14, had in his possession a forged National Identity
Card under the name of Thambimuttu Makillaran. The investigators
had also found three cyanide capsules concealed in his travelling
bag.
</P>
<P>
The bomber reportedly told the investigators that he had come
to Colombo to plant the bomb at the oil refinery at Mutwal in
Colombo and in case he was arrested he was to use the cyanide
capsules.
</P>
<P>
The senior investigator added that they were able to arrest the
suicide bomber on information received from the public.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, the LTTE rebels had made an attempt to blow up
the oil installation at Kolonnawa in suburban Colombo. On that
occasion the attack had been made by a group of five LTTE rebels
who had been able to infiltrate the premises and place a bomb on
one oil storage tank which burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
The fire was soon brought under control and the rebels were
killed in an exchange of fire with the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting for a separate state called Eelam
for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983. Over
the years they have been accused of staging dozens of bomb attacks
against political figures, government troops and economic targets.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has appointed a nine-member salaries commission to
recommend a suitable salary structure and policy for the Public
Service and Statutory Boards, the Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Director of Government Information Ariya
Rubasinghe as saying that the commission would be headed by
retired senior administrative officer Tissa Devendra.
</P>
<P>
The terms of reference of the commission includes making some
structural changes for an effective functioning of organizations,
taking into consideration the current salary scale in other
countries which have similar standards of living and economies to
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The commission will examine the need to restructure the public
service to obtain maximum efficiency and productivity and the need
to scrutinize whether there are adequate funds in the medium term
to implement the recommendations of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Consideration has also been given to have a wage structure in
the state sector which is parallel to the private sector, the
reduction in the number of scales and to effect less complicated
salary structures.
</P>
<P>
The terms of reference also include the recommendation of a
possible revision of public and government holidays and employee
benefits, the implementation of a more effective incentive scheme
and the implementation of other welfare benefits such as insurance
and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the creation of the commission is in
response to public grievances over rising cost of living resulted
from the recent depreciation of the country's currency rupee and
price hikes in electricity, gas, diesel and telephone calls.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns U.S. Senate Against Anti-China Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned the U.S. Senate Thursday against approving
an anti-China bill that would sanction China for so-called weapons
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, said
the bill sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson and Robert Torricelli
could "harm us more than it would harm others."
</P>
<P>
The senate bill, formally known as China Nonproliferation Act,
stipulates that the U.S. should punish China's arms sales to
America's enemies or war-prone regions by barring its fund-raising
activities in U.S. markets, and restricting U.S. Export-Import
Bank financing and credit guarantees for China-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
It calls for annual assessment of China's nonproliferation and
authorizes the U.S. president to carry out the sanctions once
relevant accords are found breached.
</P>
<P>
The United States is by far the largest arms seller in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The White House is strongly opposed to the bill, regarding it
as some senators' attempt to set up a new hurdle against an early
passage of the legislation on Permanent Normal Trade Relations (
PNTR) with China. The PNTR bill, which passed the House of
Representatives in May, is now in the Senate for approval.
</P>
<P>
Despite a White House veto threat and strong opposition from
big business, Senator Majority leader Trent Lott is pressing for a
vote this week or next week on the sanctions bill, before voting
on the PNTR bill.

<HEADLINE> NMD, Mideast Peace Emerge as Key Issues at G-8 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A plan by the United States
to build a national missile defense (NMD) system and the Middle
East peace talks are emerging as key subjects of discussions at
the Group of Eight (G-8) summit which begins in Nago, Okinawa
later Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prepared agenda issues could lose attention at the summit
roundtable depending on how the eight leaders handle the dispute
over the NMD plan, G-8 officials said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton could face pressure from other
participants as in the case of a pre-summit meeting of the G-8
foreign ministers last week in Miyazaki, southwestern Japan, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and Germany sharply criticized the U.S. for the
proposed NMD shield, saying it could undermine the global
disarmament and nonproliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
The NMD is designed to provide a cover for all 50 U.S. states
from ballistic missile attacks. The international community fears
that the deployment of such a system would break the arms balance
between big powers, thus triggering a new round of arms race
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has gained support from
China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in his
opposition to the U.S. missile initiative, is expected to
reiterate Russia's stance against the U.S. plan during the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process will be another issue high on the
agenda when leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia and the United States open their three-day summit
with a working dinner Friday evening, Japanese government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 leaders will voice their support for Israeli and
Palestinian efforts to achieve a peace deal after Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed
to restart their crucial summit, which was declared a failure
earlier at Camp David, Maryland, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in Naha, capital of Japan's southernmost
prefecture on Friday morning, delayed his departure for Japan by
one day in an attempt to bridge the gaps between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders so that they could reach an agreement to end
their conflict of more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which was once worried that the emphasis Clinton had
placed on the Camp David talks could overshadow the Okinawa summit,
has decided to back Clinton's efforts by incorporating the Middle
East issue into the summit agenda, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Summit host Japan must do something" to assist the U.S.
efforts to mediate peace between the Israelis and Palestinians,
the officials said, adding that Tokyo is also considering taking
the initiative in adopting a summit resolution promising economic
and personnel assistance to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, France Fail to Agree on Return of Ancient Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean and French experts
Friday failed to reached an agreement on the return of the
Oekyujanggak documents of the medieval Choson Dynasty to South
Korea after their third round of talks in Songnam, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides agreed to hold a new round of expert
talks in Paris soon.
</P>
<P>
In 1866, French navy plundered some 300 pieces of documents of
the Oekyujanggak, the medieval Choson Dynasty's royal library in
Kanghwa Island, in retaliation for the killings of several French
priests in Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin agreed to settle the ancient documents issue as soon
as possible during Kim's visit to France last March.
</P>
<P>
At the past meetings, South Korea insisted that the documents
be returned while France said they are now French property and the
matter must be solved in a legal manner.
</P>
<P>
The French once proposed leasing the documents to South Korea
on a short- or long-term basis, but Seoul rejected the initiative.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jamaican Merlene Ottey
advanced to the semi-finals of the 100 meters event Thursday at
the opening of Jamaica's Olympic trials in Kingston, Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
The 40 year-old sprinter, hoping to join the Jamaican squad for
a historic sixth Olympic berth, won her heat, posting a time of 11:
09 seconds.
</P>
<P>
It was Monaco-based Ottey's first appearance in Jamaica and her
second race since being cleared July 10 by an International
Amateur Athletics Federation panel of drug use. Track and field's
world governing body reinstated her after a year's ban, concluding
that a Swiss laboratory had improperly tested her urine sample
when she came up positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in
Switzerland in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
She needs to finish in the top three of the event to qualify
for the individual event at the Sydney Olympic Games in September.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Jamaica Amateur Athletics Association, who
long ago cleared Ottey of the drug charges, have said that the
double silver medalist at the 1996 Games likely would be included
in their Olympic squad even if she fails to place among the top
three finishers or post the required time of 11.40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The semi-final and final heats will take place on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Insects Plague Forests in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The hot, dry weather this summer
has led to an outbreak of insect plague in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
About 176,700 hectares of forests are affected by insect pests,
with 40,000 hectares in a serious situation, according to the
latest survey by the provincial forest insect pest prevention
station.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Ge, an official in charge at the prevention station, said,
however, the plague is not as widespread as last year.
</P>
<P>
Yuan and his colleagues attributed the insect plague to this
year's continuous high temperature and drought. The heavy snow
last winter also helped most pests survive the cold winter, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Local government and forestry departments in Liaoning are
taking measures to fight the insect pests.
</P>
<P>
With a forest coverage rate of about 30 percent, Liaoning has
about 4.5 million hectares of forests.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Takes Measures to Provide Workers with Occupational  Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has been
making efforts to provide occupational welfare to workers in the
country, especially those employed in factories, mills and
enterprises run by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
To create good working conditions due to changes in the
economic pattern and the relations between workers and their
employer, the government has been systematically taking measures
to give them equitable rights on the one hand and to ensure the
productivity of the enterprises on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
To settle disputes amicably between the workers and the
employers, workers' supervision committees and workers'
compensation scrutinizing committees have been established in
various townships in the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, social security plan was implemented. According to the
country's 1954 Social Security Act which is still in effect,
factories, workshops and enterprises that have over five employees,
regardless of whether they be state-owned, private-owned, foreign-
owned or joint venture, shall have to provide the employees with
social security insurance which is proportionately contributed by
the employer, the employee and the government.
</P>
<P>
The social security plan helps family members of a worker
relieve from social hardships including those derived from illness,
maternity, injury and death.
</P>
<P>
According to the Myanmar Facts and Figures, a booklet currently
published by the Ministry of Information, since 1997, workers who
are under the social security plan have been provided free medical
treatment, cash benefit and occupational injury benefit.
</P>
<P>
The booklet also disclosed that to effectively and gradually
implement the social security plan, 68 township branch offices
have been set up throughout the country with one workers' hospital
each in Yangon and Mandalay, 88 dispensaries and 2 mobile medical
units also established.
</P>
<P>
The government's support of social benefits to workers is seen
as part of its efforts to develop the country's human resources.

<HEADLINE> Top Seeds Bow Out of Indonesia Badminton Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The top three seeds in the men's
singles were eliminated, all by Malaysian players, in the Sanyo
Indonesia Open here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Roslin Hashim opened the scalping with a come-from-behind 9-15,
15-3, 15-7 win over top seed and the current world number one
Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark for a place in Friday's quarter
finals.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I am disappointed with the result but I was very
tired after playing two hard matches yesterday (Wednesday). The
first game was OK as I managed to keep the game at a high speed
but in the second and third games I failed to maintain the speed.
I think Roslin played without pressure. If he loses, it's OK but
if he wins, it's a sensation. But I should have won the match,"
Gade said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Roslin said he had studied his Danish
opponent's performance.
</P>
<P>
"I was well prepared to meet him and I believe I can beat him
again as I did in the Japan Open quarter finals," he said.
</P>
<P>
In another match, second seed and world number three Hendrawan
of Indonesia crashed to a 9-15, 9-15 straight sets defeat to
another Malaysian, world ranked 14th Ong Ewe Hock.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia scored another prestigious victory in its
confrontation with Indonesia, when young player Yap Yong Jyen
toppled world number eight Marlev Mainaky 17-16, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
In women's singles, Lidya Djaelawijaya of Indonesia came closer
to retaining the title in the Indonesia Open when she defeated
Takako Ida of Japan in the quarter-final matches on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's semifinal match, Lidya will face a tough challenge
in Mia Audina (Netherlands) who also made it to semis earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
Mia defeated Zeng Yaqiong of China 11-1, 11-3 in a one-side
game that should have been a warning that she still has what it
takes to become champion.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final will pit Camelia Martin of Denmark against
Kanako Yonekura of Japan. Martin downed Wan Ting Ling of Hong
Kong 11-5, 11-3 while the Japanese toppled Indonesian Yuli Marfuah
11-3,7-11 and 11-7.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians Tri Kusharyanto/Minarti Timur, who were seeking a
record of six successive mixed doubles title, won Thursday and
will now go through to the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The world's top pair beat Danang Gathut/Andriani (Indonesia),
winning 15-3, 15-3. The win means that they will face
HalimHaryanto/Indarti Issolina (Indonesia), who also won their
match against Imam Sodikin/Rita Kristiane (Indonesia) 15-7, 15-6.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China began earlier
this week to issue credit cards to the 23,000 managing staffs in
Shanghai-based foreign-funded enterprises, in a fresh move to
expand its credit card business.
</P>
<P>
The white-collar workers of foreign-funded firms are a group of
high-income people whose stable high-level consumption has
attracted the attention of financial institutions, according to
Wang Zheng, vice-president of the Bank of China's Shanghai Branch.
</P>
<P>
For the initial stage, Wang's bank has selected 25 from
Shanghai's more than 2,000 shopping centers, restaurants, beauty
saloons, gymnasiums and insurance companies to provide services to
the card owners.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Airport, Schools in Sumatra, Indonesia, Closed Due to Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's North Sumatra
provincial government Thursday closed the airport in its capital
city of Medan, while many schools in neighboring Riau province
were also closed, due to the thick haze caused by raging forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
"Polonia Airport has been closed since 7:00 a.m. as the thick
haze has reduced visibility to 700 meters. In the afternoon,
visibility had reached 1,000 meters, but a minimum of 1,200 meters
is required for flight safety," local leading newspapers Friday
quoted Head of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency R.
Syarifuddin as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least three planes were unable to land at the airport in the
morning, he added.
</P>
<P>
The haze was caused by forest fires in some areas of Aceh
province and in Barumun-South Tapanuli on the border of Riau and
North Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of hotspots in Riau province had
increased to 350 and local residents were told to wear masks or
even be evacuated from the province in order to avoid respiratory
problems, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Riau province said that most kindergartens and
elementary schools in Rokanhilir regency had been ordered to close
until the haze goes away.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Environment Impact Management Agency (Bapedal) Said
Abdulrachman said on Wednesday that about 80 percent of the fires
in Riau are in the areas managed by plantation and logging firms.
The firms were blamed for often using slash-and-burn techniques
banned under environmental laws to clear land.
</P>
<P>
The latest fires on Sumatra have revived memories of the 1997
haze crisis, when thick smoke from wide-spread blazes across
Indonesia blanketed parts of Southeast Asia for weeks.
</P>
<P>
The central government has played down fears of a repeat, but
also admitted it has no strategy for putting out the fires.
</P>
<P>
More than five million hectares of forest, plantations and
other land in Indonesia were razed by fires in 1997. The resulting
haze blanketed large swathes of Indonesia, Singapore and parts of
Malaysia for weeks. It also spread to Thailand and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Talks Continue in Clinton's Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The three-way Middle East peace
talks continued on Thursday at Camp David, Maryland, although U.S.
President Bill Clinton left in the morning for a summit of
industrialized countries in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Camp David discussions continue between the parties on the
core issues of permanent status, " State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is now
leading the U.S. delegation in the absence of Clinton, met
separately with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
"She will continue to try to close the gaps and move forward on
the issues so that when the president returns he can assess the
status of our efforts," Boucher said at a temporary media center
near the presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
"She's here to carry the ball forward," Boucher said. "The same
pattern and intensity will be maintained."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Arafat and Barak began their Camp David summit on July
11 in a bid to work out a framework agreement for a permanent
settlement of the 52-year Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mainly due to gaps on the status of the holy Jerusalem, Arafat
and Barak failed to reach any agreement despite nine days of
intensive shuttle mediations by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The summit had been declared dead midnight Wednesday but was
apparently salvaged when Clinton announced that Arafat and Barak
agreed to remain and continue talks at Camp David even after he
was away in Japan.

<HEADLINE> China Mobile Cuts Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China Mobile, the largest mobile
telecom operator in China, initiated a package of price
readjustment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The price incentives waived monthly fees and commission charges
for mobile services, including manual roaming, call diverting and
change in mobile phone ownership, and dramatically reduced the
fees for short message and mobile banking services.
</P>
<P>
However, the adjustment failed to tackle the most sensitive
issue: the two-way charging practice or charging for both incoming
and outgoing mobile calls.
</P>
<P>
According to the new price package, short message senders no
longer have to pay ten yuan every month for use of the service.
Instead, they will be charged 0.10 yuan for a message.
</P>
<P>
In the past, both senders and receivers were charged 0.40 yuan
for a message.
</P>
<P>
The 0.10 yuan charge rate will be also applied to every piece
of information users receive on weather forecasts, flight
schedules, stock quotes or foreign exchanges via their mobile
phones.
</P>
<P>
Previously, such information could cost as much as 0.50 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The latest price cuts aim to make the fee structure of China
Mobile more reasonable and transparent," said Lu Xiangdong, vice-
president of the company.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the new incentives could create a huge dent in
the company's revenues this year.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that he expected the price readjustments will help his
company grab a larger share of the market and win the support of
customers.
</P>
<P>
The company user pool will gain 20 million to 60 million new
subscribers this year while business revenue is set to increase 25
percent to 103.8 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Scientific Research Helps Protect Rare Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JILIN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have made
significant progress in rare bird protection by artificially
breeding certain protected species in nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Xianghai Nature Reserve in northeast China's
Jilin Province have successfully increased the population of such
rare birds as red-crowned cranes, white marabous and golden
vultures in this world-class swamp nature reserve through
artificial reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, artificial breeding and taming have been adopted as
supplemental means to better protect the wild birds in the nature
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Xianghai is known as a major habitat for wild cranes, boasting
six of the nine existing species of cranes in China. In 1992,
Xianghai was ranked as one of the top marshes in the world, and an
"A-level nature reserve of international significance".

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Faces Serious Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Little rain in northeast China's
Jilin Province has caused a serious water shortage in this
provincial capital, said to be the most serious one in the last
one hundred years.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, the city government has decided to
start supplying water to four regions at different time periods,
lessening daily water use by a total 200,000 cu m. as of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All the public bathrooms, swimming pools and car washing and
cleaning centers have stopped running, The local afforestation
bureau is required to substitute river or lake water for tap water
to irrigate the green patches and trees along the roads.
Enterprises are also ordered to lessen water usage by either one
fifth or one ninth.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature in the city since June 1 has been 24.5
degrees Celsius, 3.6 degrees higher than usual. Northeast China,
once a cool area in summer, has become a ``furnace".
</P>
<P>
Most local dams and rivers have dried up, and the water reserve
in the two main reservoirs for the city's production and daily
life are now only 10 million cu m, or another 20 or 30 days'
supply.
</P>
<P>
Continuous high temperature and little rain may reduce the
city's industrial output value by six billion yuan (about 720
million U.S. dollars) and profits by around 300 million yuan.
Drought-hit farmland in the city has now reached some 100,000 ha.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprise Makes Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises chalked up
profits of 272.4 billion yuan in the first half of this year, a
jump of 14 percent over the same period last year, according to
latest statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The ministry credited Asia's economic recovery from financial
crisis, the country's massive develop-the-west program and pro-
active fiscal policy, as stimulating township firms' production
and sales.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, township enterprises
exported goods valued at 342.6 billion yuan, a 16 percent increase
over last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces have created industrial zones to accommodate
township enterprises, helping the rural firms establish an
efficient organizational structure, the Beijing-based newspaper
quoted an official from the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, difficulty in getting bank loans, arbitrary charges,
fines and irrational quotas imposed by local government
departments on township enterprises, have held back their
development, said the official.
</P>
<P>
If township firms were to get more financial and policy support,
they could generate ten percent more in profits, said the official.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)
Thursday formed a commission to assess recommendations compiled by
Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum on match fixing in the sport and
ways to terminate the practice.
</P>
<P>
Naveed Rasool was appointed to assess the one-man commission
which had been given the full investigative powers. Rasool, a PCB

<P>
The PCB implemented the Qayyum report banning former captain
Salim Malik and Ataur Rehman for life and fining several others
including all-rounder Wasim Akram.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also discuss the implications of a legal
challenge by any aggrieved player.
</P>
<P>
PCB has already issued show cause notices to Malik and Rehman,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Justice Qayyum conducted an inquiry into allegations of match
fixing in Pakistan cricket from September 1998 to October 1999.
</P>
<P>
PCB was waiting for a contract on match-fixing from the
International Cricket Council (ICC), which decided recently that
all players will have to sign a contract not to indulge in match
fixing.

<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein on Friday called for progress
in the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at Camp David, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation, Mubarak and Abdullah reviewed
the results achieved so far in the talks, which are aimed to solve
the thorniest final-status issues between the two sides, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported. It did not say who initiated the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders underlined that progress is needed in the talks
so that a just and comprehensive settlement will be reached for the
issues including the borders of a future Palestinian state, the
status of Jerusalem, the fate of the Palestinian refugees and
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Abdullah, meanwhile, underscored that any settlement
should meet the demands of the Palestinian people for the
restoration of their rights, including the right to establish an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak have been engaging in intensive and tough negotiations since
July 11 for a final peace treaty they have planned to reach by
September 13.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that while they have found solutions to most of the
sticking points, they are unable to reach an agreement on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that the Arab East Jerusalem be the
capital of their future state, but the Israelis insist the city,
holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians, be their "eternal and
undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries that have made peace
with Israel, have been playing an active role in mediating the
Middle East peace process.

WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jason Williams of the
Sacramento Kings was suspended by the NBA authorities for the
first five games of the next season for failing to comply with his
drug treatment plan.
</P>
<P>
While neither side was willing to reveal the drug involved,
Williams said in a statement released by the Kings that "I accept
the NBA's decision. I must be responsible and accountable for my
actions. The ball is in my court."
</P>
<P>
NBA teams and the players association are prohibited from
publicly disclosing information regarding the testing or treatment
of any NBA player in the program, other than to announce
suspensions or dismissals from the league.
</P>
<P>
Williams, kicked off the team at Florida as a sophomore in
February 1998 for twice testing positive for marijuana, has been
one of the pillars in the revival of the Kings the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
Williams, averaged 12.3 points and 7.3 assists last season in
his second year with the Kings, was chosen seventh overall in the
1998 draft by the Kings, and became an immediate sensation when he

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has warned the Mexican authorities about the
existence of an electronic page that offers, seemingly from Mexico,
a content of child pornography.
</P>
<P>
The UN organization asked the Mexican Congress to legislate a
prohibition to the exhibition of child's pornography in the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF asked the intervention of the Federal Attorney Office (
PGR), the National System for the Complete Development of the
Family (DIF), and the Human Rights National Commission (CNDH) for
the solution of this problem.
</P>
<P>
The finding of the web site was made possible by the
denunciation of a young Mexican student, Gabriel Figueroa, who
sent an e-mail to UNICEF requesting the intervention of the
organization to have the page taken off the web.
</P>
<P>
Figueroa told UNICEF in his e-mail that he expected the persons
who commit these atrocities to be investigated.
</P>
<P>
A DIF study shows that some 4,600 minors were sexually exploited
in 1999 in cities like Acapulco, Cancun, Ciudad Juarez,
Guadalajara, Tapachula and Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of Mexico and the United States dismantled in
1994 an international organization based in the port of Acapulco
that produced infantile pornography, after detaining its leaders,
Anthony Frank and James Leroy Kemish, both U.S. citizens.

<HEADLINE> UK Economy Continues to Power Ahead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) - The UK economy has picked up
strongly in the second quarter of the year, according to official
figures released Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product is up 0.9 percent in the three months to
the end of June compared to 0.5 percent growth in the previous
quarter, provisional Office for National Statistics estimates
showed.
</P>
<P>
It leaves output 3.1 percent higher than a year ago and
represents the 32nd successive quarter of growth in the economy
since the depression of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The figures also suggest that the UK's domestic economy is
still on the verge of overheating, which could stoke inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank of England has a weapon against inflation by
raising interest rates. These have been on hold at 6 percent for
the last few months, although the bank has raised its base rate
four times since last September.

BRASILIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian state oil company
Petrobras said Friday that there are still 10,000 liters of crude
in the Iguazu River, of the 4 million liters spilt by the Getulio
Vargas refinery.
</P>
<P>
The biggest spillage of crude of the last 25 years in Brazil

into the Iguazu River, contaminating it along 50 kilometers.
</P>

Petrobras, fined with more than 28 U.S. million dollars,
attributed the accident to a technical failure and to human
negligence.
</P>
<P>
The biggest Brazilian petrochemical firm has hired hundreds of
workers and 50 ships to cleanse the river, a task that will last
30 days.
</P>
<P>
The biggest volume of crude spilled is concentrated in the
General Cameiro region, 20 kilometers from the refinery, where a
Canadian raft separates the water from the oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian state should
be admitted to the United Nations as a full member, whether or not
peace talks with Israel are successful, Palestinian U.N. observer
Nasser al-Kidwa said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the U.N. Palestine rights committee,
Kidwa said it should participate as a full member in the
Millennium Summit of the U.N. General Assembly to be held from
September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Kidwa charged that Israel's positions were "inconsistent with
Security Council resolution 242," which he said required its
withdrawal from all territory occupied in the 1967 Middle East war,
including East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"For the Palestinian side, East Jerusalem must be the capital
of the state of Palestine," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While we are doing our utmost to reach an agreement with the
other side, we believe that it has become clear that it is our
right, with the success of the process or, God forbid, even
without the success of the process, that Palestine, as a state,
become a full member of the United Nations," Kidwa said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, we strongly hope that the Millennium Summit...
will represent a new beginning for the Middle East through the
participation of Palestine in the summit as a full member," Kidwa
said.
</P>
<P>
Kidwa said he was confident of the overwhelming support of the
international community for U.N. membership for Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization first obtained U.N.
observer status in 1974. This was upgraded in 1988. In 1998, the U.
N. General Assembly overwhelmingly endorsed a further upgrading,
giving the Palestinian U.N. observer delegation rights almost
equivalent to those of a full member state, except the right to
cast votes or submit candidates for office.
</P>
<P>
September 13 is the date set by the Palestinians for
establishing an independent state, regardless of the outcome of U.
S.-mediated talks between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak now taking place at Camp David
in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, U.S. Sign Agreement on Organs Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican Health Ministry (
SSA) and U.S. United Network for Organ Sharing signed Friday an
agreement of cooperation in relation with the law for the
transplants of organs and tissues, said health sources of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by SSA Regulation and Development Vice
Minister Javier Castellanos Coutino and United Network Executive
Director Walter K. Graham at a ceremony in the central
headquarters of the Mexican Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement includes the exchange of technical, scientific,
and sanitary information, experiences and training related to the
transplant of organs and tissues, and all the advances related to
this matter.
</P>
<P>
Both parties must also design programs aimed at obtaining
organs and tissues as well as financial funds for their
implementation, give adequate training to the personnel who will
carry out the transplants, and promote visits of consulting
experts, among other things.
</P>
<P>
There will be in Mexico a waiting list for the transplant of
organs and tissues, dependable, opportune and transparent, and an
up-to-date register of the medical professionals, the receivers of
the transplants, and of the donating relatives.
</P>
<P>
Castellanos said he is confident that this agreement will
promote the culture of transplants in Mexico and that, according
to official figures, there is every year a bigger demand for the
transplant of 5,000 to 10,000 kidneys, 7,000 corneas, and 4,000
livers.
</P>
<P>
The number of transplants made every year could be increased
four times with the existing hospital infrastructure and surgeons'
capability if that culture were changed and the availability or
organs and tissues increased, said Castellanos, who also is the
technical secretary of the SSA National Transplants Council.
</P>
<P>
The number of transplants made in the United States every year
is 22,000, while it is expected to arrive at the figure of at
least 6,000 in Mexico every year, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Walter K. Graham said, "Our fundamental target is the same: to
develop a national system as efficient as possible to increase to
the maximum the availability of organs and fulfill the needs of
the patients in the systems of both countries."

Two U.S. experts, Jonathan Coleman and James Stamps, who have
already met with Tourism Minister Ibrahim Ferradaz, and with an
advisor to the Sugar Ministry, as reported by the authorities, are
carrying out that mission, commissioned by the U.S. Congress.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Warns Potential Incidents Across Israeli-Lebanese Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday warned that the potential for serious incidents
across the Israeli-Lebanese border still existed despite Israel's
withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said the Lebanese
army refused to allow U.N. peacekeepers and its own forces to be
deployed fully in the vacated region until it was sure all border
violations had ceased.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) was short of at least two battalions to
accomplish new tasks and was owed nearly 118 million U.S. dollars
by U.N. members in unpaid Peacekeeping dues.
</P>
<P>
"With an enormous improvement compared to the past, the
situation in the Israeli-Lebanese sector falls well short of peace,
and the potential for serious incidents still exist," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said Lebanon would consent to the UNIFIL'
s deployment after all border violations stopped and Israel had
committed itself to doing so by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities had corrected all but two of the
violations identified by the UNIFIL, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He complimented Hizbollah for conducting themselves "in a
controlled manner that deserved to be acknowledged."
</P>
<P>
Annan said "armed elements" continued to maintain a presence
in southern Lebanon and several times blocked UNIFIL patrols from
their tasks. But he did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a large number of landmines and unexploded
ordnance strewn in southern Lebanon, Annan called for governments
to help Lebanon and the United Nations clear them as well as
assist Lebanon in developing the vacated area.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would appoint a senior official to serve as his
representative in Lebanon, working closely with Terje Roed-Larsen,
his special Middle East envoy.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks. It announced it had
withdrawn its troops on May 24 and the United Nations set out to
verify this.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Reserves Drop A Bit, Esso Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The world's confirmed oil reserves
declined by 1.8 percent to 138 billion tons last year, Esso, the
Stuttgart-based German unit of multinational Exxon Mobil, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
World oil production dropped by 3.7 percent last year to 3.44
billion tons, due to decisions by OPEC, the organization of the
main oil producing countries, to stick by quotas, Esso said in its
study published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Because of cheap prices, consumption rose 3.1 percent to 3.45
billion tons in 1999, which resulted in the fall to very low
levels in oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
Esso said that the world's known natural gas reserves were 145.
6 trillion cubic meters, much the same as the year before.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the world's oil reserves can last for
hundreds of years because the confirmed reserves are still a small
part of the oil in the ground.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Supreme Court Hearing on Pinochet's Appeal Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Defense and plaintiffs'
allegations in the Supreme Court hearing on the appeal against the
deprivation of the immunity of former Chilean military ruler
Augusto Pinochet ended Friday afternoon after three sessions.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Supreme Court President Judge Hernan Alvarez announced
at the end of the allegations that the 20 judges that make up the
top court will hold a plenary meeting on July 25, to start
studying the theme of Pinochet's appeal against the request to
deprive him of his lifetime senator immunity, and that a
resolution could be reached the next week.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court hearing for Pinochet's appeal started on July
19. The judges listened during the first session to the relation
of the Court reader on the case of the former commander in chief
of the Army.
</P>
<P>
 The three-day hearing was called after the retired general
appealed a June 5 ruling by the Santiago Court of Appeals
stripping him of his parliamentary immunity. The court decided to
meet again on Tuesday to deliberate on a final decision, which is
expected in early August.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet had enjoyed legal immunity as a "senator for life," a
title he took as a former president under the constitution adopted
by his military regime.
</P>
<P>
The demand to strip the Pinochet's immunity was brought by
Judge Juan Guzman, appointed to coordinate claims lodged against
Pinochet since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, an attorney for defended the former leaders,
Pinochet claiming he was innocent and had no links to a series of
summary executions in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Ricardo Rivadeneira argued that the 84-year-old
former military ruler was too ill to stand trial and defend
himself. Pinochet suffers from cardiovascular problems and
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
But under Chilean law, a defendant's poor physical health does
not prevent a trial from going ahead.
</P>
<P>
After appearing before the court on Friday, Rivadeneira said he
was "optimistic."
</P>
<P>
But the petitioner's attorneys were also confident, with one
saying he had "not the least doubt that the Supreme Court can do
nothing but affirm the stripping of the immunity."
</P>
<P>
If the lower court ruling is upheld, Pinochet could go on trial
for any of the 146 criminal complaints lodged against him, all
stemming from incidents during his iron-fisted 1973-1990 rule,
when more than 3,000 people were killed or went missing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigator Clears Gov't of Wrongdoing in Death of 80 Cult Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- An Independent Counsel Friday
cleared the U.S. government of any wrongdoing in the 1993 siege
and fire at the Branch Davidian compound that killed about 80 cult
members, saying the group's leaders set the blaze and shot at
their own people.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Attorney
General Reno, the present and former director of the FBI (Federal
Bureau of Investigation), other high officials of the United
States or members of the FBI hostage team who fired pyrotechnic
tear gas on April 19, 1993," said Independent Counsel John C.
Danforth at a press conference in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
"I give you these conclusions with 100 percent certainty," said
former Senator Danforth, who was appointed 10 months ago by Reno
to make the investigation under the pressure of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Danforth said government agents did not start the fire that
killed most of the cult members and did not shoot at the Davidians
in the siege at its compound near Waco, Texas. He also said the
government did not improperly use the military, and did not engage
in a massive conspiracy and major cover-up.
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy at Waco rests with certain Branch Davidians and
their leader David Koresh who shot and killed four (government)
agents, wounded 20 others, shot at FBI agents trying to insert
tear gas into the complex, burned down the complex, and shot at
least 20 of their own people, including five children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denforth issued his preliminary findings one week after a Texas
jury found in a damage lawsuit that the government is not
responsible for the death of the cult members.
</P>
<P>
The 80 cult members, including their leader David Koresh, died
in the fire which followed a raid at the compound after a 51-day
siege by federal law enforcement forces.
</P>
<P>
The siege began on February 28, 1993, when Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (AFT) agents attempted to serve a search and arrest
warrant on David Koresh. A gunfight broke out, leaving four ATF
agents and six Davidians dead, and the standoff began.
</P>
<P>
It ended on April 19, 1993, when converted tanks driven by FBI
agents pumped tear gas into the compound and a fire began.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Restricts Entrance of Cuban Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Migrations General
Director Eduardo Vilchez announced Friday more stringent
regulations for the entrance of Cuban immigrants to the country.
</P>
<P>
From now on a visa to enter Costa Rica will be granted only to
Cubans who can assure that they will return to their country.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, visas for the reunion of families that
permitted Cubans already residing in this country to request visas
for their relatives will be also restricted.
</P>
<P>
Now only nationalized Cubans will be able to allege family
reunion in their visa requests and this will be applied only in
the case of first degree relatives, meaning spouse and children.
</P>
<P>
Vilchez said that the government does not consider it opportune
to maintain an ample policy for the arrival of Cubans to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica does not have diplomatic relations with Cuba, but
two years ago it reopened a consulate in Havana that had been
closed by the end of 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, a growing number of Cubans had obtained a
residence status, which permitted them also to bring their
relatives who could remain in the country as residents.
