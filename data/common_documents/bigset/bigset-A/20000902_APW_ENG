<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 28; Dow Up 24  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Friday in lackluster
trading ahead of the holiday weekend. Investors' recent optimism
was only slightly dampened by conflicting economic data.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.68 at 11,238.78,
after gaining 112 points on Thursday. Friday's gain helped the blue
chip index rise 46.15 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which also rose more than 100 points
Thursday, was up 27.98 at 4,234.33. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 3.09 at 1,520.77. The Nasdaq jumped 191.65 for the week,
while the S&AMP;P 500 rose 14.32.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and productivity figures released Friday sent mixed
signals, but seemed to indicate that inflationary pressures are
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, as a result of recent tame economic data, the
Federal Reserve Board seems to be out of the picture for the rest
of the year,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The benign inflation figures have prompted strength in both the
financial and technology sectors, as a feeling of optimism has
pervaded the markets, Ackerman noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense is that when many market players return from their
holidays in September we may see the market re-emerge as a magnet
for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment
rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and total payrolls fell by a
bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the month, the largest drop in
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, manufacturing activity declined in August after 18
months of growth, reflecting the influence of higher interest rates
and a cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investor hunger for stocks with certain interest
rate sensitive sectors has boosted the broader markets in recent
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and computer stocks helped lift the Dow index
Friday. Vodafone Airtouch PLC rose $3.19 to $44.31 and IBM climbed
$1.56 to $133.63.
</P>
<P>
   But investors continued to slam Internet portal site Yahoo!
following an analyst's warning earlier this week that the company's
second-half earnings could fall off in the face of an expected
decline in advertising revenues generated by Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s stock, which has lost about 10 percent of its value
this week, was down $7.56 on Friday at $113.94.
</P>
<P>
   Internet parts and services companies accounted for much of the
Nasdaq's gains. Global Crossing rose $5.06 to $35.13, Commerce One
gained $3.47 to $66, and Lycos was up $3.63 at $74.63.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 3-to-2 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 948.81 million
shares, well below Thursday's pace and one of the lowest figures
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index closed up 4.02 at 541.91.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.72 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.78 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
1.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.84 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Avoids Defense Decision  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he is not
convinced the technology is at hand to build an effective
anti-missile shield and will leave it to the next president -- Al
Gore or George W. Bush -- to decide when, or if, to deploy a
national missile defense that is prohibited by a 1972 arms control
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not move forward until we have absolute confidence
that the system will work,'' Clinton said in a speech at Georgetown
University explaining why he believes it is too early to commit the
United States to missile defense. He ordered the Pentagon to pursue
a ''robust program'' to prove the effectiveness of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bush reiterated that if elected he would deploy a
missile defense ''at the earliest possible date.'' He characterized
Clinton's decision as evidence of failed leadership on national
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not say what kind of missile defense he would advocate,
but in the past he has said he favored a system that could defend
not only the United States but also its allies -- an approach that
the Clinton administration and many private defense experts say
would take longer to bear fruit than Clinton's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Gore welcomed Clinton's decision as providing needed time to
more thoroughly test the technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I welcome the opportunity to be more certain that these
technologies actually work together properly,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of Clinton's decision is that the Pentagon's 2005
target date for having an initial, limited means of defending all
50 states against attack by a small number of ballistic missiles
has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain that schedule, Clinton would have had to authorize
the Pentagon -- before the end of this year -- to award contracts for
initial construction on Alaska's Shemya Island of a powerful new
radar that would provide the missile-tracking capability needed for
an effective missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision likely means that work on the Shemya radar
cannot begin before 2002, which means that a national missile
defense could not be completed before 2006 at the earliest. The
decision gives the next president leeway to restructure the program
or reorder its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also pleased the Russian government, which, along
with China, has led the international opposition to a U.S. missile
defense. They argue that it would upset the international strategic
balance by placing in jeopardy the deterrent effect of their own
arsenals of offensive nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision not to take upon
himself the responsibility for deploying the national anti-missile
defense system is seen in Russia as a well thought-out and
responsible step,'' President Vladimir Putin said in a statement in
Moscow. Clinton's decision, he said, ''doubtless will lead to
strengthening strategic stability and security in the whole world,
and will raise the United States' authority in the eyes of the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried, unsuccessfully, to
persuade the Russians to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty, which explicitly forbids a nationwide defense against
long-range ballistic missiles. The treaty allows either party to
withdraw from its provisions after providing six-months notice.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Britain, France and Germany welcomed Clinton's
decision as a prudent step, and Canada applauded as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, reaction was predictably mixed and mostly
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the decision
''yet another example of the Clinton-Gore administration's legacy
of missed opportunities.'' The House's most vocal supporter of
national missile defense, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said Clinton
chose to ''beg our allies and our enemies for permission to move
ahead with missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said Clinton
made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be dangerous consequences for America and the world
if we rush to meet arbitrary decision deadlines,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said, ''I support the president's
decision and commend him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year passed a law requiring deployment of a
national missile defense as soon as ''technologically feasible'' --
leaving open to debate when the technology is mature enough to
build a reliable defense. Clinton also took into consideration the
cost, the level of threat of missile attack and the international
implications, including the impact on relations with Russian and
European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, a Republican and perhaps the
administration's strongest advocate of national missile defense,
issued a statement supporting Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's statement today underscores the importance of
having the next president fully involved in decisions regarding the
future of the program before committing the United States to a
deployment strategy,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in July that it would
be irresponsible for the administration to put off a decision. Such
a delay, she said, would give North Korea, Iran and other countries
more time to develop missiles that could threaten the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday how the statement squared with Clinton's decision,
the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''the president
has decided the technology is not at the point where we can go
ahead confidently.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton credited the Pentagon with overcoming
''daunting technical obstacles'' in the developing of missile
defenses. But he made clear he believes more testing is needed to
validate the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the last two flight tests of the proposed
missile interceptor have failed to hit their targets, and that
questions remain about ''countermeasures,'' or methods of defeating
a national missile defense, or NMD.
</P>
<P>
   ''I simply cannot conclude, with the information I have today,
that we have enough confidence in the technology and the
operational effectiveness of the entire NMD system to move forward
to deployment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defers Defense Decision  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In deciding to put off deployment of a
national missile defense, President Clinton put heavy emphasis on
not upsetting Russia, China and other nations that oppose or
question the wisdom of such a system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can never afford to overlook the fact that the actions and
reactions of others in this increasingly interdependent world do
bear on our security,'' Clinton said Friday in announcing that he
would not authorize the Pentagon to take initial steps toward
deploying a missile defense to protect all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, therefore, it would be far better to move forward in
the context of ... allied support'' and a modification to arms
control agreements on missile defense that is acceptable to Russia,
he said. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty prohibits
deployment of a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear he believes that national missile defense has
far-reaching implications for U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the next president makes a deployment decision, he will
need to avoid stimulating an already dangerous regional nuclear
capability, from China to South Asia,'' Clinton said. He alluded
later to a classified CIA estimate that a U.S. national missile
defense would prompt China to substantially increase its missile
force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is not convinced the technology is at hand to
build an effective anti-missile shield and will leave it to the
next president -- Democrat Al Gore or Republican George W. Bush -- to
decide when, or if, to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not move forward until we have absolute confidence

   Clinton's decision probably means that work on the Shemya radar
cannot begin before 2002, with deployment impossible before 2006 or
probably 2007. The decision gives the next president leeway to
restructure the $60 billion program or reorder its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision pleased the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision not to take upon
himself the responsibility for deploying the national anti-missile

<HEADLINE> Library of Congress Faces Problems  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly developed digitalized baseball cards are
presenting the Library of Congress with new problems in preserving
the nation's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest library -- over 119 million items -- has
high-quality housings for its collection of cardboard baseball
cards going back more than 100 years, including one that shows Ty
Cobb stealing third base.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not too hot, not too cold; not too moist, not too dry,''
curator Harry Katz describes the conditions for assuring they don't
deteriorate into paper mache or dust. ''It's the same problem as
preserving the Gutenberg Bible or Ansel Adams photos, though the
parameters are different, depending on the materials.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new digital trading cards on three-inch CD-ROMs will
require also preserving what will inevitably become antique
computer technology to read them.
</P>
<P>
   ''One problem is the hardware,'' Katz said. ''Technology moves
so fast that in a few years today's computers may be obsolete. No
use keeping the disks if they can't be read. How much equipment do
we have to preserve, too?''
</P>
<P>
   As society becomes more digitalized, the library is increasingly
looking at computer capacity as much as warehouse space in planning
its future needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many gigabytes should you have?'' Katz asked.
</P>
<P>
   Many archives now exist only on the Internet, and it's not just
archives.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of artists -- increasingly -- don't work on paper. Their
work is just images you can see on a monitor,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Library of Congress gets two copies of books and
other printed materials that are copyrighted. It doesn't keep all
of them because it doesn't have the warehouse space.
</P>
<P>
   It now faces the same problem with cyberspace: which artists and
which works to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to identify the best people and the work we want to
keep,'' Katz said. ''We've been bandying a lot of names around, but
we don't have a list yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Roosa, chief of the library's conservation division,
divides the problem into two areas: material that is ''born
digital'' and information that is ''reborn digital.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''born digital'' includes art, electronic books, scientific
journals, music and multi-media presentations. ''For instance, some
of the music never resides in any format unless the end user
decides to do it,'' said Roosa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reborn digital'' material is taken from crumbling paper
documents, wax cylinders like those Thomas Edison used for the
first recordings, early television programs recorded on two-inch
videotapes that can only be read by a few remaining pieces of
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were 80 or 90 different formats for videotapes,'' Roosa
said, ''You can't get the manufacturers to go back to old
technologies and make the spare parts. We have to be sure when we
get information in new forms that we can migrate it forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The library has a lot of conservation problems.
</P>
<P>
   Microfilm, a relatively low-tech device, has been preserving
newspapers for decades. Not satisfied with that, the library wanted
to keep the actual pages of The New York Times special supplement
of April 28, 1912, on the sinking of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The ZFB Co. in Leipzig, Germany, had an experimental
paper-splitting process. It smoothed each page, covered it gently
with a transparent tissue attached by a gelatin adhesive and
inserted a sheet of acid-free paper between them. The acid in
newsprint makes it crumble in a few decades. Then the experts
encapsulated each page in a polyester film.

<HEADLINE> Robert Ray Responds to Critics  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray says critics
are misconstruing his plan to divulge conclusions of the Whitewater
investigation just weeks before voters decide whether to elect
Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and several legal experts said the
Independent Counsel statute under which Ray was appointed limits
him to filing his soon-to-be-completed report with a federal
appeals court, which wouldn't release it until well after Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came after Ray told The New York Times he would
issue a statement of his findings and conclusions in the Whitewater
probe a few weeks before New York voters go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Ray ''is defying the law,'' Levin declared.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our plan to make a public statement is not shocking,'' Ray
said in a statement. ''This office is not releasing a final report
or a portion of a final report without court approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray added that the U.S. Attorney's manual expressly authorizes
public statements regarding matters that have ''already received
substantial publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levin said Ray does not have the authority to release
conclusions and that ''Congress was very clear about this precisely
to avoid an independent counsel releasing or appearing to release a
report for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Customarily, when other independent counsels filed final reports
under seal with a special division of the U.S. Court of Appeals,
they issued terse statements, devoid of criticism, announcing an
end to their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised'' by what Ray is planning and ''I think Carl
Levin is exactly right,'' said George Washington University law
professor Stephen Saltzburg. He said it's the court that makes a
judgment on what to release.
</P>
<P>
   Saltzburg is a former Iran-Contra prosecutor who was a deputy
assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal
division in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you issue a statement at the same time that you file a
report under seal, you are absolutely running roughshod over the
spirit'' of the requirement that the report be kept confidential,
said Larry Barcella, a former federal prosecutor who has
represented Republicans and Democrats in Independent Counsel
probes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown University law professor Paul Rothstein said, ''I
think it is wise'' for an Independent Counsel ''to make some kind
of statement if it is not accusatory in nature,'' but it's
''another kettle of fish if it's going to be accusatory in any
sense. Sometimes these final reports say we're not prosecuting, but
we think there's a lot of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray took Mrs. Clinton and the White House to task in a
three-page news release in June announcing the end of his
investigation into the firings of White House travel office
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ray accused the White House of ''substantial resistance'' to
providing ''relevant evidence'' to his investigators and said there
was ''substantial evidence'' Mrs. Clinton played a role in the
travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
   That conflicted with the first lady's sworn statements that she
''had no role'' in the decision.

<HEADLINE> HUD Watchdog Workers Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several employees at the agency that checks
for fraud and abuse in federal housing programs have been suspended
in an investigation into the use of government computers to obtain
sexually explicit materials, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the Department of Housing and Urban
Development inspector general's office caught Secretary Andrew
Cuomo off guard because the watchdog agency didn't inform the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard about the allegation. We had not been previously
informed,'' HUD Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez said Friday. ''We're
obviously very concerned because such use of government computers
is clearly a violation of the department's policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have asked for a response from the IG and she has
repeatedly failed to provide that response,'' Ramirez said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Ramirez on Friday, Inspector General Susan
Gaffney blamed a canceled meeting for the delay and said, ''I now
look forward to discussing the issue at our rescheduled meeting''
next week.
</P>
<P>
   A HUD official familiar with the investigation, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said senior auditing employees at the
inspector general offices in Washington, Fort Worth, Texas, and
Boston have been suspended in connection with the probe. The
official did not know exactly how many employees have been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation involves the improper use of government
computers to download sexually explicit materials and, in some
cases, the distribution of the materials via HUD e-mail,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gaffney declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   All Cabinet departments and other major federal agencies have an
independent watchdog office of inspector general, responsible for
guarding against waste, fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the allegations of the misuse of computers by
HUD inspector general employees was overseen by the President's
Council on Integrity and Efficiency, which monitors the conduct of
the inspector generals.
</P>
<P>
   The council used FBI agents and investigators from the Labor
Department's IG office to conduct the investigation, according to
officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Documents obtained by The Associated Press show investigators
requested computer usage logs for 10 HUD inspector generals'
employees showing which Web sites they visited during 1999. The
request was made last December.
</P>
<P>
   The senior HUD official told the AP the suspensions were handed
out within the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the offices of three employees on the list this week
confirmed they have been placed on leave.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., wrote Gaffney on Friday expressing
concerns that workers within an agency charged with guarding
against abuse were involved in misusing computers. He also chided
Gaffney for not telling HUD officials earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have received reports that senior members of your office
have been subjected to disciplinary actions, including suspensions,
for accessing and downloading pornographic material from the
Internet during the workday using their HUD computers and
transmitting such materials using HUD's e-mail system,'' Lantos
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my view, it is clear that you are required to advise both
Congress and HUD senior management about these matters,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The HUD matter comes just a few weeks after the White House
acknowledged that a handful of its employees were reprimanded and
one was suspended without pay a year ago for downloading
pornographic material from the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Reno OKs Boy Scout Jamborees  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Boy Scouts can still hold their Jamborees
on federal lands even though they bar gays from being scouts or
leaders, Attorney General Janet Reno says.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Friday night, Reno moved swiftly to quash
an issue that had rapidly begun to enter the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She was responding to a request last month from the Interior
Department for guidance on how President Clinton's executive order
June 23 barring discrimination against homosexuals would affect
Interior's relations with the Boy Scouts of America.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after Interior's request become public Thursday,
GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush and other Republicans
criticized the administration. Bush questioned whether Interior was
on the verge of throwing the 90-year-old scouting organization off
federal lands, which for years have been used by many Scout troops
for camping.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno decided that Clinton's order does not prohibit the Boy
Scouts from holding their Jamborees on federal land or general
federal assistance to the group related to those gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Clinton's executive order prohibits discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation in federally conducted education
and training programs. But she determined that ''Boy Scout
Jamborees are not federally conducted education or training
programs,'' according to the Justice Department statement.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Clinton order ''does not apply to private
organizations that may use federal lands for their own training
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other types of federal assistance, such as help with
conservation merit badges or awards, also would be permitted so
long as the Scouts, rather than the federal government, conducted
the activity, said a senior Justice official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's order, which applies to other types of discrimination
as well, was issued five days before the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4,
that the Scouts could constitutionally exclude homosexuals as
members or leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Interior's solicitor asked the Justice Department
for advice on the matter and on Aug. 15 directed all Interior
agencies to produce detailed information on their activities with
the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The information is needed ''to determine which activities and
programs ... as they relate to the Boy Scouts of America are
consistent with'' the president's order on discrimination, Interior
Solicitor John Leshy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a statement: ''I'm troubled by this memo appearing
to suggest that the Clinton-Gore administration might sever the
federal government's longstanding relationship with the Boy Scouts
of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had little to say, but a spokesman for Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign, Douglas Hattaway, sought
to make clear Gore has no intention of ousting the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a Gore administration Boy Scouts will be allowed to use
federal land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior spokesman Jon Wright said the department has no
intention of severing ties with the Scouts. He characterized the
Leshy memo as an attempt to get clarification from the Justice
Department on how the president's order might affect the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a long history and tradition with the Boy Scouts and
we look forward to continuing that relationship,'' said Wright. He
added that Scouts often help clean up campgrounds and trails and
the department helps Scouts work on conservation merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican
Conference, accused the administration of ''investigating'' the Boy
Scouts and of ''political pandering'' to gays.
</P>
<P>
   The incident caught the Boy Scouts of America, incorporated in
1910 and chartered by Congress six years later, by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stumped,'' spokesman Gregg Shields said. He said as far as
he knew the Boy Scouts have had little dealing with the government
except ''we camp on some federal land. ... We get almost no
financial support from the federal government.''

<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Release Halted on Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Wen Ho Lee's homecoming was delayed
after an appeals court stayed the release of the jailed Los Alamos
nuclear scientist, leaving defense attorneys scrambling to respond
to the order.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors awaiting Lee's return said they were disappointed by
the last-minute legal maneuvers by the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals, which said Friday in a brief order: ''Release of (Lee) is
stayed pending further order of this court.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is just a tremendous amount of disappointment and
frustration and anger among a lot of people,'' said Phyllis Hedges,
an organizer of an aborted ''Welcome Home'' rally in White Rock.
''This is not the way the government should work.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James A. Parker, who last week ordered Lee's
release on $1 million bail, said he would have rejected the
government's request for a delay if the appellate court had not
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the 10th Circuit likely wouldn't have ordered the
last-minute delay if it had seen the government's information that
he's spent the past three months reviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said the court
acted on its own before the government had a chance to ask for a
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys were angered that the timing of the stay left
them no chance to respond. They filed a petition Friday asking the
10th Circuit to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Lee has spent more than eight months shackled in solitary
confinement because the prosecution misled Judge Parker (and this
court) about the significance of the information at issue and the
nature of Dr. Lee's conduct. He should not spend a single day more
in prison,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Cline told Parker, ''This isn't the way
the judicial system is supposed to work. It just isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is accused of downloading restricted data about nuclear
weapons to unsecure computers and tapes at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. He has been jailed since December awaiting trial, which
is now scheduled for Nov. 6. If convicted of all 59 counts, Lee
could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Parker raised the possibility of bail last week when he held
that the information presented by the government ''no longer has
the requisite clarity and persuasive character necessary'' to keep
Lee in jail. He ruled after an FBI agent whose testimony last
December was a key in denying bail acknowledged that some of his
testimony was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, which filed a motion to halt Lee's bail Friday,
has contended there are no acceptable terms of release as long as
seven of the tapes remained unaccounted for. The defense insists
the tapes were destroyed; the prosecution wants proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents searched Lee's home Thursday for any additional
evidence. Lee attorney Nancy Hollander, who kept watch during the
search, said she knew of nothing seized from the house. The FBI
agents also put a video surveillance camera in the Lees' backyard
and attached tracking devices to the their cars.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, affidavits were unsealed saying two former
counterintelligence chiefs believe Lee was singled out for
prosecution because of his race, as the Taiwan-born scientist's
supporters claim. Prosecutors deny the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The counterintelligence chiefs' statements were submitted by the
defense to support its petition for disclosure of a huge volume of
documents that it says shows a pattern of racial profiling in the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Parker has not decided whether to turn the materials over to the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Lee's neighborhood, the mood turned from one of anticipation
to dejection when the appellate court's ruling was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''How ashamed the government ought to be for continuing to
pursue this,'' said Carl Newton, a retired lab employee and friend
of the Lees. ''It seems very much like ... they're not recognizing
that they're dealing with human lives. It just seems very unfair.''

<HEADLINE> World Leaders React to US Decision  </HEADLINE>
By PAISLEY DODDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditional foes of the United States as well as longtime allies
expressed relief and praise after President Clinton's decision to
shelve a national missile defense system, saying it was a sensible
move that avoids jarring the international balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   China offered understated praise Saturday, describing Clinton's
decision as ''rational.'' Russian President Vladimir Putin was more
direct, calling it a ''well thought-out and responsible step.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, France, Germany and Canada also weighed in, saying the
president was wise not to rush into the project.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday he is not convinced the technology is at
hand to build an effective anti-missile shield and will leave it to
the next president to decide whether to deploy a national missile
defense. Republican candidate George W. Bush supports rapid
deployment of the system; his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has
been noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   China fiercely opposes the proposed shield as a security threat
that could force it to beef up its nuclear arsenal. However, the
government's reaction Saturday was surprisingly muted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision is rational,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua News
Agency. ''We hope that the U.S. government will have more contact
and discussions with other countries on the matter, so as to make a
decision which could serve the interests of countries and peoples
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   China fears a U.S. missile shield would undermine its limited
long-range nuclear deterrent, and that it could be extended to
shield Taiwan, which separated from Beijing amid civil war 51 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese government did not immediately react to Clinton's
decision. However, lawmaker Lee Wen-chung, a member of President
Chen Shui-bian's party, said the move was regrettable and he hoped
the new U.S. president would push the program forward more
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said Friday the decision did not mean Washington and
Moscow share common opinions about a national missile defense. He
said Russia will continue to promote nuclear disarmament and
nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The given step ... will lead to strengthening strategic
stability and security in the whole world, and will raise the
United States' authority in the eyes of the international
community,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said his country welcomed
Clinton's approach, saying the president had taken careful account
of the views of U.S. allies and other international partners who
cautioned him against making a rushed decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to continuing dialogue on this subject with
the current U.S. administration, and in due course with its
successor and with our NATO allies and others,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac took note with ''great
interest'' of Clinton's decision, saying the project ''risks
jeopardizing the strategic balance and restarting the arms race,''
according to presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
   A German government spokesman praised Clinton's move as a ''wise
decision,'' and said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had
personally urged Clinton ''not to make a hasty decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada weighed in as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are gratified that, among other things, the president has
taken into account the concerns of U.S. allies and the potential
risk for global strategic stability in not committing at this time
to proceed with deployment,'' said Michael O'Shaughnessy, a
spokesman for the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed national missile defense, projected to cost about
$60 billion, is designed to protect all 50 U.S. states from attack
by a limited number of long-range ballistic missiles from North
Korea or the Middle East. It is a scaled-down version of the global
missile defense pursued during the Reagan administration that
became known as Star Wars for its focus space-based lasers and
other exotic weaponry.

<HEADLINE> Old Meets New Under Barcelona  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Workers laying fiber-optic cable for
faster Internet access have run up against a chunk of 14th-century
wall and a watchtower built to keep intruders out of this ancient
Mediterranean city.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said they were delighted by the find this past
week under Calle Pelayo, a busy shopping street in downtown
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   From old maps they had a general idea of the wall's location but
couldn't pinpoint it. The tower was a surprise bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The tower was an imposing structure estimated at 66 feet high,
36 feet in diameter with a wall seven feet thick, city government
spokesman Diego Boza said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Only the tip of it was unearthed in the digging that began last
month to install more fiber-optic cable to the city's
telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
   Both the tower and the wall were built in the mid-1300s on
orders from King Pere of Aragon and Catalonia. They were part of
the third defense perimeter constructed around Barcelona as the
city expanded.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans to excavate the site further. Experts will
spend the next few days documenting the remains and covering them
with a special protective mesh before throwing earth back on top
and closing up the hole in Calle Pelayo.
</P>
<P>
   Boza said the fiber-active cable was never meant to go right
through the spot where the wall and tower were found and will only
have to be slightly rerouted.

<HEADLINE> 250 Neo-Nazis March in Germany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEUMUENSTER, Germany (AP) -- About 250 neo-Nazis marched through
a north German town Saturday to protest a decision by local
officials to revoke the license for a restaurant advertised on the
Internet as a meeting place for far-right extremists.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people gathered at a counter-demonstration, where
local politicians and union leaders demanded the closing of the
Club 88 in Neumuenster, about 30 miles north of Hamburg, and
criticized the Constitutional Court for allowing the neo-Nazi
march.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped cars entering the town for weapons checks. No
incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Nazis use the number eight as a stand-in for H -- the eighth
letter of the alphabet -- to get around Germany's ban on using Nazi
slogans in public. The 88 stands for HH, or ''Heil Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   The march in support of the 3 1/2-year-old Club 88 was organized
by Christian Worch, the former deputy chairman of the since-banned
National List. Worch, 42 and still one of Germany's most-active
neo-Nazis, spent two years in prison for violating a ban on
promoting Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   Worch also had ties to the youth wing of the extreme-right
National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), which the government is
considering banning as one of several initiatives to combat a
recent rise in neo-Nazi violence.
</P>
<P>
   The newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported Saturday that the Interior
Ministry has sent a request to officials in all 16 states seeking
''incriminating material'' against the fringe party, such as racist
or anti-Semitic remarks by NPD functionaries or examples of
''cooperation with skinheads or other militant right-wing
extremists.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Minimum Wage Boost  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) -- Acknowledging a compromise offer by
Republicans, President Clinton pressed Congress on Saturday to
resolve differences and pass a bill to raise the minimum wage by
$1, benefiting 10 million American workers.
</P>
<P>
   In his Labor Day weekend radio address, Clinton accused GOP
leaders in Congress of stalling the measure for more than a year
and a half, burdening it with large tax cuts for businesses and
trying to spread an increase over three instead of two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now time for the Republican leadership to stop riding the
brakes on the minimum wage,'' Clinton said in the address he taped
during a trip to the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York to
attend two fund-raisers for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates that about 10 million workers earning
between $5.15 and $6.14 an hour would directly benefit by raising
the minimum wage $1. For a full-time worker now earning minimum
wage, this increase would amount to a $2,000 annual raise.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a modest increase that merely restores the minimum wage
to what it was way back in 1982 in real dollar terms,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed minimum wage legislation, but
efforts toward a compromise have been bogged down for months.
Democrats want to use money during these prosperous times to
increase the minimum wage. Republicans say that if the minimum wage
goes up, then businesses should receive tax breaks to offset higher
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a compromise brightened on Monday when House
Speaker Dennis Hastert offered a proposal to raise the minimum wage
to $6.15 an hour over two years: 50 cents on Jan. 1 and 50 cents on
Jan. 1, 2002. The proposal would provide business tax breaks worth
$76 billion over 10 years, down from $122.7 billion in an earlier
House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., said in a letter to Clinton that Republicans
still wanted the business tax breaks paired with the wage measure,
but they agreed to remove proposals to abolish the estate tax and
change pension laws, including increased contribution limits for
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very clear that a vast majority of congressional
Democrats and Republicans would like to see a balanced approach
achieved before we adjourn,'' Hastert wrote. ''I believe that we
can work together to pass this legislation when we return in
September with strong bipartisan majorities in the House and
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But while saying that Hastert's offer had promise, Clinton said
lawmakers, who return next week from their summer recess, still
have to resolve differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge them to send me a minimum wage bill as the first order
of business,'' he said. ''It should also include a moderate tax cut
package that everyone can agree on, without harmful provisions that
would threaten overtime protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons spent Friday night at a private home in
Skaneateles. Before flying back to Washington on Saturday evening,
the president planned to play golf with top Democratic fund-raiser
Terry McAuliffe and others, including Tom Scherrer, a Syracuse
native who in June won the Kemper Open. He also planned to attend
the state fair in Syracuse with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Chelsea Clinton, 20, who
accompanied her father on trips last week to Africa and Colombia,
originally wanted to join her parents in New York but was not
feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the African trip, the day trip to Colombia and a
little bit of a head cold has led her to decide she'd rather just
stay around the house here in Washington this weekend,'' Lockhart
said Friday.

<HEADLINE> New York a state for many firsts in labor movement  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - On Sept. 5, 1882, about 10,000 workers
marched in Manhattan from the City Hall to Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a protest. It was the nation's first Labor Day
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a day set aside to honor labor and a street parade
to show workers' strength was conceived by Peter McGuire, founder
of the then-nascent Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would come at the most pleasant season of the year, nearly
midway between the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving and would fill a
wide gap in the chronology of legal holidays,'' McGuire told a
meeting of the New York Central Labor Union in May 1882.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, New York, along with Oregon and Colorado,
passed the country's first laws establishing Labor Day as a
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   And just as New York was the place where Labor Day was born, it
also became the breeding ground for several labor precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   TRIANGLE FACTORY FIRE:
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, 1911, a blaze at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. in
Manhattan's garment district claimed 146 lives. The exits to the
factory, located on the top three floors of a 10-story building,
were reportedly sealed to keep seamstresses from sneaking out and
union organizers from entering.
</P>
<P>
   When the fire broke out, some workers were trapped and died
while others leaped to their death in an attempt to escape the
blaze. Many of the dead were teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   The Triangle Shirtwaist tragedy mobilized the state Legislature,
which authorized a Factory Investigating Commission to tour
factories statewide and study working conditions. The commission
would later make recommendations that prompted some of the nation's
first worker safety laws. Among those included a ban on child labor
in factories and fire safety measures such as sprinklers in
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We banded ourselves together ... moved by a sense of stricken
guilt, to prevent this kind of disaster from ever happening
again,'' wrote Frances Perkins, a member of the commission before
becoming state labor commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who in 1933 became U.S. labor secretary and the first
female cabinet member, would later say that President Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal was ''based really upon the experiences that
we had in New York state'' and upon the Triangle Shirtwaist blaze.
</P>
<P>
   WORKERS' RIGHTS:
</P>
<P>
   -At a convention organized by various unions in 1865, delegates
- mostly Civil War veterans suffering from work discrimination in
the postwar days - voted to establish a new statewide labor group.
The Workingmen's Assembly of New York State was the first statewide
labor organization in the nation. It preceded the American
Federation of Labor by 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   -In 1938, New York voters overwhelmingly approved a state ''Bill
of Rights'' for workers. Included in this state constitutional
amendment were workers' right to collective bargaining, a guarantee
for a 40-hour work week on public work projects and the right to be
paid prevailing wages.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, a national minimum wage standard and a 40-hour
work week was set with the passage of the federal Fair Labor
Standards Act.
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE:
</P>
<P>
   New York was ahead of the federal government on providing the
unemployed with benefits, passing its insurance program for the
jobless in 1934. Congress adopted the federal Social Security Act a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   WORKERS' COMPENSATION:
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, the New York Legislature passed the first workers'
compensation measure in the nation that would not be declared
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Though unions had
supported a state system to provide insurance, employers and
insurers lobbied successfully for private-sector coverage.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR DEPARTMENT:
</P>
<P>
   New York was the first state in the nation to establish a Labor
Department, in 1901, in a consolidation of the labor statistics
bureau, the factory inspection office and the state arbitration
board.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, a state employment bureau was set up. It would be a
precursor to the Job Service created across the country under the
New Deal.

<HEADLINE> Man presumed dead after boating accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. (AP) - A Connecticut man is presumed dead and
a woman critically injured after two boats collided on Lake George,
deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County Sheriff's deputies said Graziano Sollenne, 34, of
Stratford, Conn., was missing after Friday's accident. His
companion, 30-year-old Pamela Ruggio, also of Stratford, remained
in critical condition Saturday at Albany Medical Center Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies said their boat was struck by another piloted
by 33-year-old Robert Bruno, of Hyde Park, at 5:30 p.m. Bruno was
uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   Divers searched the lake until dark for Sollenne. The search was
continuing today but officials said it would be a recovery, not a
rescue dive.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies said this was the first fatal accident this year on the
lake 53 miles north of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton enjoys post-convention bounce  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Republican
opponent in New York's U.S. Senate race, Rick Lazio, agree on at
least one thing - she enjoyed a post-Democratic National Convention
''bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also both aware that the congressman from Long Island,
battling obscurity and a late start, got no such boost from the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   While national polling immediately after the GOP and Democratic
conventions showed Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al
Gore each enjoyed post-convention bounces, the first public poll
showing one for the first lady came Sunday in the New York Post.
The Zogby International poll had Clinton favored by 47 percent of
voters to 45 percent for Lazio. A month earlier, the Zogby poll had
Lazio leading the first lady, 50 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the Senate candidates, it stemmed from what could be called
the tale of two conventions.
</P>
<P>
   At the GOP gathering in Philadelphia from July 31-Aug. 3, Lazio
appeared for just one day. He didn't speak to the convention. He
attended some fund-raising events that attracted little attention.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clintons, plus daughter Chelsea, also spent just one
day at the Democratic convention itself, it was a far different
experience. The first lady delivered a 15-minute, prime-time speech
just before her husband, the president, offered his political
valedictory as the convention opened on Monday. The couple, plus
daughter Chelsea, hugged and waved to the wildly cheering crowd.
They flew off the next day, leaving the convention to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first lady, the convention experience was a four-day
affair. On the Friday before the convention began, she flew into
Los Angeles on Air Force One and headed straight to a taping of
''The Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno. On Saturday night, the Clinton
family attended a Hollywood tribute to the president that raised
about $1 million for her campaign. On Sunday, there was more hoopla
and, on Monday, she was interviewed by the anchors of the nightly
news shows before taking the convention stage.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder she got a post-convention bounce, Lazio said
during a visit to Lake Placid last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was out there. She was well-televised and this is, as I
understand it, the natural order of things,'' he said. ''A lot of
people just see things and they may react accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign, and some top Lazio aides in private
conversation, say there is another factor at work - the vice
presidential selections.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore picked Sen. Joseph Lieberman of neighboring
Connecticut, an abortion rights-supporting moderate, as his running
mate, Bush tapped former Rep. Dick Cheney, an anti-abortion
conservative from Wyoming, as the GOP's vice presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheney is terrible for us,'' one Lazio aide, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly asked Lieberman, the first Jew ever chosen for a
major party ticket, to campaign with her in New York, a state where
she has had difficulty courting the Jewish vote that can be
critical in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't buy into that,'' Lazio said when asked about the
impact of the vice presidential picks. ''I just think there are
some days you are going to have polls up and some days you are
going to have polls down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col said the Lieberman pick
has helped the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lieberman's helping the ticket, and the ticket is helping the
first lady because what you've got is the Democratic base, in some
cases, coming back home,'' Dal Col told Albany's WROW-AM radio on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It energized their base. You're going to see a bump and she
got it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That can be important in a state where Democrats outnumber
Republicans by a 5-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dal Col predicted that Clinton ''has reached her
high-water mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the latest Zogby poll came out, the Lazio campaign has
unveiled two television ads questioning the first lady's
truthfulness, one starring Sen. John McCain, an aggressive strategy
aimed at blunting the gains scored by Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Building Collapse in India Kills 25  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCKNOW, India (AP) -- An old locomotive shed being demolished at
a railroad station in northern India collapsed on workers Saturday,
killing at least 25 people, senior officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine more people were hurt in the building collapse in
the town of Tundla in Uttar Pradesh state, 105 miles southeast of
New Delhi, said V.K. Mittal, the state's Home Secretary. Three of
the injured were in serious condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The building was an abandoned British-era structure that had
begun to crumble because of heavy rains over the last few weeks,
local authorities said in a report sent to Uttar Pradesh officials.
The concrete roof collapsed as soon as workers began to pull the
building down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bulldozers were being used to demolish the locomotive shed and
the old concrete arcs collapsed on the laborers,'' R.M. Gupta, the
chief controller at the railway station, told The Associated Press
by telephone. ''There were also several bystanders who were
watching and got killed.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday evening, rescue workers had pulled out 23 bodies.
Two bodies were sticking out from the debris of the building but
rescuers were unable to extricate them from the rubble, Mittal
said. Most of the victims were identified as railway employees.
</P>
<P>
   All the workers present at the site during the collapse were
accounted for, Mittal said, making it unlikely that more people
were trapped inside.

<HEADLINE> From Harvard Medical School to jail; doctor charged with murdering parents </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATHAM, N.J. (AP) - It was here, in this ramshackle gray house
with tree brush littering the roof and green plants sprouting from
the gutters, that Idella Kathleen Hagen spent her childhood before
making history as one of the country's first female urologists.
</P>
<P>
   And it was here that the Harvard-educated doctor returned a
month ago to care for her aging parents after abandoning medicine,
enduring two failed marriages and a failed business in the U.S.
Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, police found Hagen, 54, standing disoriented in her
nightgown , authorities say. Ninety-two-year-old Idella and
86-year-old James Hagen were in their pajamas in adjoining twin
beds, smothered to death. Police say their bodies may have lain
there for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen is now charged with murdering her parents.
</P>
<P>
   To those who knew her as a doctor, Hagen was unrecognizable when
she shuffled into a Morris County courtroom last week, listless and
gaunt with stringy, bleached-blond hair and an orange jail
jumpsuit. The Harvard Medical School graduate is on a suicide watch
and only has a ''general understanding'' of the charges against
her, said her lawyer Gerard Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who speculate that an illness like manic depression
could have plagued Hagen say they knew her as a detail-oriented
professional who overcame gender barriers in a tough medical field.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing what Kathy went through,'' said Jean Fourcroy,
who worked with Hagen in the urology department of Rutgers Medical
School in the 1980s. ''She was at the top of her field, and I'm
sure it was very lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen was one of five female urologists in the country when she
became the first woman to head a urology department at an American
medical school in 1982. Before being appointed to Rutgers Medical
School, she graduated in 1971 from Harvard and became the first
woman to specialize in urology at the prestigious Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   She held a residency there for six years, served briefly as a
surgical instructor at Harvard Medical School and eventually
returned to New Jersey and Rutgers Medical School, now called
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourcroy, a urologist who was hired by Hagen and now works for
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Hagen ''was always a
little obsessive-compulsive about details'' as an administrator.
And yet, she said, Hagen was easily overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Details were sometimes her problem,'' Fourcroy said. ''I don't
think for Kathy it was easy to get to the bottom of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, who had divorced first husband Peter Cook in 1979 after
10 years, married William Tyrrell in 1984. Three years later, she
left her job for part-time status to go to the Virgin Islands and
run a hotel there with him, friends said. They returned to New
Jersey after Hurricane Hugo caused the business to go under,
divorcing in 1997, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   While they were in the process of obtaining a divorce, Hagen
filed a lawsuit on his behalf against her old employer, challenging
the decision of two hospitals and a doctor to amputate Tyrrell's
leg after a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought she was sincere,'' said her attorney at the time,
Philip Auerbach. ''I was surprised that she would spend that much
time and effort to help a divorced husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was dismissed after Hagen failed to persuade any of
her old colleagues to testify as expert witnesses on Tyrrell's
behalf, Auerbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourcroy last saw Hagen at the couple's old home in St. Thomas,
about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was bright, alert, figuring out what she was going to do
when she grew up,'' Fourcroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, Fourcroy said Hagen told her she planned to
return to her childhood home, build an apartment in the basement
and take care of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''She adored them,'' Fourcroy said. ''I'm not sure they had much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen's gray Mercedes convertible is still parked outside the
Hagen home, modest by the standards of this affluent suburb 20
miles outside New York City with an overgrown yard.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that Hagen, who is licensed to practice medicine
in New Jersey until 2001, had said recently she was depressed about
her career, her latest divorce, money and her parents' health. The
Hagens were frail and had normal ailments for their age but did not
suffer from a specific terminal disease, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen had lost more than 20 pounds in recent weeks and had slept
for only minutes at a time, Hanlon said. When he interviewed her in
jail, where she remains held on $2.5 million bail, she frequently
lapsed into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was confused and she was distraught,'' Hanlon said. ''She
was getting more and more overwhelmed.''

<HEADLINE> State in 1930: 1,100 must move to make way for progress  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORINTH, N.Y. (AP) - The notice from the state Legislature's new
Hudson River Regulating District was clear: 1,100 people must move
from the only homes their families knew in nearly a dozen small,
century-old logging and farming communities in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Their loss would be one of the most ambitious projects in state
history, the Empire State's contribution to post-World War I
America's era of big ideas and big spending.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1920s, days of planning for the Hoover Dam, creation
of a $300 million series of dams following the Mississippi River's
worst flooding, the opening of the Holland Tunnel connecting
Manhattan and New Jersey, Model 'A's, and Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   The $12 million Sacandaga project would build a massive dam and
flood a 42-square mile area in three counties northwest of Albany
into a reservoir. It aimed mostly to control flooding and provide
hydropower down the Hudson River to serve a power company and
industrialists like Henry Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But George Wilber was no industrialist.
</P>
<P>
   He would stand on the single wooden plank step of his general
store and Post Office at the four corners of Osborn Bridge and see
all the business he needed: across the street, W.E. Flynn's
Blacksmith Shop, which had expanded into a wagon and sleigh-making
shop; a red school house for 20 students; around the corner, a
white, weathered community church; all of it surrounded by rows of
small homes. Most were built by the owners' grandparents who were
the first white settlers of this logging town.
</P>
<P>
   Wilber had no notion of retirement. He planned to work his years
in his own business surrounded by, and helping, his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in his early 60s he faced losing the prestige of
postmaster and proprietor of the town's only general store to start
over as a subsistence farmer on rocky, unfamiliar land.
</P>
<P>
   His older daughter, Ethel, was 32. She had already moved from
Osborn Bridge, first to college then to teach. But her hometown
never left her.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will soon be as completely obliterated as a problem on a
slate across which a wet sponge has been drawn,'' she wrote in the
spring of 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can words express the feeling of utter desolation and
heartache which comes over you when you know that your home, the
place where you were born, brought up and lived has been left for
the last time and you can never return?''
</P>
<P>
   Poor and without lawyers, she and others lamented the loss of
everything for which they could do nothing to stop. Few had wanted
to leave Osborn Bridge, Denton's Corners, Day Center and a
half-dozen more communities in the valley that the Iroquois
centuries before called ''the drowned land'' for its regular local
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   They listened in town meetings to state regulators telling them
that obliterating their small hometowns was necessary to create a
dam that would control the flow the Sacandaga River into the Hudson
River. That would end regular flooding of the Hudson in bustling
mill towns from Glens Falls to Poughkeepsie, including included
Albany where rowboats were sometimes used like gondolas. The last
straw, they said, were the epidemics borne from sewer backups and
standing water after three flash floods in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was drawn from a state commission with members from
Albany, New York City, Syracuse and elsewhere in the state.
Residents soon found it was Henry Ford and other emerging
industrialists who were pushing for the project. Factories lost
production time down the Hudson River to flooding and to power
losses in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Land speculators came first. They began snatching up land before
1924, when residents said insiders in Albany knew the project
discussed since the Civil War was, finally, going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   For many, some say most, the money wasn't nearly enough for what
officials were describing in newspapers as a wild and marshy
''stubble-sprinkled'' valley of farmland ''far from the most
fertile in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Elisha Foote, Sarah Bacon, and nine Meads -
members of the towns' pioneering families who were among the last
of 44 holdouts who refused to willingly sell their land. The Oct.
2, 1928 eviction notice in state Supreme Court decreed ''public use
requires condemnation'' and created a Commissioners of Appraisals
to determine compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, I think,'' said Chief Engineer Edward Sargent in
1927, ''that building the dam itself is the easiest part of the
whole business. Certainly it requires no detective work, and that's
what we're obliged to do frequently in getting some of the land. If
we have reason to believe that the 42nd cousin of the great aunt of
a former owner of a farm is alive, we must find that person before
we get a satisfactory title.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of cold comment that fueled some residents'
anger.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a few things money can't pay for,'' Ethel Wilber
wrote then, ''and your old homestead is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 27, 1930, the massive power of 200 million gallons of
Sacandaga River was, for the first time on purpose, unleashed.

<HEADLINE> Ginseng: the get rich slow crop  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - People are curious about where in the
woods Scott Harris grows his plants. Strangers call up wanting to
come over. ''Old friends'' ask the local postmaster for directions.
</P>
<P>
   They are politely turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fuss? Harris digs up a plant under a stand of
sugar maples and rubs the dirt away to reveal a blanched, wrinkly
root about the size of a pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   It's ginseng, a little plant that can fetch big prices because
of its purported ability to relieve stress, boost stamina and
improve memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ginseng growers like Harris will be digging a lot this month,
the time when ginseng leaves turn yellow and the roots are ready
for harvest. Harris will laboriously gather thousands by hand. His
reward will be roots that can potentially bring $300 or more a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a get-rich-quick root, be warned: ginseng
can take years to grow and it can take hundreds of roots to make a
pound. While money is a draw, some growers stick with it more out
of affection for a plant with an almost mystical cachet.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional Oriental medicine, the root was seen as an
invigorating agent. Native American tribes saw it variously as a
digestive aid, nosebleed cure and an aid to attract women. The
root's popularity has grown in this country with the rise of
holistic medicine and it is available in teas, powders and
capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Harris calls ginseng ''a great, subtle herb.'' But he laughingly
admits being inspired by an old Mother Earth News article with the
come-on: ''Ginseng, the $30,000 a half-acre crop.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought 'I'm going to be rich one of these days,''' he said.
''Well, it still hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The remote hillside near Cooperstown owned by Harris and his
wife Sylva is dappled with American Ginseng. The plant, no taller
than knee-high, is a close relative of the Asian variety. Asian
ginseng is considered more of a stimulant than American ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   A Jesuit priest near Montreal discovered the North American
plant in 1716. A healthy export market to Asia blossomed before
long. Lured by the promise of big money, backwoods entrepreneurs
scoured forests for wild ginseng. No less an American icon than
Daniel Boone got ginseng fever. In 1787, Boone lost a barge loaded
with 12 tons of roots in the Ohio River when it overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Wild ginseng became almost depleted over time because of the
demand. Many states, like New York, now set strict limits under
what conditions the plant may be uprooted on public land.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of ginseng grown in the United States for
export today is cultivated on raised beds under man-made shading
like wood lathing or sheets of polypropylene. Only about 8,000
acres are cultivated in North America. Wisconsin is the largest
producer in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Rarer are growers like Harris, who plant ginseng on shady
hillsides to simulate the plant's wild growing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This is a less efficient growing method, but it produces a root
that looks like the wild variety. Cultivated ginseng roots can
resemble a fat carrot. So-called wild simulated roots are gnarly
and twisty. Harris shows off a series of roots that look like a
chili pepper, a lobster claw and a jester hat.
</P>
<P>
   Wild and wild simulated roots are believed by many connoisseurs
to be more potent than cultivated stock. Prices bear this out - one
New York City trader paid $23 a pound for 5-year-old cultivated
roots last season compared to over $300 for wild simulated.
</P>
<P>
   While the money is good, growing wild simulated ginseng is
demanding. Growers need suitable land, preferably a north-facing
hillside shaded by sugar maples or tulip poplars. Roots aren't
ready for the export market for at least six years. An estimate
published by the National Agroforestry Center projects a net profit
of $16,310 for a wild simulated grower after nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most wild simulated growers keep their day
jobs. The Empire State Ginseng Growers Association has about 140
members, mostly smaller growers. Robert Beyfuss, a ginseng expert
who is a Cornell Cooperative Extension agent in Greene County,
suggests that profits from the plant can be used to pay taxes or
send a child to college.
</P>
<P>
   Ginseng growers are scattered around the eastern United States
and Canada, although exact numbers are hard to come by because many
growers keep a low profile to guard against poachers. For instance,
Harris runs his business out of a Cooperstown post office box, but
grows his ginseng in a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're growing wild ginseng, you're never going to tell
anybody you're growing it,'' Beyfuss said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 49, is a rare grower who relies on ginseng as his main
source of income. Scott started the business in 1993, when Sylva
was recovering from a severe auto accident. He quit his job with a
lumber company to spend more time at home.
</P>
<P>
   His mail- and Internet-order business, Sylvan Botanicals, offers
seeds and roots to other growers, ginseng starter kits and other
herbal products. He does site consultations for would-be growers.
Seven-day work weeks and around-the-clock hours are not uncommon
for Scott, especially this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't get a break now until there's a solid snow on the
ground,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Sylva recalled taking one large order in November
that required raking back snow and thawing out roots on their wood
stove.
</P>
<P>
   Ginseng is pretty much the plant that runs Harris' life. Besides
being a ginseng farmer, dealer and consultant, he is president of
the Empire State Ginseng Growers Association, a ginseng researcher,
a ginseng historian and a ginseng collector. A single shelf in his
office holds ginseng extract, ginseng tea, ginseng cigarettes, a
ginseng pipe, ginseng cologne and bottle of a drink called
''Ginseng-Up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting for ginseng motor oil to come out,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Day kicks off U.S. Senate race that's has been hot for a year </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Republican Bob Franks is set to shout from
the front lawns of New Jersey for the next nine weeks about the
ruinous consequences in store if voters elect the high-spending Jon
Corzine to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether voters unaffiliated with either
political party will heed or even hear him as they huddle in their
living rooms watching a stream of the millionaire Democrat's TV
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for victory Nov. 7 begins in earnest Monday as the
candidates appear at the same time at a Labor Day parade in South
Plainfield and street fair in Rutherford, then head to partisan
picnics - Franks in Flemington and Corzine in Highland Park.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the candidates were scheduled to spend Saturday and
Sunday might say more about the state of this race.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, fresh from a primary spending spree of close to $37
million, planned to break from a summer spent away from the public
eye with two days of beach walks.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways this novice politician and former Wall Street
financier has rewritten the book - at great personal expense - on
how to unify party organizations, how to use TV and how to get out
the vote in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's weakest point, in the view of many, is his inability
to make a reassuring impression during contacts with audiences or
individuals. There are no televisions on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac University political analyst Scott McLean said,
''Corzine is the kind of politician New Jersey has never seen
before, with no experience, no record, and no real charisma skills
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, a four-term congressman, is fresh from a closely fought
GOP primary in which he was also outspent by his chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he is ready to be outspent again but evidently is not
ready enough, spending Saturday and Sunday in private meetings and
on the phone in the grueling work of cajoling more donations.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign staffs and candidates have been at work all summer.
This was the year of the presidential party conventions in
Philadelphia and Los Angeles. But Labor Day signals the beginning
of when voters are expected to start paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Labor Day, somehow somebody fires the starter's pistol and
they decide the race begins,'' said former GOP aide Carl Golden.
</P>
<P>
   Every analyst agreed the key in New Jersey is winning the
independent voters, those who played no role in the hard-fought
primaries but who can be expected to show a strong turnout this
fall because of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about moderate, independent minded voters, and who
does the best job of winning them over, because they will decide an
open-seat election in New Jersey,'' said Jon Shure, a former aide
to Democratic Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ticket splitters. There is a high independent vote
here,'' said Republican lobbyist Tom Wilson, who ran Gov. Christie
Whitman's 1997 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the unpredictability of the New Jersey independents
is made more so by the high concentration and voting habits of
senior citizens. ''There is one thing seniors never do. They don't
stay home. They turn out in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican political analyst Steve Salmore said, ''I think it is
a money race. If Bob has $5 million to put on television, he will
win.''
</P>
<P>
   But to get that sum, he needs to have raised at least $2 million
fairly soon, Salmore said, to then loosen up the checkbooks of
other contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson agreed. ''A lot of this money he is looking at is
probably taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican analysts said a key to remember is that Franks
does not need to match or even come near Corzine's spending level.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't have to match Jon Corzine dollar for dollar,''
Wilson said. ''We have seen lots of candidates with lots of money
and not too much message.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's campaign manager Charlie Smith said his staff will no
longer discuss its finances - which need not be publicly reported
to federal authorities until Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   As for the task of raising money, Smith said, ''It is going
well. Like all aspects of the campaign, it is moving along the
roadmap at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Corzine losing his edge despite the cash gulf. The
Quinnipiac polls of June and July gave him a 20-point lead, but
that fell to eight points by late August. Smith said that has
quickened the pace of fund-raising activity.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has attacked Corzine relentlessly for his high spending,
but Shure said that issue sounds shallow to most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where somebody tries to make an issue of the fact that the
other guy is spending a lot of money, the guying who is making the
issue would rather have the money,'' he said. ''Either you have
money or you try to make money the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Golden - who sparred with Shure during the 1993 campaign
between Whitman and Florio - said Corzine's money could spook
people. ''It is so huge that people just can't grasp that sort of
money,'' he said. ''The audience that seems to be turned off by the
vast, wretched excess is that mass of independent voters out there
who also happen to decide New Jersey elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some expect Corzine's multi-million-dollar air war seen for
eight weeks during the primary against Florio to resume next week.
Spokesman Tom Shea would only say it is coming ''soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salmore found the delay puzzling. ''The only thing he has
going for him is to buy the election, so why isn't he buying it? I
don't understand. Every day he stays off television, Bob has a
better chance,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 8 Die in Colombia Rebel Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A U.S.-made Colombian warplane crashed
Saturday amid heavy fighting between leftist rebels and government
forces, the army said. Eight government soldiers died in the
fighting, while the fate of those aboard the plane was not
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   The C-47 airplane outfitted with .50-caliber machine guns
crashed at about 5 a.m. as it was heading back to base from the
scene of the fighting, a government military officer said on
condition of anonymity. The fighting has been centered at a main
communications complex on Mount Montezuma, 155 miles west of the
capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on how many people were aboard the plane, and
the military officer said it was not clear if there were survivors.
He denied that the plane had been shot down, saying it apparently
crashed because of a ''technical failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The communications complex, where some 60 government soldiers
are based, controls cellular and other telephone links to much of
western Colombia. The rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia had planned to blow up the complex but were repelled by
the government troops, who were reinforced after dark by soldiers
based in the provincial capital of Pereira, said army Gen. Nestor
Ramirez Mejia.
</P>
<P>
   Five government soldiers based at the communications complex
were killed in the fighting there, Ramirez said. In addition,
battalion commander Lt. Col. Jorge Sanchez Rodriguez and two of his
soldiers died when rebels ambushed them as they rushed to reinforce
the complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this moment our forces are collecting the bodies of the
rebel dead,'' Ramirez told a radio interviewer. He gave no figure
on rebel casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The combat, which began at 2 p.m. Friday and lasted far into the
night, was the bloodiest clash since President Clinton visited
Colombia on Wednesday to support President Andres Pastrana's fight
against drug traffickers and leftist rebels who protect drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, Washington is sending
60 combat helicopters to government security forces and elite U.S.
troops are training Colombian anti-narcotics army troops.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group, called by their Spanish acronym, FARC, have
been fighting Colombia's government for decades. They control vast
tracts of southern jungle, financing their insurgency by taxing
peasants who grow drug crops and protecting drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Critics Compare Colombia to Salvador  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When President Clinton said last week that the
$1.3 billion aid package to Colombia will not lead to another
Vietnam, some of the plan's main critics agreed. A better
comparison, they say, is El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the United States helped the El Salvadoran
military, despite its human rights abuses, to fight leftist
guerrillas. In Colombia, where the ''proxy war'' is against drug
traffickers and the leftist forces helping them, Clinton waived
human rights rules to deliver the military aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a Vietnam-style buildup of U.S. combat troops in
Colombia, the United States could aggravate and prolong the
three-decade old Colombian civil war, critics argue.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, it's not another Vietnam, but it's still the wrong thing
to do,'' said Lisa Haugaard, legislative coordinator of the Latin
American Working Group, a coalition of more than 60 organizations
including many that opposed the aid to El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief visit Wednesday to Cartagena, Colombia, Clinton
delivered the aid and said the United States will not get into ''a
shooting war'' in Colombia. ''This is not Vietnam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have long stressed that the United
States won't get dragged into Colombia's civil war. They say U.S.
military aid is intended solely to help Colombia battle drug
traffickers, who account for an estimated 90 percent of the cocaine
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, however, the distinction between fighting drugs and
waging war is murky. Colombian guerrillas finance their insurgency
in part by protecting drug laboratories and fields of coca and
poppy, the raw materials for cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the U.S. aid will pay for helicopters and other
equipment for two Colombian army anti-narcotics battalions to fight
those guerrillas, allowing laboratories to be dismantled and coca
fields to be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military equipment is generally restricted to
counternarcotics operations. But those operations still involve
Colombian soldiers fighting guerrillas, albeit guerrillas
protecting coca and poppy fields.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States also allows Colombia to use its U.S.
counternarcotics equipment to help friendly forces under attack and
endangered by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a very great danger that this kind of thing
can increase little by little, and all of a sudden you will be in
far more deeply than you ever wished to be,'' said Robert White, a
former ambassador to El Salvador and now president of the Center
for International Policy.
</P>
<P>
   White said this could lead to a situation such as that in El
Salvador, where U.S. involvement ''postponed peace in Central
America and divided and angered a lot of people at home.'' About
76,000 people were killed in El Salvador before a January 1992
agreement ended the 12-year war.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials did not respond to a request for
comment on parallels between Colombia and El Salvador. But in an
interview shortly before Clinton's trip, a senior State Department
official said the administration's interest in fighting the
insurgency is limited strictly to the link between guerrillas and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who compare Colombia to El Salvador acknowledge the
analogy has its limits. Colombia has a democratically elected
government; El Salvador was under military rule when the guerrilla
war began, and successive governments had strong military ties.
</P>
<P>
   And while Salvadoran death squads operated directly from
military and police units, most of Colombia's massacres are
committed by paramilitary forces linked to, but more independent
of, the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of the Salvadoran conflict occurred during the
Cold War years, when the United States worried about Soviet
encroachment in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Arnson, a Latin America specialist in the Washington's
Woodrow Wilson Center, said she sees similarities in how U.S.
security concerns -- then the Cold War, now the drug war -- have been
used by U.S. government to subordinate human rights problems.
</P>
<P>
   A week before he visited Colombia, Clinton cited national
security grounds in waiving human rights conditions that could have
blocked the aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message that they (the Colombian Army) receive is the same
one that the Salvadoran army received for a decade,'' she said,
''which is that we will support no matter what because your fight
is our fight and what you're doing is in the national security
interest of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Salem County, where growth is slow, and that's OK  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALDINE, N.J. (AP) - This tiny town tucked in the middle of Salem
County has its rush hour, just like everywhere else these days.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning at 9:30, Don and Dale Smith's 60 cows trudge from
the barn where they've been milked, down the road, through the
blinking light, past the church and cemetery, to their pasture.
Every evening at 5:30 they reverse the route.
</P>
<P>
   Cars just have to wait for the cows, and county residents know
to take another road if they're going to be passing through Aldine
at milking time.
</P>
<P>
   Chickens outnumber people, 10-1, in this tranquil, green county
at the southwest corner of the Garden State, loaded with dairy
farms and soybean, corn and hay fields.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with the people here. Census figures released
last week show that Salem County's population in 1999 was 63,534.
That was 848 fewer people, or 1.3 percent less, than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   County officials point out that those numbers are estimates and
say they're waiting for the 2000 census figures to see what the
real population is. Nonetheless, while they don't want a mass
exodus, they aren't looking for uncontrolled growth either.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of careful planning by municipal and county
officials, dedication by third- and fourth-generation farmers and a
lack of water and sewer hookups required for building mean the
county won't experience the population boom going on in the rest of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's population increased by 386,000 people, or 5
percent, in the past decade, census figures show. In Hunterdon and
Somerset counties alone, where fields and farms are being converted
quickly into suburbs, a total of 63,000 new residents arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Salem was the only rural county inoculated against the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not interested in abnormal residential growth,'' County
Freeholder John A. Kugler said in an interview last week. ''We
don't see that as a benefit to the quality of life we currently
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   On a series of Saturday mornings, officials from the county and
its 15 municipalities met to come up with a growth strategy. The
plan calls for new development to be located along the Route
295-Delaware River corridor, and in Woodstown, about 10 miles
inland.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's about 10 percent of the county,'' Kugler said. ''The
other 90 percent we look at to preserve the integrity of the
farmland.''
</P>
<P>
   When the county presented its plan to the state ''they endorsed
it and wished the other counties in New Jersey would develop the
same sort of strategy,'' Kugler said.
</P>
<P>
   Salem County has preserved more than 10,000 acres of open space
and plans to save more. Farmers are behind a lot of that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our farming community is very stable and also very protective
of its land,'' said Patricia Knobloch, county economic development
director. ''They don't make the land available for housing
development. If you cannot buy the land, you cannot build.''
</P>
<P>
   The county has a 98-percent occupancy rate, ''which means it's
tough to find a place to live unless you build new,'' said Rita
Shade Simpson, clerk of the Freeholder Board, ''and we have a
stable agricultural community, so it's hard to find land to build
on. That farming community is extraordinarily supportive of
farmland preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big reason that developers aren't beating a path to the
county is the lack of infrastructure. Water and sewer service is
available only along the river in Penns Grove and Carneys Point and
inland in Woodstown.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the rest of the homes have septic systems and well
water,'' Kugler said. ''It's not very profitable for developers to
come in unless that (infrastructure) is available.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 147 new housing units were authorized to be built in the
county in 1999. By comparison, Ocean County was given authorization
for 4,192 housing units and Middlesex County got approval for
3,102, state statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The county also doesn't want a lot of residential construction
because that drives up its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Housing is not a win-win from a ratable standpoint,'' Shade
Simpson said. ''It costs more to maintain a home than it does to
maintain services to a farm. As soon as you have a home with more
than one child in it you're at a net loss in that municipality,
trying to provide funds for schools or garbage collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The small population does have downsides. Last year, St. James
High School in Carneys Point closed due to declining enrollment and
budget problems. Two Catholic elementary schools in Salem County
and one in neighboring Gloucester County also closed. St. James
will open this year as a regional grammar school for students from
those schools.
</P>
<P>
   The county is not entirely rural. It is home to Mannington
Mills, the second-largest floor-covering manufacturer in the world,
and to chemical, pharmaceutical and glass plants, three nuclear
generating stations and PSE&AMP;G and Conectiv energy company
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   While county officials aren't particularly interested in
residential development, they are trying to attract businesses,
especially light industry.
</P>
<P>
   One major selling point is the location - 15 minutes from
Wilmington, Del., 20 minutes from southeastern Pennsylvania and a
half-hour from Philadelphia. It is the entranceway to New Jersey
from the Delaware Memorial Bridge, or as officials here like to
call it, ''the gateway to the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   A corporate park is planned in Carneys Point next to a Conectiv
office building and another corporate center is in the works in
conjunction with PSE&AMP;G in Pedricktown.
</P>
<P>
   James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning
and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said one reason Salem
County has lost residents is the lack of jobs associated with the
''new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing a lot of young people moving out of the county,
basically because of the economy. They want to be where new jobs
are,'' he said, ''knowledge-based jobs linked to the high-tech part
of the economy, information-processing and financial sector.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people here aren't in a rush to keep the fast pace of
the rest of the state. They rather like the muskrat dinners at
churches and VFWs, the annual sheep and wool festival at the
fairgrounds and the candlelight Christmas tours in Woodstown.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kugler: ''We're just a bunch of hardworking people who
enjoy a quality of life that is unequal to most any other county in
New Jersey.''

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--Mosquito Lab  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Here are some ways of reducing your risk of becoming
infected
with the West Nile virus.
<TEXT>
<P>
   -Stay indoors at dawn, dusk, and in the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   -Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants whenever you are
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   -Apply insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin. An effective
repellent will contain 35% DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). DEET
in higher concentrations provides no additional protection.
</P>
<P>
   -Spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin or DEET,
as mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing.
</P>
<P>
   -Whenever you use an insecticide or insect repellent, be sure to
read and follow the manufacturer's directions for use, as printed
on the product.

<HEADLINE> Army germ warfare experts drafted to battle West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) - In a sealed laboratory, 10 doors removed
from the outside world, scrub-suited Army scientists are probing
the mysteries of mosquitoes that spread the West Nile fever virus.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the U.S. outbreak of West Nile, which has killed
seven people and sickened scores more since last year, depends
partly on civilian entomologist Michael Turell and his six-person
team at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Disease at Fort Detrick.
</P>
<P>
   Their subjects include Aedes japonicus, an Asian mosquito
species relatively new to this country that appears especially
adept at transmitting the virus. Although the main culprits so far
have been common backyard mosquitoes in the Culex family,
scientists say japonicus may be more capable of carrying the virus
far from the New York City area, where all the deaths have
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question it is going to be a player,'' Turell
said. ''But is its role going to be the 10th most important
mosquito or the second most important mosquito? That we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does it breed? When does it feed? What does it bite? Those
are the questions the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention wants answered.
</P>
<P>
   The agency asked the Army to join the West Nile fight shortly
after the virus appeared for the first time in the Western
Hemisphere last September, said Stephen Ostroff, West Nile
coordinator at the CDC. Scientists at Fort Detrick develop defenses
to biological weapons, but they also have battled outbreaks of
Ebola and other exotic diseases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The role that they are playing is a very important one,''
Ostroff said. The more the CDC knows about the mosquitoes that
transmit the virus, the better it can advise the public on how to
reduce their risk of infection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Rutgers and Fordham universities also are studying
links between West Nile and mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers call the mosquitoes ''vectors'' - organisms that
transmit the virus by feeding on infected animals, especially
crows, and then biting uninfected ones, such as humans. Some
mosquito species are more competent vectors than others, and Turell
has found that Aedes japonicus is among the best.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory tests, japonicus has been four to five times more
effective than Culex pipiens in transmitting West Nile from
infected chickens to virus-free chickens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't necessarily mean japonicus is a competent vector in
the wild. Scientists know it breeds in old tires, which puts it
close to people, and that it feeds in the daytime. But they don't
know if it feeds in the evening, when crows are roosting, or even
if it feeds much on birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem of trying to find a fed mosquito in the middle of
a forest is extremely difficult,'' Turell said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, researchers found the West Nile virus in a few
swarms of japonicus mosquitoes in Westchester, N.Y., where one of
the West Nile deaths occurred. The virus also has been found in at
least five other mosquito species.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are intrigued by findings that japonicus and West
Nile share much of the same U.S. territory. In the past two years,
they have found the mosquitoes for the first time in most of the
seven states - Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island - where infected birds have
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a pretty rapid spread for a mosquito in only two
breeding seasons,'' Ostroff said. ''If it continues to move at the
pace it appears to have been moving, the potential to carry the
virus farther afield is a cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are less concerned, though, about japonicus' ability
to transmit the virus to humans - mainly because the evidence is
scanty.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time West Nile and japonicus have ever been
in the same place at the same time,'' Turell said. He said the
mosquito isn't found in Romania or southwestern Russia, the sites
of other recent West Nile outbreaks. And in the Far East, where
japonicus is common, West Nile fever is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff said he was gratified that while the virus appears to be
spreading among wild birds and insects, there has not been a rapid
increase in human infections. Seven cases of human infection have
been reported so far this year - six in New York and one in New
Jersey - with no deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always acknowledged there isn't any way to prevent 100
percent of human illness, but what we could do is work to minimize
the amount of human illness that we would see,'' Ostroff said.
''I'd like to believe we're actually accomplishing some of that.''

<HEADLINE> UN Summit Promises Historic Events  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Take over 150 world leaders -- dictators
and democrats, the famous and unknown. Put them together at the
United Nations for three days. The result is likely to be one of
the most intense political moments in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   All the world's problems are going to be thrown on the table for
brief discussion at the U.N. Millennium Summit, which runs from
Wednesday through Friday at the world body's New York headquarters.
And there are plenty of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mideast peace is at a critical point. Africa is in turmoil, with
Congo's peace unraveling, the Sierra Leone government fighting
rebels and the United Nations about to send peacekeepers to monitor
a cease-fire on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Afghanistan is still engulfed in civil war and East
Timor is still threatened by pro-Indonesian militias intent on
undermining its move toward independence. In Europe, Serbia's
Kosovo province is beset by continuing violence between the ethnic
Albanian majority and the Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the global and regional issues -- the billions of
people living in poverty, the lack of human rights in many
countries, the growing HIV/AIDS crisis and the impact of
globalization and information technology, which is creating an
ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   With official five-minute speeches, closed-door informal
roundtables, news conferences, bilateral meetings and a dizzying
array of social events, the largest-ever gathering of world leaders
is shaping up as a mammoth talkathon.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with U.N. General Assembly President Theo-Ben
Gurirab, the Namibian foreign minister and former guerrilla leader
who is co-chairing the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing wrong with talking,'' he said in an
interview. ''Unless people talk, you will not know what is on their
minds and in their hearts. And particularly when world leaders --
who are responsible for lives of people, who are responsible for
security and peace in the world -- meet, not anywhere else but in
the United Nations, it is an important event.''
</P>
<P>
   What U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan wants from all, big and
small, is commitment. He invited the heads of state and government
to come to the United Nations to chart a new course for the
55-year-old world body and for the globe itself at the start of the
third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to be seen -- and heard -- is going to be immense.
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard to top Cuban leader Fidel Castro, nemesis of the
United States but widely admired in the Third World, who is
expected to take center stage in the media spotlight. Not far from
that spotlight will be Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, prodded along by President
Clinton, who is hoping for a three-way meeting to get peace talks
on track.
</P>
<P>
   Just a rung below are a host of other big names. Russian
President Vladimir Putin is making his first trip to the United
States since taking office. Chinese President Jiang Zemin is likely
to have to defend himself against hundreds of protesters opposed to
Beijing's policies on human rights. Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami is also expected to be targeted by anti-government
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of guessing about possible meetings of longtime
enemies. Gurirab said he hopes Castro and Clinton will have
face-to-face talks, and he offered to provide a room. Speculation
about Clinton ''bumping into'' Khatami in a carefully choreographed
accident are rife. And many wonder if the Congo combatants and the
Ethiopians and Eritreans may find a quiet moment to talk.
</P>
<P>
   In this bubbling political cauldron, leaders from small, poor
and little countries probably won't be able to compete for media
air time. Nonetheless, Gurirab said, they and the leaders
representing rich, powerful countries will be talking with each
other, not at one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is an achievement in itself,'' he said. ''By coming
together they would, as we say at home, sit under the same tree and
dream together about our common future. That's a good idea.''

<HEADLINE> Polls: Milosevic Faces Rejection  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CVETOJEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Boza Markovic counts off
Yugoslavia's wars on his tobacco-stained fingers: first Slovenia,
then Croatia, then Bosnia and finally, worst of all, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now what?'' the 80-year old villager asks as he folds his
gnarled hand into a fist. ''Is there anything else to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Serbs are thinking about Yugoslavia's decade of
losses as they near Sept. 24 elections that are increasingly seen
as a referendum on the rule of Slobodan Milosevic. For the first
time since coming to power in 1990, pollsters insist, the Yugoslav
strongman may actually face the unthinkable: rejection by the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he could really lose this time,'' said Bratislav
Grubacic, a Belgrade political analyst who edits the influential
newsletter V.I.P. Daily News Report.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts here suggest Milosevic would be highly unlikely to
abide by such a result, given his record of tampering with earlier
ballots. If so, the question then would be whether he would seize
another term by force rather than accept the diminished status of
private citizen wanted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's problem is his challenger. The man who leads in
every independent poll is Vojislav Kostunica, 56, a soft-spoken law
professor known for his honesty and modest lifestyle. To a nation
that feels badly let down by its political class, Kostunica's
ordinariness and his artlessness as a politician are what make him
so popular.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll, by the prominent Institute for Social
Sciences, gave Kostunica 35 percent of the vote to Milosevic's 23
percent -- a big lead, though not enough to avoid a runoff ballot.
Two other candidates trail far behind with about 5 percent each,
with the remainder undecided. The poll gave no margin of error or
indication of how many people were questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in villages like Cvetojevac, 55 miles south of the
capital, Belgrade, Serbs are convinced that Milosevic will not go
down without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic's neighbor, Milivoje Nikolic, 89, comes from the same
pool of rural supporters that kept the autocratic ruler in office
year after year. Nikolic fought during World War II, endured
hardship under communism, and fears instability if there is a
change in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will do anything he can to stay in power,'' Nikolic said of
the man who clawed his way up from low-level communist-era
apparatchik to president of post-Cold War Yugoslavia. ''He may try
to provoke a war if he realizes he will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nikolic has had enough. In a garden overgrown with
flowers wilting in the late summer heat, he and his family
reminisce about the young people who have left the countryside,
unable to find work in an economy where unemployment is measured by
independent economists at 50 percent. They have seen inflation
erode pensions: An engineer's monthly 156 dinars, $13, now buy only
a few packs of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual income in Yugoslavia in 1990 was about
$3,250. A decade later it is $626.
</P>
<P>
   In cities scarred by last year's NATO bombing, where U.N.
sanctions have depleted the stores, life revolves around waiting in
line, starting at dawn when retirees gather outside grocery stores
to grab the cheapest cartons of milk. The longest lines are for
visas to leave the country. Hustlers spend the night outside
embassies and next morning sell their places in line for 30 German
marks ($15).
</P>
<P>
   Analysts suggest that if elections were free and fair, Milosevic
would face a runoff at the very least. Four candidates are seeking
the presidency, including a far-right candidate seen as siphoning
off support from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In timing the election for the fall, Milosevic appears to have
miscalculated. Though he began preparations months ago by shutting
down key independent media outlets, arresting his critics and
intimidating dissidents, he appears to have been caught off-balance
by the opposition's decision to nominate Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other opposition candidates photographed kissing the hand
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Kostunica's clear
condemnation of the 78-day NATO bombing campaign makes him
acceptable to people who feel betrayed by the West.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat lugubrious academic drives around in a small car
while other party leaders zip along in Mercedes-Benzes. He actually
campaigns, going door-to-door and listening to people's views -- a
concept unheard of in a country where the president is usually seen
only on television.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica also earns points for integrity, having never been
tainted by association with the regime or the communists. His
campaign slogan boasts that he is the only candidate that ''can
look you in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milosevic isn't acting too concerned. Though the
government has responded with campaigns to build apartment
buildings for young families, pay pensions and rebuild bridges
crushed by NATO bombers, Milosevic himself apparently sees little
need to attend rallies or present new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of a key Danube bridge destroyed by NATO,
tentatively slated for Sept. 15, is expected to be the only moment
he even appears in public before the election. It will be the high
point of a campaign featuring posters saying ''Sloba, Yes!'' -- a
play on words that also means ''freedom'' in Serbian. The type
appears over a man in a crowd whose hands are clasped, almost in
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's posters are guarded night and day by police and
hired muscle. The opposition's posters have been systematically
defaced, as have those of a group of independent monitors financed
by non-governmental agencies who will try to make sure the ballot
is fair.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much chance of fairness, however, Grubacic says. He
believes Milosevic can snatch as many as a million votes -- out of a
potential pool of about 6 million in Serbia proper -- in part by
inflating the number of Kosovo Serb refugees and having them vote
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Grubacic is not alone in the assessment that Milosevic will
cheat because he knows he probably cannot win fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksa Djilas, a commentator with intimate knowledge of the
regime, has said that the vote will probably go to a second round
and that even far-right voters will opt for Kostunica. Another
noted academic, Dragan Popadic of the University of Belgrade,
predicted that a vote pushing Milosevic out would prompt him to
lash out with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Voters like Markovic know that whatever the polls say, nothing
is guaranteed. While the retiree in Cvetojevac loudly criticizes
the failures of the last years, he holds his tongue when asked whom
he will vote for. He still has bread on his table. Things could get
worse.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Ex-Spies Get Hero Welcome  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans
poured into the streets Saturday to welcome 63 former communist
spies and guerillas -- some on stretchers and in wheelchairs --
returning home after decades in South Korean prisons.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea repatriated the aging ex-convicts across the heavily
armed border Saturday in another step toward rapprochement with the
communist North. Hours later in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang, huge crowds standing in neat lines waved red flags and
pink paper flowers as buses carrying the returning ex-spies drove
through the city's main boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   The scene played out on Northern TV footage monitored in Seoul,
the South's capital. Pyongyang streets ''turned into a veritable
sea of flowers,'' said the North's official foreign news outlet,
KCNA.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the northern side, the former spies had tearful reunions
with family members, KCNA said. Kim Jong Il sent his defense
minister, Kim Il Chol, to greet them. A brass band played
revolutionary songs.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the convicted spies is a key part of an accord
reached at a historic summit in June. At that meeting, the leaders
of the two Koreas agreed to work together for reconciliation and
reunification after decades of hostility.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoners, ranging in age from 66 to 90, refused to
renounce their communist ideology during an average of 36&AMP;frac12; years in
South Korean prisons. Some weeping, they crossed the border earlier
Saturday at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the Demilitarized
Zone, a buffer area between the two countries. Five were taken away
by ambulance after crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean ex-spies had been living as free men after
serving prison terms ranging from 13 years to 45 years, but they
had been barred from leaving the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I am going on a picnic,'' said Kim In Su, 77, who
spent 36 years in prison. ''When I left the North, my son was six
years old. Now, he is 46.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ex-spies -- Kim Suk Hyong, 87, who spent 30 years in
prison -- has a wife and six children in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never given up my confidence that I will eventually
return home,'' he said Saturday, shortly before crossing the border
in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, which badly needs a boost to the morale of its
hunger-stricken people, used the return of ''men of faith and
indomitable fighters'' to urge loyalty to its totalitarian leader,
Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Their repatriation ''is a shining fruition of the love,
comradely sense of obligation and immense magnanimity shown by the
Great Leader Kim Jong Il for revolutionary soldiers,'' said Rodong
Sinmun, the official daily of the North's ruling Workers' Party of
Korea. ''He has spared no efforts to bring them under his loving
care and bestow all happiness and honor upon them.''
</P>
<P>
   North Koreans cheered the former spies' motorcade along the
124-mile route from Panmunjom to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Senior military and party officials hugged the tearful ex-spies
in Pyongyang's main plaza. They later paid tribute to Kim Jong Il's
late father, longtime President Kim Il Sung, who is lying in state
in a mammoth memorial. The two Kims are revered as demigods in the
isolated North.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million North Koreans fled to South Korea before or
during the 1950-53 Korean War, and thousand of South Koreans are
believed to have gone to the North voluntarily or after being
drafted into the North's army. The two Koreas are separated by a
heavily militarized border, and people on one side have been unable
to contact those on the other for almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The mass spy repatriation is part of thawing relations following
the June summit, the first ever between the Korean states. Since
the summit, the two Koreas have reopened dialogue between their
governments and allowed reunions of some families separated since
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Some South Koreans objected to the spy repatriation, saying
their government should have demanded the return of hundreds of
their citizens believed to be held against their will in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ''Return kidnapped people!'' 150 people, including eight
opposition legislators, shouted as two buses carrying the North
Koreans slowed to cross a bridge near the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Seoul government says 454 South Koreans, mostly fishermen,
have been forcibly taken by the North. About 300 Southern soldiers
captured during the Korean War are also believed to be held there.
Pyongyang has denied such allegations in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul said Saturday that five South Korean prisoners of war, a
South Korean fisherman and his North Korean wife and son recently
arrived in the South through an unidentified third country after
escaping North Korea. The POWs toiled at mines in the North, the
South's government said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposition Activists Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Police arrested 19 opposition
activists Saturday, most of them at a fund-raiser organized to help
a sick child, and beat some of them, said an associate of those
detained.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 members and supporters of the popular student group
Otpor, known for its struggle against President Slobodan Milosevic,
were holding an open-air auction of used toys in the center of
Serbia's largest northern town, Novi Sad, when the police rounded
them up and took 14 into custody, the activist said. Five were
detained later.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Otpor activists have been harassed by the police in
recent months amid rising tensions between Milosevic's regime and
pro-democracy groups in Serbia, which is the larger of the two
Yugoslav republics and serves as Milosevic's power base.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor, or Resistance, supports key opposition parties in Serbia
that have joined forces ahead of the Sept. 24 Yugoslav presidential
and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event was organized to raise funds for a 12-year old
suffering for leukemia who needs costly treatment abroad because
local medical help is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as we began the auction, the policemen showed up and
asked everybody to show identity cards, then forced 14 people into
police vans ... especially those who wore T-shirts with the
clenched fist,'' the group's emblem, activist Bora Lazukic told a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The police also confiscated the donated toys, then moved to the
nearby office of Otpor and seized an unspecified amount of
leaflets, stickers and other material.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested another five activists during the office search,
which, according to Otpor, was done without a warrant. Several were
beaten, Lazukic said.
</P>
<P>
   Police declined comment. There was no information on whether
charges had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the activists were released by late afternoon,
but a crowd formed in front of the police station, ''protesting the
politically motivated harassment,'' Lazukic said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Suu Kyi Stings Junta Again  </HEADLINE>
By GRANT PECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Sleeping in a car in the middle of a
muddy, mosquito-infested field may not seem like a compelling
political tactic, but for Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, it might just have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Like the mythic mouse that strikes terror in the mighty
elephant, the diminutive opposition leader has shown again that she
can face down Myanmar's military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, two other senior members of her National League for
Democracy and 12 members of the party's youth wing were stopped by
security forces in Dala, a suburb of the capital, Yangon, on Aug.
24 while en route to do party organizational work in the
countryside. Refusing government requests to return to Yangon and
blocked from proceeding, they set up a makeshift camp around their
two vehicles and stayed put for nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's party had announced they would not voluntarily return
home until they were allowed to go to their original destination 30
miles south of the capital. The standoff finally ended Friday night
when she and her party were forcibly returned to the capital by
riot police, said her deputy, Tin Oo.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement titled ''Dala incident ends happily,'' the
government said Suu Kyi and her party ''arrived home safe and
sound'' Saturday morning after being driven back to Yangon in a
government motorcade. Senior NLD members' home telephones were not
operating Saturday, and at least one party leader, Tin Oo, was
being held under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the final outcome, analysts have suggested that Suu
Kyi's tactic bested her longtime military nemeses.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had let her go and do party work, it would have proven
that she and the party have beaten the military, and given her
party a second wind,'' says Josef Silverstein, a Myanmar expert at
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. ''On the other hand, by
stopping and holding her a prisoner, they made a non-event a world
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, 55, has shown her mettle time and again since taking up
the democracy struggle in this southeast Asian nation in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent much of her life abroad, she returned to her
homeland to take care of her ailing mother just as mass
demonstrations were breaking out against 25 years of military rule.
She was quickly thrust into a leadership role, mainly because she
is the daughter of martyred independence leader Gen. Aung Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the reigns, she rode out the military's bloody
suppression of street demonstrations to help found the National
League for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, tireless and outspoken, her popularity threatened
the country's new set of military rulers. In 1989, detained on
trumped-up national security charges, she was put under house
arrest. She was not released until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even in isolation, her principled defiance gained her fame and
honor -- most notably the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of her democracy movement were less agreeable. The
military refused to allow parliament to convene after her party won
a landslide victory in a 1990 general election, and afterward party
members were subjected to a nearly constant campaign of harassment
and arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In a cruel test of her commitment, the government in early 1999
refused to grant her husband, British academic Michael Aris, a visa
to visit her, even though he was dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The government suggested instead that she go to her spouse's
side in Britain, an offer Suu Kyi regarded as a one-way ticket to
exile. She stayed, and her husband died in March of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's junta has long been widely condemned for its poor
human rights record and failure to restore democracy, but this is a
particularly inopportune time for a new run-in with Suu Kyi,
Silverstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- received an
unprecedented condemnation from the International Labor
Organization for its use of forced labor. It was given until
November to clean up its act or face serious sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the U.N. General Assembly opens its high profile
Millennium session this month, and reports from the U.N.
secretary-general's special envoy to Myanmar and the U.N. Human
Rights Commission are unlikely to paint the junta in a favorable
light.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore spelled it out Thursday: ''Every day that
the Burmese authorities restrain Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's
isolation from the international community deepens.''
</P>
<P>
   The junta itself has indirectly conceded the point, accusing Suu
Kyi of staging the incident to gain attention abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a careful, insincere, premeditated move by Aung San
Suu Kyi to attract international attention and to coincide with the
upcoming (U.N.) Millennium Summit and to tarnish the image of the
government,'' Foreign Minister Win Aung said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What she would like to see is for us to arrest her and put her
into prison,'' he told reporters in Yangon. ''She is provoking the
government to take severe action against her so that she can have
political upper hand.''

<HEADLINE> At least 17 vehicles crash on Pa. Turnpike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW STANTON, Pa. (AP) - A chain-reaction crash involving at
least 17 vehicles including a tractor-trailer closed the
Pennsylvania Turnpike for nearly two hours in both directions
Friday in Westmoreland County.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen people were injured in the noontime crash
near mile marker 85, in a construction zone near the Donegal and
New Stanton exits, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic backed up for 10 miles in both directions after police
closed both sides of the highway to make way for emergency crews.
</P>
<P>
   State police planned to file charges against a New Jersey truck
driver who allegedly ignored signs warning motorists about an
earlier accident that had tied up traffic in the construction zone.
</P>
<P>
   The trucker, Scott Warchol, 24, of Burlington City, N.J., said
he had just climbed a short hill in the westbound lanes when he
rounded a curve and saw ''nothing but bumpers.'' Warchol said he
nudged the left side of his rig into the concrete median to slow
down as much as possible before plowing into a line of cars that
had stopped for the earlier accident, causing the chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I was going to hit them, but I wanted to slow down as
much as possible before I did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State police and turnpike officials said Warchol ignored a
stopped state police car with flashing lights, a warning on an
electronic message board and flares as he entered the curve. The
posted speed limit was 55 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But Warchol said he did not see any signs. He said he was
driving about 50 mph and had ''no warning, none'' that traffic was
stopped ahead of him. ''There were no flares, no signs, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the traffic jam had been about 50 feet shorter, I'd have
been able to steer the truck into a pulloff area and missed
everyone. The last thing I wanted to do was hit those cars. But I
had nowhere to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people were taken to hospitals. At least 15 others were
treated at the scene, according to state police.
</P>
<P>
   Warchol's rig slammed into the driver's side of the car ahead,
pinning a woman inside for 45 minutes. The woman, Delia L. Veschi,
21, of East Deer, was listed in fair condition at UPMC
Presbyterian.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are rebuilding nine miles of the turnpike east of New
Stanton. Score of mostly minor accidents have resulted, and traffic
is frequently tied up in the area because of recurring pavement
problems in the temporary lanes.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Colombia Warplane Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A U.S.-made Colombian warplane crashed
Saturday amid heavy fighting between leftist rebels and government
forces, killing seven airmen, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least eight government soldiers died in the
ground combat at a communications complex on Mount Montezuma, 155
miles west of the capital, Bogota. The clash was the bloodiest
since President Clinton visited Colombia on Wednesday to support
President Andres Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers and
leftist rebels who protect drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The AC-47 Vietnam-era gunship outfitted with .50-caliber machine
guns crashed into an 11,200-foot-high mountain at about 5 a.m. as
it returned to base from the fighting, the Colombian air force said
in a communique. There were no survivors, and all those aboard were
Colombian, the air force said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Gen. Jairo Garcia insisted the plane was not shot
down. He said poor visibility may have been a factor, because the
crash happened just before dawn in cloudy weather.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which was used extensively by U.S. forces during the
Vietnam war and was known as ''Puff the Magic Dragon,'' had been
providing fire support for the ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has equipped many Colombian warplanes with
night-vision goggles and Forward-Looking Infrared Sensors, or
FLIRS, and has trained pilots to fly in the dark. U.S. Embassy
officials were not immediately available to comment on whether the
crashed AC-47 was one of those planes or whether the pilots had
been U.S.-trained.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began Friday afternoon at the communications
complex, which controls cellular and other telephone links to much
of western Colombia. Some 60 government soldiers are based there.
Hundreds of rebels attacked the complex, planning to blow it up,
but they were repelled by the government forces and reinforcements
from the provincial capital of Pereira, said army Gen. Nestor
Ramirez Mejia.
</P>
<P>
   Five government soldiers based at the communications complex
were killed in the fighting there, Ramirez said. In addition,
battalion commander Lt. Col. Jorge Sanchez Rodriguez and two of his
soldiers died when rebels ambushed them as they rushed to reinforce
the complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this moment our forces are collecting the bodies of the
rebel dead,'' Ramirez told a radio interviewer. He gave no figure
on rebel casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group, called by their Spanish acronym, FARC, have
been fighting Colombia's government for decades. They control vast
tracts of southern jungle, financing their insurgency by taxing
peasants who grow drug crops and protecting drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, Washington is sending
60 combat helicopters to government security forces and elite U.S.
troops are training Colombian anti-narcotics army troops.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Makes Suu Kyi End Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Myanmar security forces who forced
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to end a nine-day roadside
standoff Saturday also raided her political party's headquarters,
seizing documents and sealing the offices, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-pronged crackdown was the latest development in more
than a week of tension between Nobel laureate Suu Kyi and the
iron-fisted military government of this southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   The situation began Aug. 24, when Suu Kyi and other members of
her National League for Democracy tried to leave the capital,
Yangon, for political organizing and were stopped by authorities in
Dala, a Yangon suburb. They refused to go back home, instead
camping out in two vehicles and waiting as international criticism
of Myanmar's government mounted.
</P>
<P>
   But around midnight, nearly 200 riot police raided the roadside
convoy and forced Suu Kyi to return to Yangon, party officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government confirmed the end to the standoff, saying Suu Kyi
and her colleagues ''arrived home safe and sound'' Saturday
morning. At least one senior NLD leader reported being under house
arrest after he was returned to his home.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, party sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said, NLD headquarters were raided and several documents
were seized by police. Police officers blocked the gate of the
party headquarters, located at the foot of Yangon's famed Shwedagon
Pagoda.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats near the headquarters said they saw some security
personnel inside, but they could not confirm that the building had
been raided.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, British diplomats were stopped by security
officers when they tried to visit the homes of Suu Kyi and NLD
deputy leader Tin Oo, an embassy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly angry Tin Oo said Suu Kyi and the others involved in
the standoff had been brought back to the capital in separate
police cars. He said he believed Suu Kyi was taken to her house.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the NLD would issue a statement, he asked: ''How
can I issue any statement when I can't leave my house?''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic officials said other senior NLD leaders also were
being stopped from leaving their homes, but that could not be
confirmed. Telephones of senior NLD members were not operating
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The government's statement confirming the end of the standoff
was titled ''Dala incident ends happily.'' It said that at 1:30
a.m. Saturday, Suu Kyi and her party were ''escorted back to their
residences in Yangon in a motorcade facilitated by the government
for their safe and convenient return.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the government move, Foreign Minister Win Aung had
said Suu Kyi was trying to attract international attention by
provoking authorities into arresting her. But the government said
it took action Saturday because of concerns about monsoon season
rains and Suu Kyi's personal safety, as well as complaints by her
party about living conditions at the stalled convoy.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi is the daughter of the country's late independence
leader, Gen. Aung San. She has led the opposition movement in
Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1988, when the military crushed
mass pro-democracy demonstrations and asserted its authoritarian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The government held a general election in 1990 but refused to
allow parliament to convene after the NLD won a landslide victory.
Since then, her party members have suffered arrest and harassment
from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her nonviolent
political activities but was held under house arrest from 1989 to
1995. She has repeatedly been rebuffed in attempts to hold a
dialogue with Myanmar's rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent standoff was triggered when Suu Kyi made her
first attempt to travel outside the capital since two years ago. On
her last try, in August 1998, she stayed in her vehicle for 13 days
before returning home for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi has called for foreign sanctions against Myanmar's
military regime and a tourist boycott as a way of pressuring the
government to improve human rights conditions and restore
democracy.

<HEADLINE> Kids' Show Features Latino Family  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When he set about inventing ''The Brothers
Garcia,'' Jeff Valdez wasn't trying to change the face of society.
Not even the face of television.
</P>
<P>
   What he mainly wanted to do was come up with a children's show
he could watch with his family. One that wouldn't send him running
for the remote every time a purple dinosaur broke into song.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a 2-year-old son, and I watch 'Barney' and 'Blues
Clues' with him. But they're not terribly entertaining for me
because those are the types of shows that are totally for kids,''
says Valdez, a writer-director-producer who founded the Hispanic
production company Si TV three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the groundbreaking sitcom ''The Brothers Garcia,''
which premiered this summer on the Nickelodeon children's network.
The first English-language TV show featuring an all-Hispanic cast
and production team, it airs Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important to Valdez than reaching that milestone
might be the fact that his son, Alex, can watch it with him, during
a time slot the TV industry ballyhoos as ''Family Hour'' but seems
to fill with so few family programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't think 'Friends' was appropriate for him,'' the
former standup comic quips during a phone conversation from Mexico,
where he was vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing against 'Friends,''' he quickly adds. ''It's a great
show. But it's not for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Brothers Garcia,'' with its quirky tales of growing up in
a large Latino family in San Antonio, definitely is.
</P>
<P>
   Family life is seen through the eyes of Larry. At 10, he's the
youngest of four siblings, with two older brothers and a fraternal
twin sister, who, Larry notes ruefully, ''was born one lousy
minute'' ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster, portrayed by Alvin Alvarez (with John Leguizamo
providing the adult Larry's narration), is terrified by things like
getting his first professional haircut from a ''crazy old guy'' who
can barely see the sharp objects he waves around Larry's head.
</P>
<P>
   But he's enthralled by a chance meeting with his idol ''The
Astronutt,'' a mysterious, helmeted figure who, legend has it,
became a professional wrestler after he was kicked out of the U.S.
space program over a mishap involving a Russian cosmonaut and a
punctured spacesuit.
</P>
<P>
   Larry is in awe of, though sometimes annoyed by, his father, who
lectures the kids on the benefits of being bicultural while he puts
salsa on his tortillas that is said to be so hot it can take the
paint off cars.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, Valdez says, is a lot like he was when he was growing up
as the youngest in a family of nine children in Pueblo, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sister really ran a beauty shop in our house and I wanted
to be an astronaut more than anything,'' he recalls fondly.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Garcias, for whom breakfast is a cross-cultural
mixture of menudo and Malt-O-Meal, Valdez remembers the dichotomy
of his own childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I spoke Spanish, that meant getting beaten up at school. So
I went from 'Ole' to 'Howdy' really PDQ,'' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But while everyone in the family spoke Spanish at home, they all
tuned in to English-language channels on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''I absolutely loved 'Gilligan's Island' and 'The Brady
Bunch,''' Valdez says.
</P>
<P>
   That love affair with English-language TV continues to this day
in millions of Hispanic households, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an absolute audience in America for Spanish-language
channels,'' he says. ''But a lot of Latinos don't even speak
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as is the case with Vaneza Leza Pitynski, the 12-year-old
actress who portrays Larry's sister, some family members do and
some don't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I speak it but I'm not a pro in Spanish,'' she says. Her
great-grandparents and her father are, but her mother, who is
German-Russian, doesn't speak it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it's mainly Spanish and English. Mostly English,'' she says
of conversations in her German-Russian-Puerto Rican-Amerian home in
the Los Angeles suburb of Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't surprise Valdez, who says Hispanic-American TV
viewers want good TV that reflects the world they live in, which is
a multicultural America.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's funny being in Mexico because they call me a Gringo down
here,'' he says. ''Everywhere in the world I go I'm an American.
Except in America, where I'm a Latino. Why can't I just be an
American who happens to be a Latino-American?
</P>
<P>
   ''That's really the whole crux of the show.''

<HEADLINE> Low-cost HMO has one more year to live  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A health maintenance organization created
to offer lower-cost premiums to its 25,000 members is going out of
business next year.
</P>
<P>
   Strong Care will end operations Dec. 31, 2001, officials said
Friday. The demise was blamed on rising costs of prescription
drugs, outpatient care, and increased patient visits to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Before it closes, the HMO expects to raise rates 29 percent next
year to break even.
</P>
<P>
   The business never grew as much as expected, said Kathleen
Parrinello, partly because Eastman Kodak Co. used self-insurance
and Strong Care's administrating agency began offering lower-cost
plans itself. Strong Care was created in 1997, partly in response
to Kodak's suggestion to cut premiums by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO is linked with the University of Rochester Medical
Center and other medical endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our primary mission is providing patient care and doing
medical education and research,'' Parrinello said. ''The
(University of Rochester) Medical Center was subsidizing the health
plan, and it did not make sense.''

<HEADLINE> Fall brings new books on the Beatles, Clintons  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Thirty years after their breakup, and 20 years
after the death of John Lennon, it's time yet again to meet the
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine Beatle-related titles are expected this fall, from
the authorized ''The Beatles Anthology'' to a biography of their
late manager, Brian Epstein. Other books include an illustrated
volume of Paul McCartney's paintings, a reissue of Lennon's
collection of verse, ''In His Own Write,'' and a look at the
Beatles' time in India with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
</P>
<P>
   While a generation has been born and raised since the Beatles
were together, they remain a major moneymaker and cultural
presence. The band's albums sold more than 50 million copies
worldwide over the past decade. Dozens of Beatles fans clubs still
exist, from Australia to Russia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Beatle books have been coming out since the group first started,
but readers apparently still want more. ''The Beatles Anthology,''
an oral history assembled by the three surviving Beatles and
Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, has advance orders of more than 1 million
and will be published in at least eight languages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember being at the booksellers convention a couple of
years ago and Linda McCartney was there to promote one of her
vegetarian cookbooks,'' says Constance Sayre, director of Marketing
Partners International, a publishing consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ''The publisher gave a party and you should have seen the lineup
of people to shake Sir Paul's hand. You've never seen such a crowd.
The Beatles are certainly a big deal with booksellers.''
</P>
<P>
   A minor surprise is the reissue of ''Lennon Remembers,''
Lennon's famously bitter, marathon interview with Rolling Stone
publisher Jann Wenner, given just as the group was breaking up.
Lennon had agreed to the interview on the condition that Wenner not
put it out in book form. When he did so anyway, Lennon was enraged
and spoke bitterly about Wenner right until the end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But the new publication arrives with the approval of Yoko Ono,
who contributed a forward. Material originally edited out has been
restored and some lyrics never recorded will be included.
</P>
<P>
   '''Lennon Remembers' is classic Lennon,'' Ono writes. ''It's not
a sit-back-and-put-your-feet-up read. ... It's a jolt on your
nerves like bad, bad espresso. People with weak stomachs should
close the window before reading. You might just feel like jumping
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Beatles, this fall marks another ongoing publishing
obsession, the Clintons. The titles can almost be divided into
subgenres: attack books, memoirs and policy papers.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the attack genre are ''I Feel Your Pain: The Explosion
and Abuse of Power During the Clinton-Gore Years'' and ''Sell Out:
The Inside Story of Bill Clinton's Impeachment.'' Memoirs include
''Eyewitness to Power,'' by former adviser David Gergen, and
''POTUS Speaks,'' by speechwriter Michael Waldman. (POTUS is
Washingtonian for President of the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Among those sticking to policy are former labor secretary Robert
B. Reich, who critiques e-commerce in ''The Future of Success,''
and former national security adviser Anthony Lake, who reviews
foreign policy in ''Six Nightmares.'' Bob Woodward reviews the
economy in ''Maestro: Inside Greenspan's Fed and the American
Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Clinton aide Paul Begala looks to this year's
presidential campaign with ''Is Our Children Learning?'' an actual
quote from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Al Gore, meanwhile, gets
the treatment in ''Al Gore: A User's Manual,'' by Alexander
Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair. The true specialist might look for
reissues of books by vice presidential candidates Joseph Lieberman
(''In Praise of Public Life'') and Dick Cheney (''Kings of the
Hill: Power and Personality in the House of Representatives'').
</P>
<P>
   Also this fall, Tom Wolfe comments on contemporary culture in
''Hooking Up,'' Matt Drudge sums up his life - so far - in ''Drudge
Manifesto'' and Ted Koppel looks back at recent news events in
''Off Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the market remains tiny, some titles will be available
only as e-books. They include ''Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift,''
which anticipates November's sequel to ''The Blair Witch Project,''
and the science fiction series ''Star Trek S.C.E.'' Stephen King
fans can expect more installments of his online novel, ''The
Plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on paper, King remembers his near fatal car accident in
''On Writing'' and Mary Karr, author of the best-selling ''The
Liar's Club,'' writes about her teen-age years in ''Cherry.'' J.D.
Salinger's daughter, Margaret, reflects on her family in ''Dream
Catcher.'' The McCourt franchise continues with ''Singing Him My
Song,'' Malachy's McCourt sequel to ''A Monk Swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs also are due from historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., the
late football star Walter Payton, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli,
Natalie Cole, Jerry Butler, the Neville Brothers, Jerry Stiller,
Tina Sinatra and the pro wrestler Chyna.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bellow'' is James Atlas' highly anticipated biography of Nobel
laureate Saul Bellow. Ian Kershaw, author of an acclaimed history
about Hitler's rise to power, is coming out with the second volume.
David Levering Lewis completes his two-volume series on civil
rights pioneer W.E.B. DuBois. Other biography subjects this fall
include President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Robert Kennedy, George
Orwell and Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The fiction list seems especially strong, with books expected
from Margaret Atwood, Ha Jin, Carlos Fuentes, William Trevor,
Michael Chabon, John Updike, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jane Hamilton, Caleb
Carr, Alice Walker and Nobelists Gunter Grass and Jose Saramago.
Notable new authors include Bonnie Burnard, Nomi Eve, Allen B.
Ballard and F.X. Toole.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams fans should look for a collection of his
letters and a volume of his early plays. Also expected are the
letters of Dashiell Hammett, essays by Arthur Miller, stories from
Isaac Bashevis Singer and the original, unedited version of Thomas
Wolfe's novel, ''Look Homeward, Angel,'' published upon the
centennial of the author's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Among commercial titles, the biggest seller could well be ''The
Mark: The Beast Rules the World,'' the latest apocalyptic thriller
from Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim F. LaHaye. Other names to look for
include Anne Rice, Tami Hoag, Elmore Leonard, Johanna Lindsey,
Richard Paul Evans, Colleen McCullough, Patricia Cornwall and
Philip Margolin.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the season's more unusual titles could be labeled
detective stories. In ''Author Unknown: On the Trail of
Anonymous,'' handwriting expert Don Foster reveals how he unmasked
''Primary Colors'' novelist Joe Klein. ''The Island of Lost Maps''
follows the cartographic trail of Gilbert Bland, Jr., an antiques
dealer with an unfortunate passion for stealing vintage maps from
research libraries throughout the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''Island'' has a first printing of about 50,000 and author Miles
Harvey already suspects who some of those readers will be. He
recalls speaking to a gathering of librarians at last June's
BookExpo America. He told a true tale of horror, about Bland and
Gary Menges, a librarian at the University of Washington who had
spent five years trying to save a copy of ''America,'' an
encyclopedia and atlas of the United States from 1672.
</P>
<P>
   ''Menges raised the money by himself to preserve this book,''
Harvey says. ''He even threw in $50 of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''For months, no one asked about the book. But one day a guy who
identified himself as 'James Perry' walked into the library. Menges
happened to be working at the research desk and when this fellow
requested 'America,' Menges got all excited. He said, 'I sure hope
you like this book.'
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got to the part of the map being dislodged from the
book, there was an audible gasp from all those librarians in the
room. It was extraordinary. I think this book will do very well
with librarians.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Staten Island women was diagnosed as the
eighth New York city resident struck this summer by the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus, city officials announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old woman - the seventh victim from Staten Island -
became ill on Aug. 23 and was hospitalized five days later with
encephalitis, said Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The woman is improving but remains hospitalized, Cohen said at a
joint Brooklyn news conference with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Two
other victims of the disease, one in Brooklyn and another from
Staten Island, were also hospitalized with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the latest victim came only one day after authorities
confirmed a 61-year-old Staten Island man as the seventh victim. On
Friday, New Jersey officials said tests had confirmed the state's
first human case of the virus in a 43-year-old Jersey City man.
</P>
<P>
   The city had already announced plans for pesticide spraying over
the weekend in an effort to reduce the mosquito population and halt
the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The area around the United Nations, which hosts its Millennium
Summit next week, and Central Park were sprayed with the pesticide
Anvil early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Several parts of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island were
targeted for Labor Day weekend spraying, along with most of
Manhattan between 23rd Street and 110th Street from river to river.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly and those with weakened immune systems have the
greatest risk of infection. Symptoms include a fever, headaches and
body aches, although severe infections can result in encephalitis,
an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the
brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven people in the metropolitan area died from
virus-related symptoms and scores more were hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> WWII Expelled Germans Lay Wreaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A group representing some of the millions of
ethnic Germans driven out of neighboring countries after World War
II laid wreaths Saturday in memory of those who died during the
expulsions and pledged to work for reconciliation with Germany's
former foes.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder was due Sunday to become the first Social
Democratic chancellor to address a meeting of the group, which has
accused the center-left party of failing to recognize the plight of
those who fled or were forced from countries such as
then-Czechoslovakia and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Federation of Expellees, marking the 50th
anniversary of a charter founding their campaign for reconciliation
and compensation, also honored several elderly veterans of the
cause, including the only signatory of the 1950 charter still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Social Democratic party General Secretary Franz Muentefering
praised the signatories for their rejection of violence and revenge
so soon after the expulsions, which were mostly completed by 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, 50 years later, German Social Democrats remember this
monumental step,'' Muentefering said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Reprisals after Nazi Germany's defeat saw about 12 million
ethnic Germans dispossessed and driven from their homes in eastern
Europe. About 2 million were killed or died from starvation and
illness on the trek.
</P>
<P>
   Some expellees have argued that eastern European countries such
as the Czech Republic shouldn't be allowed to join the European
Union until they change laws that legalized the confiscation of
property from ethnic Germans.

<HEADLINE> At world religious leaders' meeting, tensions and progress  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - For four days, dozens of nuns, monks and
swamis mingled in the lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria. Some took
photographs of the religious leaders with the highest hats and most
elaborate caftans, like Brontoi Yang Bedyurov, a spiritual leader
from Siberia, in his gold-lined velvet robes and fox hat with
tassels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too bad you don't speak Spanish,'' said Maria Eugenia Aguilar,
an indigenous priestess from El Salvador, as she sidled up for a
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gracias,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium World Peace Summit brought together more than
1,000 religious leaders with a goal of marshaling resources to
resolve global conflicts and find ways to collaborate with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a ''Commitment to Global Peace'' was signed, some
longtime adversaries sat down and discussed strategies to end
bloodshed, and alliances were formed, mostly on a person-to-person
level.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit also mirrored the tensions that lead to conflict
in the first place. Disagreements arose about who should speak for
the faithful, whether any group has a right to proselytize and just
how close religious leaders and the United Nations should be.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. General Assembly hall was the site of the first two
days of the summit, where, on Monday, religious leaders in
ceremonial dress took seats usually reserved for gray suited
diplomats. Men in feather headdresses sat next to women in sheer
white veils, rabbis in yarmulkes near nuns in saris.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy to see that our family is so large and many others
will see that,'' said Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Chan Phap
Dung.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican's Pontifical
Council on Interreligious Dialogue, was among the dignitaries. So
was Abdullah al-Obaid, secretary-general of the World Muslim
League; and Bishop Vashti McKenzie of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace laureate, from the
peace summit made news. Although the United Nations didn't sponsor
the summit, Secretary-General Kofi Annan gave the gathering his
support, and even unofficial ties produced political strains. The
United Nations warned conference organizers that China would be
outraged if the Dalai Lama attended, given his calls for an
autonomous Tibet. And the Chinese delegation walked out when
Tibetan Buddhists read a statement on the Dalai Lama's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Annan addressed the summit, telling leaders that religion has
too often ''stoked the flames of violent conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, whose U.N. Foundation, Better World Fund, helped pay
for the conference organized by an interfaith committee, gave a
folksier talk on how he was taught as a child that non-Christians
were going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought heaven was going to be a mighty empty place,'' he
said, drawing laughter from many monks.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelist Anne Graham Lotz, Billy Graham's daughter, was the
only speaker to tell the group that Jesus was the only way,
prompting Buddhist Mahathero Sobita to respond, ''Every river leads
to the ocean and every religion leads to God.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the speeches - which went several hours beyond the
schedule without a break - struck themes so familiar that some
audience members started counting repeated phrases calling for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit's last two days, with sessions held at the
Waldorf, participants addressed the tougher issues of how to
achieve the peace that has proved so elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Eritreans and Ethiopians, long divided by war, prayed together.
</P>
<P>
   In a session on the Middle East, an American rabbi apologized to
a Jordanian Muslim for some Jewish actions that harmed Palestinians
in the past, and another Muslim offered a plan for Jews and Arabs
to work together. And in an impromptu burst of emotion, a rabbi
danced with a sheik to a Hebrew song saying, ''Bring peace to us.''
</P>
<P>
   For many participants it was the first time they'd met so many
leaders of other traditions. ''I feel very good to have met Native
Americans,'' said Sadhvi Shilapiji, a Jain nun. And for many it was
the first time they had heard lectures on conflict resolution and
strategies to eliminate poverty and restore the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But few speakers talked about their own religious communities'
responsibility for fomenting violence, and some sessions led to the
kind of fighting religious leaders often try to avert. At one
session, a Hindu leader from Nepal shouted from the floor at a
Roman Catholic bishop, decrying the practice of using aid to
encourage conversion - and half a dozen others joined in the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar liked the direct expression of emotion. But the Rev.
John Pawlikowski, professor at Catholic Theological Union in
Chicago, wondered what it would say to the world if even religious
leaders couldn't disagree civilly.
</P>
<P>
   Pawlikowski was among a group of Christians, Hindus and Jewish
leaders who later signed an informal agreement, negotiated behind
the scenes, on ''freedom from coercion on religion.'' It supported
freedom to preach the Christian Gospel in India but rejected
proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   Some complaints were heard throughout the summit. There wasn't
enough time for the informal talks needed to form new alliances and
new understandings. Men dominated the agenda, and high-ranking men
dominated the microphone. Indigenous leaders were well represented,
but some resented that they were not asked to speak, particularly
in programs about their own regions.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu writer Janice Darbari wished there had been less talking
and more meditating. ''We could have tapped the spiritual energy,''
she said. ''We're just hearing words.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those words were formalized in the Commitment to Global
Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, a Talmudic scholar, said such resolutions
are as meaningful as a forced handshakes between fighting children
in kindergarten. But other participants welcomed the opportunity to
sign a commitment to work with the United Nations in the pursuit of
peace, to condemn violence and to promote equitable distribution of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The summit did not form an advisory council to the United
Nations, an original goal of the organizers. Many leaders had
questioned who would make up such a council and by what authority
they would speak for religious groups worldwide. Instead, a
steering committee was formed to explore ways to collaborate with
the United Nations in the future and to look into establishing a
more informal advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would not be an authoritarian body,'' said Harvard Divinity
School professor David Little. ''It would not pronounce on Sri
Lanka.'' Rather it would be a resource for the U.N. leaders on
conflict resolution experts and strategies. Women delegates planned
to form their own religious council to ensure equal representation.
</P>
<P>
   But at summit's end questions remained about that role religious
leaders should play in the United Nations, and for some the
gathering seemed a missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't much substance,'' said Buddhist Sulak Sivaraksa,
a social critic from Thailand. ''Subconsciously people feel they
have to defend their traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   For others it was a good beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peace is very dear to us,'' said Kawmar Ohiah Kamaruzaman, a
Muslim professor from Malaysia. ''We can't get it in one sitting.
But if there is any chance we should grab it.''

<HEADLINE> German Lawyer Sees Concorde Payout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A German lawyer representing 20 families with
relatives who died in the Concorde crash told a newsmagazine he
expected Air France to end up paying close to $3 million per victim
in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Christof Wellens said his clients have already received
preliminary payments from the airline of $19,500 each, Focus
magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected a settlement to be reached quickly that
''doesn't deviate much from the usual compensation after airplane
accidents in the United States, that is $2.7 million per victim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air France jet crashed July 25 shortly after takeoff from
Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, killing 113 people. Most of the
victims were German tourists headed to New York to board a luxury
cruise ship.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants More Arms Reductions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Issues of strategic stability, including a START
III arms-reduction treaty, will be a focus of President Vladimir
Putin's meetings with other world leaders during this month's
Millennium Summit, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin will also focus on the issue in a trip to Japan ahead of
the summit, which begins on Wednesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's statement came a day after President Clinton put off
deployment of a national missile-defense system that Russia
adamantly opposed and said could wreck arms-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Russia this year ratified the START II nuclear arms-reduction
treaty, which the U.S. Senate ratified in 1996, and U.S. and
Russian negotiators have discussed further reductions under a
proposed START III.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin has said Russia would abandon START II if the United
States went ahead with the missile-defense system, which would
require amending or scrapping the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty that Russia considers a cornerstone of world stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conclusion of START III is possible only provided that the
ABM treaty of 1972 remains inviolable,'' Ivanov said, according to
the news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Russia also wanted negotiations with other
governments on reducing the arms threat around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia supports an intensive dialogue on questions of
strategic stability with other interested countries, and before
all, nuclear ones,'' Ivanov said, according to a statement released
by the Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Polish Leader Dedicates Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By MIKHAIL METZEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDNOYE, Russia (AP) -- Polish and Russian leaders on Saturday
dedicated a a memorial to thousands of Polish officers and Russians
who were massacred by the Soviet secret police and buried in mass
graves in this small town.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives took a special train from Warsaw to attend the
ceremony Saturday for 6,313 Polish officers as well as more than
9,000 Russians who were victims of Stalin-era repressions in the
Tver region northwest of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek led the Polish delegation, and
Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, along with Russian
Orthodox Church leaders, also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Those buried in Mednoye comprise part of the 15,000 Polish
officers killed by Stalin's secret police in April and May 1940.
They were all shot in the back of the head and dumped into mass
graves near the villages of Mednoye and Katyn, and the
now-Ukrainian city of Kharkov.
</P>
<P>
   ''You also have millions of graves across your land,'' Buzek
said. ''Let the wrongs and the cemeteries be our joint memory and a
warning for next generations against treason and crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The dedication followed similar ceremonies at the two other
grave sites. The events are partly aimed at ending a rift in
Russian-Polish relations caused by the killings and the Soviet
government's refusal to acknowledge its responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened here should never have happened,'' Rushailo, the
interior minister, said. ''I am sure that there will be no more
events that could lay a shadow on relations between our two
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow persistently blamed the murders on Nazi forces invading
the Soviet Union during World War II, and did not officially admit
Soviet guilt until 1990. It was the Nazis who found the graves, in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   Poland still hopes that those responsible for the executions
could will be punished, and President Vladimir Putin called his
Polish counterpart Aleksander Kwasniewski in April to offer help
investigating the crime.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Files Ready For Viewing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The agency overseeing old East German spy agency
files said it has pulled together transcripts from wiretaps on
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl that could be used by the
parliamentary committee investigating the financial scandal
surrounding him and his party.
</P>
<P>
   The files were pulled together after several weeks of searching
and will be made available first to Kohl, according to standard
practice, as the person directly affected, agency chief Joachim
Gauck said in Saturday's Braunschweiger Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl attorney Stephan Holthoff-Pfoertner told the newspaper Kohl
wants to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Gauck stressed, however, that summaries of the transcripts may
also be turned over to lawmakers investigating the Christian
Democratic party's financing practices during Kohl's 16 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Committee leaders have said they won't use such files as
evidence, but may use information from them to question witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl admitted in December that he accepted some $1 million in
anonymous donations in the 1990s, saying the money was given to
help his party in former communist East Germany. Despite
investigations by prosecutors and parliament, he insists he
promised not to disclose the donors' identity and won't break his
word.
</P>
<P>
   His stonewalling has fueled speculation that cash was traded for
favors, something Kohl has denied.
</P>
<P>
   The East German spy agency, known as the Stasi, systematically
bugged Kohl and other West German politicians and recorded their
conversations. But Kohl has fought any release of the records,
saying they are bound to be full of phony and doctored information.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, media reports Saturday charged that the Hesse state
branch of the Christian Democrats illegally collected close to $1
million in undeclared campaign contributions from industry groups
during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Christian Democratic governor, Roland Koch, denied
in an interview with ZDF television that his party had received any
concealed contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, attending a convention of his
Social Democrats in the state Saturday, attacked the Christian
Democrats not only for the scandal but also the way ''the truth is
being presented piece by piece'' for almost a year now.

<HEADLINE> Marcus Camby moving charity out of Hartford  </HEADLINE>
syhfcjc
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Marcus Camby has relocated his Cambyland
Youth Foundation to New York, a move some say will damage his
reputation as a hometown hero in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   One of Camby's most publicized events in Hartford was his march
with students on the first day of school. On Tuesday, the former
Hartford High basketball star who now plays with the New York
Knicks will hold the march in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed,'' Principal Patsy Darity said from her
SAND School office where a framed, autographed photo of Camby hangs
on the wall. ''And the students will be disappointed, because he's
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also established an afterschool reading program
at two North End elementary schools, free trips for city youngsters
to professional basketball games, Christmas parties for
neighborhood children and turkey giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marcus wanted to have more control,'' said Rick Kaplan,
Camby's business manager and new executive director of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said the decision was also based on financial reasons,
saying he would not be paid to run the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Camby) took a long look at where the money was being spent,
and decided he'd rather give more money away,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Moore, the former executive director of CambyLand in
Hartford, said the organization should have been given more time to
succeed in Hartford. He said he offered to give up his salary,
which according to records was $8,400 in 1998, to keep the
foundation here.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the March with Marcus to the Rebound by Reading clubs,
the recognition brought his name to another level, based upon other
situations he had been involved in,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was refering to Camby's much publicized scandal involving
a sports agent and an arrest for marijuana possession in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, Moore said, had made fund raising in the corporate
community difficult early on. But people began to see a different
side of Camby as he walked hand in hand with children to school, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Camby's decision has caused him irreparable damage in
the corporate community of Hartford and with the children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the reasons it just leaves me scratching my
head,'' Moore said. ''It leaves a lot of people scratching their
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan would not comment on Moore's offer to volunteer his
services, and praised him for his past efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marcus is comfortable with the way it is now,'' Kaplan said.
''He wants to do two or three programs and do them well.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes marching with students to P.S. 194 in Harlem and
establishing some other programs there.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said Camby plans to maintain connections with Hartford
through some scholarships. He also said if the Rebound by Reading
club doesn't require any salaries, Camby might reinstate his
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   As for talk that Camby has damaged his reputation in Hartford,
Kaplan said the move is being made in the best interest of the
foundation's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''If at the end of the day you are making moves based on what
people say, you are not going to be successful,'' Kaplan said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has No Time for Vacation  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. -- Ah, summer. It's the season when a man's
thoughts turn to a restful family vacation, perhaps. Unless the man
is Bill Clinton, who will be president for just a few more precious
months, and is keeping an exhausting schedule of fund-raising
speeches and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Between Memorial Day weekend and the close of this Labor Day
holiday weekend, Clinton will have spent 74 days on the road and
given 59 political or fund-raising speeches. Three brief
''vacations'' were busman's holidays built around fund-raising
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered his party's premier cash collector, Clinton is
working extra hours this year to try to help Vice President Al
Gore's presidential campaign, and to elect Democrats in general.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton is trying to
narrow the traditional fund-raising gap between Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The future of this philosophy of government is at stake and he
wants to make sure he does everything he can,'' Lockhart said.
''There's going to be no time to make up for it after Election Day.
There's going to be plenty of time for a vacation in his future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 102 days spanning the start of the Memorial Day weekend
in May through the symbolic Labor Day close of summer, Clinton was
traveling somewhere in the United States for 57 days -- most of them
to raise money. He traveled abroad 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is on a perpetual campaign trail even though he is no
longer a candidate, Boston University presidential historian Robert
Dallek said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's campaigning for money and of course he's campaigning for
his legacy that is tied to Gore,'' Dallek said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's road trips have taken him from California to Rhode
Island to Florida to raise campaign cash, and as far afield as
Moscow, Japan and Nigeria for statecraft. In between, he spent 10
days hunkered down at Camp David, Md., trying unsuccessfully to
coax the Israelis and Palestinians to a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pace reflects his own position as a lame duck as much
as the election calendar, Dallek said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidents at the end of their term often focus on foreign
affairs. They have some latitude there that they don't have in
domestic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Clinton's calendar says he took nine days of
vacation away from Washington this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Clinton's vacations were weekend trips to New York state,
where first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for Senate. The
other was a long weekend on Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts
resort island populated with wealthy New Yorkers ripe for political
picking. Clinton gave four fund-raising speeches in three days
there.
</P>
<P>
   His one foray into the ocean at Martha's Vineyard, a romp with
presidential dog Buddy, ended badly when the dog panicked in the
waves and scratched the presidential torso. A sore and chastened
Clinton patted his solar plexus gingerly as he related the story
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Clinton and his family returned to a resort
village in upstate New York where they spent a quiet week last
year. This time they stayed only overnight -- long enough for
Clinton to play a round of golf and give two speeches estimated to
raise $150,000 for Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats have been counting on the president,'' said
Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks political donations. ''If the greatest
fund-raiser of all time had taken a summer vacation, his party
might rightly be up in arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is unseemly for the president to spend so much time
raising money is another matter, Makinson said.

<P>
   ''It's beyond question that that's become one of the duties of
the office,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton found a little time this summer for the more
recognizable duties of his office, such as receiving King Abdullah
II of Jordan in the Oval Office, and honoring 15 people with the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little to keep Clinton in Washington these days.
Congress was out of session much of the summer, his wife is on the
campaign trail most of the time. So is Gore, with whom he used to
share a weekly working lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Chelsea, 20, has spent the summer keeping her parents
company, and Clinton has seemed grateful for the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''When your children grow up ... you're always mildly surprised
when they still want to spend time with you, and completely
relieved and happy,'' Clinton told an interviewer in July.
</P>
<P>
   He also allowed at one point that when Hillary is out of town,
he lets Buddy sleep on the bed.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Dragging Death Casts Pall  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMDELA, South Africa (AP) -- In a country riven by racism,
Abelina Ntjantja Rampuru had always viewed whites as regular
people, just like her family, who simply had a different skin
color.
</P>
<P>
   That was before, according to police, her husband's white
employer tied one end of a wire around his leg, looped the other
end to his pickup truck and dragged the black man for three miles
before dumping his mutilated, lifeless body in an open field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate every white I see. I think my kids are going to hate
whites for their whole lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rampuru family mourned in the poor black township of
Zamdela, 50 miles south of Johannesburg, hundreds of South African
civic leaders, politicians and rights workers met in a posh suburb
of Johannesburg to discuss how to combat racism six years after the
end of the racist apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no choice but to end the nightmare,'' Deputy President
Jacob Zuma told the delegates in the conference's closing address
Saturday. ''We can only do this if we are bold and fearless about
confronting the racism that is deeply embedded in our society, the
racism that continues to dehumanize our people every day.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mosoko Rampuru's family sees no end to the nightmare. His
killing has convinced them blacks and whites can never reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   Rampuru, a driver working for a white construction company
owner, called his family Aug. 25 to say he was staying at work to
have a beer with his boss -- something that had never happened
before, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, in a neat suburban neighborhood just a few
miles from Rampuru's home, someone called the police. They had just
seen a body being dragged behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, police found Rampuru's badly torn body
in a field. They followed a three-mile track of blood and flesh to
the industrial area where Pieter Odendaal, Rampuru's boss, had his
construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Odendaal's pickup truck, which matched the caller's description,
was parked outside. Odendaal was having a drink in his office, but
he did not appear drunk, Capt. Elsabe Augoustides said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he knew nothing of what happened, he was arrested
on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether Rampuru was alive when he was dragged,
and police do not know why he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Rampuru, who was buried Saturday, had never complained about
work, except for the long hours and low pay -- $115 a month, said
his sister, Johanna Nolonolo. And he was a calm man, a caring
father to his two sons who would never fight with anybody, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have declined to call his killing a racist attack. But in
a country only six years removed from the white domination of
apartheid, few South Africans believe a similar crime would have
been committed had the races been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect it's part of our history and the values that have
been ingrained into every South African -- white and black -- that
the value of white life continues to be superior and the value of
black life continues to be inferior,'' said Jody Kollapen, a member
of South Africa's Human Right's Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Kollapen noted an incident Tuesday involving a black 14-year-old
girl suspected of shoplifting. The store's white manager ordered a
black security guard to paint the girl white from the waist up,
police said. Police declined to call the incident racist, but
Kollapen said such a punishment would never have been doled out to
a white girl.
</P>
<P>
   During the last year, the percent of South Africans who think
race relations are improving declined, according to the Markinor
Socio-Political Trends report.
</P>
<P>
   But Kollapen has hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may not able to change what is in their minds and hearts,
but what we can do is deal with the effects of their conduct,''
Kollapen said.
</P>
<P>
   Rampuru's family has lost all faith that South Africa's races
will ever live together in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, I did trust whites, and I thought things would get
better,'' said Rampuru's cousin, Thalitha Mphasa. ''Now I don't
trust them, and I think we must always fear them. There is no
respect, and no reason to hope things will change.''

<HEADLINE> Prince Moves in With Girlfriend  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's popular Crown Prince Haakon plans
to move in with his girlfriend, a single mother, in an Oslo
apartment, the Royal Palace announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian news media said that would make him the first
European prince to openly live with a girlfriend without being
married and it was seen as a step toward making Mette Marit Tjessem
Hoiby the future queen on Norway.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Haakon, 27, announced on national television that he had
a girlfriend. Hoiby, also 27, has a 3-year-old son, Marius, who
legal experts said could never be king even if Haakon someday
adopted him.
</P>
<P>
   Couples living together without being married is commonplace in
Norway, and the news was generally greeted positively. Nearly half
the children in this nation of 4.5 million people are born to
single mothers or unwed couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is nice that the crown prince, like many young people at
his stage in life, chooses to live with someone,'' Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   A news release from the palace said Haakon had found an
apartment in downtown Oslo that he intended to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Hoiby, originally from the southern town of Kristiansand, is a
student at the University of Oslo, and has worked as a part-time
waitress.
</P>
<P>
   Former Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Lutheran
clergyman and member of the Christian Democratic Party, said he
hoped Haakon would marry the woman.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Labor Day Greeting  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The following is President Clinton's Labor Day
greeting:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warm greetings to all Americans as we celebrate Labor Day and
honor the millions of working men and women across our nation whose
achievements have brought us to this moment of unprecedented
economic strength and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   When I took office in 1993, I committed my administration to
putting in place an agenda to get America back on its economic feet
while restoring the values of opportunity, responsibility, and
community. I believed that we could create a strong economy that
was pro-labor as well as pro-business; that was pro-family as well
as pro-work. I am proud that we succeeded in raising the minimum
wage, signing into law the Family and Medical Leave Act, and
cutting taxes for millions of low-income working families by
doubling the earned income tax credit. And today, thanks to the
hard work, creativity and determination of the American people, our
country is enjoying the longest economic expansion in our history,
with more than 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in
30 years, the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment
rates ever recorded, the lowest female unemployment rate in 40
years, and the smallest welfare rolls in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still much to do if we are to build the future we
want for our children. We must use this rare moment of peace and
prosperity to protect Social Security, modernize Medicare, provide
prescription drug coverage for our nation's senior citizens, and
enact a strong and enforceable patients' bill of rights. We must
raise the minimum wage again so that all our workers are able to
earn a decent income. We must bridge the digital divide and
encourage new investments in underserved regions so that every
American community shares in the promise and opportunity of today's
dynamic economy. And we must provide America's children with the
quality education they need to reach their full potential.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century was a time of enormous growth and progress for
our nation, in large part because of the skill, imagination and
dedication of America's workers. As we celebrate the first Labor
Day of this new century, let us honor and thank the working men and
women of our nation by building on their accomplishments to create
a brighter future for all our people.
</P>
<P>
   Best wishes for a wonderful holiday.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 15-year-old girl was raped blocks from Penn
Station early Saturday morning, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim reported to police at 2:30 a.m. that she had been
raped by an unidentified man about 37-years-old, said Police
Officer Chris Cottingham.

   The teen-ager was walking on West 30th Street between Eighth and
Ninth avenues when the assailant forced her into a parking garage,
took her to the garage's fourth floor, and then raped her,
Cottingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect fled after the attack, and no arrests were
immediately made, Cottingham said.

<HEADLINE> High school puts off games after lineman's fatal heart attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHFIELD SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - The Richfield Springs High School
football team postponed Sunday's opening game and the rest of its
season as it prepared to bid farewell to lineman Jarred Romero, who
died during practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, 16, collapsed at the end of Thursday's practice and was
pronounced dead at Bassett Healthcare in Cooperstown after 2 1-2
hours of resuscitation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of hard to think about football,'' said teammate
James Kelly. ''When the time comes ... we're dedicating the season
to him. I hope it would have made him happy to see us do well.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty devastating,'' sophomore Ryan Miller said. ''It
brings our football team more unity, because now we've known
hardship, but I don't know, it might be hard to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said little about the boy's death other than
releasing a statement noting counseling was available.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy performed Friday determined Romero had an enlarged
heart muscle, but Otsego County Coroner James Hurley said that
doesn't mean he had a congenital condition. He had no prior medical
problems, Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have come from a number of other conditions,'' Hurley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 years as coroner, Hurley recalls 10 to 15 similar cases of
youthful athletes dying on the practice field. ''It usually ends up
as a heart attack. All of them have been cardiovascular,'' Hurley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Romero had aspired to be a doctor and he opted to be an organ
donor, family members pointed out in an obituary.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-grader played the flute and was active in football and
the school chorus. He was learning to play guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services at the school's field are scheduled for Tuesday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Gore's lead over Bush in New Jersey looks to be getting more firm  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - In the race for president, there is a
growing belief among political analysts that the race in New Jersey
might be Democrat Al Gore's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is the polls, part is the strong performance
by President Clinton over GOP challenger Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, polls have given Gore a steady lead of between 5 and
12 points over GOP nominee George W. Bush, with the exception of
one poll by Gannett News Service the weekend after the Philadelphia
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent, by Quinnipiac University of Hamden, Conn., gave
Gore a 49-37 percent lead over Bush among 802 registered voters.
The poll was conducted Aug. 18 to Aug. 22, and reported its margin
of error as 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts in New Jersey said the poll trend is too
early to matter, but shows Gore is firming up his base and claiming
a piece of the decisive independent vote. Democrats outnumber
Republicans 5-to-4 but unaffiliated voters outnumber them both.
</P>
<P>
   GOP analyst Steve Salmore, a Bush supporter, said New Jersey was
almost a write-off for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican Party has become a party of the South and the
West. The whole way that George Bush speaks grates on many
Northeasterners,'' Salmore said. He said Ohio, Illinois, Michigan
and Missouri were the battlegrounds, and he liked Bush's chances
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would give Gore right now New Jersey, Connecticut, New York,
which means we are not likely to see a lot of presidential ads
around here,'' Salmore said. ''If George Bush wins New Jersey it is
because he is having a landslide nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Tom Wilson, who has run Republican campaigns in New
Jersey, said the Gore campaign has nothing locked up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ticket splitters. There is a high independent vote
here,'' Wilson said. ''New Jerseyans probably have as much Clinton
fatigue as anyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac political analyst Scott McLean said Gore's horse-race
lead was soft but he was getting a significant increase in support
from women and independents. ''I don't think he has a lock on New
Jersey, though I think the trends are more favorable to him than
before.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean noted Bush's growing weakness among New Jersey
Republicans, with 20 percent of them either supporting Gore or
showing disinterest, probably because of the abortion issue. McLean
said the majority of New Jersey Republicans consistently support
abortion rights in his university's polls, which is in keeping with
Gov. Christie Whitman and the majority of the GOP-controlled
Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Said Causing 3% of Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- Traffic pollution is responsible for
about 3 percent of deaths across Austria, France and Switzerland --
half of all outdoor pollution deaths there, a scientific researcher
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nico Kunzli of the Institute for Social and Preventive
Medicine at the University of Basel, Switzerland, told colleagues
at the World Congress on Lung Health that his team estimated that 6
percent of deaths per year, or 40,000, are directly attributable to
outdoor air pollution across those Alpine countries.
</P>
<P>
   He used the level of invisible inhalable particles floating in
the air to measure outdoor air pollution. Many experts believe that
about half of those come from traffic pollution, which includes not
only exhaust emissions but also dust from tires and debris
disturbed by traffic. On that basis, Kunzli assigned half the blame
to traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than 60 studies now have come up with virtually the same
result'' of 6 percent, said Daniel Costa, chief of the pulmonary
toxicology branch at the National Health and Environmental Effects
Research laboratory of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
''This is an international confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has focused on cities, a collection of cities
or single countries. Not all of them used the same methods to
measure the impact of air pollution on health.
</P>
<P>
   The new study emerged from a World Health Organization project
to create a coordinated European transport policy to reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite unavoidable uncertainties, the authors have reported a
straightforward method for estimating health costs of
traffic-related air pollution,'' Stephanie London and Isabelle
Romieu of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences wrote in a critique of the work published in The Lancet
medical journal. They said the results were a first step toward the
European goal of making motorists pay for the true costs driving
imposes on society.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimated that each year, traffic pollution causes
more than 25,000 new cases of chronic bronchitis in adults, more
than 290,000 episodes of bronchitis among children and more than
500,000 asthma attacks. Costa said Kunzli used the best method
available to make his estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The higher the level of pollution, the higher the fraction
attributable to traffic,'' Kunzli said. ''But Switzerland, Austria
and France is a rather good example for conditions in mid-Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution has been blamed both for aggravating illnesses and
for bringing on heart and lung diseases. Most of the deaths are
from heart or lung complications.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that because pollution affects different
people in different ways, there is no threshold that is ''safe''
for everybody. A pollution level that may trigger a reaction in one
person may be fine for another, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Detain 22 Chechens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Interior Ministry said Saturday that
troops detained 22 suspected rebels in the Chechen capital,
continuing a practice of mass arrests that human rights groups have
sharply criticized.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected rebels had been rounded up in the previous 24
hours in Grozny, the ministry said in comments reported by the
Interfax news agency. According to the report, some of the
detainees had bruise marks on their shoulders, indicating they had
recently used weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to the Interior Ministry's office in Chechnya went
unanswered Saturday and the report could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have conducted scores of so-called ''mopping up''
operations in Grozny and other Chechen towns since taking much of
Chechnya from rebel forces in the last year. Military leaders say
small groups of rebels periodically infiltrate areas under Russian
control and must be hunted down.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups allege the sweeps simply target all
Chechen males and that some men are detained for no reason. The
groups say they have documented cases when detainees were tortured
by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Saturday, no major attacks were reported against
either side in Chechnya. Russian commanders have been apparently
unwilling to risk the high casualties that would likely come with
an attack on remaining rebel strongholds in the mountainous south,
while rebels have acknowledged shortages of weapons. The rebels say
they will rely on hit-and-run tactics to wear down the Russians
rather than a major offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the rebel-linked Web site www.kavkaz.org reported
that Chechen parliament speaker Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev has died at
Lefortovo prison in Moscow, where he reportedly had been held since
May. The Russian Federal Security Service declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels drove out Russian troops in a 1994-96 war, but federal
forces returned after a series of cross-border raids and bombings
in Moscow and two other cities last year that left some 300 people
dead. Moscow blames the bombings on Chechens and says the military
campaign in Chechnya was made necessary by the threat of new
terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> More young people in Connecticut using drugs compared to other states </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The first federal survey of drug abuse in every state
estimates
that greater percentages of Connecticut's young people are using
illicit drugs compared with those in other states.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A total of 13.4 percent of young people in Connecticut age 12 to
17 reported use of at least one illicit drug during the previous
month. This ranked Connecticut fifth, behind Rhode Island,
Massachusetts, Montana and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to do a lot more parent education, bringing parents in
and training them more so they have more awareness of what a
teen-ager's life is like these days,'' said James Horton, health
educator at Cromwell High School.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and New England in general remain a hotbed for
marijuana use among those age 18 to 25, according to the National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse, prepared by the Department of
Health and Human Services. Connecticut teen-agers also have
somewhat higher rates of so-called ''binge alcohol'' use.
</P>
<P>
   The survey interviewed 67,000 young people across the country
last year on a variety of topics related to substance abuse. It
found wide differences in drug use among states. Nationwide, the
survey found drug use down among those 12 to 17, but up for those
18 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   The news that younger teens are turning away from drugs suggests
a positive trend for the future, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazingly encouraging,'' said Bob Weiner, a spokesman for
Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the White House office on drug
control policy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decline in use among young teenagers was a sign that
community efforts by schools, police and parents were making a
difference. Overall, about 15 million Americans were estimated to
be current users of illicit drugs in 1999, compared with the high
point of drug use in 1979, when the figure was 25 million.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 18.1 percent of those age 18 to 25 in Connecticut
reported marijuana use -- a high percentage, but behind
Massachusetts, where almost 28 percent in that age bracket reported
inhaling within a month of being surveyed. Some 9.3 percent of
Connecticut young people age 12 to 17 reported marijuana use within
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 56.5 percent reported that obtaining
marijuana was ''fairly or very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was relatively little difference in reported marijuana use
between those who had a drug education class and those who had not.
</P>
<P>
   The percent of youths who perceived a risk in smoking marijuana
has declined, from 32.6 percent in 1996 to 29.0 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While drug use among younger teens is decreasing nationally,
smoking and alcohol use is not.
</P>
<P>
   According to the data, 19 percent of young people age 12 to 17
reported that they drank at least once in the past month and 52
percent of Americans age 12 and older reported current alcohol use.
In 1999, 7.8 percent of youths age 12 to 17 reported binge drinking
during the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with substance abuse problems often falls at the door of
the public schools, but experts say the solutions must come more
from the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is not just on the backs of the schools, '' said
Nancy Pugliese, who supervises the state Department of Education's
office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools. ''The majority of use is on
the weekends. It has to be a concerted effort in the community to
really come together and educate.''

<HEADLINE> Andy Williams To Begin New Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- Singer Andy Williams is glad he got a second
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   After a node was found on his throat last October, he was forced
to cancel a tour for the first time in his 63-year career. A doctor
advised him to consider surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bing Crosby had his operated on and it changed his voice. It
made it lower. Well, I didn't want to sound like Bing, my voice is
much higher,'' said Williams, 72. ''Julie Andrews also went through
the same thing. I called her and she said it didn't work out too
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams consulted another doctor, who happened to be a fan. He
gave Williams the answer he was looking for: Take several months
off to see if the growth subsides.
</P>
<P>
   He did, and it did. Williams will begin his ninth season at his
Moon River Theatre starting Sept. 8.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Imposter May Be Deported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Jonathan Taylor Spielberg and Steven
Spielberg have one thing in common: a talent for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   That talent made Steven rich and famous. It could get Jonathan
Taylor deported. He allegedly duped a Catholic high school into
believing he was the nephew of the famous filmmaker, and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service is seeking send him back to
his native Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, 27, legally changed his name from Anoushirvan D.
Fakhran in 1997. In the fall of 1998 he enrolled at Paul VI
Catholic High School, claiming that he was 14 and that Steven
Spielberg was his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   School officials uncovered the scam in January, and Spielberg
pleaded guilty to forgery for submitting phony forms to the school.
He was given two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents took Spielberg into custody last week. He faces
deportation because his forgery conviction violates his status as a
permanent resident.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police Arrest Couple For Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) -- Police have arrested a high-living
Chinese couple who are suspected of defrauding $300 million from a
state-run bank in China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Manxiong, 40, and his wife, Chen Quiyuan, 30, are prime
suspects in a bank scam in Guangdong, China, 10 years ago, said
Police Col. Montri Sampunnaon. They fled to Thailand five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two were arrested Friday on charges of illegally entering
the country and falsifying official documents, Montri said, adding
that they are to be face trial in Bangkok before being extradited
to China. He said the couple denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the two surfaced in Chiang Mai, 360 miles north of
Bangkok, in 1995 and lived luxuriously, owning two large houses,
three Mercedes Benz cars and a string of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   By allegedly falsifying documents they were reportedly able to
change their names to those of a Thai couple who had died many
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is emerging that that the couple enjoyed close
relations with prominent politicians, generals and top ranking
officials, Montri said. In their cars and houses, police found many
official documents and licenses signed by top Thai officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Chinese Consulate in Chiang Mai are
participating in the investigation, according to the police.

<HEADLINE> Finns Fete Cold War Leader  </HEADLINE>
By MATTI HUUHTANEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finns are commemorating Sunday's
centennial of the birth of Urho Kekkonen, the president who pulled
off a Cold War balancing act by befriending the Soviets while
keeping this small, neutral country closely tied to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Kekkonen, who died in 1986 at the age of 85, led the nation with
an iron grip for 25 years until 1981, when he retired because of
ill health.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Kekkonen statue was unveiled in his birthplace in
Pielavesi, 260 miles north of the capital, Helsinki. President
Tarja Halonen and other government officials were to attend
commemoration ceremonies in the capital, and several new works
about the disputed figure have appeared in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Kekkonen's skills at keeping an even keel between the interests
of Western nations and Finland's large communist neighbor to the
east reached a climax in 1975, when he played host to a summit of
35 Eastern and Western leaders in Helsinki. The parties signed the
landmark Helsinki Human Rights Accords.
</P>
<P>
   But Finns also remember Kekkonen for his ruthless political
maneuvering, his frequent fishing and hunting trips with Soviet
leaders and his fondness for alcohol and womanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kekkonen was a patriot but he used methods that are
unacceptable,'' said Pekka Hyvarinen, author of a ''A Man of
Finland; Urho Kekkonen's Life,'' published this week.
</P>
<P>
   During his five terms in office beginning in 1956, Kekkonen
continued the country's foreign policy of appeasement to the
Soviets, dubbed ''Finlandization'' in the West. The policy was
adopted after the Finns fought two bitter wars against the Soviets
and were forced to cede 11 percent of their land.
</P>
<P>
   Kekkonen's large black-rimmed glasses and bald head were easy
targets for cartoonists, but his ability to talk to ordinary people
won him respect and popularity. Forced by illness to retire from
the job he loved, he grew bitter and died a lonely figure, shut
away from the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Anja Snellman, who runs a market cafe in front of the
presidential palace in the Helsinki harbor, remembers when Kekkonen
dropped by for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as he arrived, he commanded respect,'' she said.
''It's the kind of respect you have to have when you head a
nation.''

<HEADLINE> Release Sought for Killer of Nuns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- El Salvador's attorney general
says he will fight for the release of one of two former soldiers
still imprisoned for the 1980 slaying of four U.S. religious
workers, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Miguel Cardoza said Francisco Orlando Contreras
has changed and that he would push to have him released, local
media reported Saturday. The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected
the former soldier's petition because it believed he had not been
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the country's National Guard, Contreras was
one of five men sentenced to 30 years in prison in 1984 for the
slayings of nuns Ita Ford, Maura Clarke and Dorothy Kazel, and
layworker Jean Donovan during the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The women had been detained at a highway checkpoint in December
1980 while headed to the capital from the nearby international
airport. Their bullet-riddled bodies were found a day later. They
apparently had been raped.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men were freed in 1998 for good behavior under a
law that reduced some sentences to ease prison overcrowding.
Contreras and Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios were kept in prison
because they had participated in a prison uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims said they believe the women were
targeted because officials suspected they sympathized with leftist
guerrillas during the war.

<HEADLINE> Edgewater neighbors suspect arson in spectacular apartment blaze  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) - Up and down Undercliff Avenue, residents
are convinced the massive fire that destroyed a luxury apartment
complex and nine houses across the street this week was the work of
an arsonist.
</P>
<P>
   But three days after the fire, there was no shortage of
suspects, at least in neighbors' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspect anti-development fervor might have pushed someone
over the edge. Others speculate that Wednesday's fire was the act
of a disgruntled worker.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was becoming clear: If the blaze is officially
declared an arson, investigators are going to have a hard time
proving who did it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way it went so fast, it seems like somebody did
something,'' said Leo Petruzzella, who lives down the street from
what used to be the Avalon River Mews complex. Saturday morning, it
was just a few brick walls, some twisted pipes sticking crazily
into the air, and a couple chimneys rising above $75 million worth
of soggy, smelly rubble. ''But I'll tell you what: You have to have
(guts) to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor, John Ghazey, also said the fire must have been
set, given how quickly it engulfed the complex, which was still
under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything points toward that,'' he said. ''It started in one
corner, and within seven minutes, it went through the whole thing.
I was in World War II, and the devastation was just like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like hell opened up,'' added Rebecca Valle, another
Undercliff Avenue resident. ''The way that fire spread, it's hard
to believe it could have been an accident. That was a furious
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Edgewater Fire Department, the Bergen
County Prosecutor's Office have been joined by personnel from the
state Division of Fire Safety and the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms in trying to determine what started the
spectacular fire, which shot flames hundreds of feet into the air
and was visible for miles.
</P>
<P>
   The fire has been labeled as suspicious, but investigators had
not determined as of Saturday whether it was set deliberately. They
may have a hard time ever finding out, because arson cases are
among the toughest crimes to solve, according to a veteran arson
prosecutor from another county who spoke on the condition that he
not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   It's ''a real beat-the-bushes type of thing,'' the prosecutor
said. ''There's rarely an admission. Usually by the time the fire
is discovered, the defendant has himself somewhere where he's got
an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large percentage of these crimes don't get solved at all,''
he said. ''And if you can charge someone, once you get into court,
it's usually no more than 50-50 that you'll get a conviction,
because most of the evidence is circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators probing large fires such as the one in Edgewater
initially try to determine where and how the fire started. This can
sometimes be determined by examining ''burn patterns,'' or how
deeply charred walls or beams are in a certain spot, whether they
fan out from a central area, or run in a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   If a fire is found to have started in more than one spot, that's
almost always an indication the fire was set, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators always look for telltale signs of an accelerant,
something like gasoline or other flammable material used to start
or quickly spread a fire. Sophisticated laboratory tests can detect
traces of accelerants from even burned materials.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fire is determined to be an arson, the investigation then
shifts to looking for suspects: who had a motive to set it? Might
it have been done for financial gain, or as an act of revenge?
Might it have been started by squatters, or by kids playing with
matches?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions have Undercliff Avenue residents working
overtime on conspiracy theories. Some centered on how rapidly the
once-struggling industrial town has gentrified, with luxury
high-rise condominiums and apartments soaring skyward, blocking the
breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline that longtime residents
had enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost the whole town is opposed to this kind of
development,'' said David Luabes, the superintendent of an
apartment building across the street from the fire scene which
itself sustained heavy damage. ''But money talks, and they don't
listen to anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Petruzzella said neighborhood residents were happy when the
former Alcoa aluminum factory was razed in 1997, opening up
long-blocked views of Manhattan that residents thought they'd never
see again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then they started this new construction, and people didn't
like it because they lost their views of New York City again,'' he
said. ''But I don't think it could have been anyone from across the
street, because if it was, they ended up burning their own houses
down, too.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people have been left homeless by the fire. Local
businesses and residents have donated food and clothing to the
victims, and a fund has been set up for donations to help the
victims replace personal belongings, or find a new place to live.

<HEADLINE> Bush Balks at Debate Site  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN TESTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- An image of President Kennedy flashed in the video
clips shown just moments before George W. Bush accepted the
Republican presidential nomination. Last spring, the daughter of
the slain president honored Bush's father as a Kennedy Library
Foundation Distinguished American.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Texas Gov. Bush is balking at a planned debate in Boston
because it is co-sponsored by Kennedy's presidential library,
according to a Republican familiar with the Bush campaign's
thinking, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Some can't blame him for wanting to avoid the symbol-laden venue
devoted to Kennedy, a Democratic icon and telegenic orator whose
1960 debates with Richard Nixon sealed his bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could see stories ... 'Bush debates in Kennedy's
shadow,''' said William Benoit, a professor of communication at the
University of Missouri and co-author of a book on the 1992
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if Gore would want to debate at the George Bush
(presidential) library,'' he said. ''I think that's reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts-Boston and the Kennedy library,
which share a campus, were selected by the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates to host one of three general election debates.
</P>
<P>
   However, as of Friday, Bush had not accepted any debate offers.
Officials from the commission had a meeting with Bush campaign
officials Friday that ''was purely informational.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Representatives of the Bush campaign did not request a change
in the scheduled dates of the commission debates, nor was this
issue discussed,'' said Janet Brown, executive director of the
commission. They discussed the dates and format that would reach
the largest possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, has accepted
the commission debates, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made clear his preference for relatively informal
debates, such as the session during the Republican primaries in
which the candidates sat around a table with CNN talk-show host
Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign chairman, William Daley, said the vice president
will consider cable TV and other debate formats only after sealing
a deal with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seem to be getting picky all of a sudden about which
debates they will do after months of saying they will do all of
them,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker replied. ''Governor Bush
still looks forward to debating in a forum that as many people as
possible can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at UMass and the presidential library have heard talk
of Bush's reluctance, but they forge ahead anyway. In fact, the
school has spent nearly $250,000 so far in preparations, including
shoring up the former wetland on which the campus was built to
ensure it can support all the satellite television trucks. The
actual debate will be in a university building, not in the library.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations at Washington University in St. Louis and Wake
Forest University in North Carolina -- the other two commission
sites -- also are moving ahead, even without a commitment from Bush.
Each school has committed $550,000 to cover expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldman, a Boston-based Democratic political consultant,
doesn't buy the story that Bush doesn't want to do the debate here
because of the Kennedy connection. Goldman said Bush knows he's not
as strong a debater as Gore and would be better served by debates
in smaller, lower-profile venues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Were I one of his handlers, I would be saying the same thing
they are saying: We are willing to do three debates, as long as
they occur between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. on an infomercial channel
during a blizzard,'' Goldman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy library and UMass campus were selected as a site in
part because it is the 40th anniversary of the Kennedy-Nixon
debates, the first to be nationally televised.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McNaught, a spokesman for the library, said the event would
proceed in the ''strictest nonpartisan sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that former President Bush received a bronze bust of
President Kennedy from Caroline Kennedy in May when he received the
annual ''Profile in Courage'' award and that the library has twice
played host to former GOP presidential candidate John McCain in the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel it's long overdue that Boston be a host site for a
presidential debate,'' McNaught said. ''This is the city where it
all began. This is the cradle of American democracy.''

   MIAMI (AP) -- A man was sentenced to more than six years in
prison for bilking 1,300 investors nationwide out of $49 million.
</P>
<P>
   James F. Hurst of West Palm Beach was accused of selling
agreements and promissory notes to investors, promising annual
returns in excess of 20 percent. He spent $10 million on a home,

   Hurst's lawyer said earlier that his client was working to
return the money to the defrauded investors.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst's company told investors it bought accounts receivable
from health care providers and commercial companies at a discount
and reinvested the funds four times a year.

<HEADLINE> Warning on School Bus Brakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the country's largest school bus
builders is warning school districts that the brake systems on an
estimated 6,000 buses may be defective, The Washington Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Built Buses Inc. of High Point, N.C., wrote in an Aug. 30
letter sent to hundreds of school districts nationwide that the
defect involves the anti-lock brake system on buses manufactured
between March 1998 and last month.
</P>
<P>
   The brake system's electronic control units can ''misinterpret''
certain signals from the wheels, resulting in the temporary loss of
braking capability ''in one or more wheel positions,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company told the districts how to inspect their buses'
brakes and said repair kits were being manufactured and would be
shipped by November.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the company's headquarters for comment Saturday were
not answered.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Freightliner Corp., Thomas Built's Portland,
Ore.-based parent company, said they were notified of the braking
problem in June by Bendix, the brake system's manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Bendix reported an incident in which a San Francisco school bus
experienced a ''temporary loss of brake capability,'' although the
driver was able to bring the bus to a safe stop, Freightliner
President Jim Hebe told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Hebe said Thomas Built is just one of several bus manufacturers
that use the Bendix system. The two companies discussed the problem
with officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Action was taken as quickly as possible,'' Hebe said. ''We are
the first manufacturer to notify our customers. We are extremely
concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebe said school officials could call a Freightliner help line --
800-FTL-HELP -- to arrange for an inspection of any buses that might
present a safety problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts said they had yet to receive the warning
from Thomas Built about the braking problem. Others complained the
company's letter was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''The letter is vague and cryptic and borderline irresponsible
in its lack of detail,'' said Brian Porter, a spokesman for the
Montgomery County, Md., school district.

   LAUDERHILL, Fla. (AP) -- A 3-year-old girl died after her older
sister jumped off a bed and onto her stomach while they played,
investigators said.
</P>

   The girls were playing in their room early Friday when Brittany
Charles fell off the bed and struck her head on a nightstand. Her
sister, Shakera, 6, then jumped off the bed and landed on her

   Their mother's boyfriend heard Brittany scream, went into the

   Brittany was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead of injuries
to her liver and pancreas.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Rebury Mass Grave Victims  </HEADLINE>
By MERITA DHIMGJOKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAKOVC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The heat, the stench of dead bodies
and the wailing of women mingled Saturday in a scene that has
become disturbingly commonplace in postwar Kosovo: the reburial of
victims found in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   This time hundreds of ethnic Albanians gathered in the town of
Makovc, six miles northeast of Pristina, to see the reburials of 67
men, women and children killed last year during a Yugoslav army
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were discovered last year in six mass graves in the
area, but it has taken time for forensics experts to identify those
killed. And with new mass graves continuing to be discovered,
investigators with the United Nations' war crimes tribunal say it's
impossible to know how many people were killed during the crackdown
-- or when the reburials will end.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives fought to control their emotions Saturday as the
remains of their loved ones were lowered into graves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Open up the coffin,'' said Kadire Demoli, 68, leaning down and
trying to remove the top of the wooden coffin of her 32-year-old
son, Heset. ''I don't believe my son's body is inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Forensic workers authorized the opening of the coffin, and with
trembling hands Demoli lifted the top, to see an almost flat
plastic bag with some remains inside. She pulled her white scarf
over her face and continued weeping.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't realize -- nor did Heset's widow, nor his three
daughters -- was that the remains she saw were only the bottom half
of her son's body.
</P>
<P>
   A relative who had been invited by investigators to identify the
body said he had recognized the trousers, and his passport in the
back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't know where the other half was,'' said Gazmend
Rahimi.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said they had seen Yugoslav army soldiers and members
of Serb paramilitary groups handpick young men and women from the
miles-long convoy of people fleeing their villages between April
19-23 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   They were never seen alive again.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against
separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The war crimes tribunal continues to collect evidence against
five Yugoslav and Serb leaders who have already been indicted,
including Milosevic. Local Serbs accused of war crimes are to be
prosecuted locally by criminal courts in the province set up under
U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Governments and international organizations routinely speak of
an estimated 10,000 people who died during the crackdown, which
ended last summer with the pullout of Milosevic's forces after NATO
bombing and the entry of NATO and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But with new mass graves being found, ''it is still early'' to
cite a death toll, said Stephen Leach, a tribunal investigator at
the reburial site.
</P>
<P>
   With reburials held every few weeks, such events are becoming
routine. Organizers of Saturday's ceremony had expected thousands
of people to come, but only a few hundred turned up.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have gotten tired of death,'' said Gani Krasniqi, a
village teacher.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians: No Israel Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Hours before Yasser Arafat's
departure for his meeting in New York with President Clinton, a
senior Palestinian official said the Palestinians will not make new
concessions to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, who said he was speaking on Arafat's behalf,
said the Palestinians have been flexible enough in agreeing to
United Nations resolution 242, which gives them only 22 percent of
British Mandatory Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians will not give in on the issue of Jerusalem, he
told a graduation ceremony of military intelligence soldiers in
Gaza. ''We are committed to our national principles and first and
foremost the right of the refugees to return and sovereignty over
east Jerusalem which will be only for the Palestinian independent
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David summit in July broke down over the issue of
Jerusalem. Israel insisted on retaining sovereignty over the area
but offered the Palestinians certain rights, which were less than
sovereignty, at the Muslim Holy places.
</P>
<P>
   Each side accused the other of being inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Rahim said the Palestinians are not seeking a military
confrontation with Israel, ''but we will defend ourselves if the
Israeli side tries to attack us.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat left Saturday night for Cairo, where he is to address a
session of the Arab League before flying on to New York, where he
will meet with Clinton on Wednesday. On Saturday he met with
visiting CIA director George Tenet in the West Bank city of
Ramallah. Palestinian security officials were also present. They
discussed the peace process, a Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
   American peace envoy Dennis Ross also held a meeting Friday with
Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan. Ross has
been trying to bridge the gap between Israel and the Palestinians,
but Erekat said it is still wide and ''Israel has backslided'' on
some of the positions it adopted at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has made the same charge
against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Ross will report to Clinton before he holds separate meetings
with Barak and Arafat at the Millennium summit in New York.

<HEADLINE> Policing casinos offers troopers a colorful beat  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) - Past the dizzying patterns,
flickering lights and frenzied tourists at Foxwoods Resort Casino
lies a secure area off limits to patrons who play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But those who gamble with the law are escorted by plainclothes
detectives down a lackluster white hallway and into a three-room
office that functions as a state police barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the casino unit made 362 arrests at Foxwoods and 152
arrests at Mohegan Sun Casino in neighboring Montville.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers also conduct background checks on gaming employees
- more than 28,000 at Foxwoods since the casino opened in 1992 -
and escort employees carrying cash and chips across the floors of
the world's largest casino.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal struck before Foxwoods opened, the state and the
Mashantucket Pequot tribe agreed to house a state police unit to
function as the primary law enforcement agency within the casino.
The tribe also has its own police department and state police from
the Montville barracks have jurisdiction on the reservation outside
the gaming floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could consider this the only foot patrol in the
Connecticut State Police,'' said Detective Patrick Graham. ''We're
constantly walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Ronald Coleman, who works from midnight to 8 a.m.,
said he walks up to 20 miles per shift.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been here since day one and we handle the crimes that
take place ranging from breach of peace to disorderly conduct up to
thefts and employee schemes,'' said unit commander Lt. Edmond
Brunt.
</P>
<P>
   One ongoing case involves a man accused of stealing hundreds of
thousands of dollars from his stepfather who is suspected of
stealing the money from Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Gahner, 22, was charged in August with concealing
information from police during their investigation of the case. He
has been in custody since early July when he was charged with
raping a woman at his Norwich home.
</P>
<P>
   His stepfather, Harlan Gahner, 54, a former Mohegan Sun
employee, was arrested several days before the alleged rape when
casino officials allegedly spotted him stuffing nearly $100,000 in
cash into his overalls while counting money in one of the ''soft
count'' rooms, police said
</P>
<P>
   State police are investigating both Gahners for the possible
theft of up to $600,000 in casino money.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were also charged in July with hindering
prosecution and interfering with a police officer for allegedly
lying during the investigation into the Gahners.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place sort of attracts the weirdest of the weird,'' said
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when there were just six people at the Foxwoods dance
club bar - including employees - a man pulled out a knife and
attempted to stab another man for no apparent reason, Coleman said.
The two men had never met. The assailant managed only to cut the
victim's shirt and was charged with first-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   Graham recalled a late-night case involving a man who broke into
a gaming table and stole about $7,500 worth of chips. He was caught
on camera but got away. About a month later, he returned to the
casino where surveillance employees tracked him on camera for about
eight hours as he tried to break into a car in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprints on the car matched prints on the glass cover of the
gaming table and detectives were able to make an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He then bonded himself out with the stolen chips,'' said
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   In August a Massachusetts man was charged with larceny in the
theft of two human corneas that had been donated for
transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dellaria, 47, told state police that he thought the
plastic foam package he had stolen from a train station in Boston
was filled with lobsters, Detective Jeff Megin said. The package,
which belonged to the New England Eye &AMP; Tissue Transplant Bank, was
about the size of a 12-pack beer container. It is not clear why
Dellaria brought the ''lobsters'' to the casino, police said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few instances of violent crime at the casinos. The
most common charge is criminal trespassing, with 92 arrests at
Foxwoods in 1999 and 46 at Mohegan Sun. That includes people who
are prohibited from returning to the casino for a variety of
reasons, including drunken behavior, and compulsive gamblers who
ask the casino to keep their photograph on file and boot them out
if they refuse to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Larceny is the second most common charge with 79 arrests last
year at Foxwoods and 36 at Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   There has only been one robbery at the casino, said Coleman. A
former casino security guard knocked over a security guard as he
grabbed some bills off a gaming table.
</P>
<P>
   State police say the only people they ever found armed were
licensed firearms owners who forgot they were carrying a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Only one sexual assault arrest was made at Foxwoods last year
and troopers say there is no apparent problem with prostitution
within the casino itself. There were four narcotics arrests at
Foxwoods in 1999 and three at Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Brunt says that he is not aware of a suicide within the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a very rare suicide in the parking lot,'' said Graham,
adding that there may be others at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month each casino saw the arrest of parents who left
their children unattended while they gambled. But Sgt. Alex Aalberg
said there is not a significant problem with abandoned children.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have a city of 40,000 or 60,000 people, you're going
to have a problem,'' said Brunt, referring to the number of casino
patrons. ''Also you have a bigger chunk of males 18-to-40.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 79 women were arrested at Foxwoods compared to 283
men. At Mohegan Sun, the ratio was 17-135.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a female suspect who kicked in an office wall bearing
the bar that held her handcuffs. Since then, the casino added a
steel panel to better secure the bar. Also added was a second area
with steel paneling and a bar to hold additional suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had small armies in here between prisoners and
security,'' said Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers who volunteer to work in the unit spend a week in
Atlantic City learning to play all the games so that they can
identify cheaters. But the real training comes on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police officers get exposed to things here you won't see
anywhere else,'' said Brunt.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Egypt Call for Arab Summit  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Syria, backed by Egypt, will press for an
Arab summit to discuss the peace process with Israel, particularly
the issue of Jerusalem, at a two-day Arab League meeting here
Sunday, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa and his four counterparts from Egypt, Tunisia, Oman
and Yemen agreed late Saturday to hold an annual Arab summit,
League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will next be put to the League's 22 foreign
ministers, Abdel-Meguid said. The proposal leaves it to this
weekend's meeting to set a date for an Arab summit, which has not
been held since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Syria hopes to convene an Arab summit as soon as possible to
study how we can meet the challenges which face the Arab nation,''
al-Sharaa told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The summit would review the Arab-Israeli conflict ''especially
the issue of Jerusalem,'' al-Sharaa said, adding that no part of
the city should be ''squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Egypt, Arab states have been involved in intensive
discussions over the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks which
foundered at Camp David in July over the issue of east Jerusalem.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered Palestinians limited
control, but Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held out for
sovereignty over the eastern sector, which contains the third
holiest shrine in the Islamic world as well as sites sacred to Jews
and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said this week that peace can
either be achieved ''now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian mediators have reportedly put forward a plan under
which Israel and the Palestinians would jointly administer east
Jerusalem during a five- to 10-year trial period.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Israel would control the Western Wall, the site
where Jews pray. The al-Aqsa mosque, which stands above and behind
the wall, would be under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who arrived in Cairo to attend the League meeting, has
long threatened to declare an independent Palestinian state on
Sept. 13. He is expected to ask Arab countries to support his move.
</P>
<P>
   League members are expected to endorse full Palestinian
sovereignty over east Jerusalem, but many states, including Egypt,
have already privately advised Arafat to postpone an independence
declaration so as not to jeopardize negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak are scheduled to discuss the peace process with
President Clinton on the margins of the U.N. Millennium Summit in
New York on Sept. 6-8.

	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The manager of a Trenton apartment complex
was found dead inside the trunk of his car late Thursday after he
was beaten and abducted outside the building, police said.
</P>
<P>
   John Thomas Newell, 72, was a month away from retiring and
returning to Michigan to be with his family.
</P>
<P>
   His body was discovered in the trunk of his 1992 Pontiac Sunbird
in a small park, Deputy Police Chief Paul Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were searching for the car after receiving a 911 call
from the building about an assault in progress. But by the time
police arrived, the assailant had driven off with Newell in the
victim's car.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said police did not have a motive for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy determined Newell was killed by a blow to the head.

<HEADLINE> Million Youth March a mellow gathering on a hot summer day  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Million Youth March turned into a gathering
of mere hundreds on a sweltering Saturday in Harlem, with
supporters eating ice cream and fanning themselves as they heard
fiery black-power speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Former Nation of Islam spokesman Khalid Abdul Muhammad blamed
the ''devil white media'' for the low turnout, saying they turned
down coverage when no controversy was involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the police permit granted for this third annual march
signalled that ''the black power movement has been reborn,'' he
told followers milling around for the disorganized start of the
rally at about noon on Malcolm X Boulevard and 122nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenters were still assembling the speakers' platform, and by
1:30 p.m., Muhammad's entourage was tacking up the black, green and
orange black-power flag.
</P>
<P>
   Police barricades set up to contain spectators on the boulevard
between 122nd and 125th streets remained empty as Muhammad
proclaimed the theme of this year's march: ''Black power into the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   ''By planting these seeds and rekindling that fire, we believe
we'll be well on our way to freedom and independence,'' said
Muhammad, the national chairman of the New Black Panther Party,
whose followers were dressed in all-black uniforms topped by berets
with a panther insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Police patrolled the area, some strolling around in shirtsleeves
over bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   But at about 4 p.m., the march permit deadline, police
surrounded the intersection at 122nd and the boulevard, and the two
sides faced off in a rowdy confrontation that ended quickly. No one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The city's police department was braced for any trouble at an
event that turned violent two years ago, when officers clashed with
the crowd in a bottle-and chair-throwing brawl. There were 28 minor
injuries then, including 16 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the
organizers that year and in 1999 while city officials tried to
block the event, claiming it was hateful and bigoted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's second march was peaceful, with an estimated 2,000
people attending.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, city officials quietly granted a permit
for Saturday's event, where Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he did not
expect any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad blamed shrinking crowds on the ''wicked campaign'' he
said authorities had launched against the march. But ''we beat
them,'' he said, adding that Giuliani and the police finally let
the march go ahead without a fight after the mayor ''was struck by
the curse of cancer, by an African god.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that numbers don't matter, though, saying the
march's real goal had already been accomplished - ''a movement has
been born.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, with temperatures in the 80s and a matching-high
humidity, there was another goal - just keeping cool.
</P>
<P>
   Chauntal James, a Harlem resident, came with her four children,
ages 11 months, 2 years, 5, and 8, ''and I brought plenty of water,
and crackers and candy.''

<HEADLINE> India: No Plans for Test Ban Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India does not intend to sign a global
treaty banning atomic testing in the near future, the country's
national security adviser said in comments published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Brajesh Mishra's comments on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
came just days before Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit
to the United States to address the United Nations and meet
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mishra, who is also the principle secretary to Vajpayee,
reiterated India's position that a decision on signing the treaty
would be made only after a political consensus was arrived in
India, the United News of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the weekly magazine Outlook, to be
published Sept. 11, Mishra said India had no plans to sign the
treaty ''before or after Mr. Vajpayee's visit.'' An advance copy of
the interview was made available to United News.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other nations imposed sanctions on India
and Pakistan and pressed them to join the treaty after the two
countries conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. The tests sparked
fears of a nuclear confrontation between the South Asian rivals,
particularly over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India has said it does not plan any more tests, but will not
succumb to pressure to sign a treaty that no nuclear power has
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is
divided between them. Both lay claim to the entire territory.
</P>
<P>
   Mishra also said Vajpayee would not meet with Pakistani military
ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who, along with dozens of world
leaders, will be in New York to attend the United Nations
Millennium Summit, running Wednesday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Group Head's Son Kills Self  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE TSAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- After Les Franklin's teen-age son committed
suicide, he channeled his grief into helping others and founded a
suicide prevention organization so other families wouldn't endure
similar tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   But ten years after the suicide of Shaka Franklin, Les Franklin
has found himself inexplicably reliving the same nightmare: His
troubled son, Jamon, committed suicide last month.
</P>
<P>
   Jamon, 31, was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a
remodeled blue Cadillac parked in a four-car garage at the family's
home, which doubles as headquarters for the Shaka Franklin
Foundation for Youth.
</P>
<P>
   Now Franklin is stepping away from that organization as he
struggles to deal with his confusion and grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get angry with myself even though I know if I had done
everything perfectly, this still could have happened,'' Franklin,
61, said. ''I just don't have it in me to go out and talk to kids
about taking their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk of suicide is thought to be up to 12 times higher for
people whose immediate family members have committed suicide, but
it is uncommon to find multiple suicides in a family because the
suicide rate is low, said Dr. David Brent, academic chief of child
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a rare occurrence,'' Brent said. ''It's just so
devastating when it does happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show 11 in 100,000 people committed suicide
nationally in 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of Northern Colorado, Franklin was
an Air Force lieutenant and IBM executive for 25 years. He also
directed the governor's Job Training Office, resigning in 1995 for
an unsuccessful run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Franklin returned home to find his 16-year-old son,
Shaka, had killed himself in a downstairs bedroom of the family's
7,200-square-foot home.
</P>
<P>
   Shaka's suicide was attributed to his mother's failing health
and an injury that ended his football season at Thomas Jefferson
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin resigned from his jobs and founded the Shaka Franklin
Foundation for Youth, which offered programs to help prevent
suicide among youths as well as helping underprivileged youth.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the boys' mother died of cancer and Franklin, who
had remarried, suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the losses had affected Jamon Franklin, Les Franklin
offered to get his son help, but he refused, pledging not to kill
himself as Shaka did.
</P>
<P>
   Jamon Franklin pressed ahead, graduating this summer from
Morehouse College in Atlanta. He took charge of Shaka Inner City
Edge, a program of the Shaka foundation which teaches inner-city
children how to skate and play hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives believed Jamon Franklin was in control.
''He was the type who was quiet,'' said Earleen Reed, Les
Franklin's cousin. ''That's what's so puzzling. He had such a good
rapport with the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Patton, one of his closest friends, said it was Jamon
Franklin who made sure everybody was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never gave me any indication that he needed to talk to
anyone about anything like this,'' Patton said. ''I'm wondering,
did the guy have a secret life that none of us knew about?''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and his wife, Marianne, knew the younger Franklin
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before he died, Jamon Franklin had threatened
suicide, brandishing a butcher knife and screaming because his
father had scolded him about dirty laundry in his room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared to death,'' Les Franklin said. ''I was so afraid
he would do what his brother did that I would give in really easy
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, the Franklins returned from an overseas wedding and
Marianne Franklin, 50, found Jamon Franklin's body. No note was
found.
</P>
<P>
   Les Franklin is bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not at the point where I want to remember any good things
about him,'' Franklin said, clenching his jaw. ''He promised me he
wouldn't do what Shaka did. He didn't keep his word.''
</P>
<P>
   His response is fairly typical for relatives of suicide victims,
said Dale Emme, executive director of the Yellow Ribbon Suicide
Prevention Program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people have to vent some kind of emotion somewhere, and
unfortunately, sometimes it's anger,'' said Emme, who also started
a suicide program after losing a son to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's a man who has endured a terrible loss,'' said Robert
Gebbia, executive director of the American Foundation for Suicide
Prevention, an acquaintance of the Franklin family. ''He's
absolutely in a state of shock. He needs time to work through this
on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her husband, Marianne Franklin has chosen to continue as
the foundation's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to lose ground. People who work here, they say,
'I don't want to come here. I don't feel right,' It upsets me,''
she said, wiping her eyes. ''I hate this.''

<HEADLINE> Foster Loses Bid To Seal Records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ezola Foster, the vice presidential candidate
on the Reform Party ticket, lost her bid to get a judge to seal the
workers' compensation records that detail a mental health condition
she claimed to have.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Semial R. Treadwell ruled Friday that the public's right
to know about Foster's claim for disability payments outweighed her
right to privacy. Treadwell agreed, however, to give Foster's
attorneys time to appeal his decision before making the records
public.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is the running mate of conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan, whose name is being printed on California ballots despite
an attempt in court by John Hagelin to appear as the party's
presidential candidate. Hagelin was nominated the party's candidate
in a splinter convention last month.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has been waging a battle with Hagelin for $12.6 million
in federal campaign financing earmarked for the party's nominee.
Buchanan's choice of Foster, an outspoken black conservative, was
seen by some as an attempt to buffer charges that Buchanan has a
record of racist statements.
</P>
<P>
   Foster has refused to disclose the mental health condition she
cited when filing a claim for disability payments in 1996, after
refusing to return to her job as a typing teacher at Bell High
School. She collected the payments, but told the Los Angeles Times
she never suffered from a mental disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The Times requested to see her records, prompting her to file a
motion to seal her workers' compensation file. Her attorney, Tanya
Garza-Sutton, argued that Foster was entitled to an amount of
privacy that protected highly sensitive information such as her
family history, mental health and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Foster did not return a phone call to her home Saturday from The
Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Milosevic May Face Rejection  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CVETOJEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Boza Markovic counts off
Yugoslavia's wars on his tobacco-stained fingers: first Slovenia,
then Croatia, then Bosnia and finally, worst of all, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now what?'' the 80-year old villager asks as he folds his
gnarled hand into a fist. ''Is there anything else to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Serbs are thinking about Yugoslavia's decade of
losses as they near Sept. 24 elections that are increasingly seen
as a referendum on the rule of Slobodan Milosevic. For the first
time since coming to power in 1990, pollsters insist, the Yugoslav
strongman may actually face the unthinkable: rejection by the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he could really lose this time,'' said Bratislav
Grubacic, a Belgrade political analyst who edits the influential
newsletter V.I.P. Daily News Report.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts here suggest Milosevic would be highly unlikely to
abide by such a result, given his record of tampering with earlier
ballots. If so, the question then would be whether he would seize
another term by force rather than accept the diminished status of
private citizen wanted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's problem is his challenger. The man who leads in
every independent poll is Vojislav Kostunica, 56, a soft-spoken law
professor known for his honesty and modest lifestyle. To a nation
that feels badly let down by its political class, Kostunica's
ordinariness and his artlessness as a politician are what make him
so popular.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll, by the prominent Institute for Social
Sciences, gave Kostunica 35 percent of the vote to Milosevic's 23
percent -- a big lead, though not enough to avoid a runoff ballot.
Two other candidates trail far behind with about 5 percent each,
with the remainder undecided. The poll gave no margin of error or
indication of how many people were questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in villages like Cvetojevac, 55 miles south of the
capital, Belgrade, Serbs are convinced that Milosevic will not go
down without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic's neighbor, Milivoje Nikolic, 89, comes from the same
pool of rural supporters that kept the autocratic ruler in office
year after year. Nikolic fought during World War II, endured
hardship under communism, and fears instability if there is a
change in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will do anything he can to stay in power,'' Nikolic said of
the man who clawed his way up from low-level communist-era
apparatchik to president of post-Cold War Yugoslavia. ''He may try
to provoke a war if he realizes he will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nikolic has had enough. In a garden overgrown with
flowers wilting in the late summer heat, he and his family
reminisce about the young people who have left the countryside,
unable to find work in an economy where unemployment is measured by
independent economists at 50 percent. They have seen inflation
erode pensions: An engineer's monthly 156 dinars, $13, now buy only
a few packs of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual income in Yugoslavia in 1990 was about
$3,250. A decade later it is $626.
</P>
<P>
   In cities scarred by last year's NATO bombing, where U.N.
sanctions have depleted the stores, life revolves around waiting in
line, starting at dawn when retirees gather outside grocery stores
to grab the cheapest cartons of milk. The longest lines are for
visas to leave the country. Hustlers spend the night outside
embassies and next morning sell their places in line for 30 German
marks ($15).
</P>
<P>
   Analysts suggest that if elections were free and fair, Milosevic
would face a runoff at the very least. Four candidates are seeking
the presidency, including a far-right candidate seen as siphoning
off support from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In timing the election for the fall, Milosevic appears to have
miscalculated. Though he began preparations months ago by shutting
down key independent media outlets, arresting his critics and
intimidating dissidents, he appears to have been caught off-balance
by the opposition's decision to nominate Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other opposition candidates photographed kissing the hand
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Kostunica's clear
condemnation of the 78-day NATO bombing campaign makes him
acceptable to people who feel betrayed by the West.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat lugubrious academic drives around in a small car
while other party leaders zip along in Mercedes-Benzes. He actually
campaigns, going door-to-door and listening to people's views -- a
concept unheard of in a country where the president is usually seen
only on television.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica also earns points for integrity, having never been
tainted by association with the regime or the communists. His
campaign slogan boasts that he is the only candidate that ''can
look you in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milosevic isn't acting too concerned. Though the
government has responded with campaigns to build apartment
buildings for young families, pay pensions and rebuild bridges
crushed by NATO bombers, Milosevic himself apparently sees little
need to attend rallies or present new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of a key Danube bridge destroyed by NATO,
tentatively slated for Sept. 15, is expected to be the only moment
he even appears in public before the election. It will be the high
point of a campaign featuring posters saying ''Sloba, Yes!'' -- a
play on words that also means ''freedom'' in Serbian. The type
appears over a man in a crowd whose hands are clasped, almost in
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's posters are guarded night and day by police and
hired muscle. The opposition's posters have been systematically
defaced, as have those of a group of independent monitors financed
by non-governmental agencies who will try to make sure the ballot
is fair.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much chance of fairness, however, Grubacic says. He
believes Milosevic can snatch as many as a million votes -- out of a
potential pool of about 6 million in Serbia proper -- in part by
inflating the number of Kosovo Serb refugees and having them vote
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grubacic is not alone in the assessment that Milosevic is
vulnerable for the time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksa Djilas, a commentator with intimate knowledge of the
regime, has said that the vote will probably go to a second round
and that even far-right voters will opt for Kostunica. Another
noted academic, Dragan Popadic of the University of Belgrade,
predicted that a vote pushing Milosevic out would prompt him to
lash out with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Voters like Markovic know that whatever the polls say, nothing
is guaranteed. While the retiree in Cvetojevac loudly criticizes
the failures of the last years, he holds his tongue when asked whom
he will vote for. He still has bread on his table. Things could get
worse.

<HEADLINE> Texans once accused of trying to sell stolen German art pay $135,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two heirs of a Texas soldier have agreed to pay
$135,000 in taxes, penalties and interest to settle a decade-long
dispute over the priceless religious artwork that he stole while
stationed in Germany in the final days of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached April 20 in federal tax court, but
was not publicly announced, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   It came after a decade of legal wrangling over the pieces taken
by Army Lt. Joe T. Meador, who in 1945 was assigned to guard a mine
where the Germans had hidden religious artifacts. The art, which
dated back to the ninth century, had been kept at the Quedlinburg
cathedral for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   Meador apparently mailed several pieces of the collection to his
Texas home. Among them was the ''Samuhel Gospels,'' a ninth century
manuscript written in gold, and the ''Evangelistar aus St.
Wiperti,'' a 16th century prayer book.
</P>
<P>
   When he died in 1980, his siblings inherited the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Meador's sister, Jane Meador Cook, 66, of Mesquite, Texas, and
his brother, Jack Meador, 80, of Whitewright, Texas, were accused
of trafficking in stolen goods after they tried to sell some of the
objects.
</P>
<P>
   But charges against them were dismissed in 1998 by a federal
judge in Sherman who ruled a prosecutor had collected evidence
beyond the lawful time limit.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement were provided by Don Lan, a tax lawyer
in Dallas who represented the lieutenant's brother and sister, and
the estate of Meador, who died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very favorable settlement,'' Lan said.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston lawyer, John Stephen Torigian, negotiated the sale of
the ''Samuhel Gospels'' for nearly $3 million in 1990 and was
trying to sell the prayer book when their origins were revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Germany demanded the return of the treasures, sparking an
international debate.
</P>
<P>
   The fight ended when the Meadors agreed to return the remaining
works, but were allowed to keep about $2.7 million from the sale of
the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   The government recently had been seeking $8.6 million in federal
taxes, $2.1 million in penalties and more than $40 million in
interest from the two siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys may have settled on the much smaller amount
because they recognized collection was unlikely, since Cook is the
widow of a dentist and Jack Meador runs a hardware store, said
Stanley Johanson, a professor of law at the University of Texas at
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal surprised and disappointed several legal experts
and art professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a slap on the wrist,'' said Thomas R. Kline, a
Washington lawyer who represented the German government in its
efforts to recover the Quedlinburg treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a lost opportunity to encourage dealers, museum people
and collectors to return stolen objects as a way of avoiding
significant estate tax liabilities. The reverse message was sent,''
Kline said.
</P>
<P>
   Constance Lowenthal, director of the World Jewish Congress'
Commission for Art Recovery, said she also was disappointed by the
settlement but hopes the ordeal will act as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Meadors have had 10 years without peace. And although the
criminal case against them failed on technical grounds, they must
now realize that selling their brother's loot was the wrong way to
go,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Jewish Pride Day Overshadowed  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- It is a day of Jewish cultural pride in
Europe: Jewish communities in 16 countries show off their
synagogues, museums and graveyards as a sign of an ancient and
once-thriving presence.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bologna in particular, Sunday's European Day of Jewish
Culture is tinged with the memory of a 6-year-old Jewish boy
abducted in 1858 during the papacy of Pius IX and virtually adopted
by the Italian pope.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is the day that Pope John Paul II has scheduled the
beatification of Pius IX, moving him to the last step before
possible sainthood. In the eyes of the tiny community of no more
than 40,000 Italian Jews, that move threatens to harm two decades
of efforts by the current pope for a reconciliation between the two
religions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunday should be a joyous moment, but instead there is also
this sad side,'' Franco Bonilauri, director of Bologna's Jewish
museum, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more than 200 Jews in today's Bologna, their
numbers reduced by expulsions under popes, deportations by the
Nazis and emigration. But their presence can be traced back at
least 600 years and a narrow street in the historic center is
called Via dei Giudei (street of the Jews). It was there in 1556
that Jews were segregated into a ghetto on the orders of Pope Paul
IV across the states then ruled by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the papacy's temporal power was eroding in the 19th
century, the case of 6-year-old Edgardo Mortara arose and took on
international attention. For the Vatican, Pius IX was the pope who
put papal infallibility and the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin
Mary into church doctrine. But for Italian Jews, the defining
moment of the papacy was the boy's kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Mortara had been secretly baptized when he was 2 by a Catholic
maid worried about his high fever, and church law at that time
required the church to take charge of any person baptized into the
Catholic faith. Papal guards took the boy away over his parents'
objections and put him in a Catholic boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an international campaign, Pius IX refused to return him
to his family. The Mortara youth later became a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians have called the case an important element in the
collapse of support for papal rule in Italy. Amos Luzzatto,
president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, called it
''the biggest wound that remains in the Italian Jewish world.''
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of Mortaro were among hundreds taking part in a
candelight protest Saturday in Rome on the eve of the
beatification. Speakers read from passages in Pius IX's own words,
including one in which he allegedly wrote that Jews were not
citizens but ''dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We always thought that this ordeal was in the past,'' Elena
Mortara, Edgardo's great-great niece, said, surrounded by the
Mortara family. ''We are sorry that it has become a scandal of the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a reopening of a wound,'' she said of Pius'
beatification.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials quoted in the Italian press have rejected
suggestions that the beatification was planned to balance that of
Pope John XXIII the same day. John, pope from 1958-63, reached out
to Jews and was much beloved by liberal Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilauri, summing up dismay in Jewish circles, said it seemed a
contradiction that the present pope, who visited Rome's main
synagogue in 1986 and prayed at the Western Wall in Jerusalem in
March, was carrying out the beatification of Pius.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Mortara case drew little attention in Italy.
Bologna's Jewish museum includes an exhibit on the Mortara boy, but
the former family home is unmarked and the leading work on the
case, a 1997 book, was written by an American, David I. Kertzer.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilauri said that in the past Italian Jews obviously preferred
to not take on the church. The beatification, however, has
galvanized protests, with Rome's Jewish community taking the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bologna's Jewish community is considering opening a new
large-scale exhibit on Mortara in its synagogue, which was rebuilt
in 1954 following damage in a World War II bombing raid.

<HEADLINE> Sweden May View Wreck Footage  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Sweden is considering launching a new
investigation into the sinking of the Estonia ferry in 1994, which
killed 852 people, but first wants to view footage filmed by a
privately funded diving expedition to the wreck, a Justice Ministry
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government should look at the material, then the different
ministries and experts should give their opinion,'' Camila Buzaglo,
spokeswoman for Justice Minister Mona Sahlin, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A team of divers said Friday that it had found what might be a
hole in the hull of the sunken ferry, as well as bodies outside the
ship, which went down in the Baltic Sea, casting doubt on the
official report.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Bemis Jr., a 71-year-old New Mexico businessman, and
German television producer Jutta Rabe told a news conference in
Hamburg, Germany, that they filmed evidence during a week of dives.
But they did not show footage of their findings, citing unspecified
legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has remained about a hole and possible explosion on
board, despite an official 1997 report by an
Estonian-Finnish-Swedish commission that blamed faulty locks on the
bow doors and a slow-to-react crew for the shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may start a new investigation,'' Sahlin was quoted as
saying on the Web site of the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet. ''There
was nothing in earlier investigations that indicated that there
were victims from the Estonia outside the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   She also refused to dismiss the possibility of raising the
wreck, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Estonia was en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm
when it went down on Sept. 28, 1994, during a storm off the coast
of Finland in one of Europe's worst maritime disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The German shipbuilder, Meyer-Werft, commissioned a separate
report that claimed poor maintenance of the locks was the cause of
the accident. It also said a bomb could have exploded on board --
which the commission ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement, signed by Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Denmark,
Lithuania, Russia and Britain, declared the wreck site a final
resting place for the ferry and the 758 unrecovered bodies, and
criminalized activities that would disturb it.
</P>
<P>
   The dives could not be legally stopped because the wreck lies in
international waters.

<HEADLINE> Another West Nile Victim in NY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed as the eighth
New York City resident struck this summer by the mosquito-borne
West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The woman -- the seventh victim from Staten Island -- became ill
Aug. 23 and was hospitalized five days later with encephalitis,
health officials said Saturday. The woman is improving but remains
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Two other victims also required hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven people in the New York area died from
virus-related symptoms and scores more were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, New Jersey officials said tests had confirmed that
state's first case in a 43-year-old Jersey City man.
</P>
<P>
   New York City continued pesticide spraying over the weekend in
an effort to reduce the mosquito population and halt the spread of
the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly and those with weakened immune systems have the
greatest risk of infection. Symptoms include a fever, headaches and
body aches, although severe infections can result in encephalitis,
an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the
brain's lining and the spinal cord.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Ray Harris rushed for two touchdowns as Towson
State scored the final 26 points en route to a 36-13 victory over
Fordham on Saturday, extending the Rams' losing streak to 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Harris scored on runs of 34 and 68 yards, finishing with 120
yards on eight carries.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Read had 16 carries for 116 yards, including a 12-yard
scoring run, for the Tigers (1-0, 1-0 Patriot League). Darnell
Evans scored on a 62-yard interception return, the second-longest
in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Gaskin had a 62-yard scoring run for Fordham (0-1, 0-1),
winless in 11 games last season. The Rams' last victory was 49-40
over Georgetown in the 1998 season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Colsant, who set a Fordham record for field goals in a
season with 12 last year, had kicks of 39 and 44 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskin's run gave the Rams their final lead of the game, 13-10,
at 7:35 of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Harris responded with his 34-yard run that gave the Tigers the
lead for good at 17-13 with 2:05 remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' interception return, second only to Ricky Crestwell's
72-yard run against Lafayette last season, increased Towson's
advantage to 23-13 at 5:32 of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' 68-yard run with 30 seconds remaining in the third, and
Kris Blake's 23-yard scoring pass to Billy Hayes at 9:53 of the
fourth completed the scoring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Descendants of a Jewish-born boy wrenched from his
family in the 19th century with the blessing of Pope Pius IX joined
hundreds in a candelight protest Saturday on the eve of Pius'
beatification.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II's planned declaration Sunday of Pius as among
the Roman Catholic Church's blessed ''is the reopening of a wound.
There's no doubt about it,'' said Elena Mortara, the abducted boy's
great-great niece.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's Catholic noble families, meanwhile, celebrated the
upcoming beatification with a Saturday church vigil, band and
shouts of ''Viva Pio Nono!,'' or ''Long Live Pius IX!''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's beatification of Pius IX and the 20th century's John
XXIII places the two predecessors of John Paul to the last formal
step before possible sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Italian and international Jewish groups have protested Pius'
beatification in large part because of the 1858 taking of
6-year-old Edgardo Mortara by papal guards. Church officials
ordered the boy removed from his Jewish family in Bologna after
hearing he had been secretly baptized by a Catholic housemaid.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pius' patronage, Edgardo grew up a church ward and later a
priest.
</P>
<P>
   ''That mother was deprived of her son,'' Giacomo Saban, an
Italian Jewish leader, told the crowd. ''The injury is still alive.
It's still felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers read from passages of Pius' writing, including
one in which he allegedly wrote Jews were not citizens but
''dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's ''glorification'' of Pius is a disappointment to
those -- like the Mortara family -- who welcomed the dialogue John
Paul had fostered among religions, Elena Mortara said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally troublesome was that the precept that governed the
taking of Edgardo remains church law today, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Church tradition holds that Catholics have a duty to baptize any
child -- Catholic or non-Catholic, with parents' permission or not --
if they believe the child's life in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always thought that this ordeal was in the past,'' Elena
Mortara said. ''We are sorry that it has become a scandal of the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Rome's aristocracy -- known as the ''black nobility'' because of
its historic allegiance to the Vatican's black-robed clerics --
passed the eve of the beatification in a solemn Latin Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long live Pius IX, Pontiff and King!'' the nobles shouted
afterward, while a band played hymns on the piazza outside.
</P>
<P>
   Pius IX, the son of a northern Italian count, was the last ruler
before the abolition of the centuries-old Papal States in the 1870s
largely did away with the church's temporal kingdom. During his
papacy, he put papal infallibility and the Immaculate Conception of
the Virgin Mary into church doctrine.

<HEADLINE> Highway authority plans new parkway interchanges, new tollbooths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey Highway Authority wants
to collect tolls at eight Garden State Parkway interchanges it
plans to add or improve in Cape May and Ocean counties.
</P>
<P>
   The authority, which operates the 173-mile toll road, announced
the proposal Friday, two months after it held public meetings on
the topic in Toms River and Cape May Court House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years, and regardless of location, the authority has
not built any new interchanges of this type without placing tolls
on them,'' the authority said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the authority receives no state tax revenues
and must fund parkway maintenance entirely from tolls. The proposed
tolls for the new interchanges range from 25 cents to 35 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the grass-roots group Citizens Against Tolls wants
the state to fund the parkway entirely, saying that would cut down
on air pollution by keeping cars moving.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our feeling is, the tolls should be eliminated, starting at
the north and working their way down,'' the group's founder,
Raymond Neveil of Brielle, told the Asbury Park Press for
Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The interchange improvements, primarily intended to improve
traffic flow and reduce congestion on local roads, include three
projects in Ocean County and five in Cape May County.
</P>
<P>
   In Cape May County, the projects would complete missing sections
of existing partial interchanges in Middle Township, Dennis
Township and Upper Township, with price tags of about $3 million,
$6 million and $8 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In Ocean County, projects include completing partial
interchanges in Ocean Township and Barnegat Township, at a cost of
about $9 million and $7 million, respectively. The other projects
there would add new interchanges in Lakewood Township (for about
$12 million), Dover Township (about $4 million) and Berkeley
Township (about $7 million).
</P>
<P>
   Citizens may send comments or questions about the proposal to
the executive director of the Woodbridge-based authority until Oct.
18.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton, and husband, hit the fair  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Following through on a promise to do
something her Republican Senate opponent didn't, Hillary Rodham
Clinton went to the State Fair Saturday and ate the sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping at Gianelli's Sausage stand, the first lady and
President Clinton ordered sausage, onion and pepper sandwiches
which she proclaimed to be ''great.'' Hillary Clinton, asked if she
really felt she was on a vacation with her one-day visit to the
area, said, ''sort of.''
</P>
<P>
   Before digging in, the first lady allowed the president to tie a
Dinosaur Barbecue handkerchief around her neck to serve as a bib.
Partway through their snack, the Clintons climbed onto the snack
bar's counter and sat there finishing their sandwiches and waving
to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were warmly received by the fair crowd but there
were a few signs for her opponent, Rick Lazio. One man waving a
Lazio bumper sticker shouted, ''Welcome to Buffalo, Hillary,'' an
obviously sarcastic reference to her recent move into New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the first lady promised more than 100 supporters at a
$1,000-a-person fund-raising barbecue that she would savor the
sausage at the annual fair. The fund-raiser was at the home of an
insurance broker friend of Syracuse-reared Terry McAuliffe, a top
fund-raiser for President Clinton who is lending his talents to
Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit of culinary one-upmanship in a Senate race that
polls indicate is very tight.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before the first lady spoke Friday night, McAuliffe
had pointedly told reporters: ''You go to the State Fair, you eat
sausages.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark served to call attention to Lazio's decision to pass
up the gastronomic delight when he visited the fair last week. The
congressman from Long Island has a chance to make amends Monday
when he visits the fair again.
</P>
<P>
   A stop at the fair has become something of a requirement for
candidates running for statewide office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Clintons spent five days vacationing in
nearby Skaneateles, the first lady and President Clinton stopped by
the fair to work the crowds. At the time, she had not formally
entered the race.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the now-official Senate candidate was once again
taking her husband, an even bigger celebrity draw than the first
lady herself, to the fairgrounds for a Saturday visit.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the Clintons received a warm welcome at a
fund-raiser on the shores of Cazenovia Lake, attended by about 200
people and expected to raise about $50,000 for the first lady's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During an almost-15-minute speech, the first lady again attacked
fiscal proposals offered by Lazio and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will vote against the kind of risky tax schemes my opponent
and Governor Bush have proposed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the reception inside was warm, outside it was a little
chillier. Across the road from the estate, a sign read ''It takes a
village to say no.'' On the sign, ''Hillary'' was circled and
crossed out.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, the Clintons' visit to Skaneateles this summer
was an abbreviated one. While they had originally planned to leave
on Sunday, having arrived on Friday afternoon, the Clintons were
heading back to Washington after Saturday's fund-raiser to be with
daughter Chelsea, who is nursing a summer cold and is worn out from
recent trips to Africa and Colombia with her father, according to
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Clintons stayed in Skaneateles at the lakeside
home of Thomas and Cathy McDonald, other friends of McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was reported that Thomas McDonald, a builder, had
an outstanding state income tax bill of almost $1 million. His
lawyer said the 1997 state tax bill, plus an IRS bill for an
undisclosed amount, stemmed from a real estate venture gone bad and
that McDonald is in discussions with state and federal officials
about paying off the tax debts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New York Post reported Saturday that the wife of
Jonathan Pollard, the American serving a life sentence for spying
for Israel, had written to the first lady seeking a meeting to
discuss possible clemency for her husband. A spokesman for the
Clinton campaign, Howard Wolfson, said such they look forward to
discussing a possible meeting with Mrs. Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Pollard's wife came after the first lady
successfully interceded with federal officials in an effort to keep
Pollard from being transferred to what his supporters felt was a
less-safe federal prison unit.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard's push for clemency has become an issue in the Senate
campaign, particularly within New York's Jewish community which can
be crucial in close statewide elections. Neither the first lady nor
Lazio has yet taken a position on the Pollard clemency request.

<HEADLINE> Small Crowd At Million Youth March  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Million Youth March turned into a gathering
of mere hundreds on a sweltering Saturday in Harlem, with
supporters eating ice cream and fanning themselves as they heard
fiery black-power speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Former Nation of Islam spokesman Khalid Abdul Muhammad blamed
the ''devil white media'' and city officials for the low turnout --
estimated by police at just over 100 -- saying news organizations
turned down coverage when no controversy was involved.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the fact that a permit for the third annual march
was granted this year without the legal wrangling seen in 1998 and
1999 signaled that ''the black power movement has been reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   The city had tried to block the march in its first and second
years, but a federal court sided with the march's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ''By planting these seeds and rekindling that fire, we believe
we'll be well on our way to freedom and independence,'' said
Muhammad, the national chairman of the New Black Panther Party,
whose followers were dressed in all-black uniforms topped by berets
with a panther insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Police patroled the event, which two years ago turned into a
bottle-and chair-throwing brawl that caused 28 minor injuries after
police in riot gear tried to enforce a court-ordered curfew.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, there was no violence and no injuries were
reported. The only verbal confrontation came when police began
enforcing the 4 p.m. deadline cited in the permit.
</P>
<P>
   The city estimated 6,000 people attended the 1998 march. Last
year's march was peaceful with an estimated 2,000 people attending.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Campaigns With Wife  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton, working hard at his new
job as second banana, gave a pair of brisk, workmanlike campaign
speeches for his Senate candidate wife this weekend. ''I want
Hillary to make the speech,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was the undercard at two campaign appearances in central New
York, which together brought in an estimated $150,000 for Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Since he symbolically handed leadership of the Democratic Party
to Vice President Al Gore last month, Clinton has also tried not to
step in Gore's spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   He praised his wife as a long advocate for children and
families, and as a politician who could lure economic development
to depressed and bypassed pockets of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton displayed only one flash of his customary colorful
oratory when discussing meat -- a topic outside the realm of typical
campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He drew cheers at Saturday's fund-raising speech by noting that
Mrs. Clinton had tucked into a sausage sandwich at the New York
State Fair here. Her Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, had earlier
begged off the local delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the other Senate candidate refused to eat a sausage
sandwich there, this one did not,'' Clinton exclaimed. ''Let's get
right down to the basic issues in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore their role reversal after some 25 years in
political life, it was Clinton who made sure the candidate did not
mess up her campaign clothes. He tied a bandanna around his wife's
neck before she ate.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the president waxed rhapsodic about barbecue
from a Syracuse rib joint called The Dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is flat pander, but I'm not running for office so I can
get away with it,'' he said. I have, for the last 27 years, eaten
barbecue for a living. I come from a place where barbecue is not
food, it is a way of life. It is a philosophy of human nature. I
have rarely had any as good as this.''
</P>
<P>
   During an overnight trip that the White House billed as a
working vacation, Clinton also took time for golf and some sidewalk
politicking in the Syracuse area.
</P>
<P>
   Although this part of New York is heavily Republican, the shops
in the nearby resort village of Skaneateles were decorated with
bunting and signs welcoming the Clintons. The first family took a
week's vacation in Skaneateles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pigtailed Amelia O'Hara, 7, held a sign that read ''Clintons
Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Clinton used his weekly radio address to
accuse GOP leaders in Congress of stalling legislation to raise the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now time for the Republican leadership to stop riding the
brakes on the minimum wage,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates that about 10 million workers now
earning between $5.15 and $6.14 an hour would directly benefit by
raising the minimum wage by a dollar. For a full-time worker now
earning the minimum wage, this increase would amount to a $2,000
annual raise.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed minimum wage legislation, but
efforts toward a compromise have been bogged down for months.
Democrats want to use money during these prosperous times to
increase the minimum wage. Republicans say that if the minimum wage
goes up, businesses should receive tax breaks to offset higher
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Possibility for a compromise brightened last Monday when House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., offered a proposal to raise the
minimum wage to $6.15 an hour over two years: 50 cents next Jan. 1
and 50 cents on Jan. 1, 2002. The proposal would provide business
tax breaks worth $76 billion over 10 years, down from $122.7
billion in an earlier House version of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Atlantic Storm Ernesto Called Small  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth named storm of
the 2000 hurricane season, formed early Saturday deep in the
Atlantic Ocean but posed no immediate threat to land, a
meteorologist said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a minimal tropical storm,'' said Eric Blake of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto's top sustained winds were near 40 mph Saturday, and its
tropical storm force winds extended 115 miles from its center. The
storm was about 600 miles east of the Leeward Islands, about 1,800
miles southeast of Florida, and moving northwest at about 15 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said Ernesto was expected to remain over open ocean at
least through Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rain, Cold Slow Pace of Fires  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A few days of rain have helped to slow the
spread of wildfires burning on hundreds of thousands of acres
across the Northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are probably the best conditions we've had since this
fire started,'' said Dan Kincaid, a fire information officer for a
81,000-acre fire near Townsend. ''I think it will allow
(firefighters) to make pretty good progress this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms had dropped as much half an inch of
rain on parts of Montana by Saturday and an inch or more elsewhere.
Highs only reached into the 70s, humidity was low and rain was
forecast through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It cooled things down. It cooled the fires down, the air down.
It took a lot of the smoke out. It made things so much more
bearable for the crews,'' said J.D. Coleman, information officer at
the Northern Rockies Coordination Center in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in Wyoming awoke to freezing temperatures Saturday
morning. The damp, cold conditions allowed commanders in the state
to start sending crews home or to other fires, and some
restrictions were lifted in Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Showers also slowed the spread of some of Idaho's 24 major
fires. The state's largest blaze, at 200,000 acres near Salmon, had
not expanded since Thursday -- the first time the blaze hasn't grown
since it started in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, fire officials still cautioned that many of the 27
blazes burning on more than 658,200 acres there were not yet
contained and could still jump fire lines if the weather changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning accompanying some of Friday's showers also ignited new
fires.
</P>
<P>
   While the wet weather has helped in the northern Rockies, more
than 200 new fires were reported Friday in Texas, Arkansas, Alabama
and Mississippi, an area that has been suffering through
triple-digit temperatures and drought conditions for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, counted 68
major fires burning across the country Saturday on 1.7 million
acres. So far this year, more than 74,000 fires blackened nearly
6.5 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Coleman said crews were relieved to have cool
weather but weren't naive enough to believe it would halt advancing
flames for good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire dragon sort of retreated into its lair for a bit,''
he said, ''but it's not gone.''

Gore Builds State-By-State Edge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore has come from behind to build a slight
lead over Republican George W. Bush in the race for state electoral votes, but
is still short of the total needed to win the presidency, according to an
analysis by The Associated Press. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia
are leaning Gore's way or solidly in his column at the Labor Day start of the
fall campaign, putting him at 201 electoral votes -- 69 fewer than the 270
required to win. Another 22 states with 179 electoral votes would go to the
Texas governor if the election were held today.

Foster Loses Bid To Seal Records

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ezola Foster, the vice presidential candidate on the
Reform Party ticket, lost her bid to get a judge to seal the workers'
compensation records that detail a mental health condition she claimed to have.
Judge Semial R. Treadwell ruled yesterday that the public's right to know about
Foster's claim for disability payments outweighed her right to privacy.
Treadwell agreed, however, to give Foster's attorneys time to appeal his
decision before making the records public. Foster is the running mate of
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, whose name is being printed on California
ballots despite an attempt in court by John Hagelin to appear as the party's
presidential candidate.

declaration Sunday of Pius as among the Roman Catholic Church's blessed ''is the

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Ernesto forms deep in Atlantic, poses no threat  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth named storm of
the 2000 hurricane season, formed early Saturday deep in the
Atlantic Ocean but posed no immediate threat to land, a
meteorologist said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a minimal tropical storm,'' said Eric Blake of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''It's no threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto originated from a tropical wave in the Atlantic. At 5
p.m. EDT, the storm was located about 600 miles east of the Leeward
Islands - at 17.8 north latitude, 52.7 west longitude. That's about
1,800 miles east-southeast of the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's top sustained winds were near 40 mph and tropical
storm force winds were extending 115 miles from its center. Ernesto
was moving west-northwest at 15 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time through (Monday) we expect it to remain over the
open ocean,'' Blake said.

Rain, Cold Slow Pace of Western Fires
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A few days of rain have helped to slow the spread of
wildfires burning on hundreds of thousands of acres across the Northern Rockies.
''These are probably the best conditions we've had since this fire started,''
said Dan Kincaid, a fire information officer for a 81,000-acre fire near
Townsend. ''I think it will allow (firefighters) to make pretty good progress
this weekend.'' Showers and thunderstorms had dropped as much half an inch of
rain on parts of Montana by today and an inch or more elsewhere. Highs only
reached into the 70s, humidity was low and rain was forecast through Wednesday.

Deaths in Colombia Fighting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PEREIRA, Colombia (AP) -- A U.S.-made Colombian warplane crashed today amid
heavy fighting between leftist rebels and government forces, killing seven
airmen, the military said. In addition, at least eight government soldiers and
12 rebels died in the ground combat at a communications complex on Mount
Montezuma, 155 miles west of the capital, Bogota. The clash was the bloodiest
since President Clinton visited Colombia on Wednesday to support President
Andres Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers and leftist rebels who protect
drug crops. The AC-47 Vietnam-era gunship crashed into a mountain as it returned
to base from the fighting, the Colombian air force said in a communique. There
were no survivors, and all those aboard were Colombian, the air force said.

Gore Builds State-By-State Edge

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the race for state electoral votes Democrat Al Gore has
come from behind to build a slight lead over Republican George W. Bush, but is
still short of the total needed to win the presidency, according to an analysis
by The Associated Press. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia are
leaning Gore's way or solidly in his column at the Labor Day start of the fall
campaign, putting him at 201 electoral votes -- 69 fewer than the 270 required
to win. Another 22 states with 179 electoral votes would go to the Texas
governor if the election were held today.

Atlantic Storm Ernesto Called Small
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth named storm of the 2000
hurricane season, formed early today deep in the Atlantic Ocean but posed no
immediate threat to land, a meteorologist said. Ernesto's top sustained winds
were near 40 mph today, and its tropical storm force winds extended 115 miles
from its center. The storm was about 600 miles east of the Leeward Islands,
about 1,800 miles southeast of Florida, and moving northwest at about 15 mph.
Eric Blake of the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Ernesto was expected
to remain over open ocean at least through Monday.

   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- An experimental drug could make breathing much easier
for millions of people suffering from ''smoker's lung,'' new research suggests.
In tests involving 500 people who had suffered from chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease for more than a decade, the drug appeared to be safer and
better at improving breathing and at reducing infections and hospital visits
than the best current treatment, researchers said. They were addressing
scientists at the World Congress on Lung Health, which concluded Saturday. The
inhaled drug, Spiriva, could be available as soon as 2002.

<HEADLINE> Police find body of Annemarie Cussano  </HEADLINE>
syfonstv
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUFFIELD, Conn. (AP) - The body of a Shelton woman who
disappeared in 1998 was found Saturday, a day after the man last
seen with her was charged with her murder, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford police said the remains of Annemarie Cusano were found
in a wooded area near Boston Neck Road.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were led to the body by Gregory McArthur, who
was extradited to Connecticut from a Massachusetts prison Friday to
face murder charges in Cusano's death. The chief state medical
examiner confirmed the remains were that of Cusano through dental
records.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not comment on how Cusano was killed. Sgt. Eddie
Rivera said he was waiting for the medical examiner to confirm
McArthur's version of events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we just have his word to go on,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur was the last person seen with Cusano before she
disappeared Jan. 3, 1998, leaving behind twin 16-year-old
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Through cellular phone records, police traced Cusano to
McArthur's room in a Hartford boarding house, where a bloody bag of
clothing was found. Cusano's car also was found parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, police searched several areas for
Cusano's body, including the more than 600-acre Keney Park in
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   A murder warrant was issued in February 1999 for McArthur, who
is serving 10 to 15 years in a Massachusetts prison for unrelated
assault and motor vehicle theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur last month agreed to return to Connecticut to face the
charges. He is the first person arrested in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her disappearance, Cusano, 43, worked for
Executone Information Systems Inc. in Milford and was reportedly
working part-time at an escort service. Police believe she was
answering a call from McArthur the night she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur, 39, is charged with murder, felony murder and
first-degree robbery. He is being held on $800,000 bail and is
scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Hartford Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur, whose criminal record includes convictions for
robbery, larceny and violation of probation, was released from jail
in Connecticut four months before Cusano's disappearance. He had
served more than six years for violating probation on robbery and
sexual-assault convictions.

<HEADLINE> Company Warns on School Bus Brakes  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTINE GONZALEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- One of the country's largest school bus
builders is warning that 6,000 of its school buses may have
defective brake systems and 40,000 other buses may be affected
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The defect involves the anti-lock brake system on buses
manufactured between March 1998 and last month, said Debi
Nicholson, a spokeswoman for Freightliner Corp., the Portland-based
parent company of Thomas Built Buses Inc.
</P>
<P>
   When the buses are moving slowly, less than 20 miles per hour,
they can temporarily lose their braking ability for up to three
seconds, Nicholson said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was discovered by the brake system's maker, Bendix
of Elyria, Ohio, which told Freightliner in June that a San
Francisco school bus had experienced a ''temporary loss of brake
capability.'' The driver was able to bring the bus to a safe stop.
</P>
<P>
   No accidents have been directly linked to the brake systems, and
Bendix spokesman Rick Batyko said Saturday that the system's
emergency brake still works.
</P>
<P>
   Several other bus manufacturers use the same system, Batyko
said. In all, more than 40,000 buses have potentially defective
brake systems, he said. He said many of those buses were built by
International.
</P>
<P>
   Batyko said it is only under ''very rare circumstances'' that a
school bus brake system would completely fail.
</P>
<P>
   The brake system's electronic control units can ''misinterpret''
certain signals from the wheels, resulting in the temporary loss of
braking capability ''in one or more wheel positions,'' Thomas Built
wrote in an Aug. 30 letter sent to hundreds of school districts
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company said repair kits were being manufactured and would
be shipped by November. Meanwhile, Freightliner dealerships are
prepared to inspect buses around the clock, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly trying to react as quickly as possible,''
Nicholson said Saturday. ''We wanted schools to have an opportunity
to inspect their buses before school starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have discussed the problem with officials from
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Thomas Built, based in High Point, N.C., were
unanswered Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   School officials can call Freightliner's help line --
800-FTL-HELP -- to arrange inspections.

<HEADLINE> White House Urged Babbitt's Apology  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, at the
urging of the White House chief of staff, apologized in 1997 for
misleading Sen. John McCain, a special prosecutor's report says.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 letter from Babbitt to McCain misled the Arizona
Republican senator about Babbitt's contacts with backers of a
proposed American Indian casino in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the publication of an Associated Press story
describing the misleading letter, then-White House Chief of Staff
Erskine Bowles summoned Babbitt to the White House to discuss the
matter, according to the report from special prosecutor Carol Elder
Bruce. The 600-page report, released last week, says Bruce did not
find enough evidence to prove Babbitt either denied the casino
application because of political donations or knowingly lied to
Congress about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   During the Columbus Day 1997 meeting, ''Bowles told Babbitt that
lying to a United States senator was unacceptable and serious
business,'' the report said. ''Bowles also told Babbitt that he
should call Sen. McCain to make amends.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt did. McCain later told investigators that Babbitt said,
''John, I misled you and owe you an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's report notes that Babbitt did not admit he intended to
mislead McCain but did not deny intentionally misleading the
senator, either.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department spokesmen did not return telephone messages
seeking comment Friday. McCain was vacationing and recovering from
skin cancer surgery Friday and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was appointed in 1998 to investigate Babbitt's involvement
in the 1995 decision to veto three Wisconsin Chippewa bands' plan
for a casino on the site of a financially foundering greyhound
track. Paul Eckstein, a lawyer for the Chippewa who once ran
Babbitt's Arizona gubernatorial campaign, said Babbitt suggested
political donations from competing tribes helped scuttle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein said Babbitt told him that Harold Ickes, then a deputy
White House chief of staff, had pressed him to make a decision on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has said he never had contact with Ickes on the case and
just said that to get a pesky Eckstein out of his office. Babbitt
has said political donations played no role in the casino decision
-- which is being reconsidered after the Chippewa bands sued.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt wrote to McCain in 1996, disputing Eckstein's
description of Babbitt's reference to Ickes. Babbitt later admitted
making the reference to Ickes in a letter to Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. (AP) - Divers on Saturday recovered the body
of a Connecticut man killed after two boats collided the night
before on Lake George.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County Sheriff Larry Cleveland said divers found the body
of Graziano Sollenne, 34, of Stratford, Conn., in 32 feet of water
about 250 feet from the shore. They were guided to the site by a
witness who saw the boat accident from a nearby island.
</P>
<P>
   Sollenne's companion, 30-year-old Pamela Ruggio, also of
Stratford, remained in critical condition Saturday night at Albany
Medical Center Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies said their boat was struck by another piloted
by 33-year-old Robert Bruno, of Hyde Park, at 5:30 p.m. Bruno was
uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland said it appears driver inattention contributed to the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first things we look for, alcohol and speed, do not appear
to be factors,'' Cleveland said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies said this was the first fatal accident this year on the
lake 53 miles north of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Clinton campaigns with wife, pushes minimum wage boost  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - President Clinton, working hard at his new
job as second banana, gave a pair of brisk, workmanlike campaign
speeches for his Senate candidate wife this weekend. ''I want
Hillary to make the speech,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was the undercard at two campaign appearances in central New
York, which together brought in an estimated $150,000 for Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Since he symbolically handed leadership of the Democratic Party
to Vice President Al Gore last month, Clinton has also tried not to
step in Gore's spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   He praised his wife as a longtime advocate for children and
families, and as a politician who could lure economic development
to depressed and bypassed pockets of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton displayed only one flash of his customary colorful
oratory when discussing meat - a topic outside the realm of typical
campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He drew cheers at Saturday's fund-raising speech by noting that
Mrs. Clinton had tucked into a sausage sandwich at the New York
State Fair here. Her Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, had earlier
begged off the local delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the other Senate candidate refused to eat a sausage
sandwich there, this one did not,'' Clinton exclaimed. ''Let's get
right down to the basic issues in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore their role reversal after some 25 years in
political life, it was Clinton who made sure the candidate did not
mess up her campaign clothes. He tied a bandanna around his wife's
neck before she ate.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the president waxed rhapsodic about barbecue
from a Syracuse rib joint called The Dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is flat pander, but I'm not running for office so I can
get away with it,'' he said. ''I have, for the last 27 years, eaten
barbecue for a living. I come from a place where barbecue is not
food, it is a way of life. It is a philosophy of human nature. I
have rarely had any as good as this.''
</P>
<P>
   During an overnight trip that the White House billed as a
working vacation, Clinton also took time for golf and some sidewalk
politicking in the Syracuse area.
</P>
<P>
   Although this part of New York is heavily Republican, the shops
in the nearby resort village of Skaneateles were decorated with
bunting and signs welcoming the Clintons. The first family took a
week's vacation in Skaneateles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pigtailed Amelia O'Hara, 7, held a sign that read ''Clintons
Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Clinton used his weekly radio address to
accuse GOP leaders in Congress of stalling legislation to raise the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now time for the Republican leadership to stop riding the
brakes on the minimum wage,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates that about 10 million workers now
earning between $5.15 and $6.14 an hour would directly benefit by
raising the minimum wage by a dollar. For a full-time worker now
earning the minimum wage, this increase would amount to a $2,000
annual raise.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed minimum wage legislation, but
efforts toward a compromise have been bogged down for months.
Democrats want to use money during these prosperous times to
increase the minimum wage. Republicans say that if the minimum wage
goes up, businesses should receive tax breaks to offset higher
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Possibility for a compromise brightened last Monday when House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., offered a proposal to raise the
minimum wage to $6.15 an hour over two years: 50 cents next Jan. 1
and 50 cents on Jan. 1, 2002. The proposal would provide business
tax breaks worth $76 billion over 10 years, down from $122.7
billion in an earlier House version of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Warrant for search of ex-parole chief lists suspicion of bribery, conspiracy and misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The search warrant used to carry out a raid
on the home of former state Parole Board chairman Andrew Consovoy
listed suspicion of bribery, conspiracy and official misconduct as
probable cause to carry out the raid, according to a published
report.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Saturday's editions that
the FBI has joined New Jersey investigators in examining
allegations that as head of the parole board, Consovoy personally
benefitted by handing out favors to jailed mobsters and other
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators seized 10 to 15 boxes of documents from Consovoy's
Mount Laurel home on Aug. 5, including parole board documents, and
personal banking and telephone records, the newspaper reported,
citing unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   Consovoy, 52, could not be reached for comment by the newspaper,
but has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He cited health problems
in stepping down from the board in July. He remains on sick leave
until his resignation becomes effective on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   State police detectives are reportedly examining what steps
Consovoy took before Michael Perna, a one-time lieutenant with the
Lucchese crime family, was paroled from state prison in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Perna was in federal custody. He was
sentenced eventually to 25 years on new federal and state charges.
</P>
<P>
   Perna's parole came after a meeting with Consovoy, who then
recommended parole. The chairman has defended his actions as
proper, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also examining the release of other
mob-connected felons as well as other inmates under Consovoy's
tenure, according to reports.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe Theft of $2M Violin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Police are investigating the reported theft of a
$2 million violin from an unlocked apartment closet.
</P>
<P>
   A man called police Thursday to report that his Stradivarius
violin had been taken from the closet sometime in the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Tom Sexton said Boston authorities are
investigating. ''It's not an everyday occurrence that someone
claims to have a $2 million musical instrument missing,'' Sexton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dohoon Rhee, 26, told police he had last seen the violin in May.
He said he had been out of the country for more than a month and
when he returned, the violin was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Stradivarius violins are named for Antonio Stradivari, who made
more than 1,100 instruments famed for their tone and power.
Thousands of other violins bearing the ''Stradivarius'' name and
copying the original model have been made in tribute to Stradivari
since his death in 1737.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Rhee for comment Saturday were unsuccessful.
The phone number listed him had been disconnected.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PEREIRA, Colombia (AP) -- A U.S.-made Colombian warplane crashed today amid
heavy fighting between leftist rebels and government forces, killing seven
airmen, the military said. In addition, at least eight government soldiers and
12 rebels died in the ground combat at a communications complex on Mount
Montezuma, 155 miles west of the capital, Bogota. The clash was the bloodiest
since President Clinton visited Colombia on Wednesday to support President
Andres Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers and leftist rebels who protect
drug crops. The AC-47 Vietnam-era gunship crashed into a mountain as it returned
to base from the fighting, the Colombian air force said in a communique. There
were no survivors, and all those aboard were Colombian, the air force said.

Small Crowd At Million Youth March
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Million Youth March turned into a gathering of mere
hundreds on a sweltering Saturday in Harlem, with supporters eating ice cream
and fanning themselves as they heard fiery black-power speeches. Former Nation
of Islam spokesman Khalid Abdul Muhammad blamed the ''devil white media'' and
city officials for the low turnout -- estimated by police at just over 100 --
saying news organizations turned down coverage when no controversy was involved.
But he said the fact that a permit for the third annual march was granted this
year without the legal wrangling seen in 1998 and 1999 signaled that ''the black
power movement has been reborn.''

Gore Builds State-By-State Edge

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the race for state electoral votes Democrat Al Gore has
come from behind to build a slight lead over Republican George W. Bush, but is
still short of the total needed to win the presidency, according to an analysis
by The Associated Press. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia are
leaning Gore's way or solidly in his column at the Labor Day start of the fall
campaign, putting him at 201 electoral votes -- 69 fewer than the 270 required
to win. Another 22 states with 179 electoral votes would go to the Texas

Atlantic Storm Ernesto Called Small
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth named storm of the 2000
hurricane season, formed early today deep in the Atlantic Ocean but posed no
immediate threat to land, a meteorologist said. Ernesto's top sustained winds
were near 40 mph today, and its tropical storm force winds extended 115 miles
from its center. The storm was about 600 miles east of the Leeward Islands,
about 1,800 miles southeast of Florida, and moving northwest at about 15 mph.
Eric Blake of the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Ernesto was expected
to remain over open ocean at least through Monday.

throwing the first two touchdown passes of his career as Notre Dame held off No.
25 Texas A&AMP;M 24-10 today before a jittery crowd of 80,232. Irish coach Bob Davie

Battle loosened up late in the first half and finished with scoring passes of 9
yards to Joey Getherall and 46 yards to Javin Hunter.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Internationally recognized photographic
research scientist Thomas Howard James died Aug. 24 after a brief
illness. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for Eastman Kodak Co. for 42 years starting in 1936.
He researched the development of photographic film, latent image
effects, and chemical and spectral sensitization and was awarded
numerous patents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to teaching photographic theory at Rochester
universities and writing 150 scientific papers, James wrote and
edited books on photographic theory and edited ''Photographic
Science and Engineering'' magazine for more than a decade.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Theodore W. Trautwein, a New Jersey
appellate judge who once sent a New York Times reporter to jail for
refusing to reveal his sources died Aug. 17 of heart failure. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Times reporter M.A. Farber refused to surrender notes
of interviews he conducted while preparing stories on Dr. Mario E.
Jascalevich, who was charged with killing three patients by
injecting them with lethal doses of a muscle relaxant.
</P>
<P>
   Trautwein found Farber and The Times guilty of criminal
contempt. He sentenced Farber to six months in jail and fined the
newspaper $5,000 a day until the notes were turned over.
</P>
<P>
   Farber spent about 40 days in jail before he was released,
shortly before Jascalevich was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   As a judge in Bergen County in the 1960s and 70s, Trautwein
upheld laws that granted state oversight to the Hackensack
Meadowlands and financed the sports complex that now houses major
league football, hockey and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He was named to the state Appellate Division in 1981.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Defense Sites  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- U.S. jets bombed air defense
sites in southern Iraq on Saturday after allied planes came under
missile attack, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   All the planes returned safely from the strike, and the military
is assessing the damage, according to a press release from MacDill
Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sites were targeted to further degrade Iraq's ability to
jeopardize coalition pilots and aircraft enforcing United Nation's
mandates,'' the military said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word from Iraqi officials about any
damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The last air strike against Iraqi air defense sites was
Wednesday. Iraq claimed the strike hit a village, injuring three
people, including a child.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have been enforcing no-fly zones
over northern and southern Iraq since the end of the Gulf War in
1991. Iraq regards the zones violations of its territorial
sovereignty and has been challenging the patrols since December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The zones were set up ostensibly to protect Shiite Muslims in
the south and Kurds in the north from attacks by Iraq's army.

<HEADLINE> Deaths in Colombia Fighting  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEREIRA, Colombia (AP) -- A U.S.-made Colombian warplane crashed
Saturday amid heavy fighting between leftist rebels and government
forces, killing seven airmen, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least eight government soldiers and 12 rebels
died in the ground combat at a communications complex on Mount
Montezuma, 155 miles west of the capital, Bogota. The clash was the
bloodiest since President Clinton visited Colombia on Wednesday to
support President Andres Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers
and leftist rebels who protect drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The AC-47 Vietnam-era gunship outfitted with .50-caliber machine
guns crashed into an 11,200-foot-high mountain at about 5 a.m. as
it returned to base from the fighting, the Colombian air force said
in a communique. There were no survivors, and all those aboard were
Colombian, the air force said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Gen. Jairo Garcia insisted the plane was not shot
down. He said poor visibility may have been a factor, because the
crash happened just before dawn in cloudy weather.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which was used extensively by U.S. forces during the
Vietnam War and was known as ''Puff the Magic Dragon,'' had been
providing fire support for the ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had equipped the plane with Forward-Looking
Infrared Sensors, or FLIRS, and night-vision goggles, said Gen.
Hector Velasco, Colombia's air force chief. The pilots had been
trained in night-flying either by U.S. military pilots or by other
Colombian pilots who had received training from the Americans,
Velasco told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began Friday afternoon at the communications
complex, which controls cellular and other telephone links to much
of western Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
attacked about 50 government soldiers at the complex, said Gen.
Fernando Tapias, commander in chief of Colombian military forces.
The rebels were repelled by the government forces and
reinforcements from the provincial capital, Pereira, military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Pastrana, Tapias and other military brass
visited the communications complex aboard a U.S.-made Black Hawk
helicopter. Tapias said government troops were still clashing with
retreating rebels nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Army helicopters ferried some of the rebel dead to a base in
Pereira. Five rebel corpses -- four men and a woman -- were laid out
on the grass under a huge sheet. The number of confirmed rebel dead
stood at 12.
</P>
<P>
   Tapias called the rebel assault an ''all-around failure''
because they failed to capture the complex. Up to 50 rebels may
have died, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five government soldiers based at the communications complex
were killed in the fighting, said army Gen. Nestor Ramirez Mejia.
In addition, battalion commander Lt. Col. Jorge Sanchez Rodriguez
and two of his soldiers died when rebels ambushed them as they
rushed to reinforce the complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group, called by their Spanish acronym, FARC, have
been fighting Colombia's government for some 36 years. They control
vast tracts of southern jungle, financing their insurgency by
taxing peasants who grow drug crops and protecting drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, Washington is sending
60 combat helicopters to government security forces and elite U.S.
troops are training Colombian anti-narcotics army troops.

<HEADLINE> Campaign to keep workers from commuting gains momentum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA, N.Y. (AP) - Employers in western New York are turning to
the highways to keep workers from going to Rochester and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   A billboard campaign that started in Ontario County is being
expanded to three other counties, asking drivers, ''Why Commute?
Great jobs are abundant in Ontario County.'' It also informs
would-be employees how to find out about regional job openings.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the billboards will substitute ''Ontario County'' with
''Wayne, Finger Lakes Region.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first billboard campaign far exceeded our expectations,''
said Michael Manikowski, director of Ontario County's Office of
Economic Development and Industrial Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since the initial project was launched in January, 604 job
seekers registered for the service and 60 different companies
listed a total of 622 employment openings.
</P>
<P>
   Employers in Ontario and surrounding counties say there is a
shortage of skilled workers to fill openings at their companies.
Last year, Manikowski's office embarked on a mission to develop and
retain a work force to fill some of the vacancies, with a goal of
making the county the ''home of the technical worker.''

	   MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) - The field was slippery and it had been
raining most of the day, so Hofstra was taking no chances on its
late-game field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to kick it on third down in case of a bad snap,''
Hofstra coach Joe Gardi said. ''But the wind just died down. I
guess we've been going to church.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Johnson was good on the 40-yarder with 46 seconds remaining
Saturday to lift Hofstra to a 10-9 upset of Montana in a
season-opening game featuring two nationally ranked NCAA Division
I-AA teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I hit it well, but I didn't know if it was going
straight until I looked up,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 11 Pride capitalized on two key fumbles by Montana's
Yohance Humphery and a missed extra point attempt to outlast the
second-ranked Grizzlies in a defensive struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew we were going to be good on defense, but we shut down a
mighty good football team,'' Gardi said. ''That's one of the best
wins we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana outgained Hofstra 346-331 yards in total offense, but
the normally prolific Grizzly offense could score only one
touchdown in coach Joe Glenn's debut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Statistically we put nearly 350 yards of offense on the
field,'' Glenn said. ''But in the red zone and in short yardage
offense where we've got to convert, that needs work.''
</P>
<P>
   A swarming Hofstra defense also sacked quarterback Drew Miller
four times and stuffed the Grizzly running game, holding Humphery -
who rushed for more than 1,200 yards last year - to just 67 yards
on 20 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Montana opened the scoring with a 20-yard field goal by freshman
Chris Snyder with 6:22 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra took a 7-3 lead on a 10-yard touchdown run by
quarterback Rocky Butler with 13:05 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Thorne recovered Humphery's first fumble on the Hofstra
2-yard-line with 5:14 to play in the third quarter, ending one of
Montana's most promising drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies finally got into the end zone with 9:02 remaining
when receiver Jimmy Farris scored on a 7-yard end around. However,
Hofstra twice blocked the extra point attempt by Snyder, who got a
second chance after a Pride penalty. The Grizzlies led 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time the ball hit the grass, the holder couldn't
hold it and the kicker slipped,'' said Montana coach Joe Glenn.
''The second time a guy jumped over and pulled our snapper's face
mask.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies appeared to have the game in hand after safety
Jason Miller recovered a Trevor Dimmie fumble on the Montana 32
with 3:22 to play. But on a third-and-5 from their own 37, Humphery
fumbled again after taking a swing pass from Miller with 1:35
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was recovered on the Montana 29 by Jayar Santos. Dimmie
ran the ball twice, for a total of 6 yards, before Johnson kicked
the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Offensively we played great as a unit,'' Farris said. ''We did
everything we wanted. We just had a few breakdowns and a few
penalties that kept us from getting in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana got the ball one more time, but could only move to their
own 36. After three incomplete passes by Miller, the Grizzlies
turned the ball over with 14 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Butler completed 16 of 28 passes for 195 yards, including nine
passes for 125 yards to Charles Adams. Dimmie rushed for 122 yards
for Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   Miller completed 23 of 34 passes for 304 yards for Montana,
which lost an unprecedented third straight game at
Washington-Grizzly Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides played hard and gave it a great effort. But we
didn't get enough points on the board,'' Glenn said. ''But that's
also a pretty good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Sao Alosi had 10 tackles for the Pride, while
defensive end Khari Williams had two sacks. Linebacker Adam Boomer
recorded 10 stops for Montana.

   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A few days of rain have helped to slow the spread of
wildfires burning on hundreds of thousands of acres across the Northern Rockies.
Dan Kincaid, a fire information officer for a 81,000-acre fire near Townsend
said ''These are probably the best conditions we've had since this fire

parts of Montana by today and an inch or more elsewhere. Highs only reached into

<HEADLINE> Tax Sum Settled for Stolen Art  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two siblings have agreed to pay $135,000 in
taxes, penalties and interest to settle a decade-long dispute over
priceless religious artwork their brother stole while stationed in
Germany during World War II, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Meador Cook, 66, and Jack Meador, 80, were accused of
trafficking in stolen goods after they tried to sell some of the
objects brought home after the war by their late brother Joe T.
Meador from a mine he had been assigned to guard where Germans
stored hidden religious artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items was the ''Samuhel Gospels,'' a ninth century
manuscript written in gold,'' which Cook and Meador sold in 1990
for nearly $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadors, who both live in northeast Texas, agreed to return
the remaining works to Germany, but were allowed to keep about $2.7
million from the sale of the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal charges were thrown out because the statute of
limitations had expired, leaving only the tax case. The settlement
was reached April 20 in federal tax court, but was not publicly
announced, The Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very favorable settlement,'' said tax lawyer Don Lan,
who represented the heirs and provided details of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the government had been seeking $8.6 million in
federal taxes, $2.1 million in penalties and more than $40 million
in interest from the siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Kline, a Washington lawyer who represented the German
government in its efforts to recover the treasures, called the
settlement ''a slap on the wrist.''

<HEADLINE> Marlton man swept away in Delaware River, presumed drown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EWING, N.J. (AP) - State police will resume a search Sunday for
a Marlton man who was swept away by swift currents in the Delaware
River Saturday afternoon while swimming and fishing with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The man is presumed to have drowned, Trooper Adam Wrede of the
Wilburtha Barracks said Saturday night. The 24-year-old man's
identity was being withheld until family members could be notified.
</P>
<P>
   Wrede said the incident happened about 2:20 p.m., a quarter mile
north of the Scudders Falls Bridge where the group of six people
had been swimming and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was wading in the river and went to an area that was
deeper - about 12 feet deep - when he was pulled under and away by
the current, which Wrede said was stronger than normal because of
recent rains.
</P>
<P>
   Wrede said one of the victim's companions tried to save him but
was couldn't. That person was not injured, Wrede said.
</P>
<P>
   State police searched the river for about five hours, using a
helicopter, boats and divers. The search will resume 8 a.m. Sunday
with divers and boats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrede said statements from witnesses led police to conclude the
man likely had drowned. The victim's companions described him as a
weak swimmer. The man also was not wearing a lifejacket.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Plane Crashes in Fighting  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEREIRA, Colombia (AP) -- A U.S.-made Colombian warplane crashed
Saturday into an Andean mountainside amid heavy fighting between
leftist rebels and government forces, killing seven airmen, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least eight government soldiers and 12 rebels
died in the ground combat at a communications complex on Mount
Montezuma, 155 miles west of the capital, Bogota. The clash
followed President Clinton's visit Wednesday to Colombia to support
President Andres Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers and
leftist rebels who protect drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The AC-47 Vietnam-era gunship outfitted with .50-caliber machine
guns crashed into an 11,200-foot-high mountain at about 5 a.m. as
it returned to base from the fighting, the Colombian air force said
in a communique. There were no survivors, and all those aboard were
Colombian, the air force said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Gen. Jairo Garcia said the plane was not shot down.
Poor visibility may have been a factor since the crash happened
just before dawn in cloudy weather, he said. Colombian special
forces troops and civil defense teams were still unable to set down
on the crash site Saturday due to cloud cover.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million plane, which was used extensively by U.S. forces
during the Vietnam War and was known as ''Puff the Magic Dragon,''
had been providing fire support for the ground troops and lighting
up the night sky with massive flares.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had equipped the plane with Forward-Looking
Infrared Sensors, or FLIRS, and night-vision goggles, said Gen.
Hector Velasco, Colombia's air force chief. The pilots had been
trained in night-flying either by U.S. military pilots or by other
Colombian pilots who had received training from the Americans,
Velasco told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began Friday afternoon at the communications
complex, which controls cellular and other telephone links to much
of western Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
attacked about 50 government soldiers at the complex, said Gen.
Fernando Tapias, commander in chief of Colombian military forces.
The rebels were repelled with the help of reinforcements from the
provincial capital, Pereira, who were fired on repeatedly as they
hacked through the dense vegetation covering Mt. Mountezuma.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought them all the way up, from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m, hitting
them with machine gun fire and everything we had,'' said Col. Luis
Ardila, head of the army's 8th Brigade based in Pereira, who
commanded the reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Pastrana, Tapias and other military brass visited
the communications complex aboard a U.S.-made Black Hawk
helicopter. Tapias said government troops were still fighting the
retreating rebels nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Tapias called the rebel assault an ''all-around failure''
because they failed to capture the complex. Up to 50 rebels may
have died, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group, called by their Spanish acronym, FARC, have
been fighting Colombia's government for some 36 years. They control
vast tracts of southern jungle, financing their insurgency with
kidnappings and by taxing peasants who grow drug crops and
protecting drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, Washington is sending
60 combat helicopters to government security forces and elite U.S.
troops are training Colombian anti-narcotics army troops.

<HEADLINE> Atlantic Storm Ernesto: No Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth named storm of
the 2000 hurricane season, formed early Saturday deep in the
Atlantic Ocean but posed no immediate threat to land, a
meteorologist said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a minimal tropical storm,'' said Eric Blake of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto's top sustained winds were near 40 mph Saturday, and its
tropical storm force winds extended 115 miles from its center. The
storm was about 520 miles east of the Leeward Islands, about 1,700
miles southeast of Florida. It was moving west-northwest at about
15 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said Ernesto was expected to remain over open ocean at
least through Monday.

<HEADLINE> Braves 8, Astros 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla hit a go-ahead,
two-run single in the eighth inning as the Atlanta Braves defeated
the Houston Astros 8-6 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win, combined with the Mets' 2-1 loss to St. Louis earlier
in the day, lifted the Braves back into first place in the NL East
by a half game.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux (15-8) gave up five runs in the first inning, but
settled down and lasted 7 1-3 innings. Maddux, who lost five of his
previous eight starts, allowed six runs on 10 hits, struck out
eight and walked only one.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla came up with Brian Jordan at third and George Lombard,
pinch-running for Andres Galarraga, at second, and hit a single to
right center off reliever Octavio Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dotel's third blown save in 14 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker pitched a perfect ninth for his 18th save in 20
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (15-5), who won 11 of his previous 12 decisions,
allowed seven runs on seven hits, struck out eight and walked six
in 7 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Furcal hit his first major league home run leading off
the ninth against Jose Cabrera for the final run.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou hit a career-high three doubles, drove in two runs
and scored two for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Andruw Jones' 31st home run cleared the
tracks high above left field and would have gone out if the Enron
Field roof was retracted.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's bases-loaded double to the right-field corner then
drove in Chipper Jones and B.J. Surhoff for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Houston answered with five runs in the bottom of the first as
Richard Hidalgo's broken bat single to left drove in Bill Spiers
from third. Alou then doubled to left center to drive in Jeff
Bagwell and Hidalgo, tying the score 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey's 12th home run drove in Alou and gave Houston a
5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alou scored from third on Julio Lugo's infield grounder to
stretch the lead to 6-3 in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones' double to right center drove in Paul Bako and
Furcal to close the gap to 6-5 in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With his run scored in the first inning, Bagwell became
only the 17th major leaguer to score 500 runs over a four-year
period and only the third since 1950. The other two most recent
players to accomplish the feat were Mickey Mantle (1954-57 and
1955-58) and Craig Biggio (1995-98 and 1996-99). ... Meluskey is
only the eighth Astros rookie to hit 10 or more home runs and the
first since Bagwell (15) and Luis Gonzalez (13) both did it in
1991. ... Andruw Jones tied his career high for home runs. He also
had 31 in 1998. ... The crowd of 43,189 was the 24th sellout of the
year and the largest crowd at Enron Field.

Rain Slows Spread of Western Fires

   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A few days of rain have helped to slow the spread of
wildfires burning on hundreds of thousands of acres across the Northern Rockies.
Dan Kincaid, a fire information officer for a 81,000-acre fire near Townsend
said ''These are probably the best conditions we've had since this fire
started.'' Showers and thunderstorms had dropped as much half an inch of rain on
parts of Montana by today and an inch or more elsewhere. Highs only reached into
the 70s, humidity was low and rain was forecast through Wednesday.

   MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- The U.S. military said U.S. jets bombed
air defense sites in southern Iraq Saturday after allied planes came under
missile attack. According to a press release from MacDill Air Force Base near
Tampa, Fla. All the planes returned safely from the strike, and the military is
assessing the damage, ''The sites were targeted to further degrade Iraq's
ability to jeopardize coalition pilots and aircraft enforcing United Nation's
mandates,'' the military said. There was no immediate word from Iraqi officials
about any damage or casualties.

White House Urged Babbitt's '97 Apology

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the urging of the White House chief of staff, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt apologized in 1997 for misleading Sen. John McCain, a
special prosecutor's report says. A 1996 letter from Babbitt to McCain misled
the Arizona Republican senator about Babbitt's contacts with backers of a
proposed American Indian casino in Wisconsin. The day after the publication of
an Associated Press story describing the misleading letter, then-White House
Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles summoned Babbitt to the White House to discuss the
matter, according to the report from special prosecutor Carol Elder Bruce.

a double-digit lead in Vermont and an edge in Iowa. The new polls continue a
full week of Gore gains in the race, including key battleground states. The
latest poll results came out as Republicans launched a TV ad campaign, appearing

School Bus Company: Brakes Could Fail

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- One of the country's largest school bus builders is
warning that 6,000 of its buses may have defective brake systems. The company
that makes the systems said today that the same defect could affect as many as
300,000 commercial vehicles. When the vehicles are moving slowly, typically less
than 20 miles per hour, they can temporarily lose their braking ability for up
to three seconds, said Debi Nicholson, a spokeswoman for Freightliner Corp., the
Portland-based parent company of school bus maker Thomas Built Buses Inc.

   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Arnaz Battle made his first start a memorable one by
throwing the first two touchdown passes of his career as Notre Dame held off No.
25 Texas A&AMP;M 24-10 today before a jittery crowd of 80,232. Irish coach Bob Davie
began his fourth season knowing his job would be in jeopardy if the Irish failed
to get off to a winning start. It took a while, but Davie was a happy man after
Battle loosened up late in the first half and finished with scoring passes of 9
yards to Joey Getherall and 46 yards to Javin Hunter.

   MORAGA, Calif. (AP) -- Saint Mary's lost the season opener to
Sacramento State 24-21 as Hornet running back Charles Roberts
rushed for a game-high 219 yards for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento State scored on its first drive of the game when Mike
Wooster scored from two yards out just 4:58 into the game. Saint
Mary's answered on the ensuing drive when Papanikolas hit J.C.
Serrano for a 30-yard touchdown pass down the right sideline to tie
the score at 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, Roberts scampered for a 21-yard
touchdown run to give the Hornets a 14-7 lead, which they held onto
as time expired in the half.
</P>
<P>
   To open the second half, the Gaels drove 76 yards in nine plays
to cut the lead to 14-13. Then Jimmy Sanchez hit a 48-yard field
goal to give the Hornets a 17-13 lead heading into the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets upped the lead to 24-13 when Lamont Webb scored on a
24-yard touchdown reception from Ricky Ray with 9:48 remaining in
the game. Then with time running down, Papanikolas led the Gael
offense to a nine-play, 92 yard scoring drive to cut the score to
24-21 with just over a minute to play. On the ensuing kick off, the
Saint Mary's on side attempt was recovered by the Hornets to ice
the game.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Signs Farmworker Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis signed a farmworker safety
bill, then urged the United Farm Workers union to work with growers
in contract talks Saturday during the first address by a California
governor to a UFW convention in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Davis told more than 500 delegates at the UFW's 15th biennial
constitutional convention that negotiation, not confrontation,
would better serve workers' interests.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW should ''extend the hand of friendship to everyone,''
Davis said. ''If they are willing to sit with us at the bargaining
table, we can become working partners, not sparring partners.''
</P>
<P>
   As former Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of staff, Davis worked on the
1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act, the landmark law that
recognized the collective bargaining rights of the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was the last governor to address the UFW's constitutional
convention, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to say whether he would sign new legislation,
described as necessary by UFW President Arturo Rodriguez, that
would penalize farm-labor contractors who fail to pay their workers
and stiffen licensing requirements for contractors and
subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Davis signed into law a measure that bars the
use of wooden benches in vans used to transport farm workers to
their jobs and requires that the vans meet federal seating
regulations. It was prompted by the August 1999 crash of a jammed
farm van in which 13 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also signed a bill to set up social and health
services for farm workers.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Miklos Molnar scored after 10 minutes
and Tony Meola recorded his 15th shutout as the Kansas City Wizards
beat the Tampa Bay Mutiny 1-0 Saturday night in a game between
division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar, who has been nursing a sore left knee, scored off
assists from Matt McKeon and Chris Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Meola only had to stop one shot on goal, taken by league-leading
scorer Mamadou Diallo. Kansas City leads the MLS with 16 shutouts
and has allowed just 27 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was coming off a three-goal performance in the Mutiny's
4-3 victory over Columbus on Wednesday. He has 26 goals, one shy of
the 1997 league record set by Roy Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay leads the MLS with 60 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards (15-7-8), atop the Western Division, have a
league-best 53 points with two games remaining. Tampa Bay (16-12-3)
leads the Central.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was 99 degrees at kickoff.

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Bart Hendricks ran and threw for two
first half touchdowns and Shaunard Harts returned an interception
for a score as Boise State beat New Mexico 31-14 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks, who led the Broncos (1-0) to the Big West Conference
title last season and a win over Louisville in the Humanitarian
Bowl, ran 34 yards for a TD and threw a 9-yard scoring pass to
Andre Banks.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico (0-2) didn't get a first down until the 12:46 mark of
the second quarter and quarterback Jeremy Denson was sacked four
times in the Lobos' first two possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Lobos, who went scoreless in the third quarter in their
first six games last year, didn't get a first down in the second
half until 11:49 remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Lobo fans, growing restless after back-to-back losing seasons
under coach Rocky Long, cheered mockingly when Denson completed a
9-yard pass to Rob Caston for New Mexico's initial first down.
</P>
<P>
   Boise State led 31-7 at halftime. The Broncos' other scores came
on a 2-yard run by Brock Forsey, Harts' 34-yard return of a Denson
pass in the flat and a 42-yard field goal by Nick Calaycay.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico, which lost 24-3 in its opener at Texas Tech last
week, scored on a 32-yard run by Jarrod Baxter with 1:19 left in
the first half. Denson, who was booed through much of the first
half, ran for 28 yards and threw a 25-yard pass to Dwight Counter
in the 80-yard, 11-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   Denson last season threw for more than 2,200 yards and 31
touchdowns at Navarro Junior College, but struggled for the second
straight week. His 52 yards passing against Texas Tech was the
Lobos' lowest total in 21 years and he wasn't any better against
Boise State, completing 5 of 14 passes for 53 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by Rudy Caamano with 3:12 left in the third
quarter and he led the Lobos to a late fourth quarter score.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Josh Booty passed for 291 yards and two
touchdowns and Rohan Davey threw for 194 and three touchdowns as
LSU opened the Nick Saban era with a 58-0 victory over Western
Carolina on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Saban, who left Michigan State for LSU, wanted to start with a
win, but he expected more than that against the Catamounts. He
spent the week talking about playing tough, playing with focus,
playing a full 60 minutes and playing mistake-free football.
</P>
<P>
   The team fulfilled some of his wishes, but questions remained
about how LSU would do when they stepped up from a Division I-AA
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   LSU's defense not only shut out Western Carolina, it shut them
down, limiting them to just 167 overall yards on 54 plays, and 11
first downs. The Tigers also sacked Catamount quarterback David
Rivers once, intercepted him once and recovered a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The LSU offense was impressive, with 680 total yards with three
quarterbacks running it. LSU's 485 total passing yards is a school
record. The Tigers had eight players score nine touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But LSU also had 12 penalties for 107 yards, including one that
nullified what would have been a 61-yard touchdown pass by Booty.
The Tigers gained only 195 yards on 43 rushing attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Booty opened the game with an 80-yard scoring pass to Reggie
Robinson on the third play from scrimmage. Booty, who alternated
time through three quarters with Davey, dubbed the No. 1-A
quarterback by Saban, completed 12 of 15 passes. He also hit Jerel
Myers for a 45-yard first-quarter touchdown. An 8-yard run by
LaBrandon Toefield put LSU ahead 20-0 after a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Saban planned to use both quarterbacks against Western Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Davey was poised and showed no signs of the knee injury that
required surgery last spring. Davey completed 11-of-11 for 194 and
threw three touchdowns -- a 47-yarder to Josh Reed in the second
quarter and a pair of third quarter scores -- 36 yards to Jerel
Myers and 9 yards to Elice Parker.
</P>
<P>
   A 32 yard touchdown run by Devery Henderson in the second
quarter and a 37-yard field goal by John Corbello gave LSU an 37-0
lead at half time.
</P>
<P>
   Derron Parquet scored on a 3-yard in the fourth quarter to close
out the scoring. Craig Nall LSU's third-string quarterback mopped
up in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers completed 21 of 10 for 75 yards for Western Carolina.
David Hunter came in late and connected with his only pass for a
minus-4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The game was not a sell out, but the 87,188 on hand was the
biggest crowd in LSU history and the biggest crowd to ever watch a
college football game in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   LSU completed 11,000 additional seats and 70 luxury boxes in
time for the opener. The new seats make Tiger Stadium the fourth
largest on-campus stadium in the country.

<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Ken Simonton rushed for 200 yards to
break the Oregon State career rushing record as the Beavers beat
Eastern Washington 21-19 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But other than Simonton, the game -- played in a cold rain -- was
a disappointing season-opening performance for the Beavers, who are
trying to prove they aren't a flash in the pan after last year's
7-5 record, their first winning season in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they let the Division I-AA Eagles get within 21-19 with
3:19 left when Fred Salanoa completed passes of 24 and 31 yards and
then scrambled 8 yards into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers receivers repeatedly dropped passes. Quarterback
Jonathan Smith, who had not thrown an interception in 156 passes --
14 shy of a school record -- threw two.
</P>
<P>
   The second came as the Beavers were leading 14-6 and driving
into the end zone in the third quarter. Instead, Smith's pass went
straight into the hands of Ole Oleson on the Eagles' 1, and Oleson
returned it for 90 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Jesse Chatman ran 2 yards into the end zone.
Eastern Washington's attempt at a 2-point conversion failed, and
the score was 14-12.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Eagles' last touchdown, the Beavers defense did a
good job holding down both their running game and Salanoa, who
completed 13 of 30 passes for 139 yards with one interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles finished with 197 total offensive yards -- just 58
rushing -- compared to 326 for the Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   Simonton, a junior, entered the game 39 yards short of
overtaking the career school rushing record of 2,563 yards set by
Dave Schilling from 1969-71.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 3-0 following a 44-yard field goal by the Eagles'
Troy Griggs when Simonton set the record in the second quarter on a
21-yard run up the middle. Two plays later, he scored the first of
his three touchdowns, pushing his way 2 yards into the end zone to
make it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Simonton also broke Schilling's record of 13 100-yard rushing
games for Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles got another 22-field goal from Griggs to make it 7-6
with 9:49 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the next Oregon State possession, Smith connected on passes
of 15 and 17 yards before Simonton completed a 14-yard touchdown
run to make it 14-6 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Simonton also scored on a 14-yard touchdown run late in the
fourth quarter to make it 21-12.

<HEADLINE> Colorado St. 28, No. 23 Colorado 24  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- After throwing a career-high four touchdown passes
to help his team beat in-state rival Colorado for the second
straight year, Colorado State quarterback Matt Newton allowed
himself a brief moment to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess there's a new sheriff in town,'' Newton said Saturday
after his Rams defeated Colorado 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who shocked then-No. 14 Colorado 41-14 a year ago, did
it again Saturday despite being a 4&AMP;frac12;-point underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Newton's 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jose Ochoa with
10:31 remaining proved to be the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said the Buffaloes ''were all about revenge, but revenge
only takes you so far. We've always been the 'guys up the road.'
We'll probably still have no respect, and they'll think this was a
fluke. But so be it. It's all about wins, and we beat them twice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener for both teams, No. 23 Colorado fell behind
14-0 but rallied to take a 24-14 lead early in the third quarter
behind backup quarterback Bobby Pesavento.
</P>
<P>
   Newton subsequently was intercepted twice by cornerback Terrence
Wood, but Newton and Frank Rice hooked up on their second scoring
pass of the game, a 42-yarder with 2:32 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After the Buffaloes missed a long field-goal attempt, Colorado
State went 64 yards in eight plays for its fourth touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State had only 5 yards rushing through three quarters,
but Cecil Sapp promptly broke off a 20-yard run and later added a
5-yarder. On third-and-10 from the Colorado 30, Newton found Ochoa
wide open over the middle, and freshman cornerback Phil Jackson,
closing fast, was unable to bring the 255-pound Ochoa down short of
the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had three possessions after that but failed to advance
beyond midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the outcome means his team owns the state, CSU coach
Sonny Lubick said, ''It means we beat them two years in a row, and
it means we're happy about it. Coach (Gary) Barnett did a hell of a
job with his kids and they played well. They were out for revenge,
they were out for blood. That motivational factor worried me.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado outgained the Rams 532-392 in total offense, including
121 yards rushing by Cortlen Johnson and 98 by highly recruited
freshman Marcus Houston. But shoddy coverage by the Colorado
secondary proved to be the Buffs' undoing. Newton victimized Buffs
cornerback Nate Wright on three of his TD throws.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took advantage of our young guys, our inexperienced guys,
with a veteran quarterback,'' Barnett said. ''We had to go to man
coverage in order to bring pressure. We put our corners on an
island, and they just didn't hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Javon Green expressed the disbelief of many of his
teammates. ''I never thought in a million years that CSU would beat
us two straight years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams scored six minutes into the game when Rice got behind
Wright and hauled in Newton's pass in-stride at the 15 for a
52-yard scoring play.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Mark Mariscal was short on a 54-yard field-goal
attempt later in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After a short Colorado punt early in the second quarter, Newton
passed 12 yards to Pete Rebstock and then found a wide-open Joey
Cuppari, who had beaten Wright, for a 34-yard scoring play with
14:01 left in the half and a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pesavento, who took over in the second quarter after starter Zac
Colvin bruised his right elbow, led the Buffs on a nine-play,
88-yard scoring drive. Pesavento completed four of four, including
a 26-yarder to Cedric Cormier and an 18-yarder to Scott Nemeth, and
Houston ran 5 yards for a touchdown with 9:41 to go in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Pesavento's 17-yard pass to Roman Hollowell got the Buffs moving
again later in the half, and Pesavento hit Javon Green on a 15-yard
scoring pass with 2:35 left.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to defensive end Anwawn Jones' sack of Newton, Colorado
took possession again at midfield in the waning seconds.
Pesavento's 28-yard pass to Eric McCready set up Mariscal's 36-yard
field goal as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffs took the second-half kickoff and marched 75 yards for
another touchdown and a 24-14 lead. Johnson had a pair of 15-yard
runs, and Pesavento sneaked the final yard with 11:55 left in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes later, Rice wrestled an underthrown ball away from
Wright to make it 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   A no-alcohol policy at Mile High Stadium and police presence on
the field at the end of the game -- including six patrolmen on
horseback -- prevented a repeat of the rowdiness that followed last
year's game here.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 22 people, ejected 21 fans and sent seven to
detoxification, police spokesman Tony Lombard said.

<HEADLINE> No. 19 Oklahoma 55, UTEP 14  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN CANFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Josh Heupel threw two touchdown passes and
ran for a score, and freshman Renaldo Works scored three
fourth-quarter touchdowns as No. 19 Oklahoma beat Texas-El Paso
55-14 on Saturday night in the hottest home game in Sooners
history.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was 106 at kickoff, but that didn't keep 74,761
from turning out, making it the largest home-opening crowd since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Heupel and the Sooners' wide-open passing game appeared rusty,
but Oklahoma took advantage of great field position and UTEP
mistakes -- the Sooners scored 35 points off turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Roy Williams returned an interception 35 yards for a
score and two of Works' touchdowns came after turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Heupel set school and Big 12 records with 3,460 yards and 30
touchdowns a year ago, leading the Sooners to their first bowl game
since 1994. He scored on a sneak and threw scoring passes of 4 and
31 yards, but also had seven straight incompletions during one
stretch, was intercepted once and lost a fumble. He wound up
18-of-36 for 274 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Works scored on runs of 19, 6 and 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   UTEP coach Gary Nord, who was Oklahoma's offensive coordinator
in 1995, tried a little bit of everything to keep the Sooners off
balance. In the first quarter alone, the Miners attempted two
onside kicks, ran an end around and converted a fake punt.
</P>
<P>
   They also failed on a fake field goal in the third quarter after
reaching the 13-yard line, and converted on fourth-and-1 to keep
their second touchdown drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   A fumble recovery on the Miners' first play gave Oklahoma the
ball at the UTEP 17, and three plays later Heupel scored from 1
yard out.
</P>
<P>
   The Miners tied it nine minutes later, keeping the drive alive
with the fake punt, but Oklahoma later capitalized on a failed
onside kick to take over at the UTEP 46. A 36-yard completion to
Quentin Griffin set up Heupel's 4-yard TD pass to tight end Trent
Smith that gave the Sooners the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   After their first touchdown, the Miners netted 10 yards or fewer
on four of their next six possessions, including the one in which
Williams intercepted Rocky Perez's pass and returned to the end
zone for a touchdown that made it 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   Perez threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Paul Tessier in the first
quarter. The Miners' other TD came on a 19-yard run by Chris Porter
one play after reserve quarterback Wesley Phillips gained 9 yards
on fourth-and-1.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas 38, SW Missouri St. 0  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Robby Hampton had a nice tangible
statistic to go along with all those intangibles that coach Houston
Nutt expects from the Arkansas quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, a 24-year-old sophomore making his first start,
completed his first nine passes and wound up 17-of-22 for 237 yards
and two touchdowns as the Razorbacks opened the season with a 38-0
victory over Southwest Missouri State on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton ended his night when he recognized single coverage on
Boo Williams and lobbed a pass that Williams took in stride at the
Arkansas 47 behind cornerback Donte King. The 79-yard play made it
31-0 with 1:36 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks' first touchdown drive started when Williams
turned Hampton's toss into a 17-yard gain. Hampton then threw a
long way to the left sideline, but the defense gave Sparky Hamilton
a big cushion and the play gained 13.
</P>
<P>
   A motion penalty on Cedric Cobbs wiped out a big gain and
assistant coach Danny Nutt substituted Fred Talley for Cobbs. At
that point, Cobbs had eight carries for 13 yards. He finished with
57 yards on 18 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-8 from the Bears' 36, Hampton dropped a couple of
steps and flipped to Richard Smith moving across the field after a
slight delay. Smith reached the 5 and a facemask penalty was worth
a couple more yards. Cobbs scored on his third try.
</P>
<P>
   Good kickoff coverage and the defense gave Arkansas' offense a
short field to negotiate for its second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Warren stopped Maurice Flournoy at the Bears' 12 on the
kickoff. Quinton Caver and Jeremiah Harper knocked down a pass each
and the Razorbacks started from their 43 after a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's ninth straight completion went to a wide-open Adam
Daily in the left flat and was good for 8 yards to the Bears' 30.
Hampton missed on his 10th try, but Cobbs made a nice cut on a draw
play and hit a big hole over the right side for 26 yards. On first
down, Hampton looked for Daily in the right flat, didn't force the
pass and found tight end Marcellus Poydras alone in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Matt Swartz' first Arkansas field goal, a 49-yarder, made
it 17-0 midway through the second quarter. Swartz, a transfer from
Lehigh, redshirted in 1998 and watched Tony Dodson do the kicking
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri reached the Arkansas 21 late in the first
half, but Austin Moherman had trouble with a high snap in the
shotgun and was swarmed for a 14-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' defense was on the field more than 21 minutes in the
first half when the heat index was in the 90s. Kickoff was pushed
back two hours because of the record heat.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas upped the lead to 24-0 in the third quarter. Alvin Ray
scored from the 11 after a pass interference penalty and a face
mask penalty against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears got to the Arkansas 17 in the third quarter, but Brian
Long missed a 34-yard field goal attempt.

   YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) -- Walter Church threw a 4-yard touchdown
pass to Kevin Walter with 1:50 remaining, then completed a 2-point
conversion pass to Kenny Christian as Eastern Michigan rallied to
beat Connecticut 32-25 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' win in the season opener for both teams was the
first for former Arizona assistant Jeff Woodruff, and spoiled the
Huskies' first Division I-A game.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, playing as an independent, will become a full-time
member of the Big East conference in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Michigan led 24-13 after three quarters, but the Huskies
made it 24-19 on Ryan Tracey's 2-yard pass to Tommy Collins just
three seconds into the fourth quarter. Tracey's 21-yard pass to
John Fitzsimmons with 6:19 left to play made it 25-24.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had 402 yards to 355 for the Eagles, but Eastern
Michigan had the more balanced attack as Church passed for 205
yards and directed a rushing attack that finished with 150 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey passed for 340 yards and three touchdowns, but
Connecticut managed only 62 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles went up 17-10 on Idris Wells' only carry of the game,
a 1-yard run with 6:23 left in the second quarter. Eastern made it
24-10 on John White's short run with 11:18 left in the third
quarter. Jeff Heyl's 34-yard field goal brought Connecticut to
within 24-13 with 4:40 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons had four catches, including a 46-yard TD pass from
Tracey in the second quarter for 124 yards.

<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Kliff Kingsbury threw for a school-record
450 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another score, leading
Texas Tech to a 38-16 victory over Utah State on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury completed 33 of 47 passes with one interception,
breaking the school's single-game passing yardage mark of 446 set
in 1988 by Billy Joe Tolliver against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Red Raiders' second victory with their new
pass-oriented offense under new coach Mike Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Tech held the Aggies (0-1) scoreless until about four minutes
left in the first half. Utah State's Brad Bohn kicked a 43-yard
field goal after the Aggies came up short on their first six
possessions. That cut the Red Raiders' lead to 21-3.
</P>
<P>
   Tech scored in the first quarter on Kingsbury's a 1-yard run,
set up by his 47-yard pass to freshman Carlos Francis, and on
Dorian Pitts' 6-yard fumble return. Kingsbury threw 19 yards to
Darrell Jones for a second-quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Crosbie threw for both of Utah State's two touchdowns, a
23-yard pass to Aaron Jones in the third quarter to Aaron Jones and
a 5-yard pass to Joe Solosabal in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State's Emmett White was the game's leading rusher with 143
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury connected with Francis four times for 170 yards,
including a 45-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter. It's the first
time Kingsbury has gone deep in the new offense. The Red Raiders
used short passes to beat New Mexico last week.
</P>
<P>
   After Tech's 24-3 victory last week over New Mexico, Kingsbury
said if he could give himself a grade for his performance he'd fail
himself because he missed more passes than he completed -- going 21
of 47 passes for 186 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Against Utah State, Kingsbury's stats more than met Leach's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury's touchdown pass to Francis came after the Raiders
pressured Aggies punter Kjell Nesen, who kicked only 16 yards to
the Utah State 45.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' opening score wasn't easy. After Kingsbury's
47-yard pass to Francis put the ball on the Utah State 22, Ricky
Williams ran for 7 yards, but a false-start penalty cost Tech five
yards. But Kingsbury then hit King Scovell for 10 yards and Cole
Roberts for 9 yards. On fourth-and-goal, Kingsbury scored from a
yard out.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's next possession crumbled when a wild pass by Kingsbury
was intercepted by Utah State's Tony Walker. But Crosbie then found
himself under the pressure of Pitts, who forced the Utah State
quarterback to retreat 14 yards before a fumble that Pitts returned
6 yards for a 14-0 lead with 1:41 left in the first quarter.

Negotiators Continue Tire Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Union negotiators and Bridgestone/Firestone
continued talking Saturday night as more than 8,400 workers at nine tire plants
remained poised to strike at a moment's notice. The negotiators have been
meeting continuously since the union indefinitely postponed a strike deadline
Friday night. A company spokeswoman said late Saturday that the tone of the
talks was constructive. ''If it were going backward or stalled, we would be on
strike,'' United Steelworkers of America spokesman John Duray said Saturday
night.

<P>
   PEREIRA, Colombia (AP) -- Amid heavy fighting between leftist rebels and
government forces, a U.S.-made Colombian warplane crashed Saturday into an
Andean mountainside, killing seven airmen, the military said. In addition, at
least eight government soldiers and 12 rebels died in the ground combat at a
communications complex on Mount Montezuma, 155 miles west of the capital,
Bogota. The clash followed President Clinton's visit Wednesday to Colombia to
support President Andres Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers and leftist
rebels who protect drug crops.

Rain Slows Spread of Western Fires

<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- The spread of wildfires burning on hundreds of
thousands of acres across the Northern Rockies have been slowed by rain. Dan
Kincaid, a fire information officer for a 81,000-acre fire near Townsend said
''These are probably the best conditions we've had since this fire started.''
Showers and thunderstorms had dropped as much half an inch of rain on parts of
Montana by Saturday and an inch or more elsewhere. Highs only reached into the
70s, humidity was low and rain was forecast through Wednesday.

Polls: Milosevic May Face Rejection
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CVETOJEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Boza Markovic counts off Yugoslavia's wars on
his tobacco-stained fingers: first Slovenia, then Croatia, then Bosnia and
finally, worst of all, Kosovo. ''Now what?'' the 80-year old villager asks as he
folds his gnarled hand into a fist. ''Is there anything else to lose?'' Millions
of Serbs are thinking about Yugoslavia's decade of losses as they near Sept. 24
elections that are increasingly seen as a referendum on the rule of Slobodan
Milosevic. For the first time since coming to power in 1990, pollsters insist,
the Yugoslav strongman may actually face the unthinkable: rejection by the
masses.

White House Urged Babbitt's '97 Apology
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the urging of the White House chief of staff, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt apologized in 1997 for misleading Sen. John McCain, a
special prosecutor's report says. A 1996 letter from Babbitt to McCain misled
the Arizona Republican senator about Babbitt's contacts with backers of a
proposed American Indian casino in Wisconsin. The day after the publication of
an Associated Press story describing the misleading letter, then-White House
Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles summoned Babbitt to the White House to discuss the
matter, according to the report from special prosecutor Carol Elder Bruce.

School Bus Company: Brakes Could Fail
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- One of the country's largest school bus builders is
warning that 6,000 of its buses may have defective brake systems. The company
that makes the systems said Saturday that the same defect could affect as many
as 300,000 commercial vehicles. When the vehicles are moving slowly, typically
less than 20 miles per hour, they can temporarily lose their braking ability for
up to three seconds, said Debi Nicholson, a spokeswoman for Freightliner Corp.,
the Portland-based parent company of school bus maker Thomas Built Buses Inc.

Cincinnati Reds on Saturday night. Trailing 4-3, Montreal scored three times in
the sixth on an RBI single by pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero and a two-run single
by Bradley. Felipe Lira (4-5) earned the win with 2 2-3 innings of relief,
allowing two runs on two hits, with one strikeout.

Notre Dame 24, Texas A&AMP;M 10

   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Arnaz Battle made his first start a memorable one by
throwing the first two touchdown passes of his career as Notre Dame held off No.
25 Texas A&AMP;M 24-10 Saturday before a jittery crowd of 80,232. Irish coach Bob
Davie began his fourth season knowing his job would be in jeopardy if the Irish
failed to get off to a winning start. It took a while, but Davie was a happy man
after Battle loosened up late in the first half and finished with scoring passes
of 9 yards to Joey Getherall and 46 yards to Javin Hunter.

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Ray Robinson rushed for 139 yards and
scored in the second overtime to lift North Carolina State to a
38-31 victory over Arkansas State on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Amato, who took over the Wolfpack program after spending
18 years as an assistant coach at Florida State, won his first game
as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State sealed the win when Wolfpack linebacker Edrick Smith
recovered a fumble by running back Jacqis Walker on third down in
the second OT.
</P>
<P>
   The game also marked a prolific start to the career of N.C.
State quarterback Philip Rivers. The 6-foot-5 freshman completed 29
of 57 passes for 397 yards and three touchdowns and set three
single-game school records: most completions, attempts and yards by
a first-year player.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers' two main targets were Koren Robinson and Eric Leak, who
combined for 16 catches.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State's Kent Passingham kicked a 33-yard field goal with
one second remaining in regulation to send the game into overtime
tied at 24. Arkansas State opened the overtime with a 6-yard
scoring pass from Cleo Lemon to reserve tight end Anwar Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson answered, running three times for 25 yards and scoring
from 5 yards out to tie it at 31. He then scored from 1-yard out in
the second overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State, which led 17-7 in the third quarter, got 137
yards and one touchdown from running back Jonathan Adams.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State won its fourth consecutive season opener and improved
to 3-1 in overtime games. The Indians lost their fifth straight
opener.
