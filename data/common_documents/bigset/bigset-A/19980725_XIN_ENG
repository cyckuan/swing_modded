<HEADLINE> Major Integrated Circuit Project Goes Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Project 909
integrated circuit production lines has proceeded smoothly in the
New Pudong Area in Shanghai since its launching last year.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to be put into trial
operation by next February, half a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The project is focused on building an 8-inch silicon
monocrystal production line for the Shanghai Huahong
NEC Electronics Co. Ltd.. The production line adopts
0.5-0.35-micron technology.
</P>
<P>
The line has been built completely for civil and commercial
use, with an expected monthly output of 20,000 pieces of 8-inch
silicon, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai company has invested 500 million U.S. dollars in
the project, and the Japanese branch of NEC the remaining 200
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Integrated circuit design and production lines are also
included in the project, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
This project was launched to reduce China's heavy dependence on
foreign imports. In 1997 alone, the country imported 3.4 billion
U.S. dollars worth of integrated circuits, according to official
figures.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton expects

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Establishes "Agent Orange Victims Fund" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam established the "Agent
Orange Victims Fund " (AGORAVIF) Friday, in order to help the
hundreds of thousands people who suffered the toxic chemical used
by the United States forces in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
The chemical war conducted by the United States between 1961
and 1971 was the biggest war of destruction against the ecology
and human beings in the history of war of humankind, said Nguyen
Trong Nhan, president of the Vietnam Red Cross, and management
council president of the AGORAVIF. He was speaking at the
inauguration ceremony of the fund.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. armed forces dropped 5,700 tons of agent orange in
South Vietnam during the war, affecting hundred of thousands of
people, said Nhan.
</P>
<P>
Many people affected by the toxic chemical contracted serious
and even fatal illness including cancer. Others gave birth to
deformed children and the effects were passed on to a younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces sprayed agent orange, a kind of herbicide
packed in containers with orange strips, on a large area of
Vietnam to defoliate the dense jungles which protected the North
Vietnamese troops and their resupply convoys from being exposed.
</P>
<P>
Nhan said that although more than 20 years had passed since the
end of the war, agent orange, which can remain in soil for a very
long time, is still causing serious consequences in the lives and
health of Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
Nhan expressed hope that the fund will receive positive
responses from local and foreign organizations and individuals to
alleviate the losses and misery of agent orange victims.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi, the Vietnamese Communist Party Central Committee's
adviser, and honorary president of the Vietnam Red Cross, Nhuyen
Thi Binh, Vice Vietnamese president, and other leaders attended
the fund's inauguration.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Special Finance Scheme for Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government will launch in August a 2.5
billion HK dollars (320 million U.S. dollars) special finance
scheme to provide funding and guarantees for loans for local small
and medium enterprises (SMEs), it was announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, which is subject to the provision of funds by the
Finance Committee of the Legislative Council, is part of the
package of the special relief measures announced by the government
 last month to ease Hong Kong's economic problems. It aims at
helping SMEs to cope with the liquidity crunch problem.
</P>
<P>
Chau Tak Hay, Secretary for Trade and Industry, said here
Friday that while the prevailing credit crunch problem was
affecting all companies, SMEs were particularly hard hit.
</P>
<P>
"Despite their credit worthiness, good track record and
business prospects, some SMEs are unable to obtain loans from
banks or have their credit line cut. With their relatively low
start-up costs and greater adaptability to changing business
environment, SMEs are a significant force in reviving the economy
and creating employment opportunities," Chau said.
</P>
<P>
The current Credit Guarantee Scheme will be merged with the new
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, the government will act as the guarantor
for SMEs' loans approved by lending institutions and it will
provide a matching deposit to participating licensed banks, if
requested, so that the loan to deposit ratio would be maintained
at a reasonable level, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would be market-driven, relying on the lending
institutions to exercise their usual prudent professional judgment
in assessing applicants' credit worthiness. The risk of default
would be shared between the lending institutions and the scheme.
</P>
<P>
All companies registered in Hong Kong are eligible to apply for
the scheme and all authorized institutions under the Banking
Ordinance would be invited to join the scheme, which will be
reviewed regularly taking into account the overall economic
climate and liquidity situation.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Rules Out Pardon for WWI Executed Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government Friday ruled
out the possibility of a blanket pardon for 306 British soldiers
who were executed for desertion during World War I.
</P>
<P>
British Armed Forces Minister John Reid told parliament the
passage of time meant grounds for a pardon on the basis of unsafe
conviction "just did not exist."
</P>
<P>
"In the vast majority of cases, there is little to be gleaned
from the fragments of the stories that would provide serious
grounds for legal pardon," Reid said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister expressed "deep sense of regret at this
loss of life, calling these soldiers "victims, with million of
others, of a cataclysmic and ghastly war."
</P>
<P>
Reid also noted that the Labor government would abolish the
death penalty for military offenses in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Some descendants of those executed soldiers and the Royal
British Legion veterans group have campaigned for many years for a
blanket pardon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Interior Minister Pitra
Petroff said here Friday that the country has been plunged into
great tension since the killing of civilians in northeast Angola
by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The situation is worrying, Petroff said. But he said that the
situation is still under the government control.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan minister made the remarks to the press before
leaving for Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
UNITA militiamen attacked Bula Town in Lunda-Norte Province
Wednesday, killing at least 124 people including foreigners,
according to Angolan army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Lunda-Norte governor Gomes Maiato told the state radio that a
batch of UNITA fighters started shooting unarmed residents who
were doing business in local market at around 21:00 (GMT)
Wednesday, killing 127 and wounding 75.
</P>
<P>
Of the wounded, 40 were sent to a Luanda hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan military sources believed this is the worst killing by
UNITA since the Lusaka Peace Accorded was signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Reports said UNITA forces ambushed traveling vehicles Thursday
in central Angola's Kuanza-Sul Province, killing nine, including
seven civilians and two policemen, and injuring scores of others.

<HEADLINE> EU Criticized for Raising Controversial Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian conservative leader
criticized the European Union (EU) on Friday for raising several
controversial issues during its recent talks with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The EU must not tell us out of the blue that we are
terrorists, or supporters of terrorists or are seeking to obtain
nuclear weapons," secretary of the conservative Guardians Council
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said at the Friday prayers congregation.
</P>
<P>
"If you (EU) want to deal with us in this spirit, it would be
unacceptable to our people, to our government and to our leader,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A delegation comprising officials from Britain, Austria and
Germany, the past, present and future EU presidents, opened a new
round of talks with Iranian officials in Tehran on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation exchanged views with Iranian officials about
terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, the Middle East peace
process, human rights and other regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The EU called on Iran to nullify the award offered for those
who will kill the British writer Salman Rushdie according to a
fatwa, or religious decree by late Iranian leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini. It also asked Tehran to change its stance towards Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jannati said that the Rushdie issue was definitively decided
by Khomeini and no one has the authority to revoke his fatwa.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU must admit that the issue was definitively
decided once and for all, and they should not dwell on the topic
in their meetings here and there anymore.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official noted that the EU must accept as a fact
Iran's position towards Israel, saying that "we believe that
Israel is a usurper, and Muslim occupied lands must be liberated."

<HEADLINE> Monitors Encouraged by Election Process in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The monitor group for
Cambodia's July 26 general elections said Friday it was encouraged
by the smoothness of the registration and campaign process, the
two main phases of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Joint International Observer Group (JIOG) will observe and
judge the polling process Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the month-long campaign ended Friday, the
group said it had been "generally encouraged" by the way the
registration process was carried out and by the good result.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent or more of the total population was registered
for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The result "gives a clear signal to Cambodian leaders and the
international community alike that the Cambodian people are
determined to use this opportunity to decide their own political
future," the group said.
</P>
<P>
As for the campaign, the group called it "active." It said the
parties, to a large extent, were able to hold their rallies,
disseminate information about their programs and pursue other
relevant political meeting and rallies.
</P>
<P>
The group was still concerned about some problems such as
unresolved killings, intimidation, voters' beliefs in the secrecy
of the ballot, ethnic prejudices and unequal access to electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
The monitors said many of the problems seemed to be of a
practical and technical nature.
</P>
<P>
It felt "justified in anticipating that reasonable conditions
exist for an election on Sunday July 26, that can broadly
represent the will of the Cambodian people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The group hoped the election process would be free from any
kinds of violence that could disturb the electoral process and
influence its final assessment in a negative way.

<TEXT>

BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A Bahraini envoy denied here Friday
that a Bahraini citizen found dead in Lebanon is an intelligence
officer sent to observe Bahraini opposition groups in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Voice of the People radio quoted Abdul al Aziz Ali,
Bahraini ambassador to Syria as saying that Toufic Abel-Meneen
Ibrahim is an ordinary person without any official link.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim was found dead in a tourist area of Beirut on Sunday
with a pistol in his hand.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Foreign Ministry's
Secretary-General Zafer Hassan, Ali told reporters that according
to the legal medical examination, Ibrahim killed himself because
of financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon earlier insisted that Ibrahim is a Bahraini
intelligence agent charged with observing Bahrain's opposition
groups in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ali arrived in Lebanon on Friday to handle the issue as there
is no Bahraini embassy in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
He said he has delivered a message from the Bahraini
government to the Lebanese government over the issue, adding the
good ties between the two countries will not be affected by the
incident.
</P>
<P>
But there has not been an official comment from the Lebanese
government on Ali's claims.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Drops Fraud Charges on Treasury Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Friday dropped fraud
charges against four treasury chiefs and 11 officials and
businessmen, less than 24 hours after their arrests.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructions to enter a nolle prosequi (termination of
prosecution) in this case, and hereby do," Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP) Bernard Chunga said in a written presentation
to Nairobi Chief Magistrate Uniter Kidullah.
</P>
<P>
Kidullah issued an order Thursday to arrest Kenya Revenue
Authority (KRA) Commissioner-General John Msafari, Commissioner of
Customs Samuel Chebii, Financial Secretary Joseph KanKyi Kinyua,
Director of Fiscal and Monetary Affairs Njeru Kirira and 11 other
senior Customs officials.
</P>
<P>
Kidullah said his move followed of the application by the
Director of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority (KACA), John
Harun Mwau.
</P>
<P>
However, under the Kenyan law, the DPP can terminate any
criminal charges on the instructions of the attorney-general who
is not required by law to explain his actions.
</P>
<P>
Chunga said the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) would
probe the case and report to the attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
The officials were accused of defrauding the government
through failure to levy taxes on sugar and wheat imported from
Brazil and Argentina. The frauds involved more than 230 million
Shillings (some 3.9 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
They are also to be charged with breaching the public trust by
fraudulently allowing 1,400 tons of uninspected sugar into the
country's market.
</P>
<P>
Failure to collect tax on illegal sugar imports was a key
complaint by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when it
suspended a major loan to Kenya in July last year. The IMF has
also asked for reforming KRA.
</P>
<P>
Other IMF demands, agreed with the government in last August,

<HEADLINE> India Ascertaining Reports on U.S. Decision to Expel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- India said Friday it was
ascertaining reports on decision of the Clinton Administration to
ask Indian scientists to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are ascertaining the facts. If it has happened, it is
unfortunate," said a spokesman of the Ministry for External
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said that the Clinton Administration
has asked 7 Indian scientists working in the United States to
leave the country and 75 others are likely to be forced out in
what is seen as a punitive action against India for its nuclear
tests in May.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also reportedly ordered suspension of all
interactions with India and Pakistan financed by the Department of
Energy and national laboratories except for humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has denied visa to Chairman of Indian Atomic Energy
Commission R. Chidambaram and may ask all Indian scientists
working in the country on exchange and fellowship programs to
return home.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. actions have set off strong repercussions in the
Indian Parliament with a parliamentarian suggesting to shift the
headquarters of the United Nations from New York to Africa or Asia
where India could be one of the choices.
</P>
<P>
Members of Parliament from nearly all parties condemned the
U.S. decision as unfortunate, saying Indian scientists made
significant contribution to science and technology in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India reported from the southern city of
Bangalore that some top scientists described the U.S. decision as
"unjustified and unwarranted".

outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) had been killed in recent
military operations staged by the Turkish security forces in
southeastern Turkey, an official statement said on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and U.S. Vice President Al Gore signed here Friday
several documents on bilateral ties and nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Their meetings were held within the framework of the
U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological
Cooperation. Both were chairmen of the commission that was
established in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The documents include a joint statement on economic and
technological cooperation, a joint statement on helping Russia's
closed nuclear towns and an agreement on the management of
plutonium that has been withdrawn from nuclear military programs.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following their meetings, both Gore
and Kiriyenko expressed satisfaction with what they described as
"constructive," "frank and friendly" talks.
</P>
<P>
Gore reaffirmed U.S. support for Russia's efforts to accelerate
reform and its integration into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called Nuclear Cities Initiative, the United
States would help Russia's closed nuclear complex to find civilian
jobs for its employees and commercially viable projects to produce
civilian goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Although no figure of funding is included in the joint
statement, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov said
Washington has agreed to provide 25-30 million U.S. dollars next
year in aid for the nuclear towns such as Sarov, the leading
Russian nuclear weapons research center.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, thousands of employees in Sarov staged a
three-hour warning strike for back wages, fueling concern about
safety at the nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
During his stay of some 24 hours, Gore also had a telephone
conversation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is spending
his vacation in Shuiskaya Chupa, Karelia, and discussed U.S.
President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to Russia in September.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko and Gore also discussed the state of Russia's economy
and the help provided by the international financial institutions.
Washington was a strong backer of a 22.6 billion dollar bailout
loan package for Russia, finalized earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
On space cooperation, Russian Space Agency director general
Yuri Koptov told reporters that Kiriyenko reaffirmed Moscow's
pledge to continue its participation in the construction of the
Alpha international space station.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who arrived here Thursday evening, was scheduled to leave
Moscow later Friday.

HAVANA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
and Cuban Foreign Minister Robert Robaina Friday expressed their
confidence that bigger progress will be made in developing
relations between their countries.
</P>
<P>
The two officials discussed bilateral relations and
international issues of common concern during a meeting, a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman told Chinese reporters.
</P>
<P>
Qian's visit is important not only to Cuba but also to the
Caribbean region, said Robaina.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister highly praised the development of the
friendly relationship between his country and China, saying that
exchange of visits by top leaders of the two countries has helped
push the relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
In November 1993, Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Cuba
while Cuban leader Fidel Castro visited China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the relations between the two countries
are developing in all areas and have entered a new period, Qian
told Robaina.
</P>
<P>
The two officials expressed their satisfaction with the
development of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China attaches great importance to the
relationship with Cuba and is willing to strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
Qian also expressed the Chinese government's gratitudes to Cuba
for its support on many issues, particularly in helping develop
the relations between China and the Caribbean nations. Robaina
expressed thanks for China's precious support on the international
stage.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier praised the outstanding achievement
made by the Cuban people in social and economic development under
pressure from outside.
</P>
<P>
This year, Cuba has achieved some significant progress in
foreign policy, gaining more understanding and sympathy from the
international community and having more influence on international
affairs, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his belief that the Cuban people will overcome
difficulties and make more progress.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang
Jiechi and Jorge Luis Aspiolea, director of the National Hydrology
Institution of Cuba, signed an agreement on technology and
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here Thursday, will leave Saturday for
Jamaica, the last leg of his five-Caribbean-nation tour, which
also includes Barbados and Guyana.

<P>
Ahmed said that as the world is governed by international law,
Ethiopia will present its case to the concerned international
agency.

47,000 cubic meters of wet cargo and 50,000 tons of asphalt
remain impounded at the Eritrean ports of Assab and Massawa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry Friday issued a
press release, accusing the Eritrean government of ''inhuman
treatment of Ethiopians in Eritrea''.
</P>
<P>
The press release stated: ''About 2,000 Ethiopians who have
been living in and around Asmara have been thrown out of their
jobs and residences and are now living on the streets with no
food or shelter.''
</P>
<P>
It said, ''Thousands of Ethiopians are currently under
detention in Sawa military training camp and other detention
centers and police stations throughout Eritrea including Asmara
and Assab.''
</P>
<P>
On July 8, 1998, ''Eritrean border guards opened fire killing
a few of'' Ethiopians and ''the whereabouts of 85 of Ethiopians
is not known so far".

<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A new cold fish storage facility
has been set up at Entebbe international airport following the
recent lifting of the European Union's (EU) ban on fish products
from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kintu Musoke commissioned the facility
Thursday, Radio Uganda reported Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
He commended the Entebbe Handling Services for completing the
project earlier than expected and hoped dealers in the fisheries
industry will make full use of the new storage system.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Works, Housing and Communications John Nasasira
urged the management to ensure the facility, which cost 630
million Uganda shillings ( 500,000 U.S. Dollars), is run and
maintained professionally.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the EU imposed a ban on fish imports from
East African countries following an outbreak of cholera in the
region and reported use of chemicals in the Lake Victoria to kill
weeds hampering fishing activities.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Uganda was allowed to export fish to European
market because it had met a signficant part of EU standards.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fish processing sector has expanded greatly in recent
years and current export earnings are in excess of 100 million
dollars per year.

<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
taking steps to ensure the operations of the crucial iron and
steel industry are viable, president Robert Mugabe said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the eight million U.S. Dollar steel makers
of hot rolling mills in Redcliff of central Zimbabwe, Mugabe said
measures were being implemented to remove hurdles dogging the
industry, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The government has embarked on the rehabilitation of blast
furnace number four of the Zimbabwe Steel Company (ZISCO) to
ensure an adequate supply of billets and scrap metal for
steelmakers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebuilding of the blast furnace would involve the
restoration of the furnace to a production capacity of 700,000
metric tons of liquid steel per annum, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ferrostal AG of Germany had been selected as
ZISCO's technical partner to modernise and automate steel-making
and casting operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once the rehabilitation of these projects is completed,
possibly within the next 12 to 18 months," Mugabe said, "ZISCO
will become a viable steel producer".

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Somalia Elects Local Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A controversial conference in
northeastern Somalia has elected a "president" and a
"vice-president".
</P>
<P>
The 70-day conference concluded Thursday in Garowe District of
Nugal region, electing Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed and Mohamed
Abdi Hashi as "president and vice-president" respectively.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 people from various sectors of the northeastern
communities attended the meeting aimed at establishing a local
government as Puntland.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the conference Islan Mohamed Islam Muse also
endorsed the formation of a 69-member "parliament" and nine
"ministers" to be announced within 45 days beginning from
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the information from Garowe town, the two
leaders, General Mohamed Abshir Musa and Boqor Kingkong, held a
press meeting Friday, condemning the outcome of the conference
and calling it a meaningless political maneuver mal-organized by
Colonel Yussuf.
</P>
<P>
Sources told Xinhua that the two leaders were especially
annoyed by the election of Colonel Yussuf as a "president" and
proposal of Garowe town as "the capital city" for the autonomous
administration.
</P>
<P>
General Musa and Boqor Kingkong prefer the port town of
Bossaso, the largest city in the northeastern Somalia, as the
"capital city."
</P>
<P>
According to the politicians in northeastern Somalia, the
conference which has overcome serious disputes over how the
delegates would be put into equilibrium in its embryonic stages
had been a political gamble played by Colonel Yussuf in his
attempts to overthrow General Musa whom they bitterly
misunderstood during the meeting in Cairo attended by the Somali
faction leaders late last year.
</P>
<P>
The politicians said that the meeting had all the time been
supporting Colonel Yussuf.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the meeting has shocked thousands of people in
Bossaso and several other major towns in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The politicians have warned against insecurity which may
result unless the traditional leaders face the problem deeply.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Yussuf had abandoned the Cairo meeting while General
Musa had signed the Cairo peace deal together with Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
General Musa and Colonel Yussuf had represented the Somali
Salvation Democratic Front in the Cairo peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Wildlife Authority to Translocate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA)
has clarified its position on translocation of elephants which
are reported to have caused loss of life and destruction to
property in Luwero district in the central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement recently signed by the Acting Executive Director
of UWA Yakobo Moyini said the UWA is trying its best to have the
elephants moved to their new homes in the northern sector of
Murchison Falls national park, Radio Uganda reported Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
UWA has stationed staff on the ground to keep monitoring the
big animals and is trying to procure the necessary equipment
including big containers to carry the elephants.
</P>
<P>
The director assured the local people that enough fund had
been secured and the job was to be done soon.
</P>
<P>
The general public have been urged to report any imminent
danger from the elephants to the Senior Warden who is now camped
at Kyakapimpini and is fully equipped.
</P>
<P>
The elephants, estimated to be about 60, are reported to
damage the crops and stroll in vallages, posing a great threat to
people's safety.
</P>
<P>
An elephant translocation expert from Zimbabwe has been in
Uganda since July 11 to acquaint himself with the situation
before embarking on translocation of these jumbos.
</P>
<P>
Local people are pressing the wildlife authority to move the
elephants as quickly as possible because the coming of the next
rainy season will make it more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Rain is expected at the end of this month, almost a month
earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
However, an expert said the exact number, age and sex of the
elephants have to be established and access roads have to be
built for trucks to move the elephants. They have to be
tranquilized before being loaded on the trucks.

<HEADLINE> Formal Mechanism Expected for Coop Between East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) - A senior official of the
East African Cooperation (EAC) said in Arusha Friday that the
three member states hope to establish a formal mechanism to boost
bilateral cooperation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jakaya Kikwete, chairman of the permanent tripartite
commission of the EAC, was quoted by sources as saying that
following an EAC-U.S. ministerial meeting in Entebbe, Uganda
during the recent visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, "there is
need to establish a formal mechanism for regular EAC-US
ministerial consultations."
</P>
<P>
Kikwete, who is also the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation of Tanzania, made the remarks during
his meeting at the EAC headquarters with Richard Bogosian, a
senior official of the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
Bogosian said that the U.S. viewed the EAC, which consists of
the Kiswahili-speaking Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, as a "very
serious undertaking", noting that the regional integration effort
was gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
"The regional body deserve more attention by the United
States," he said, emphasizing the need for effective involvement
of the private sector and the civil society in the regional
integration process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed a wide range of issues including
EAC-U.S. cooperation, food security and conflict resolution in
the Great Lakes region and prospect of enlarging the EAC
cooperation with Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete, accompanied by the EAC Executive Secretary Francis
Muthaura, told Bogosian together with J. Strauss, USAID
Coordinator in Tanzania, that EAC's priority was given to
economic cooperation and particularly the establishment of a
single market to benefit the three member states.
</P>
<P>
"The EAC is a binding and stabilizing factor ensuring healthy
economic cooperation and greater political cooperation in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the permanent secretaries responsible for
foreign affairs in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda agreed in a draft
memorandum of understanding that they will take concrete measures
to promote their cooperation in the foreign field in a bid to
enhance their image in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
The member states will establish liaison offices in their
foreign ministries with attention on aspects relating to foreign
affairs, making joint briefings, and soliciting support for the
EAC regional projects.
</P>
<P>
"They will provide consular services on behalf of the other
member states where they do not have embassies and consulates,
including renewal of passports and any other necessary assistance
to nationals of member states," the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
It further said that the EAC members should cooperate in
multilateral diplomacy with a view to harmonizing policies with
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Abuja Treaty for
African Economic Community, the Nonaligned Movement, the Group of
77 and the (British) Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also proposed collaboration by member states in
trade, investment, tourism as well as cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
In April, the three EAC member states approved a draft treaty
in a move to upgrade their cooperation into a treaty level to
help define in more clearer terms the shape and inclination of
the cooperation aimed at establishing a single market and
investment area in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on the basis of the defunct East African
Community which collapsed in 1977 due to reasons including the
divergence of economic policies then pursued by the member
states, the continued perception of disproportionate sharing of
benefits and lack of adequate compensation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation in 1996, the new EAC has tried to address
the shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives and
determined to place the new regional integration on a sustainable
basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Option Exchange (LIFFE) announced Friday that it will
start full customer testing for the equity options release of its
new electronic trading platform: LIFFE CONNECTtm on 27 July 1998.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE CONNECTtm is a new generation electronic trading system

</P>
<P>
Based on an open architecture and using front-end solutions
developed by a wide range of third party system vendors, LIFFE
CONNECTtm will provide users with the potential to access the
LIFFE market from any PC located anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first opportunity for the LIFFE'S 45 member
firms, who have signed up to use the service, to test their
in-house systems against the LIFFE's trading engine.
</P>
<P>
The next key step is the start of full dress rehearsals which

<HEADLINE> Burundi Armed Group Denies Involvement in Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- An armed group of
PALIPEHUTU has distanced itself from a rebel attack near
Bujumbura, capital of Burundi, in which 20 people were reportedly
killed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The leader of PALIPEHUTU, Sezoya Antoine, who is attending the
second round of Burundi peace talks in north Tanzanian town of
Arusha, said Friday in a statement that his army has nothing to
do with the attack.
</P>
<P>
"We're totally dissociated from the attack which killed nearly
20 people near Bujumbura on Wednesday," Antoine said.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that PALIPEHUTU had stopped armed hostilities
since July 20 to help the resumption of the second round of
Burundi peace talks chaired by the international mediator on
Burundi, Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We want everybody to respect the peace agreement signed here
last month by all the parties," Antoine said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the leader also said that
he has commanded his army to stop fighting unless an order is
given.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Burundi peace talks continued to make progress
Friday as all warring parties began closed-door and face-to-face
discussion on the root of the Burundi conflict.
</P>
<P>
The talks bring the government of Pierre Buyoya, who took
power in a July 1996 coup, face to face with Hutu rebels who are
fighting the country's Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
The top agenda, the rules and procedures of negotiations, will
be tackled later after the negotiating team of Nyerere completed
drawing the procedures.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's team is helped by nominated members from each of the
19 parties taking part in the peace talks to end ethnic violence
in the tiny central African republic which has claimed more than
150,000 lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Nyerere, Hashim Mbita, said that the session
on Friday afternoon was adjourned to allow Nyerere and his team
to draw rules and procedures of the negotiations. Journalists
were not allowed to attend the session.
</P>
<P>
Delegates, however, tipped that Mathias Himita, Chairman of
PRP (one of the parties at the talks) said that absence of a king
in Burundi had led to such a brutal ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, former president of Burundi, claimed
in his half-an-hour presentation that previous insincerity of
governments had plunged the land-locked country into an
unprecedented crisis between Hutus and Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expects Close Working Ties with Obuchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
expects close working relationship with Keizo Obuchi, Japan's
foreign minister but now prime minister-designate following his
election as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, the White
House said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The president believes that he can forge a close working
relationship with Foreign Minister Obuchi if he is confirmed as
prime minister," spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was elected as the leader of the Liberal Democratic
Party on Friday -- a move that assures he will formally become
the nation's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi has said he intends to act quickly to deal with
Japan's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Japan knows seriously we take the
commitments Japan has made to economic modernization," McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not our place to comment on the ability of a prime
minister to promulgate a program," McCurry said when asked if
the United States was confident Obuchi would achieve his goals.
</P>
<P>
McCurry, however, urged Obuchi to take bold and decisive steps
to revive the country's moribund economy and speed the pace of
banking sector reform.
</P>
<P>
"It's very critical that the new government move quickly and
with some measure of boldness to develop decisive action to
address the problems of the banking system and to restore rebust
domestic and demand-led growth to the Japanese economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
the White House press secretary said the United States looked
forward to Obuchi's economic action plans in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the positions that he has announced in the past few
days, particularly in the area of fiscal policy, seem to us
promising ... But it's important that those words be followed up
with concrete action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked when Obuchi and Clinton would meet, McCurry said: "We
will look for a mutually convenient time and hopefully an early
and convenient time to meet with the new prime minister."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright could hold talks at an
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in
Manila, McCurry said. Obuchi will attend an ASEAN Regional Forum
banquet on Sunday.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A tanker truck Friday slammed
into an interstate overpass and burst into flames in Valdese,
North Carolina, setting the bridge on fire and collapsing it onto
the truck. One person was killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The European infrared space
telescope finds a new population of galaxies, the first objects
known to contribute to the background glow of the universe,
according to a press release from the European Space Agency (ESA).
</P>
<P>
A team of French astronomers using the ESA's ISO space
telescope has detected two dozen distant galaxies that are
undergoing a process of intense evolution, either merging to build
larger ones or reaching their final shape.
</P>
<P>
These are the first individual objects known to contribute
their energy to the bulk of the Cosmic Infrared Background, a
radiation that fills the entire universe like a wallpaper, emitted
at the era when galaxies were formed.
</P>
<P>
The new-found distant galaxies are indeed like the "pattern" in
this "cosmic wallpaper".
</P>
<P>
This discovery will for the first time enable scientists to
test different theories of galaxy formation, and therefore have a
better understanding of the birth process of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
How the galaxies are born remained a mystery so far, mainly
because current telescopes cannot reach that far back in time,
about 12,000 million years ago.

<HEADLINE> Seven Indian Scientists Asked to Leave U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Seven Indian scientists
have been asked to leave the United States because of sanctions
imposed on India for its nuclear tests in May, a government
research center said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have been working at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, on
two semiconductor manufacturing projects and a ceramics
processing project, said NIST spokesman Michael Newman.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has blacklisted these three projects and
has put on hold four projects NIST is running in conjunction
with the Indian National Physical Laboratory, all related to
scientific standards.
</P>
<P>
"We were asked to provide the State Department with a list of
projects in which researchers from Indian institutions are
taking part. We were given back a list with markings as to who
should leave and who could stay," Newman said
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which responded to India with its own nuclear tests,
is also liable to the same sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Energy (DOE) said in a factsheet that the
sanctions required the suspension of all DOE-financed activities
with Indian or Pakistani government entities, except for
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
All visits by Indians and Pakistanis from the blacklisted
institutions must also be suspended, along with high-level visit
to India and Pakistan by DOE personnel, it said.

<HEADLINE> Demilitarization in Africa Depends on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour said Friday that the best option for demilitarization in
Africa is to get rid of poverty through developing economy.
</P>
<P>
Amour said this at the close of an international conference on
Africa's demilitarization in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"It is very necessary for African leadership to pay more
attention towards uplifting the economic performances and direct
the national incomes to the well-being of the people," sources
quoted Amour as telling more than 100 senior military experts and
politicians from Africa and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar president said that too much emphasis on war
would erode the meager resources, but too little preparation for
war may also make Africa vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
"It is advisable that a careful balance must be drawn in order
to have both the necessities complimenting each other," President
Amour said. "Even a small but well equipped army needs huge sum
of money."
</P>
<P>
Amour urged the African leaders to formulate new economic
strategies of competitiveness in the globalized world trade and
to set up a common defense mechanism to protect the stability in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Conference on Leadership Challenges of
Demilitarization in Africa was organized by the Arias Foundation
for Peace and Human Progress in collaboration with the African
Leadership Forum and the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The delegates, including former Haitian President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and former President of Panama Guillermo
Ondara.
</P>
<P>
In his key-note address to open the conference Wednesday,
former president of Costa Rica Oscar Arias called on the
industrialized countries, especially the United States to stop
pouring their arms to the poor African continent.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa urged in his opening speech
African countries to cut down on military expenditures and to
promote their economies.
</P>
<P>
"The military expenses must reflect a realistic assessment of
external threat, if any, or the amount of resources at disposal,"
Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
The best way to decrease military expenditures is to promote
the socio-economic development which demand infusion of greater
resources both private and official, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mkapa said, the aid from the developed countries to
Africa has drastically dropped from a total of 368 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1996 to 272 billion U.S. Dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Aid from the richest countries, G7, is a mere 0.19 percent of
their collective national incomes, far below the target of 0.7
percent set by the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa underscored that African countries should build a
consensus that a speedy socio-economic development will help
Africa to boost its capacity to move from confrontations and
wars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Serious in Fighting AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
adopt a multi-sectorial approach through social mobilization and
advocacy to effectively combat the AIDS pandemic, a minister of
state said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Oppah Muchinguri, minister in the President's Office
responsible for gender issues, said this when she officially
opened a workshop to map out a program of action following the
recent Ugandan HIV/AIDS educational trip.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is no longer just a ministry of health and child welfare
concern, but a problem affecting all sections of society," she
said, adding that "combating it requires a collective
comprehensive approach."
</P>
<P>
She said that women and children suffered most as a result of
the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan minister said that 25.84 percent of sexually
active adults between 15 and 49 were HIV positive. Also infected
were 720,000 women and 57,000 children.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, she said, Zimbabwe has had an estimated 650,000
cumulative AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
"The current estimated number of AIDS orphans is 300,000, and
it is projected to rise to 800,000 by year 2000," said
Muchinguri.
</P>
<P>
She stressed an HIV/AIDS prevention program would be placed at
the national and sub-national level.
</P>
<P>
"The Uganda trip showed us a lot, especially in the
involvement of politicians and government in the campaign against
AIDS," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister was handed a citizens's petition calling on
government and politicians to fully commit to the campaign
against AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reactions About Release of Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, JULY 24 (Xinhua) -- The release of 136 genocide
suspects from Kigali Thursday has provoked mixed reactions in the
general public, with some people expressing fears that this could
provoke retribution from their victims.
</P>
<P>
"In releasing the suspects we targeted the terminally ill, the
old, as well as those whose files lack sufficiently convincing
evidence," the Kigali Prosecutor, Emmanuel Rukangira, told Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
This process has been going on for quite a while and is going
to continue, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the release broadcast on state-run radio
Rwandan radio and television Thursday night has triggered concern
about what might happen once those released reach their homes.
</P>
<P>
"Some of those set free could try to kill the evidence in
eliminating potential witnesses," one genocide survivor from
Nyamirambo told RNA.
</P>
<P>
This survivor affirmed that one of those released was a
militiaman who participated in the killings of the Tutsis in that
quarter of the capital in the 100-day genocide.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand how it is said that there is not enough
evidence for crimes he was charged with," the survivor said.
</P>
<P>
Other people in the capital Kigali fear that the victims would
tempted to take justice in their own hands, as the feel betrayed
by the judicial system in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
But some organizations catering for survivors believe that
there is no problem with releasing genocide suspects who are
terminally sick, and who were just waiting for the end of their
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
"The pictures passed on television were quite shocking," a
chairperson of one of these organizations told RNA. "Those are
finished, they could not move by themselves, they were brought
out on stretchers..." he commented.
</P>
<P>
"As long as those allegedly without sufficiently incriminating
evidence, it is up to their communities to stand up and provide
it," he underscored.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that if those released presented a real menace to
the victims, the people should protest and have them punished.
</P>
<P>
In the past, people in southern Gikongoro Prefecture had shown
a staunch opposition against releasing the suspects, claiming
that some of them were involved in past pogroms which rocked the
area since 1959, before getting involved again in the 1994
killings.
</P>
<P>
In Butare Prefecture, more than 22 genocide suspects, who had
been reportedly released for lack of evidence, were murdered by
unknown people.

<HEADLINE> Greece Slams Turkish President's Statement on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday expressed its
opposition to the statement made by Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel that Turkey would not allow Cyprus to become "a second
Crete."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described Demirel's statement as "highly
provocative," saying that it also revealed Ankara's "true
intentions."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president reportedly said that Crete, an island in
the southern part of Greece, was given to Greece as a gift by
Turkey in the particular circumstances of the times, but this
could not be done in the case of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Reppas urged neighboring Turkey to create suitable conditions
in the Bakan region rather than resorting to statements of the
type made by Demirel which created a climate of tension.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits, the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Greece and Turkey rose this year due to the
nearing of the deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in Cyprus, which has been divided into the Greek
Cypriots- dominated south and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north
since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and took over the northern
third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Outspoken French Lawyer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Henri-Rene Garaud, a 72-year-old
French Lawyer known for American-style pragmatism and promotion of
the idea of self-defense, died in Paris on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A founder of the Association of Legitimate Defense, Garaud is
known for anti-leftist views and his calls for the revival of the
death penalty in France, which was abolished in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He was also an advocate of absolute safety for private
properties.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the tenor of the bar," Garaud was a relentless
fighter in court and served as the lawyer for various clients
including small shop owners, jewellers, pump attendants, policemen
and other lower middle class people.
</P>
<P>
"See one who did you harm is punished, it's normal. When one
accepts a defense case, he should fight with all means for the
result," he once said.
</P>
<P>
By seeking patronization from ordinary people, Garaud said he
won success by climbing a watch tower not scaled until now.
</P>
<P>
"My cafe owners, pump attendants and jewellers are worth as
much as others," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Capitol Shootout "Savagery" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- With the Capitol's flags at
half-staff in mourning, U.S. President Bill Clinton Saturday
called a gunman's spree at the national landmark "a moment of
savagery at the front door of American civilization."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Andrews Air Force base before leaving on a trip to
Norfolk, Virginia, Clinton praised the two police officers who
died in Friday's shootout and those who rushed to help.
</P>
<P>
"In this one heartless act, there were many acts of heroism,"
The Associated Press quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are trying to learn how and why a gunman burst
into the Capitol and opened fire before being shot and captured. A
female tourist was wounded in the exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Russell E. Weston Jr., 41, of rural
Rimini, Montana, was being held under heavy guard at a hospital
and was in critical condition Saturday after surgery for gunshot
wounds. Charges were pending.
</P>
<P>
With the Capitol reopened Saturday, Clinton said, "We must keep
it a place where people can freely and proudly walk the halls of
our government."
</P>
<P>
Killed were Jacob Chestnut, 58, and John Gibson, 42, both
18-year veterans of the Capitol police force. Each was married
with three children and colleagues said Chestnut, an Air Force
veteran, planned to retire soon.
</P>
<P>
The wounded tourist was identified as Angela Dickerson, 24.
George Washington University Hospital spokeswoman Lisa Saisselin
said Dickerson's condition had been upgraded from serious to
stable and she may be released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the fallen officers for saving many others from
"exposure to lethal violence."
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned Republican Senator Bill Frist, a heart
surgeon, who rushed to the aid of the victims and the suspect.
</P>
<P>
"The shooting at the U.S. Capitol was a moment of savagery at
the front door of American civilization," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Ass'n Holds Dinner for Visiting Mainland Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIBEI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Straits Peaceful Reunification
Association hosted a dinner here this evening in honor of the
visiting delegation from the mainland which is here to study
education in the island province of China.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Li Yafei, deputy secretary general of
the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Liang Su-Yung, chairman of the Taiwan-based association, said
in a speech at the dinner that pushing exchanges across the
straits and talks between the two associations is a major issue of
concern to the people across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
His association, which was set up in April this year, adheres
to the "one China" principle and hopes that both sides will take
common steps towards a peaceful reunification, Liang noted.
</P>
<P>
The association will give priority to increasing exchanges and
commencing direct mail, communications and air and shipping
services, and to urge negotiations for ending the state of
hostility between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Li extended his gratitude to the Taiwanese association for the
warm reception and remarked that the watchword and orientation of
the mainland association to develop cross-straits relations toward
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
At the present stage, the mainland body has persistently
advocated that cross-straits exchanges be expanded, and further,
that political negotiations across the straits be held as early as
possible. Procedural talks prior to the proposed political
negotiations could held first, he noted.
</P>
<P>
While factors of instability still exist in cross-straits
relations, a stable environment for their development and normal
exchanges between the two sides can only be achieved through
political talks, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He told his host that since people from various circles in
Taiwan have many views and proposals on cross-straits relations
and the issue of the reunification of the motherland, the mainland
association is willing to exchange views with them in order to
join hands in realizing the great cause of reunification at an
earlier date.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Foreign Secretaries Continue Preparatory Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign secretaries from the
seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) began a two-day meeting here Saturday to review the
progress in implementing decisions made at last year's SAARC
summit in the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
They were discussing the whole range of items on the agenda for
the upcoming SAARC summit scheduled for July 29-31 in the Sri
Lankan capital, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries were meeting behind closed doors amid
tight security arrangements. A total of 6,000 police officers, in
addition to army soldiers, are being deployed in Colombo for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said the items they were reviewing included specific
projects now under consideration, the issues of preferential trade
and the proposed free trade zone in the region, various reports
from the SAARC's technical committees dealing with different areas
of cooperation within SAARC.
</P>
<P>
Progress in carrying out the anti-terrorism and anti-drugs
plans is also under discussion. Recommendations on the basis of
the discussions will be formulated for the SAARC foreign ministers
who will meet here on next Monday and Tuesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad also said that the Group of Eminent Persons, set up at
the Male summit with the aim of developing a long-range vision and
formulating a perspective plan of action, will deliver its report
straight to the SAARC foreign ministers. "But they (the foreign
ministers) may ask us perhaps to look at it," he added.
</P>
<P>
At their summit in Male, the Maldives, in May last year, the
South Asian leaders decided to move faster from the South Asian
Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) to the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA), bringing forward the timetable for creating
such a free trade zone from 2005 to 2001.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Robust Growth of Egypt's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A Senior International Monetary Fund
(IMF) official said Saturday that Egyptian economy is growing
robustly and no longer needs IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian economy can now stand alone. Egypt is no longer
in need of IMF support. But the fund will stand by ready for
providing any required technical assistance," IMF mission chief in
Cairo Howard Handy said.
</P>
<P>
The technical support will include outlining the bases of a
growing financial sector and means of promoting Egyptian
financial strategies. The IMF has been sending experts to help
governments seeking reform in economic areas.
</P>
<P>
Handy is in Egypt for the final review of an IMF loan
program. IMF approved a two-year, 350 million U.S. dollar loan to
Egypt in October 1996, but Cairo has not drawn on the money.
</P>
<P>
Egypt decided it wanted IMF technical support in macroeconomic
fields instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Middle East News Agency Saturday,
Handy said the IMF mission has been impressed by Egyptian
government's professionalism and commitment to continue the
IMF-sponsored reform program that started in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Public Business Sector Atef Ebeid, on the
other hand, said Cairo is discussing "a new formula for future
cooperation" with the fund after the current economic reform
program ends in September.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid expects an agreement on that formula to be reached by
October, adding that Egypt does not need a new formal agreement
with the IMF but the fund will be ready to offer technical support.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister noted that Cairo is now preparaing for
"more ambitious future work" and seeking to make more progress on
the successes already achieved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he underlined Cairo's commitment to privatization
and deregulation of the economy to maintain high growth rates.
</P>
<P>
The IMF made an assessment in May of Egyptian privatization
program, which indicated that Egypt ranked fourth on the list of
some 39 countries in terms of the efficiency in their
privatization drive.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Bank, Fund Support Road Project in E. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) - The African Development Bank
(ADB) and the African Development Fund (ADF) have jointly pledged
19.8 billion Tanzanian Shillings (about 30 million U.S. Dollars) to
finance projects in the three member states of the East African
Cooperation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
The pledge was part of a cooperation agreement signed here
Thursday between visiting ADB President Omar Kabbaj and the
Executive Secretary of the EAC Secretariat Francis Muthaura,
local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kabbaj said the ADB and ADF will support the 112-kilometer
Road Project which will link Kagera Region in Tanzania to the
road network in Uganda through Mtukula in a bid to promote
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations will also finance other cooperation
projects on food security, agriculture and animal husbandry,
tourism, natural resources and environment, energy, transport and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Kabbaj, who concluded a two-day visit Thursday, hailed
the important positive political and economic changes which have
taken place over the past decade in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Since the growth rate in the continent's GDP has risen from
the average of 1.6 percent between 1990 and 1994 to about three
percent in 1995, five percent in 1996 and 3.7 percent in 1997,
many countries have been experiencing economic recovery, he noted.
</P>
<P>
While underscoring the importance of collaboration between
the bank and the EAC secretariat, he said: "The deepening of
economic reforms and the progress made in stabilizing the
socio-political framework provides encouragement over the
region's economic development prospects."
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded in 1996 on the basis of the defunct East
African Community which collapsed in 1977 due to reasons
including the divergence of economic policies then pursued by the
member states, the continued perception of disproportionate
sharing of benefits and lack of adequate compensation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the new EAC has been trying to address the
shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives and
determined to place the new regional integration on a sustainable
basis.

<HEADLINE> Waterlogged Wuhan Back on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- After suffering heavy urban flooding
from recent torrential rains, the city of Wuhan is returning to
normal as much of the rain water had been drained away by this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
By 2:00 pm today, 100 million cubic meters of water had been
drained, and no large areas of flood water remained in this
capital of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Major thoroughfares have now reopened to traffic, and
two-thirds of the flood-stricken businesses have resumed
operation, including the eight large department stores that had
been closed by the flooding.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the flood water in Wuhan was now basically
drained, but the 100,000 people who have been draining and
conducting rescue operation are still on high alert for another
possible siege of torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
Beginning early Tuesday morning, 34 hours of continuous heavy
rains brought 110 million cubic meters of water down on the
city.
</P>
<P>
By 2:00 pm today, the water level of the Yangtze River at Wuhan
reached 28.22 meters, or 0.92 meters above the danger mark.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest rainfall was 616.6 mm, a historic high.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, a flood prevention contingent of 50,000
has been patrolling along the 287-kilometer-long Yangtze River dyke,
and no major breaks have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Prices at outdoor grocery markets rose only 20-50 percent,
an increase described by local people as within the normal range
for weather-related emergencies.
</P>
<P>
According to Wuhan's epidemic prevention department, there have
been no reports of epidemic outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
Latest forecasts warn that from July 27 to 29 torrential rains
are expected in the mainstream area of the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River and the Poyang Lake system. Hubei Province is now
experiencing the worst flooding since 1954.

HAWAII, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army of
China (PLA) is willing to further deepen mutual understanding and

<HEADLINE> Turkey's General Elections Fall in April 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said Saturday that he and his coalition partners have
bridged gaps and agreed to general elections April next year, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, Democratic Left Party (DS) Chairman Bulent Ecevit and
Democratic Turkey Party (DTP) leader Husammatin Cindoruk reached
agreement during their discussions in Istanbul, the largest city
of Turkey, Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement endorsed by the three partners, the general
elections will be held across the country on April 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
His coalition partner, Ecevit, had held that the elections
should be held in November or December of this year.
</P>
<P>
Another partner, Cindoruk, had strongly opposed the elections
taking place either in the fall or in April 1999, and requested
that a later date be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Having reached consensus with Republican People's Party (CHP)
leader Deniz Baykal, who provides support to Yilmaz's minority
coalition government from outside, Yilmaz wanted the elections to
be held in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yilmaz-Baykal agreement, both the provincial
and general elections will be held together in April.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in line with Baykal's request, Yilmaz's coalition
will resign at the end of this year and a "low profile election
government" will be formed.
</P>
<P>
But Ecevit opposed the idea of an election government, saying
this concept would cause loss of valuable time and adversely
affect the completion of reforms initiated by the coalition.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The water level of the Yangtze
River climbed above the historic high today at its Jiujiang
section in east China's Jiangxi Province, topping the previous
record by 0.04 m to reach 22.4 m at 8:00 pm.
</P>
<P>
The previous high was recorded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It's the second time the water level has exceeded the record
this year," Acting Mayor Liu Jifu told Xinhua, referring to the
22.2 m recorded on July 4.
</P>
<P>
The water level of Poyang Lake has topped 21.75 m, 2.75 m
higher than the danger line, and is approaching the record high of
21.93 m, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Local weathermen say that more heavy rains are expected to
arrive in the province in the next few days, forecasting that
water levels of both the Yangtze River and the Poyang Lake will
rise further still.
</P>
<P>
To help Jiangxi fight against the possibility of severe
flooding, central and local governments are sending more relief
supplies to flood-threatened areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 900,000 people have been stationed on local dykes to
prevent any possible breaches.
</P>
<P>
"We are making every effort to safeguard the dykes of the
Yangtze, the urban districts of Jiujiang city, as well as key
water conservancy facilities along the Beijing-Kowloon railway,"

<HEADLINE> Nuke Tests Thwart Progress of SAARC: Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan have done much to thwart progress of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Chairman of the
Press Council of India P. B. Sawant said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a conference on "An Initiative for the Confederation of
SAARC Countries" organized by SAARC Citizen Forum, Sawant said the
nuclear tests have further strained the tenuous bond between SAARC
member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The tests have put the clock of the progress of the
organization (SAARC) back by many years," Sawant said in his
opening address.
</P>
<P>
Heads of states or government of the SAARC countries are
scheduled to hold a summit in Colombo towards the end of this
month to discuss, among others, regional cooperations between
South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"While on the one hand, we have been talking of regional
cooperation and pooling of resources for common development, here
we are expending our meager resources on destructive activities,"
Sawant said.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, he said, to talk of common economic,
social, cultural, and technological development sounds a big joke.
</P>
<P>
In the present political scenario, the goal of confederation
might be laudable but seems to be distant cry, Sawant said, adding
that "we may not be able to march towards it, but we can at least
inch towards it."
</P>
<P>
SAARC, established in December 1985 with an aim to promote
economic, social, cultural, scientific and technological
cooperations in South Asian region, is composed of Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian law enforcement agents have
found 13 "Shmel" grenade launchers in a clandestine ammunition
depot in Moscow suburbs, Itar-Tass news agency reports.
</P>
<P>
The press center of the Federal Security Department (FSB) said
the launchers, capable of destroying combat hardware and killing
large numbers of people, were spotted near dachas in the Chekhovo
region.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted an FSB spokesman as saying the depot, which
belonged to one of the organized criminal gangs operating in the
Moscow region, was discovered by local FSB agents.
</P>
<P>
Since the weapons were hidden in areas where they might have
fallen into the hands of strangers or youngsters, or removed by
criminals, the FSB decided not to wait for the owners to turn up,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were believed to be stolen from army depots and
then sold to organized criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
Measures are being taken to find the criminals, the FSB
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reaffirms Support for Chechnya President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
reaffirmed support for the presidency of Aslan Maskhadov in
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya, and demanded talks to
ensure law and order in the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting Saturday with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in
Shuiskaya Chupa, where the president is recessing, Yeltsin called
for a Kiriyenko-Maskhadov meeting for measures to ensure stability
and law in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"I reaffirm once again that we support the government of
Chechnya and Aslan Maskhadov personally," Yeltsin said. "If
someone has any doubt about that, he is wrong."
</P>
<P>
"If Maskhadov wants the meeting to be held we shall arrange
it," Itar-Tass quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said a meeting with Maskhadov was designed to
thoroughly discuss the Chechnya situation and measures to ensure
normal law and order in the region without violating either
Russian or Chechen legislations.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov escaped an assassination attempt with some bruises
Thursday when a parked car exploded just as his motorcade was
passing by.
</P>
<P>
Two of his bodyguards were killed and three others seriously
wounded in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov, viewed as the most moderate leader in Chechnya,
which is seeking independence from Russia, had first accused the
Russian secret service and then other military factions in
Chechnya of masterminding the plot.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high in Chechnya, and Maskhadov
declared a state of emergency more than a month ago to crack down
on rampant crime and violence.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya has witnessed rising internal strife between rival
factions following the departure of Russian troops in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached earlier that year between Maskhadov
and Alexandr Lebed, then national security advisor to Yeltsin, a
decision on Chechnya's status would be postponed until 2001.

NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said Saturday he was looking forward to meeting
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with a positive mind and
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Week Magazine on the eve of his
departure for Colombo to attend the summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Vajpayee expressed
his hope that the scheduled meeting with Sharif would result in a

</P>
<P>
He said he wished to discuss differences between India and
Pakistan including those on Kashmir bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Prime minister, however, ruled out a third party
mediation on the Kashmir issue, saying that "we are of the firm
view that there is no role for any third party in our bilateral
relationship."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is scheduled to hold his meeting with Sharif, the
first between the two prime ministers since the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan in May, on the sidelines of the SAARC summit on
July 29.

the confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
"In the aftermath of our nuclear tests, we are also prepared to
discuss a no-first-use of nuclear weapon agreement with Pakistan,"
said Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
He declared that India was committed to resolving its
differences with Pakistan peacefully and through a process of
bilateral dialogue so as to build a stable structure of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether New Delhi would sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) if Pakistan were to do so, the prime minister said
as far as India was concerned, there is no link with Pakistan in
signing the CTBT as India's decision would based on its national
interests.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Judge First Rwandan Criminal in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Agwu Ukiwe Okali, registrar
of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has said
that the tribunal's first judgement was expected in August in the
case of Jean-Paul Akayesu, an ICTR press release reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While visiting Kigali, capital of Rwanda, Okali said besides
the case of Akayesu, the former bourg mestre of Taba Commune in
Gitarama Prefecture, the tribunal also expects to deliver its
sentence on Jean Kambanda, former Prime Minister of Rwanda at the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda is the first Rwandan suspect who pleaded guilty
to genocide and crimes against humanity before the tribunal based
in Arusha, northern Tanzania, on May 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Okali Friday, Rwandan Vice-President
and Minister of Defense Paul Kagame said the
tribunal has made significant progress in its work under
difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
His government pledged strong support for the Tribunal's
process, because "we are partners in this situation".
</P>
<P>
Okali has been on a week-long working visit to Rwanda since
Monday. He has met with senior officials of the Rwandan
government, the media, and representatives of civil society
including the victims of the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 suspects have been indicted so far by the ICTR,
founded by the United Nations following the Rwanda massacre in
April 1994 soon after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died
when his plane was shot down over capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Over 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were
reportedly killed in the three-month slaughter.

<P>
NANJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The water level on the Jiangsu
section of the Yangtze River in east China has risen rapidly this
week due to flooding in the river's middle and upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
The water flow of the Yangtze -- 60,000 to over 70,000
cu. m. per second -- has topped the warning mark for a month since
mid June, and the protective capability of the dykes along the
river has declined.
</P>
<P>
The water flow reached 77,200 cubic meters per second today,
according to a report issued by the Provincial Flood Control
Headquarters. The water level in Xiaguan, in the provincial
capital of Nanjing, has reached 9.82 meters, 1.32 meters higher
than the danger level, and water levels on other parts of the
Yangtze have also reached record highs.
</P>
<P>
The situation will become more severe when flood peaks from
the middle and upper reaches of the river approach.
</P>
<P>
As many as 340,000 people have been mobilized around the clock
to protect the dykes, said Xu Junren, deputy director of the
provincial water resources department.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Property Market Worst Hit, But </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's property sector,
engulfed by the regional economic turmoil, has been hit the
hardest, but is not all gloom and doom. This is the general view
of the Speakers at the 10th National Real Estate Convention here
on July 22-23.
</P>
<P>
Following the economic slowdown since July last year, property
prices on the local market have gone down between 20 and 35
percent, depending on the location.
</P>
<P>
There is about 38 billion ringgit (about 9.22 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of property "lying around" in Malaysia now.
</P>
<P>
The credit crunch, high interest rates, over-supply of high-end
commercial and residential units, lack of confidence and a
wait-and-see attitude among purchasers have all contributed to the
overall gloom of the property market.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gloomy scene in the property sector at present,
most speakers at the convention were optimistic that the sector
would recover.
</P>
<P>
Housing Developers' Association President Eddy Chen Lo Loi said
the property sector has reached the near bottom and will soon be
on its road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
And Jeffrey Ng, Managing Director of Asia Pacific Land Bhd,
said despite of the present glut in the Malaysian property market,
developers can still benefit from some of the downturn's positive
effects such as the declining labor costs that now allows
developers to choose the best employees at a lower pay rate.
</P>
<P>
It was also noted that demand for housing will still continue
as there will always be population growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
With the country's population projected to touch 23.3 million
by the end of this century, the requirement for housing to meet
the needs of the growing population is tremendous.
</P>
<P>
Housing, a major industry which attracts considerable resources
and generated employment opportunities, accounted for 10 percent
of a gross domestic product (GDP) of 170 billion ringgit (about
41.262 billion U.S. dollars at present rate) and for 40 to 50
percent of some 850,000 employed by the construction sector in
1996 when there were about 4.8 million housing units catering to a
population of about 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
According to Henry Butcher Lim and Long Director Fahariah Abdul
Wahab, the market for houses below 150,000 ringgit (about 36,407
U.S. dollars) was expected to grow despite of the current economic
situation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Property Market Worst Hit, But </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Alan Tong Kok Mau, President of FIABCI, the International
Real Estate Federation, said some developers have survived the
economic crisis successfully as the demand continued to be there.
"Slackening demand does not mean there is no demand ... so we have
to sharpen on skills to find niches in the market."
</P>
<P>
As for ways to tackle the current problems faced by developers,
it was proposed that a serious study be made on the Real Estates
Investment Trusts (REITS), a U.S. model, as instruments to create
liquidity in the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Also, to encourage purchasers to invest in the housing market,
it was suggested that support be given to the first-time house
buyers such as exemptions from all monetary curbs on housing loans
or having preferential rates of interest.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it was also proposed that the quantum for withdrawal
for housing under the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) be increased
to reduce the burden on eligible purchasers, because the amount of
housing loans available from banks has decreased and the interest
charged by banks on housing loans is high.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to attract more foreign buyers into Malaysia's
property sector, the approval process for foreign purchase of
properties was proposed to be limited to a single stage or the
state authorities.
</P>
<P>
Presently, foreigners who want to purchase properties worth
more than 250,000 ringgit (about 60,679 U.S. dollars) in Malaysia
must gain government's approval in two stages -- firstly, from the
Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) and secondly, the state
authorities.
</P>
<P>
As such, the government has been called for the setting up of a
consultative mechanism together with the private sector to
formulate guidelines and rules on property purchased by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
It was also suggested that tax incentives be offered and
restrictions on purchases by foreigners be relaxed to woo foreign
participation in the local property market, which could bring the
much needed foreign exchange, help create more employment and
subsequently stimulate the property market and related downstream
industries.
</P>
<P>
The government has been responsive and ready to revitalize the
industry with the measures introduced including the lifting of
levies imposed on foreign purchases of properties and granting of
loans to properties costing 150,000 ringgit (about 36,407 U.S.
dollars) or less besides setting up the National Housing Fund.
</P>
<P>
More recently, under the National Economic Recovery Plan
announced on July 23, the property sector is recommended to be
reclassified from "unproductive" to "priority" for bank loans.
</P>
<P>
A general view is that the property market turnaround depends
on the country's economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Ready to Continue Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian leadership was
ready to continue direct talks with Israel in a bid to clinch a
deal over Israeli withdrawal, the Voice of Palestine radio
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after Friday night's Cabinet meeting, the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) declared its willingness to
continue the talks, which were resumed last week.
</P>
<P>
The statement blamed the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process on the hard-line policies adopted by the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, the Palestinians were willing to
continue talks in order to avoid a outbreak of widespread violence
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The talks on an long overdue deal on Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank hit a snag Wednesday after three days of talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA refused to continue the talks to protest against what
they called Israeli refusal to accept the United States proposal
on the scope of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal asked Israel to hand over 13 percent more of
the West Bank to the Palestinians during the second stage of
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But after his meeting with Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani Friday in Ramallah, PNA President Yasser Arafat
changed his position and agreed to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing in the Israeli government said the proposed
scope was unacceptable, citing that it would endanger the
security of the Jewish country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN Stresses Unity in Face of Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
(AMM), which ended here Saturday afternoon, stressed the need for
ASEAN member countries to unite and cooperate more closely to
resolve the financial crisis that has ravaged the regional
economies since July last year.
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement and in their speeches at the two-day
meeting, the delegates made it clear that only unity and
cooperation can help their countries tide over the economic
difficulties and return their economies to the prosperity they had
previously enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, presiding over the opening
ceremony, pointed out, "As we have gone through this storm
together, we have acquired a deeper realization that we need to
bind ourselves to one another even more tightly."
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Some ASEAN countries, particularly Indonesia and Thailand, have
been hit hard by the financial crisis: their currencies have
fallen by as much as up to 80 percent against the U.S. dollar,
banks and factories closed down and millions of people have been
thrown out of work. Some members have even registered negative
economic growth, presenting a sharp contrast to the fact that the
region was one of the fastest-growing areas in the world before
the crisis struck.
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement Saturday afternoon, Philippine
Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon, whose country is
chairman of this year's AMM meetings, noted that in face of the
difficulties, the ASEAN, instead of bowing to the pressures,
"sought to enhance its solidarity and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from other member countries also called for
closer unity and cooperation in reviving the economies in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"If we have faith in our shared vision, if we use our resources
with foresight and wisdom and help one another in an unrelenting
pursuit of development, we will not only survive, we will not
merely recover -- we will... triumph over our adversities and
resume our steady march toward stable peace and sustained
progress," said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, whose
country is among the hardest hit in the crisis, at the opening
session.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan of Thailand, where the
financial crisis first erupted, said, "During this crucial
juncture, it is... vital for us... to redouble our efforts to
strengthen cohesiveness and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"The way forward remains cooperation, more cooperation and
better cooperation," Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi
declared at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad of Laos, which joined the
ASEAN just last year, noted in his statement that in face of the
economic difficulties, "our member states have intensified greater
cooperation and coordination to address the current situation."
</P>
<P>
"Closer cooperation will help us overcome the current crisis,
continue to advance on the path toward prosperity," Vietnamese
Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has actually already adopted a number of collective
measures to address the economic problems and mitigate the effects
on the people.
</P>
<P>
Among them is a decision by ASEAN finance ministers to
establish an ASEAN surveillance mechanism to closely monitor
regional macroeconomic and financial indicators and to serve as an
early warning system and thus help avert a recurrence of the
crisis. Work is now under way to implement the decision, which was
"strongly endorsed" by the foreign ministers at their meeting.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers have also endorsed the use of ASEAN
currencies for the settlement of intra-ASEAN trade to reduce
members' dependency on the U.S. dollar and promote intra-ASEAN
trade. Modalities for carrying this out are to be agreed upon
between the trading partners concerned and are being worked out
between Malaysia and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand, and Indonesia and Thailand, ASEAN
Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino said in a report to the AMM.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN member countries have also agreed to speed up the
implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the ASEAN Investment
Area and the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation Scheme to promote trade
and investment and maintain an open trade and investment
environment in ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Bank Makes More Profit in 1997/98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia made a profit of over 76.86 million U.S. Dollars during
the just-ended 1997/98 fiscal year, 10.7 percent over the target
of 69.4 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Habte-Sellasie Hagos, Vice-President of marketing and planning
sector of the bank has said that the good performance of the bank
was the result of the country's overall economic growth,
considerable boost of the private economic sector as well as the
expansion of trade, the Ethiopian Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Habte-Sellasie said the bank has also given out short, medium
and long-term loans amounting to 514 million U.S. Dollars during
the fiscal year, 10.6 percent and 28.9 percent more than those
loaned during 1996/97 and 1995/96 respectively.
</P>
<P>
He contributed the increase of loans to the introduction of
new loaning systems which provide wider opportunities for
starting new projects.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia is the largest bank in the
country with 168 branches.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed here
Saturday a joint declaration which aims to make the region free
from drug production, abuse and trafficking by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The document, the Joint Declaration for a Drug-Free ASEAN, is
part of ASEAN's programs for closer coordination in building
Southeast Asia into a region free from the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken by ASEAN in the realization that the growing
drug menace could seriously endanger development programs of ASEAN
member countries, especially in relation to the region's youth and
the preservation of the moral fabric of the family as the basic
unit of society.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN member countries have expressed fears that the
illicit drug trade, which is inextricably linked to other

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The city of Chongqing in
southwest China will strengthen its crackdown on smuggling, a
municipal government official said today.
</P>
<P>
As the biggest city in southwest China, Chongqing is a traffic
hub of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China's
longest. Smuggling has become rampant in the region in recent
years, with illicit trafficking in cultural relics, petroleum,
automobiles, and electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The city's Customs office made arrests in dozens of smuggling
cases, each involving more than 300,000 yuan (about 36,000 U.S.
dollars) worth of goods, and seized more than 160 cultural relics
last year.
</P>
<P>
The city government has called on various departments to crack
a number of major smuggling cases and deal severely with the
smugglers.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to India Zhou
Gang said Saturday that it is China's consistent policy to develop
neighborly and friendly relations and mutually beneficial
cooperation with the South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Sino-Indian Relations" organized by
the Indian International Center here, Zhou Gang said that the
South Asian countries are close neighbors of China and traditional
friendship has long existed between the Chinese people and the
people of these countries.
</P>
<P>
"China not only wants to develop with them long-term and stable
relations of neighborliness and friendship towards the 21st
century, but also hopes that they will treat one another on an
equal footing, live in harmony, develop friendly cooperation, seek
common ground while reserving differences, promote mutual
understanding and mutual accommodation and settle their
differences and disputes through peaceful means," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting friendly relations between China and the South Asian
countries is conducive to peace, stability and development in
South Asia, and conforms to fundamental interests of the Chinese
people and the people of these countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Sino-Indian relations, he first of all recalled
friendly exchanges and traditional friendship between the two
countries in the past over 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
He said from 1988 to 1996 there had been constant top level
exchanges of visits by the leaders of the two countries. The state
visit to India by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in November 1996
in particular is an important historical event in the two
countries' bilateral relations and has pushed them onto a new
phase of development at the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
"During the visit the leaders of the two countries agreed to
establish the constructive and cooperative partnership towards the
21st century on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that since April and May this year the
Sino-Indian relations have witnessed abnormal developments and
"this is something we are unwilling to see."
</P>
<P>
"The so-called China's threat to India's security is baseless.
Fictitious charges against China have greatly hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people and harmed the Sino-Indian relations," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"China does not pose any threat to India. The Chinese side
could not but refute some wanton attack and accusation against
China by certain personages in India in order to safeguard the
friendly relations between our two countries and bring the
Sino-Indian relations back onto the track of healthy development
at an early date," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What China hopes from India is neighborliness, friendship and
cooperation. What China wishes India is stability, progress and
development," he further said.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Vows to Give Freedom to People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
vowed here Saturday to give freedom to the people, saying freedom
was a "divine right of human beings."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the 17th meeting of
heads of education departments from across the country, Khatami
stressed the existing obstacles to the achievement of freedom
and administration of justice should be removed.
</P>
<P>
A religion which respects man must first respect man's freedom,
the official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the religion stands against freedom in that society, then
freedom will be suppressed, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a veiled attack against the hard-liners in the country,
Khatami denounced them for suppressing freedom and "trying to pit
the religion against freedom by manipulating people's feelings."
</P>
<P>
A group of senior clerics from the Mom seminary on
Wednesday called on Khatami to curb the budding freedom in the
country, in the press in particular. They highlighted the
importance of strengthening spiritual values in the society.
</P>
<P>
Some prominent conservative figures recently also accused the
Khatami's moderate government of pursuing western-style freedom
under the title of political reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami called on the people not to allow those
hard-liners to dictate to the society, "because it is like
insulting the personality of human beings."
</P>
<P>
In an Islamic system of government, the framework of which
has been determined by law, no one has the right to impose
his views on the society as an absolute right, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that freedom and law were
indispensable, saying that without law, the society would be in a
state of chaos.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni FM in Saudi Arabia for Talks on Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul
Qader Ba-Jammal Saturday arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for
talks with Saudi officials on last week's clashes on an island,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that Ba-Jammal was expected to meet Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Foreign Minister Prince
Saud Al-Faisal.
</P>
<P>
They would try to reach a compromise calling for preventing
further bloodshed between the two countries through the
demarcation of their disputed borders, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal was initially scheduled to visit the kingdom last
Tuesday or Wednesday, but postponed due to domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both Yemen and Saudi Arabia have confirmed that armed clashes
took place last Sunday on the Duwaima Island, over which both
sides have claimed sovereignty. Three Yemeni soldiers were killed
and an officer captured in the clashes with Saudi troops.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh accused Saudi Arabia last
Monday of occupying the island. Meanwhile, Saudi Interior Minister
Prince Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz blamed the Yemeni troops for initiating
the conflict by firing at the Saudi positions on the island.
</P>
<P>
But Nayef said on Wednesday that since both countries agreed
to hold talks on the dispute, tensions on the island had been
defused and the situation there remained calm.
</P>
<P>
The recent clashes were the most serious since 1995 when Saudi
Arabia and Yemen signed a memorandum of understanding, calling for
the establishment of joint committees to demarcate the borders.

<HEADLINE> Famine Looms Large in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- There is a growing fear that a
large scale famine may strike again in southern Somalia and the
three regions of Bay, Bakol and Gedo in particular.
</P>
<P>
Despite the humanitarian effort by the World Food Program, the
regions of Bay and Bakol are suffering severe food shortage
following the lack of enough rains in the Gu' season this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Ahmed Sheikh Hamud, the district commissioner of
Bardale Town, 55 km west of Baidoa, the evidence of serious
famine can be seen in the streets where the children with swollen
face and inflated abdomen for marasmus are barely leaning against
the walls of their huts rather than playing in happiness.
</P>
<P>
The region, the highest sorghum producing area in the country,
is now having no single farm following the floods of late last
year which washed away the underground food reservoirs and
displaced farmers.
</P>
<P>
Hamud said the famine is also affecting the livestock where
the camels, the most resistant animal, and goats are dying at the
rate of two or three per day for each family.
</P>
<P>
Aden Ibrahim Finni, the district commissioner of Wajid, 90 km
north of Baidoa, said that apart
from the famine which has so far claimed the lives of more than
15, the people are also dying of malaria.
</P>
<P>
" Twelve people have died in the past week of the disease alone
and there is no medicine," said Finni.
</P>
<P>
In the border region of Gedo where a large reconciliatory
meeting is still going on between the Somali National Front (SNF)
faction and the Islamic fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad
Al-Islam, the famine is still tightening its grip on the
civilians already badly affected by the civil strive.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mohamed Mukhtar, the Deputy Chairman of SNF, said three
children have died of famine in Bur Dhubo village early in the
week.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar has made an appeal to the U.N. and international aid
agencies to help the people in the region and encourage the
on-going peace meeting which is to be concluded later in the
month or early next month.
</P>
<P>
The famine in these regions is also felt in Mogadishu as
dozens of families are reaching the capital per day in search of
better living and food from the few refugee camps still open for
the internally displaced people.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of women and children have joined the already
innumerable street beggars in the capital since the beginning of
the month, while poorly dressed middle aged men are begging
inside the mosques for help.

state assets administration of Zhuhai, an special economic zone
and a coastal open city bordering Macao in south China's Guangdong
Province, has been arrested by the city's procuratorial office and
charged with receiving bribes.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Li was charged with having taken bribes worth more
than 200,000 yuan (24,000 U.S dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li was also charged with misappropriating a large amount of
public funds. More than 70 million yuan (8.4 million US dollars)
in public funds were diverted by Li to privately-owned
corporations from 1992 to 1997, during which time he allegedly
took bribes totaling some 170,000 yuan (20,500 US dollars) and
more than 50,000 Hong Kong dollars (6,460 U.S. dollars). Most of
these public funds have not yet been recovered.

<HEADLINE> Future of Sheraton Kampala Hotel Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian buyer of Sheraton
Kampala Hotel has not yet paid the balance of 17 million U.S.
Dollars for the price, making the future of the Number one hotel
here uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the payment expires next Monday, the New
Vision daily reported Saturaday,
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian-based Midroc bought the hotel for 19 million
dollars and it made a cash bond deposit of two million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what is happening to them. I also tried
to call Mr. Alfred Ireland in Addis but I couldn't find him,"
Leonard Muganwa, the Executive Director of Uganda's Enterprise
Development Project, was quoted as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Though they still have up to Monday to meet the deadline, it
is also still tricky because cash transfers cannot be made on a
Sunday," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what would happen if the buyer could not pay
the balance on time, Muganwa said he wouldn't wish that to happen
and it would mean the agreement has collapsed. But he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Midroc, owned by a Saudi Abrabian, millionaire Muhammad
Al-Amoudi, had requested for extension of the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Accused of Murdering 30 Patients in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A 28-year-old nurse has been accused
of murdering some 30 elderly patients in a hospital in Mantes-la-
Jolie, a small city in the south of Paris, by practicing
euthanasia on them over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Christine Malevre, who had admitted the murders, attempted to
commit suicide after she was put under judicial inquiry in early
May, the authorities of Francois Quesnay hospital said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Holder of a state diploma on nursery and having received
excellent evaluations for her work, Malevre was suspected to have
killed elderly patients suffering from mental and lung disorders,
but "their state of health did not leave any doubt about the fatal
end of their diseases," said the hospital.
</P>
<P>
As a nation with a strong Catholic tradition, France has not
legalized euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
The hospital did not notice the abnormal deaths until a patient
died under suspicious circumstances on May 6.

<P>
They "strongly endorsed" the decision made by the ASEAN finance

In the communique, the ministers also expressed welcome to the
signing of the Second Protocol to the Treaty of Amity and
Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC).

<HEADLINE> Cambodian NEC Chairman Confident About Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National Election
Committee (NEC) chairman Chheng Phon on Saturday dismissed jitters
about the upcoming election, expressing belief the election would
produce a legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no doubt that the election will pave the way
for the establishment of a government that will be able to lead
the Cambodian people toward peace and development," Chheng Phon
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 5.4 million Cambodians will go to the polls on
Sunday to elect a National Assembly, a major step toward the
setting up of a government.
</P>
<P>
Three major parties, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
led by co-premier Hun Sen, the FUNCINPEC of deposed co-premier
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and the Sam Rainsy Party named after the
former finance minister, are contending for seats of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian people widely expect the election will end
decades of war that has wrecked havoc on the impoverished country.
</P>
<P>
Chheng Phon said the NEC, an independent organization
responsible for preparing the election, had been doing its best to
ensure the election be free, fair and credible.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports about irregularities, behind-the-scene
intimidation and incidents of violence prior to the election.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, also a prominent opposition leader, told a press
conference on Saturday that the 24,000 observers dispatched by his
party were subject to intimidation.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been "disguised crimes" intended to
intimidate supporters of his party and FUNCINPEC, a reference to
remarks by the CPP which refuted any linkage of previous crimes
with the election.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 election-related killings had reportedly taken
place.
</P>
<P>
Chheng Phon said the NEC has worked out 11-point regulations to
prevent intimidation and violence. These regulations, he said,
include the training of election workers and observers, and
punishment for those who violate the rules.
</P>
<P>
He said about 700 international and 33,000 local observers have
fanned out across the country to guarantee the transparency and
legitimacy of the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the three-phase election had successfully completed the
first two stages -- voter registration and campaigning.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the last phase of casting and counting votes will
also be successful," Chheng Phon said.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no doubt that the election will show the will
and correct choice of the Cambodian people," he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Asks Japan for Measures to Strengthen Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations
(ASEAN) Saturday urged Japan to implement economic measures and
put its
own economy in order to help ASEAN countries get out of the
year-old
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the two-day 31st
ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting here Saturday afternoon, foreign ministers
from the
nine ASEAN members "called on Japan to expedite the implementation
of its
economic measures in support of the economic recovery of ASEAN
countries."
</P>
<P>
They also asked Japan to put its economy on the right track,
saying,
"Japan's determination to strengthen its financial system and to
put its
economy back on the path of self-sustained and domestic demand-led
growth
is important to the recovery of the Asian economies."
</P>
<P>
Japan is ASEAN's biggest creditor country. The recent turmoil
in the
Japanese financial system, including a fast-declining Japanese
yen, and
its economy as a whole has seriously affected the recovery of
ASEAN
economies, which have been plagued by problems such as currency
devaluation, bank liquidity problems, flight of capital, bank and
factory
closedowns, high inflation and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also asked the G-7 industrialized countries --
Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- "to
lead
international efforts and coordinate policy responses in resolving
the
financial crisis," which they said has become "a global concern."
</P>
<P>
On regional and international assistance programs, the ASEAN
ministers
said international and regional financial institutions as well as
friendly donor countries "need to consider the overall impact of
structural adjustment measures, which are being implemented by the

affected countries, on the underprivileged and vulnerable sectors
of
their societies."
</P>
<P>
Some affected ASEAN countries have obtained loans and
assistance from
the International Monetary Fund and other organizations, some of
which
imposed conditions including drastic structural adjustments such
as cuts
in welfare benefits for the poor people and privatization.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers in their communique also urged these donor
countries and financial institutions to implement the agreed
commitments
to enable the affected countries to continue their contributions
in
maintaining the stability of the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The nine member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Cambodia signed
here Saturday the Second Protocol to the Treaty of Amity and
Cooperation in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The protocol amends Article 18 of the treaty to confer the
right of consent for accession by non-Southeast Asian states to
the treaty only to Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The amendment allows non-Southeast Asian countries to accede to
the treaty which will provide them the legal framework for the
conduct of cooperative relations with states in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is a major landmark in the pursuit of ASEAN's
objective of making Southeast Asia a zone of peace, freedom and
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was approved at the first ASEAN Summit held in Bali,
Indonesia, in February 1976, by the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the treaty was to "promote perpetual peace,
everlasting amity and cooperation among their peoples which would
contribute to their strength, solidarity and closer relationship."
</P>
<P>
Papua New Guinea, through the first protocol approved in Manila
in December 1987, became the first and, thus far, the only
non-ASEAN state to accede to the treaty.

<P>
The Friends of Cambodia, a private group including Japan, the
United States, Russia, the European Union and some other donors,

intensification of consultations with Cambodia to facilitate its
admission into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in their respective statements at the 31st AMM, they
voiced their support to have Cambodia as a new ASEAN member. Some
countries hope that Cambodia can join ASEAN at the end of this
year or next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said
earlier at a press conference that Cambodia's admission to ASEAN
will depend on the outcome of the general elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN foreign ministers ended their
meeting here Saturday after discussions on a wide range of issues
including the financial crisis in the region, political and
economic cooperation among member countries, Cambodia and
transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement, Philippine Secretary of Foreign
Affairs Domingo Siazon, whose country is chairman of this year's
ASEAN meetings, said, "Over two days, we discussed ASEAN's
accomplishments in the past year, the challenges ahead and how
ASEAN, as a community and an organization, will meet the
uncertainties of the future."
</P>
<P>
"It was a meeting characterized by an atmosphere of
congeniality, frankness and enduring solidarity among the member
countries, which augurs well for stronger and more mature
relationships in the years to come," Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the regional currency turmoil, which has
been plaguing the region for over a year, "put our resolve to its
deepest test."
</P>
<P>
"As a group, we moved forward with regional efforts to resolve
the crisis -- through initiatives ranging from the use of regional
currencies for intra-ASEAN trade to the creation of an ASEAN
economic monitoring mechanism," he pointed out. "Instead of bowing
to the pressures, ASEAN sought to enhance its solidarity and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that at the meeting, the countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam -- expressed to the world ASEAN's continuing
commitment to friendship and cooperation with other countries, as
embodied in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"By adopting the Second Protocol to the treaty, we have invited
non-ASEAN states to accede to the treaty and with us to work for
and share in the peace and friendship in Southeast Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers signed the protocol during their two-day
31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) here.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province has
added 3.2 billion yuan (385 million US dollars) to its original
spending plan of 52.5 billion yuan for infrastructure construction
this year.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities say they hope that the total investment
alone will help increase economic growth 7 percent and help the
province reach its goal of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 18.4 billion yuan will come from the Central Government
and the remaining 37.3 billion yuan from the local government and
other sources. Funds from non-government organizations are
expected to increase to 5 billion yuan, pushing total
infrastructure spending to 60 billion yuan in the province.
</P>
<P>
The increased spending will make infrastructure the province's
biggest area for new jobs, local planning officials say.
</P>
<P>
Highway construction funds will increase to 6.7 billion yuan
this year, creating 150,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
As more infrastructure projects are completed, 830,000 kw of
power generating capacity will be added in 1998, and people in 10
prefectures and cities will have access to piped natural gas this
year, officials say.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Accused of Linkage With Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military on Saturday
accused the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) of
"conspiracy" with kidnap-for-ransom groups operating in Central
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a local radio station, Major General Rolando
Bautista, chief of the Army's 6th Infantry Division, chided the
MILF for questionably disclosing kidnap victims' transfer from one
group to another.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what the MILF (is trying to imply)...Why
not convince these people (kidnappers) to release their captives
if they know them," Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
Bautista was reacting to an earlier statement made by Al Haj
Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, that a kidnapped
city trader was recently transferred by his captors to another
group of kidnap gang.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has earlier vowed to also neutralize kidnap-for-ransom
groups in Central Mindanao. The military, however, alleged that
the Moro organization is just using updates on kidnapping
activities here for one of its "propagandas."
</P>
<P>
Bautista vowed to launch a massive military operation against
kidnap syndicates operating in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Paid 60 Cows for Marriage to Machel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela's clan held secret negotiations with the Machel
clan in Mozambique before Mandela's marriage to Graca Machel.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed that Mandela would pay 60 prime cattle for
Graca's hand in marriage, Saturday Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which lasted two months, were full of symbolic and
traditional customs required during negotiations for such an
auspicious union, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary mission began in April when a "task force"
of royal members from Mandela's Tembu clan was sent to
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
True to tradition, Mandela's uncles went to the future bride's
family to negotiate the number of cattle wanted for the bride.
</P>
<P>
The whole procedure took about two months and several trips.
</P>
<P>
It could have taken longer if negotiations were not so smooth,
for instance if the family had not wanted their child to marry
into that particular family. It went faster than usual because
all parties were enthusiastic about the match, said the paper,
quoting King Buyelekhaya Zwelibanzi and senior members of the
Tembu royal court.
</P>
<P>
The first step in the secretive negotiations was when Graca
officially informed her family about the impending visitors but
did not reveal who they were and where they were coming from.
</P>
<P>
The Machel family then set a date for the mysterious visitors'
arrival, April, in this case.
</P>
<P>
The initial contact, called ukucelwa, took place at night when
Mandela's clan delegates formally asked for Graca's hand in
marriage. The Tembu clan visitors were allowed into the house and
asked to identify themselves and justify why they wanted to
create kinship through Graca.
</P>
<P>
They were well taken care of and the visit did not last more
than five hours. But before they left, both parties agreed on the
next date to negotiate the number of cows to be paid for lobola,
or bridal price.
</P>
<P>
When the delegation came back, both parties told each other
what they expected from one another. According to custom,
Mandela and Graca were not involved in the second discussion, nor
was their input sought.
</P>
<P>
At some point during these negotiations, the parties agreed
that Mandela would pay 60 prime cattle for Graca's hand in
marriage.
</P>
<P>
Then, at the meeting, a date was set for the transfer of the
cows, and lastly the date for the wedding was set.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought the lobola was justified, King
Zwelibanzi replied: "The number of cows involved in lobola is
nobody's business. Even if Rolihlahla (Mandela) had paid a
million cows for Graca, she is worth every bristle of hair and
hoof !"
</P>
<P>
When asked if Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had strategically
attended a funeral in the Eastern Cape at the time of the
wedding, the king replied: "This is another typical rumor, that
we have fallen out with her. She is a child of this family, we
never divorced her as a clan. Only tow people divorced. We still
love her."
</P>
<P>
Themba Sangoni, the presidential aide in the Eastern Cape,
would not confirm how the cows were exchanged. He also refused
to disclose how often the emissaries traveled to Maputo to close
the lobola deal with the Machels.
</P>
<P>
"The president is not a boy, and it is a matter between him
and those he chooses to tell," he said.
</P>
<P>
King Zwelibanzi this week also scotched rumors that a rift had
developed between Mandela and his clan members over the marriage.
He described the controversy as a fabrication by a loose-footed,
bitter pretender to the throne."
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Chief Ndaba Zwelodumo Mtirara claimed the Tembu
clan was up in arms over Mandela's planned wedding to Graca.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, he said Mandela had acted in a
disrespectful manner, unbecoming an honored member of the royal
family. He went on further to say Mandela would face serious
consequences, which would be decided upon by the royal house,
King Zwelibanzi and senior members of the royal court.
</P>
<P>
Zwelibanzi distanced himself and the royal house from the
"heretical utterances of Chief Ndaba Zwelodumo."
</P>
<P>
The king said: "There is nothing wrong for Rolihlahla to
publicly court a woman he loves and have a relationship with her
outside of marriage, considering his age, royal status and
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
"His marrying her is actually a great sign of respect and
confirms his greatness -- he has given the relationship dignity."

<HEADLINE> Talks With Israelis Not on Troop Withdrawal: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior advisor to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has said the continued Israeli-Palestinian
talks this week will not discuss the Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank, Egypt's Voice of Arabs radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, Arafat's advisor on Israeli affairs, said that
during their meetings next week, Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani would not touch
on the overdue troop pullout.
</P>
<P>
They would discuss the problems facing the Palestinians in
Jerusalem, Tibi said, without elaborating on what are the problems.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Palestinians would not resume talks with
the Israelis on the troop withdrawal until Israel accepts the
proposal made by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Abbas and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held talks
last Sunday, but ended in failure. This was the first high-level
talks between the two sides in months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly called on Israel to withdraw from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel has
rejected it citing that the proposed withdrawal endangers its
security interests.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has full or partial control
over 27 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tibi urged the U.S. administration to go public with its
initiative in an effort to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. does not take such a step, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will go on with slowly killing the peace
march," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Curb Brutal Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's businessmen and workers
have urged the government to quickly move in and curb the recent
upsurge of brutal killings and warned that foreign investors will
start fleeing the country if nothing is done.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Federation of Employers (ZFE) and the Zambia
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) issued the warning in Lusaka
Friday during a consultative labor council, Times of Zambia
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, said ZFE President Francis Simenda,
foreign investors have been attacked and killed in brutal
circumstances, and if the situation continues, investors will flee
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to find resources to beef up the
police to make them more effective.
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to continue losing lives. If it means
diverting resources to the police to curb the situation, let us
do so," Simenda said.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU President Fackson Shamenda attributed the rising crime
wave to the de-motivated police service and demanded that the
government improve their salaries and conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Newstead Zimba said the government is equally
concerned with the development and is appealing to people with
information that could help to curb crimes to report to the
police.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that security in the country is now worrying. I am
grateful that both ZCTU and ZFE have expressed concern over the
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, gunmen have shot dead a number of businessmen with
the latest being a managing director Vincent Chalwe of a bureau
de change who was killed last Tuesday morning in a dramatic
robbery.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Island Province Develops Its Marine Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Policy-makers on China's southern
island province of Hainan are looking at the maritime industry as
a source of help for stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
Average growth in the maritime industry for the past decade was
3 times GDP growth, and in 1997, the sector had 11.6 billion yuan
(1.397 billion US dollars) in output, a quarter of the provincial
GDP.
</P>
<P>
Du Qinglin, Hainan's Party Secretary, says the local authorities
will make the most of the rapid, efficient, and forceful growth in
the maritime industry to help economic growth and build Hainan
into a powerful marine economy.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is China's smallest province, with 34,000 square
kilometers of land, but it has more than 2 million sq km of ocean,
with over 10,000 species of marine life, including some 1,000
types of fishes and 200 kinds of algae.
</P>
<P>
It has 1,800 kilometers of coastline, with 18 ports and another
60 potential port locations. It also has 200,000 ha of shallows
that could be used for aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to develop its petroleum resources and
refining and related industries. South China Sea reserves are
estimated at 70 billion tons of petroleum and gas.
</P>
<P>
Hainan wants to bring its marine industrial output up to 15
billion yuan in the next 2 years.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has received an additional
14-million-U.S. Dollar grant from the United States to boost
on-going programs for health, agriculture and governance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed Friday in Lusaka by Finance Deputy
Minister Godfrey Simasiku and U.S. Charge d'Affaires Stevenson
Mcllvaine, Times of Zambia reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The grant is part of a total of 41 million Dollars which the
U.S. government has so far contributed this year in terms of
helping the country realize its immense development potential.
</P>
<P>
Mcllvaine said the U.S. government's assistance to meet
Zambia's food demands is a response to the short-fall in maize,
the country's staple food, this year.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the crippling debt crisis, this is another
area where Zambia needs to be assisted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia suffered a serious shortage of maize last agriculture
season due to unfavorable climate. It had to spend much of its
needed foreign exchange currency to import food to avoid
starvation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Deputy Speaker Forced to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Deputy Speaker of
Parliament, Betty Okwir, has finally bowed to mounting pressure
from the top leadership of National Resistance Movement and
resigned her job only three days before the speaker is to
be elected.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the office of the clerk to parliament
confirmed the resignation over the weekend, the Monitor daily
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the deputy speaker was offered a ministerial
post in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Previously, she vowed to remain on the post in spite of
pressure piled on her to quit.
</P>
<P>
"No. I am not resigning and nobody has talked to me about
resigning. Why? Why should I resign?" she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There were allegations that former speaker James Wapakhabulo,
who was elected the Movement's National Political Commissar last
week, was chosen to persuade Okwir to quit.
</P>
<P>
If she refused to do so, they could turn the screws on and
possibly force her out via a vote of no confidence, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Okwir's resignation was taken as preparing ground for Edward
Sekandi's entrance into the race as deputy speaker creating
favorable conditions for Minister Francis Ayume's candidature for
the Speakership.
</P>
<P>
Sekandi is widely considered a big rival for Ayume who was
chosen by the Movement leadership caucus as candidate for the top
post in the House.
</P>
<P>
"If Okwir stays in office it wil be difficult for Ayume to
take over as Speaker, we can't have two northerners steering
Parliament," one member of parliament said.
</P>
<P>
The report said President Yoweri Museveni and his confidants
are also wary that the rebellious mood sweeping the House over
the executive's push for Ayume, could make it easy for someone to
come from the floor and defeat him if Okwir is still deputy
speaker.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Sarah Nabagesera Sebaggala, wife
of detained Kampala city mayor, arrived at Entebbe International
Airport Friday evening from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nabagesera, whose Sabena flight touched down at 8:20 p.m.
(1720 GMT), was immediately whisked away upon arrival, leaving
many of her friends and relatives who came to meet her
disappointed, the New Vision paper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She did not go through the VIP lounge as expected, but chose
the departure lounge to avoid inquisitive journalists.
</P>
<P>
Before getting on a waiting van, Nabagesera, the Deputy
Speaker of Kampala District Council, said she had a statement
from her husband Nasser Sebaggala and revealed she would give a
press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I will convene a press conference on Monday and present to
you the statement from the Mayor. But we are very grateful to
the press support," she was quoted as saying in Luganda.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's supporters were promised that the mayor would
overcome any problem and return home to perform his important
duties.
</P>
<P>
Nabagesera had been accompanying her husband in the United
States since the mayor was arrested in New York on June 13 for
allegedly making false customs declaration and depositing altered
checks in a U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said if the mayor was convicted, he would
probably get a prison term of more than 30 years and a fine of
over one million U.S. Dollars.

<P>
She urged all political parties and non-governmental
organizations in the country to take part in the rescue, relief
and rehabilitation work for the flood victims, as it was not
possible for the government alone to ensure all possible
assistance to rehabilitate the huge number of flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five of the country's 64 districts were attacked by
flooding affecting nearly 10 million people, officials at the
meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Press reports, however, put the number of flood victims at over
10 million in 54 districts, where 61 people had died from flood,
standing crops on 381,000 acres of land had been ravaged, 29,000
homes wrecked and 194,000 houses partially damaged by monsoon
floods since the monsoon season began in the country in early
July.
</P>
<P>
As diseases usually claim more lives in the post-flood
situation, steps should be taken to ensure adequate medicines,
water purification tablets, and other essentials for the
flood-affected people, according to the prime minister, who also
directed the officials to maintain adequate food stock and ensure
supply of seedlings for farmers.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 people were attacked by diarrhea, with only four
deaths reported, due to precautionary measures, according to the
officials. Some 2,000 medical teams had been formed and were being
sent to the flood-affected areas, they said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that there was an adequate stock of food grains
to face any possible disaster and steps were being taken to make
more stocks as further precautionary measures. The government
machinery in the flood- affected areas were working "vigorously"
to ensure food and shelter to the flood victims, and sufficient
relief and medicine were being supplied in the affected areas,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The government had reportedly sanctioned more than 4 million
(about 85,000 U.S. dollars) and 2,481 tons of rice or wheat
together with other relief materials for the flood-stricken
population.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recurrent floods in the country, the prime
minister laid emphasis on timely dredging of rivers. The river
embankments could be constructed by the dredged soil, which would
help protect land and increase the depth of the rivers, she said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lebanese Civilians Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese civilians were
killed Friday night by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon, the
Orient radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place at the al Muna village in the country's
southern city of Nabatieh.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
But the radio quoted Lebanese security sources as saying
that when the bomb blew up, an Israeli pilotless warplane
was buzzing overhead.
</P>
<P>
Israel has created the 1,200-square-kilometer "South Lebanon
Security Zone" since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
fighting a guerrilla war to oust the 2,000-strong Israeli
occupation forces from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Daily Solicits Assistance for Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The pro-moderate daily Iran
Saturday published a bank account of convicted Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi for public donations to help him pay the
huge fine imposed by the court.
</P>
<P>
A notice printed in the front page of the English-language
newspaper said those who intended to help Karbaschi pay the fine
can send their donation to the account No. 89700 at the Bank Melli.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the account was published after a large number
of people expressed readiness to help Karbaschi, who was believed
to be a victim of the fierce political struggle between the
conservatives and moderates in the country.
</P>
<P>
Finding Karbaschi guilty of embezzlement and misappropriation
of public funds, an Iranian court Thursday sentenced him to five
years in prison and fined him 1 billion Iran rials (180,000 U.S.
dollars at the market price).
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi refused to comment on the verdict, but his lawyers
said that he would appeal the verdict. Under the law, he will
remain free until he appealed the court verdict.
</P>
<P>
There are have been mixed reactions among the society to the
verdict on Karbaschi. While some said the punishment was unjust or
unexpectedly harsh, the hard-liners claimed that it was too
lenient and they demanded the execution of the former mayor.
</P>
<P>
The case of Karbaschi, a moderate technocrat and close ally of
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, intensified the factional
struggle between the moderates and the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The moderates accuse the conservatives of politicizing the case
in an aim to weaken the government of Khatami, who enjoyed strong
support from Karbaschi and his followers since the presidential
elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives, who control the judiciary, have
vowed to punish any one violating laws and attacked the moderates
for imposing strong political pressure on the judiciary over the
case.

<HEADLINE> National Language Policy Called for in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) --A senior Zimbabwean official has
called for the launching of a comprehensive national language
policy to maintain the country's mother language, culture and
values.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's present and future generations are in danger of
losing their mother language, culture and values unless a
comprehensive national language policy is adopted, said Minister
of Education, Sport and Culture, Gabriel Machinga.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks Friday after he was presented
with the report on the formulation of a national language policy
by the national language policy advisory panel, the Daily Herald
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's vernacular languages were at the risk of
dying out as the post-independence generation prefers to speak
English with the blessings of their parents.
</P>
<P>
As a result, primary school pupils have been progressively
performing badly in the main Shona and Ndebele vernacular
languages.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot dissociate ourselves from our mother tongue. Those
children denied a chance to learn vernacular languages will lose
their culture," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Machinga said while the world was becoming a global village,
there was need to distinguish our languages by uplifting them. By
the same token "we should not be globalized so much so that we
lose our national languages."
</P>
<P>
The national language advisory panel has recommended that two
different bodies be formed to implement, monitor and review the
national language policy provisions.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Renews Security Guarantee for Turkish Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
vowed Saturday Turkey will take necessary measures to protect the
security of Turkish Cypriots living in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport
before his departure for an one-day visit to northern Cyprus at the
invitation of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
This was Demirel's first visit to northern Cyprus since he
became president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Demirel criticized the "wrong messages" sent to Greek Cypriots
by the European Union (EU), warning it could lead to "the
destruction of the framework of the settlement and parameter in
the process of the United Nations conference."
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Turkish Cypriots were angered by the EU's
decision to start membership negotiations with the Greek
Cypriot-led Cypriot government in April.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has repeated that the Cypriot government has no right
to represent the Turkish Cypriots. He quited the peace talks with
the Greek Cypriots in August last year to protest against the EU's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over northern Cyprus in response to an abortive
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in the north, which was recognized
only by Turkey, the staunch allay of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high since early last year when
Cyprus ordered a Russian anti-aircraft missile system in a bid to
boost its air defense. Turkey has threatened to strike the
missiles if they are deployed as scheduled late this year.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that he believed "that two Turkish States in the
Mediterranean Sea will intensify strong solidarity and
cooperation during the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Besides the security guarantees, Turkey also attaches great
importance to the development of the economy of northern Cyprus,
added Demirel.

<HEADLINE> Study: Postsurgical Radiation May Reduce Survival Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A study released Saturday said
that postoperative radiotherapy appears to reduce survival rates
among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the July 25th issue of The Lancet and
conducted by a group of researchers led by Dr Lesley A Stewart,
said that the research team analyzed updated data from nine
studies that assessed the effects of the therapy among more than
2,100 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Of 1,072 patients who had surgery alone, 411 were still living,
the team found. By comparison, only 349 of 1,056 patients who had
postoperative radiation were still alive. Patients who had
postsurgical radiation ran a 21 percent higher risk of dying than
those who had surgery alone, the study added.
</P>
<P>
"The results therefore indicate that postoperative radiotherapy
should not be routinely used to treat these patients," writes
Stewart, the author of the study.
</P>
<P>
The researchers noted that information on causes of death among
the patients in the nine studies was limited. But they suggested
the toxic effects as one of main causes of the additional deaths.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Alina Kabayeva of Russia swept
three out of four gold medals in the rhythmic gymnastics
competition, while the United States beat Australia 93-85 overtime
in the men's basketball final here on Friday at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
Kabayeva, who took the all-around title yesterday, conquered
the referees with tremendous talent in the individual events,
finishing first in the ribbon, the clubs and hoop. Olympic bronze
medalist Yelena Vitrichenko of Ukriane prevented her from a clean
sweep of the golds by winning the rope with a slight margin over
the delicate Russian.
</P>
<P>
The day's another gold medal was won by China's Yu Zhuocheng in
the men's one-meter springboard.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. basketball team, including no NBA professionals, was e
xtended fully into overtime after the regulation ended 79-all. The
American college players fended off the never-say-die Aussies to
win the tough showdown.
</P>
<P>
Shane Heal was the biggest gun for Australia, scoring game-high
38 points. Andrew Gaze added 25 and Chris Anstey had nine. The
rest of the line-up only contributed a total of 13 points.
</P>
<P>
Andre Miller scored 15 of his 18 points in the second half for
the U.S. team, while Elton Brand and Wally Szczerbiak each hit 15
points.
</P>
<P>
The score was seasawed all the way till the last two minutes.
The first half ended 40-40, and Miller forced the game into the
overtime with a steal-and-driving layup with 55 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
The Americans used their speed and better board control to ruin
the Aussies, who lost their rhythm and composure in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 85-89 with one minute to go, the Americans scored four
straight points to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
In the game to determine the third place, Lithuania, bronze
medalists in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, beat defending champions
Puerto Rico 119-75.
</P>
<P>
China's Yu Zhuocheng and Zhou Yilin met no challenge throughout
to sweep the top two medals of the men's one-meter springboard
diving this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Yu, world 3-meter springboard champion this year, overtook Zhou
in his final dive, winning the gold with a total of 426.24 points.
Zhuo, world silver medalist for the event this year, led the first
five round after registering a day's highest score 81.60 on his
second outing. He faded to second position, but still had 26
points to spare than the third placed Mark Ruiz of the United
States, who collected 395.52.
</P>
<P>
The competition was a Chinese affair from the first round,
which saw Zhou ranked first with 63.96 ahead of Yu's 63.18. Ruiz
was listed third trailig about 1.5 points.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, 24, widened the leading margin after second action, but
Yu narrowed the gap a bit in the third. After the fourth round,
Zhou placed first with 277.86, followed closely by Yu, 277.38.
Ruiz dropped a distance third with 256.02.
</P>
<P>
With the two Chinese fighting for the gold, Ruiz had to hold
off a strong surge from Andreas Wels of Germany in the bronze
battle. The German performed excellently in his final two dives,
gaining 72.00 and 73.47, but his efforts came still short, losing
only 2.18 points.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could win through if I dive good in my last round.
That was the most difficult action and could bring me high point,"
said Yu, who gained his fame in 1993 when he won World Cup 3-meter
springboard title.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best here to win the 3-meter title," added Yu,
who was selected as the Best Diver of the Year in 1994 by the U.S.
Swimming magzine.
</P>
<P>
Li Dazheng, leader of the Chinese diving team, told Xinhua that
the Chinese divers have strength to take five or six gold medals
here. "But we will meet strong challenge in the men's 3-meter
springboard and the platform."
</P>
<P>
In the men's beach volleyball competition, Brazil's tandem Para
Ferreira and Guilherme Marques overspiked Canada's John Child and
Mark Heese 15-11, and the U.S. team Adam Johnson and Karch Kiraly
nipped Ricci Luyties and Sinjin Smith, also Americans, 16-14 in
group A.
</P>

defending champions Jan Kvahleim and Bjorn Maaseide of Norway
16-14, while Australia's pair Lee Zahner and Julien Prosser
overpowered Esteban Martinez and Martin Conde of Argentina 15-7.

<HEADLINE> Floods Hit Three Provinces in Central, East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Floods in Hunan, Jiangxi and Hubei
provinces have killed 145 people and forced the emergency
relocation of 900,000 residents since last Friday, according to a
report issued yesterday by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Reports issued by the Ministry also indicate there have been
1,145 deaths caused by flooding since the beginning of this year,
"China Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
The majority of deaths resulted from drownings, houses
collapsing, lightning, mud flows and landslides caused by mountain
torrents.
</P>
<P>
Floods in the three provinces have destroyed 250,000 houses and
damaged another 780,000, affecting 1.1 million residents in 71
counties.
</P>
<P>
The floods also affected one million hectares of cultivated
land, leaving 180,000 hectares of crops fruitless. Direct losses
are estimated to be at least 9.2 billion yuan(1.1 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As of July 15, flooding that started in June had affected more
than 140 million people, had destroyed 2.9 million houses and had
ruined 9 million hectares of crops.
</P>
<P>
To date, direct economic losses resulting from floods were
estimated at more than 94.8 billion yuan(11.4 billion US dollars),

<HEADLINE> American Investors Choose Internet Portals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Of the 58 million American
Internet users, 35 million are conducting some form of financial
services over the Web, according to a study by market research
firm Cyber Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The study, released Thursday, shows that instead of banks or
brokerage houses, Internet portals such as American Online, Yahoo
and Quicken have become the key to financial services. American
consumers are primarily using these portals to access financial
services on the Internet, placing portal brand recognition above
traditional financial brand names online.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 18.1 million American users who manage their
investments online, more than 2 million "digital investors"
reported that the most frequently used site for managing their
finances is American Online's Personal Finance area, which is
accessed five times more often than the nearest established
brokerage branded Web site.
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to the study, financial services providers
cannot go online and rest on the laurels, depending on their
offline brand to bring in the hits. They must have a range of
online and offline service options available to obtain and retain
customers. More than 50 percent of American "digital investors"
use multiple sources to retrieve stock quotes, and nearly 20
percent use multiple brokerage sources when they trade.
</P>
<P>
"These findings tend to support the long-term valuations of
leading Internet portals," said Cyber Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that while only 3 million Internet users
perform a majority for their stock trades via the Internet, 18.1
million users are regularly engaged in some form of investment
activity via the Net, a 132 percent increase from 7.8 million
measured in the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on interviews with 1,000 Internet users and
500 non-users. Respondents were asked about their use of online
and offline financial services usage. The survey was fielded in
the second quarter of 1998.

<HEADLINE> People's Bank of China to Increase Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China will
work out a series of measures to increase input into housing
loans, said Shang Fulin, deputy-governor of the People's Bank of
China recently.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a tele-conference on speeding up
construction of residential housing, which was held at Beijing
recently.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the four state-owned commercial banks'
outstanding of housing loans had reached 274.2 billion yuan (about
34 billion US dollars), increasing by 12.3 billion yuan over early
this year, he said, emphasizing that the bank will adopt measures
as follows to increase housing loans and strengthen its management.
</P>
<P>
First, all commercial banks are required to shift their key
loan-granting field from housing construction to ordinary housing
consumptions and the building of their auxiliary facilities.
</P>
<P>
Second, commercial banks are allowed to grant loans to
ordinary-housing developers who raise no less than 30 percent of
the investment needed by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Third, commercial banks are also allowed to grant loans to
improve auxiliary facilities for the unsalable commodity housing
and encourage developers to increase housing sales by reducing
prices.
</P>
<P>
Forth, housing-loan mangement will be strengthened to ensure no
ordinary housing loans are appropriated for financing other
projects.

TIANJIN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a port city about 100 km
east of Beijing, plans to use 70 million cubic meters of
desalted sea water by the year 2010, or 4 percent of its water
for industry and daily use, according to a Municipal Oceanic
Administration official.
</P>
<P>
With per capita fresh water resources only about a fourth the
world average, China has more than 300 cities with water shortage
problems, 14 of them coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has developed new desalination technology using
membrane and precipitating methods. The Dagang Power Plant can
annually produce 2.19 million tons of fresh water through
desalination.
</P>
<P>
Dagang can use 1.7 billion cubic meters of sea water for
cooling each year, and a third-phase sea water utilization project
is being prepared.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government plans to use sea water mainly as
industrial cooling water in coastal areas before the year 2010,
and after that it will be able to use it directly in industry and

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Urged To Get Japan's Economy Growing Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Local newspaper "The Dominion"
said in a Saturday's report that "More uncertainty was cast over
New Zealand's economic recovery last night when Japan's ruling
party elected Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi its new leader and
almost certainly the next prime minister."
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that Mr. Obuchi faces the urgent task of
"lifting Japan's ailing economy out of its worst recession since
World War II".
</P>
<P>
It said that the health of the Japanese economy is "crucial to
the recovery of Asian countries and New Zealand."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon as
saying that he hoped Mr. Obuchi and his Liberal Democratic Party
"grasp the nettle".
</P>
<P>
"Japan is the big locomotive of the region, and we'd like to
see it moving out of the station. Once it starts moving it pulls
all the Asian carriages including ourselves and Australia behind
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of New Zealand's worsening economic situation, the
paper quoted a New Zealand economist as saying "This is the
cumulative impact of Asia now hitting us."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that markets must now wait to see if Mr. Obuchi
can push through the policies necessary to fix Japan's crippled
banking sector and get its economy growing again.
</P>
<P>
"Though he has pledged economic reform, there is doubt over his
ability to make haste. Success will demand deft political footwork
and a delicate economic balancing act," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, a spokeswoman for New Zealand Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley said that New Zealand would extend its
congratulations to Mr. Obuchi on his appointment. Mr. Obuchi
"assumes the role at a very challenging time for his country and
we wish him well," she said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Minister On SAPTA, SAFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Minister of Internal
and International Commerce T. Wickramaratne has said the South
Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA) has given the correct
impetus to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC).
</P>
<P>
In a special interview with the official newspaper Daily News
here Friday, He also said the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)
was not a non-tariff barrier to globalization, but is a building
block and a stepping stone to globalization.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the SAARC decided at the Male Summit in May last
year that the time from SAPTA to SAFTA be advanced from 2005 to
2001. that itself shows the positive attitude of the SAARC leaders
towards the globalization process, the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is important that South Asia becomes a
single market so that it could marshal all the resources within
the region be it the material resources or human resources.
</P>
<P>
This could set the stage for joint ventures, alliances and
networks in order to be competitive in the global market, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, formed in December 1985 to promote regional
cooperation in economic, social, cultural and other fields,
embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
On trade under SAFTA, which has been very small up to now, he
answered that once SAFTA comes into place, market distortions
would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
He said as for the last two years, Sri Lanka's exports to SAPTA
 accounted for 15.8 million U.S. dollars while the imports from
SAFTA to Sri Lanka was only 12.5 million U.S. dollars. The trade
balance was in the country's favor by 3.3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question on the differences of opinions about
SAFTA, the Minister noted that the real reason is that India has
vast market access and is afraid of competition. In Sri Lanka, he
said, the import tariffs are low. The maximum tariff is 35
percent. The tariff rate for gold, silver and textiles is zero.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Obuchi Gets Tough Job as LDP President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi could hardly get relaxed after winning the presidential
race within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as several
thorny problems are awaiting him and his government to be formed.
</P>
<P>
As the newly-elected LDP chief, Obuchi, 61, is expected to be
prime minister to succeed Ryutaro Hashimoto later this month.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was elected LDP chief at a time when Japan's economy is
going through the worst slump since the end of World War II. The
top task Obuchi has to face up is how to revitalize the ailing
economy.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1997, Japan's gross domestic product grew
only 0.7 percent. Meanwhile, the jobless rate exceeded 4 percent,
the most unfavorable percentage since comparable figures were
first recorded in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Because of the stagnant economy, the LDP suffered a major
setback in the July 12 House of Councillors election, forcing
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to step down.
</P>
<P>
"The pressing issue facing us is to reconstruct the Japanese
economy and get rid of the people's uncertainty," Obuchi said at a
press conference shortly after winning the election.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese economy bears responsibility for Asia and the
whole world. We hope to convert the minus growth into plus
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, acknowledgement and hope are far away from being
sufficient to revive the sluggish economy. Turning the minus
growth into plus growth needs concrete and effective measures.
</P>
<P>
The first step Obuchi has to take is to give a clear impression
of his bold economic policies, political will and his ability to
carry them out so as to recover the confidence of people at home
and abroad, analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To show the public and the rest of the world how determined he
is to tackle the country's economic woes, Obuchi should form a
truly capable cabinet that can overcome the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The immediate task for Obuchi is to rebuild the country's
battered financial sector as time is running out to dispose of
huge amounts of bad loans held by banks and other financial
institutions, which many believe are the root cause of the
country's economic predicament.
</P>
<P>
Besides this, policies, such as the large-scale permanent tax
cuts and the injection of public money, as Obuchi has already
pledged, must be implemented to stimulate the economy and improve
economic performance, they added.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi promised to carry out permanent tax cuts of 6 trillion
yen (about 42.9 billion U.S. dollars) before the election.
</P>
<P>
Another major task for Obuchi is how to unite his party and
coordinate relations with opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi currently inherited a party that lacks not only majority
in the House of Councillors but also internal unity due to cracks
appeared during the heated and closely watched run-up to the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some young LDP politicians claimed before
the election that they would leave the party if Obuchi won. If
this came true, a political vacuum would be created and a
political mess would be unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
Even if Obuchi, known as being very adept at political
adjustment and building a consensus, could have no problem in
uniting his own party, it seems that he would meet more
difficulties in coordinating relations with the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
In response to his election as LDP president, opposition
parties demanded Friday the House of Representatives (the lower
house of parliament) be dissolved for a general election, citing
that the LDP would not take a stance aimed at making reforms.
</P>
<P>
As the LDP failed to hold a majority in the House of
Councillors, Obuchi has to solicit cooperation from opposition
parties so as to enact government-proposed bills.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi expressed the hope shortly after being elected that the
Diet (parliament) would pass legislation as soon as possible to
implement the "bridge bank" plan to clean up bad debts of the
country's failed financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The LDP chief, hence the prime minister, is not an easy job for
Obuchi. Whether he could serve out smoothly the rest of
Hashimoto's term until the end of September, 1999, depends upon
how quickly he can promote measures to revive Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
If the new government cannot produce tangible and positive
results soon in its management of the economy, the LDP is certain
to lose the next unified local elections scheduled for next
spring. That also means that the Obuchi government may crumble
before the next general election, some analysts noted.

<HEADLINE> NZ Yearly Trade deficit Exceeds One Bln NZ Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's foreign trade
balance was a deficit of 1,009 million NZ dollars (524.7 million
U.S. dollars) for the year ended June 1998, Deputy Government
Statistician Ian Ewing announced in a media release, which was
circulated here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He added the deficit for the previous 12 months was 290 NZ
dollars (150.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that Imports to New Zealand in June exceeded
exports, resulting in a trade deficit of 15 million NZ dollars
(7.8 million U.S. dollars). This compares with a trade surplus of
150 million NZ dollars (78 million U.S. dollars) for the month of
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ewing said that for June 1998, New Zealand's imports were 1,836
million NZ dollars (954.7 million U.S. dollars) and its exports
were 1,821 million NZ dollars (946.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The trend in the monthly merchandise trade balance has been
negative for seven months and is worsening," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The imports trend is rising and increasingly exceeds the
exports trend which is falling," Ewing said, adding: "Exports to
Asia are still declining."

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Population Expected to Drop in Coming Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The population in Bulgaria is likely
to drop from around 8.3 million to 7 million in the coming
decades, according to a study organized by the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe.
</P>
<P>
Dimiter Filipov from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences
presented the findings to a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study, covering 2,725 women aged 18 to 45, used a standard
questionnaire applied in other 24 countries.
</P>
<P>
It found that marriage and child bearing come at an earlier age
in Bulgaria than in other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The first marriage age for women in this nation is 18 to 22 as
against 30 in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The average number of children per family is 2.1, which means a
zero population growth for Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The birth rate among Bulgarian Turks and Gypsies is expected to
drop even more dramatically as these ethnic groups are entering a
period of transition characterized by fewer births, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Bulgarian women who do not want children say the
rising cost of raising children, especially when they grow up, is
the main reason.

PANAMA CITY, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Panama's banana exports
dropped 33 percent in the first half of this year, compared to the
same period of 1997, the Commerce and Industry Ministry said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian banana export in the period slid to 12 million
boxes, each weighing 18.14 kilograms, from 16.8 million in the
same period of the last year.
</P>

The shocking 57-day strike by workers in the Chiriqui Land
Company of the Pacific division and the "El Nino" weather
phenomenon are to blame for the situation.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only 24 million boxes will be exported in
1998, as against 33.3 million in 1997, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Banana is one of Panama's major agriculture items for export,
garnering more than 120 million U.S. dollars per year. More than
10,000 Panamanians are working in this industry with its products
mainly supplied to the United States, Germany, and Spain.

However, the Lacigas mounted a tremendous comeback to tie the
Norway's pair in the group B standings with 1-2 marks. The

The Brazilian pair, the top-rated team on the 1998 FIVA beach
volleyball world tour, were down 6-0 to the Canadians before
rallying to take a 10-9 lead. The winner took the last four points
in a row after a 11-11 tie.

<HEADLINE> EU Health Ministers Meet on Health Care Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Health ministers of the European
Union (EU) nations met at Burg Schlaining, Austria, Friday to
discuss ways of improving health care in their countries and
explore possibility of cooperation in the area.
</P>
<P>
Opening the one-day meeting, Austrian Health Minister Lore
Hostasch said more and more patients are placing high hopes on the
improved health care.
</P>
<P>
"We must respond to these expectations," he said, adding that
there should be a new strategy in funding to ensure and improve
health care in all union nations.
</P>
<P>

for further improvement.

<HEADLINE> Steels Wins Stage of Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- In the shadow of drug scandals,
Belgian national champion Tom Steels won the 12th stage delayed
two hours in the Tour de France in Tarascon sur Ariege on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Steels' victory was overshadowed by the scandals that
smear the sport of cycling.
</P>
<P>
Three of the nine expelled Festina riders, namely world road
race champion Laurent Brochard, Christophe Moreau, both French,
and Armin Meier of Switzerland, admitted taking
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
The remaining six riders, including four-time King of the
Mountains Richard Virenque, and the two assistant team directors,
were released early Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Swiss cyclist Armin Meier said on Friday that he had taken the
EPO, becoming the first cyclist in the Tour de France to publicly
admit taking the performance-enhancing substance.
</P>
<P>
And competitors delayed their action for two hours in a
protest, saying the sport of cycling was taking a backseat to the
doping investigation as the tournament was overshadowed by the
drug scandal.
</P>
<P>
Meier, a member of the Festina team that was expelled from the
Tour last week, said he had admitted to taking EPO during police
questioning who, he claimed, had treated him as a criminal and
undressed him to nakedness.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I said that I had taken EPO, how I took it and why I took
it," he said, "I'm just the victim of a system."
</P>
<P>
However, Meier refused to say if any of his teammates had also
taken the banned substance.
</P>
<P>
In another scandal, Dutch TVM team has two members detained
Friday night over allegations of drug-taking by the team.
</P>
<P>
The team's sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei
Mikhailov were placed in custody after being questioned in the
southern town of Pamiers.
</P>
<P>
About 100 doses of drugs were found last March in a TVM team
car near Reims, east of Paris. Police did nothing at the time,
but the affair resurfaced in the wake of the Festina scandal that
is rocking the cycling world.
</P>
<P>
Police officials said EPO was found at the team's hotel in
Pamiers during a search on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Two Stock Brokerages Announce Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's two large stock
brokerages, the Shanghai's Guotai Securities and Shenzhen-based
J&AMP;A Securities, announced a merger yesterday to create the biggest
securities firm in China, according to a joint ad issued by the
two companies in the "China Security News" yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The government has yet to approve the proposed merger, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The merger resolution has been approved by the boards of
directors of both companies and has now been sent to the relevant
government authorities for approval.
</P>
<P>
The step was taken after several officials of J&AMP;A Securities Co
were accused of breaking the law. They are currently being
investigated by the judicial department.
</P>
<P>
The new company will replace the Shanghai-based Shenyin-Wanguo
to become China's biggest stock trading firm. Shenyin-Wanguo
itself is also a product of a merger in 1996 when the former
International Securities Co, suffering huge losses in treasury
bonds trading, was taken over by Shenyin Securities.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of the Securities Association of China,
J&AMP;A, with total assets of 17.56 billion yuan (two billion US
dollars) was the leading industry profit-earner last year with net
profits amounting to 740.9 million yuan (89.27 million US
dollars). It was also the forth biggest A-share underwriter and
third biggest A-share trader in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Guotai reported 298.37 million yuan (35.95 million US dollars)
in net profits last year with total assets of 5.1 billion yuan
(614 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Mercosur to Deepen Regional Integration Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the Latin
America's largest trade bloc, Mercosur, reiterated Friday their
commitment to help quicken the regional integration process with
insistence on the principle of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
which form the South Common Market (Mercosur), reiterated the
commitment in a joint communique issued at the end of their 14th
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit was held in Argentina's southern outpost
Ushuaia. Also present were presidents of Chile and Bolivia,
Mercosur's two associate members, and visiting South African
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Noting its role in promoting economic growth in the four member
states, the communique spoke highly of the development of
Mercosur. It added that the bloc also helped the entire region
stand up to all challenges triggered by the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Also in the communique, the leaders made clear their support
for the creation of a single currency within the Mercosur, a
proposal initiated by Argentine President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
As for cooperation with the European Union (EU), the communique
said that Mercosur would continue negotiations on the
establishment of a free trade link between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the four presidents, together with the presidents
of Chile and Bolivia, signed a political declaration, naming the
territories of the six nations "zone of peace" free of mass
destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The six countries promised they would strengthen future
cooperation on defense and security.
</P>
<P>
Also signed in the summit was a series of agreements covering
the fields of trade, justice, education and national
security. These agreements were all documents reached in a
four-day preparatory session at the ministerial level prior to the
summit and ready for signing.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Mercosur members get together twice per year
and their next summit is expected to be held in Brazil later this
year.

<HEADLINE> Klan Ruled to Pay 37.8 Million Dollars for Hate Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A jury decided on Friday the Ku
Klux Klan, a white supremacist group, must pay 37.8 million
U.S. dollars because the group's message of hate incited the
burning of a rural black church in Manning, South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The award to Macedonia Baptist Church was 12.6 million dollars
more than even its own lawyers had requested. Jurors decided the
church had proved the Klan's rhetoric motivated four former
Klansmen to set the 1995 fire that destroyed the church.
</P>
<P>
The jury of nine blacks and three whites rejected arguments by
the Klan's lawyer that the four acted on their own and the issue
was whether the Klan's speech should be protected by the law.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Mouzon, the church's pastor, said as quoted by AP,
"This wasn't a monetary thing. This was about taking a stand for
your rights."
</P>
<P>
"There are always going to be people who hate. And lawsuits
like this make it harder for them to operate," said the church's
attorney.
</P>
<P>
Three of the men in prison for the church burning testified,
and two implicated the Klan.
</P>
<P>
"The church fire was Klan business, and we were told we would
not go to jail. We were convinced we were untouchable," one of them
said.
</P>
<P>
Four men pleaded guilty to burning down the church and are
serving prison sentences. A day before the attack, two of them
also torched the Mount Zion AME Church nearby.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Thailand Sign Tourism Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Thailand reached an
agreement here Friday on cooperation in tourism between the two
countries, the state-run TV Myanmar reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Myanmar Minister of Hotels and
Tourism Major-General Saw Lwin and visiting Thai Minister to the
Office of the Prime Minister Jurin Laksanawisit.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is planning to attract more visitors from Thailand that
plays a key role in supplying tourists to the country among its
neighbors and ranked second after Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, more than 7,000
tourists from Thailand visited Myanmar out of more than 246,000
from 24 countries and regions, according to the official monthly
Economic Indicators.
</P>
<P>
The country has also been receiving a large number of Thai
visitors through Kawthoung at the southern end of the country
bordering Thailand where resorts have been built on some islands.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's investment in Myanmar's hotels and tourism sector,
second only to Singapore, amounted to 200 million U.S. dollars in
eight projects at the end of March this year, compared to a total
of foreign investment of more than 1 billion dollars in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also planning to organize a travel show
in Thailand to attract tourists from there following its tourism
promotion campaign launched in Singapore recently.

<P>
BONN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Marcelo Rios defeated German
veteran Boris Becker in straight sets to reach the semifinals of
the 1.04 million U.S. dollars Mercedes Cup tennis tournament in
Stuttgart on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rios who ranked second only behind Pete Sampras in the ATP
rankings, knocked the 30-year-old Becker out with a 6-2, 6-0 rout
in just 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Rios will climb to the top of the rankings if he can beat fifth
seed Karol Kucera to reach the final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The victory was a revenge for the 22-year-old Chilean who lost
to Becker in the semifinals of the Swiss Open in Gstaad earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Becker, a six-time Grand Slam champion, was still looking for
the first clay court title in his 15-year career after winning 49
of the 250 international tournaments he has played since 1983.
</P>
<P>
French Open champion Carlos Moya, who is seeded two here, beat

<HEADLINE> China's Laid-Off Workers Ensured of Expenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Living expenses will be provided
to all laid-off workers and every retiree will get their pensions
paid through a new unified old-age pension system, which is
expected to be introduced nationwide within three months,
according to an ongoing national conference.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily said all retired workers, no matter what
their former employers' present financial status, will start
getting their pensions from a social public pension fund,
beginning August 1.
</P>
<P>
All the country's laid-off workers, discharged because of the
ongoing State enterprise reform to cut redundancy, will be
accommodated in re-employment centers by the end of September,
said Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo at a conference here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the conference, which is being attended by the
country's provincial officials in charge of the employment and
social welfare system, revealed that so far 8.2 billion yuan (987
million US dollars) of pension funds have been misappropriated,
causing delays in pension payments to some 1.08 million people.
</P>
<P>
Wu said such irregularities must be thoroughly checked, and
re-employment centers should be set up in every enterprise which
has laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, there were 7.1 million laid-off workers
nationwide, and about a quarter of them have been absorbed into
re-employment centers.
</P>
<P>
The plan was created in Shanghai in 1996 and spread throughout
the country in 1997. Laid-off workers sign three-year contracts
with the centers, which will pay them minimum living expenses,
pension and medicare insurance that come to a total of 3,000 yuan
a year per person.
</P>
<P>
The money is contributed equally by the government, enterprises
and society. Society may offer donations and unemployment
insurance for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The old-age pension network will eventually expand to cover
workers of enterprises of all ownerships, including private
enterprises and joint ventures.

<P>
European Parliament President Jose Maria Gil Robles said Friday

In a global trend of integration and cohesion, the EU favors a
Latin America moving that direction, said the president.

The European Parliament proposed the dialogue to reduce the
differences so as to secure the biggest benefit possible for the

<HEADLINE> Kunming to Ban Use of Phosphorus Detergents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Kunming, capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province, will ban sales of phosphorus detergents
in the Dianchi Lake Valley on October 1 as part of an effort to
effectively treat pollution in the nation's sixth largest fresh
water lake.
</P>
<P>
The ban will not only restrict the use of phosphorus detergents
in the lake area with a population of over two million people, but
also require detergent dealers to report their inventories to
industrial and commercial administrations by September 1.
</P>
<P>
Advertising on phosphorus detergents will also be banned.
</P>
<P>
Dianchi Lake, a formerly clear green body of water, is
currently choked by algae which is nourished by major discharges
of phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
The city introduced a program encouraging the use of
phosphorus-free detergents some two years ago, and began levying
fees on sales of phosphorus detergents on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, related efforts failed to achieve desired results,
with experts attributing the failure to high prices and the
ineffective cleaning properties of phosphorus-free detergents. The
per ton price for phosphorus-free washing powder hovers around
6,000 yuan, or substantially higher than the 4,000 yuan per ton
for products containing phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
The ban is expected to reinforce the battle against pollution,
according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Li Guochun, an official in charge of the lake protection, said
that as of October 1, income from illegal sales of the phosphorus
detergents in the areas will be confiscated and offenders will be
subject to fines ranging from 500-5,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has pledged to carry out the Dianchi pollution
treatment program over the next 18 years. Related efforts will be
carried out with 250 million yuan in funding from the central
government and World Bank loans totalling 150 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> FINA Fails to Reach Verdict in Smith Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- FINA started its hearing on the
alleged doping case of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith but failed to
reach any decision so far in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Smith, triple gold medalist in the Centennial Olympic Games in
Atlanta in 1996, appeared tired before a three-man panel,
answering
questions on the allegations that she had tampered with her urine
samples with achohol earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
If she was found guilty, Smith would face a possible life ban.
For the moment, the Irish swimmers still had to suffer at least
days of nightmares.
</P>
<P>
Harm Bayer, head of the commission, said the panel will review
the case on Saturday and he doubted any decision in days.
</P>
<P>
Smith's lawyer Peter Lennon said a verdict would be announced
in "days or weeks".
</P>
<P>
The hearing lasted four and half a hours as Lennon was given
three hours to present Smith's defense in the closed-door hearing
in Lausanne, headquarters of the swimming world governing body
FINA.
</P>
<P>
Smith appeared in the hearing without the company of her
husband Erik De Bruin, and left the courtroom without meeting the
press circle.
</P>
<P>
In April, FINA said Smith's A sample tested in Barcelona showed
"unequivocal signs of adulteration" and "physical manipulation",
and the analysis of her second sample justified the first findings.
</P>
<P>
Both samples contained a lethal concentration of alcohol,
suggesting an attempt to mask the detection of drugs. But Smith
who underwent the out-of-season test in Ireland on January 10, had
consistently denied taking banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered
as serious as taking steroids. The maximum penalty is a life
ban.

BELGRADE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's national coach
Slobodan Santrac offered his resignation on Friday after his soccer squad
failed to make the last eight in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was beaten 1-2 in the second round of the World Cup by the
Netherlands, losing semifinalist, in Toulouse's Stade Municipal on June 29.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the national team said Santrac could be
succeeded by Radomir Antic, former Atletico Madrid coach in the
Spanish first division.
</P>
<P>
Santrac said in his report to the Yugoslav Football Association
that since Yugoslavia failed to make further steps in the World
Cup under his helm, another coach should take his place to prepare
for the European Championship qualification rounds.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Santrac's resignation was not yet accepted by the Yugoslavian

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Issues Decree on Freedom of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has signed a government regulation in lieu of a law on "freedom of
expression" that governs requirements for street demonstrations, a
minister was quoted by local press Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was urgently needed to maintain national
security and order but, at the same time, also to assure freedom
of expression for all citizens, Minister of Justice Muladi told
reporters after meeting Habibie at the presidential office here
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the regulation was not meant to silence
government critics nor to restrict human rights but to prevent
uncontrollable situations and to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
He cited how street demonstrations often ended out of control,
resulting in destruction, burning and looting, which in turn
caused widespread losses.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting in decades in
Jakarta and other cities from May 13 to 15. More than 1,000 lives
were claimed, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Those incidents spread "public fear and endangered national
unity", Muladi said, adding that national stability was urgently
needed now to restore international confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the four-chapter, 17-article regulation, a police
permit is required for a street demonstration if it involves more
than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
The police must give an official answer to any request for a
permit. The demonstration can be conducted three days after the
permit is issued.
</P>
<P>
The police must also be informed at least 24 hours in advance
if demonstrations are canceled, apparently to prevent the
unnecessary deployment of police officers.
</P>
<P>
Street protests will not be allowed on public holidays or at
night.
</P>
<P>
"They (demonstrations) cannot be carried out in front of the
presidential palace, places of worship, military installations,
hospitals, harbors or airports, train and land transportation
stations and other vital locations," the regulation said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the regulation would remain valid until the
House of Representatives ratifies the bill. The government plans
to submit the document for House deliberation soon.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Cyclist Admits to Doping in Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Swiss cyclist Armin Meier said on
Friday that he had taken the EPO, becoming the first cyclist in the Tour de
France to publicly admit taking the performance-enhancing substance.
</P>
<P>
And competitors delayed their action for two hours in a protest, saying the
sport of cycling was taking a backseat to the doping investigation as the
tournament was overshadowed by the drug scandal.
</P>
<P>
Meier, a member of the Festina team that was expelled from the
Tour last week, said he had admitted to taking EPO during police questioning
who, he claimed, had treated him as a criminal and undressed him to nakedness.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I said that I had taken EPO, how I took it and why I took
it," he said, "I'm just the victim of a system."
</P>
<P>
However, Meier refused to say if any of his teammates had also
taken the banned substance.
</P>
<P>
In another scandal, Dutch TVM team has two members detained
Friday night over allegations of drug-taking by the team.
</P>
<P>
The team's sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei
Mikhailov were placed in custody after being questioned in the
southern town of Pamiers.
</P>
<P>
About 100 doses of drugs were found last March in a TVM team
car near Reims, east of Paris. Police did nothing at the time,
but the affair resurfaced in the wake of the Festina scandal that
is rocking the cycling world.
</P>
<P>
Police officials said EPO was found at the team's hotel in
Pamiers during a search on Thursday.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Yu Zhuocheng and Zhou
Yilin met no challenge throughout to sweep the top two medals of
the men's one-meter springboard diving at the Goodwill Games here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yu, world 3-meter springboard champion this year, overtook Zhou
in his final dive, winning the gold with a total of 426.24 points.
Zhuo, world silver medalist for the event this year, led the first
five rounds after registering a day-high score of 81.60 on his
second outing. He faded to second position, but still had 26
points to spare than the third placed Mark Ruiz of the United
States, who collected 395.52.
</P>
<P>
The competition was a Chinese affair from the first round,
which saw Zhou ranked first with 63.96 ahead of Yu's 63.18. Ruiz
was listed third, trailig about 1.5 points.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, 24, widened the leading margin after second action, but
Yu narrowed the gap a bit in the third. After the fourth round,
Zhou placed first with 277.86, followed closely by Yu, 277.38.
Ruiz dropped a distance third with 256.02.
</P>
<P>
With the two Chinese fighting for the gold, Ruiz had to hold
off a strong surge from Andreas Wels of Germany in the bronze
battle. The Germany performed excellently in his final two dives,
gaining 72.00 and 73.47, but his efforts came still short, losing
only 2.18 points.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could win through if I dive good in my last round.
That was the most difficult action and could bring me high point,"
said Yu, who gained his fame in 1993 when he won the World Cup
3-meter springboard title.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best here to win the 3-meter title," added Yu,
who was selected as the Best Diver of the Year in 1994 by the U.S.
Swimming magzine.
</P>
<P>
Li Dazheng, leader of the Chinese diving team, told Xinhua that
the Chinese divers have strength to take five or six gold medals
here. "But we will meet strong challenge in the men's 3-meter
springboard and the platform."

consent was secured for us through the Chinese delegation
accompanying Sang Lan," said Doctor Brock Schnebel, Chief Medical
Officer for the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese delegation, Sang Lan's parents will
arrive here Saturday night. Sang's father Sang Shisheng and mother
Chen Xiufeng heard the tragic news when they were watching T.V. on
July 22 local time.
</P>
<P>
When they couldn't find their darling daughter on the screen,
they began to sense something bad might occur to her. The Chinese
Central TV Station has been transmitting all the competition
programs of the Goodwill Games, so everyone who knows Sang Lan in
Ningbo, a small town near Shanghai, heard the shocking news from
the tv broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
Gu Songhui, top sports official in the city, informed Sang's
parents to prepare for an urgent trip to the United States. Since
Sang Lan is a famous sport star in the local town, many people
flocked her home to console her parents.
</P>
<P>
Sang's parents took a flight to Beijing the following day.
Thanks to the help of the U.S.-Sino governments, they were allowed
to fly here with special permission. The Chinese government let
them go without passports and the U.S. government allowed them to
enter the United States with special visas. Sang Lan is the only
child in her family.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan, who started gymnastics training at age five, won five
gold medals for Ninbo at the China's Zhejiang Provincial Games.
She was selected into the national team in 1992, and won both the
all-around and vaulting titles at the 1996 Chinese City Games.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Sang was able to perform some most
difficult vaulting actions in the world, so she was dubbed as "the
vaulting queen" in China.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Schnebel said: "Sang Lan is gaining in her understanding
of what is happening, and is maintaining a good attitude. As you
can imagine, this would be very difficult for anyone, especially a
teenager."
</P>
<P>
The doctor revealed that there has been no neurological change
in her condition at all. "Her mental state is also what we're
watching closely as she deals day-to-day with the injury," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said Sang Lan has had two dosages of the experimental drug
Sygen so far - one at 10:15 last night and another at 2:30 this
afternoon. Sygen is being administered through a slow-drip IV in
100 milligram dosages over 30-minute periods.

<HEADLINE> Two Policemen Killed in Capitol Gunfire Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A gunman broke through security
barriers at the Capitol Friday afternoon and killed two Capitol
police officers in a heated exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was shot and captured and a woman tourist was also
seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
Federal law enforcement officers said that, based on
preliminary work, authorities believe the man, identified as a
42-year white man from the Midwest, was acting alone when he
invaded the Capitol, filled with summertime tourists, according to
news reports.
</P>
<P>
The slain policemen were Jacob Chestnut, an 18-year veteran of
the Capitol police force, and John Gibson, who had served on the
force for eight years. Both were married and each had three
children.
</P>
<P>
The deaths were confirmed by Sergeant Dan Nichols, spokesman
for the Capitol police. Capitol flags already had been lowered to
half-staff. President Bill Clinton ordered flags at the White
House and other executive buildings lowered as well.
</P>
<P>
Both police officers were declared dead at nearby hospitals.
Nichols said one of the officers was on duty at the entrance, and
was shot there. The other was killed just inside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred near the suite of offices occupied by
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip. He
was inside the office when the gunfire burst out in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
The wounded tourist was identified as Angela Dickerson, 24, and
was reported in serious condition at George Washington University
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was expected to survive. He was from Illinois and
had moved to Montana two or three years ago, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was at Camp David, Maryland, issued a statement
saying he was "deeply disturbed" by the bloodshed at "the people's
house, a place where visitors and workers should not have to fear
violence."
</P>
<P>
Clinton telephoned Speaker Newt Gingrich after learning of the
shootings, and Gingrich also spoke by phone with Democratic Leader
Dick Gephardt, who had left the Capitol by the time the attack
occurred.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich also spoke with Gibson's and Chestnut's families and
planned to visit them to express his condolences, said an aide.
</P>
<P>
DeLay issued a statement of gratitude for the work of the
officers, saying of officer Gibson, "I have no doubt that John
saved the lives of many people today."

<HEADLINE> Tour Riders Delay Twelfth Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tour de France riders on Friday held
up the start of the 12th stage of the race in protest over a drugs
scandal involving the top-ranking Festina team.
</P>
<P>
The stage finally began two hours late after frantic talks
between cyclists and race officials.
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before the stage was due to start, world No.1
cyclist Laurent Jalabert of France addressed race officials on the
tour radio station, saying the riders had decided to boycott
Friday's stage.
</P>
<P>
Race director Jean-Marie Leblanc immediately announced the
start of the 222 kilometre-stage from Tarascon to Cap D'Agde would
be delayed while he held urgent talks with riders and team
officials.
</P>
<P>
The scandal erupted when performance-enhancing drugs were
seized from a Festina car and the team later expelled from the
race.

<HEADLINE> Germany's DASA Seeks Single European Aerospace Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG
(DASA) confirmed Friday that it has held talks with other European
aerospace companies to seek the creation of a single European
aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
In response to a report in the Friday edition of the British
Financial Times saying that DASA was in merger talks with British
Aerospace (BAe), a DASA spokesman said Friday that the talks had
taken place, but it also involved other European aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that his company wanted to see a wider
European consolidation, not just a bilateral merger with BAe.
</P>
<P>
It has been speculated long ago that DASA and BAe wanted to
push for a pan-European aerospace company first through a
bilateral merger.
</P>
<P>
DASA chairman of the board, Manfred Bischoff, was quoted by
German press as saying recently that it was necessary for leading
European companies to merger themselves into a single European
Aerospace and Defense Company in order to compete with their U.S.
rivals.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the possible single European entity also
integrate activities of the current four-European-nation Airbus
consortium.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Two policemen, a woman tourist
and a suspected gunman were shot late Friday afternoon in an
exchange of gunfire just inside the Capitol near the office of a
ranking Republican lawmaker, officials said.
