EDITORIAL: ON A DANGEROUS PATH TO FETAL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Congressional opponents of abortion rights have come up with yet
another scheme to advance their agenda. Called the ``Unborn Victims
of Violence Act,'' and scheduled for action today by the House
Judiciary Committee, the measure aims to chip away at women's
reproductive freedom by granting new legal status to ``unborn
children'' _ under the deceptively benign guise of fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would add to the federal criminal code a separate new
offense to punish individuals who injure or cause the death of a
``child'' who is ``in utero'' _ regardless of the stage of
gestation or whether the perpetrator knew of the pregnancy. Under
the measure, a prosecutor could choose to pursue a defendant for
harming a fetus independent of whether he prosecuted the defendant
for harming the mother.
</P>
<P>
   No one would quarrel that an attack on a pregnant woman that
results in a miscarriage or prevents normal fetal development is a
tragedy. Extra severe penalties in such cases may be appropriate.
But that can be done by prosecuting a defendant for assaulting the
pregnant woman. The pending bill, however, treats the woman as a
different entity from the fetus _ in essence raising the status of
a fetus to that of a person for law enforcement purposes _ a
longtime goal of the right-to-life movement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains exceptions for medical treatment and legal
abortions. That has allowed the bill's sponsors to assert that the
measure has nothing to do with the abortion issue. But that view is
disingenuous. By creating a separate legal status for fetuses, the
bill's supporters are plainly hoping to build a foundation for a
fresh legal assault on the constitutional underpinnings of the
Supreme Court's ruling in Roe vs. Wade. Sending the nation down a
legal path that could undermine the privacy rights of women is not
a reasonable way to protect women or deter crime.

TRANSPLANTED PALFFY GLAD TO BE A KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Ziggy Palffy didn't hesitate Monday when
asked which arena is his favorite to play in.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSG,'' Palffy said, referring to Madison Square Garden, home
of the New York Rangers. ``It's a lot of fun and they always have a
big crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   MSG almost was his home, too, but instead of trading him to the
Rangers this summer, the New York Islanders dealt Palffy to the
Kings. And tonight at the Forum, he will make his first Los
Angeles-area appearance as a King, in an exhibition game against
the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to come here,'' Palffy said. ``What happened,
happened. I'm very glad to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Kings are happy to have added their most dynamic
offensive threat since the Wayne Gretzky era. Coach Andy Murray
said he's been especially pleased that the slightly built Palffy
(who is 5-foot-10, 183 pounds) has shown a willingness to battle
for the puck, which belies his smallish stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I've really noticed is he's really feisty,'' Murray
said. ``He's not big, but when he battles for the puck, he's very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy said, ``You have to fight for the puck. If you have the
puck, you can score goals or pass the puck to someone who is
(open). If you don't have the puck, you can't score.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sixty-minute men:During the exhibition season, many coaches
will play one goalie for the first 30 minutes of a game, the other
goalie for the last 30. Not Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Las Vegas, Murray used Stephane Fiset for 60
minutes, and the Kings' No. 1 goalie responded with a 19-save
shutout of the Phoenix Coyotes. Tonight, Murray said he is planning
to use Jamie Storr for the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're helping your goalies by splitting
games,'' Murray said. ``Part of it is the physical side, giving
them the chance to play 60 minutes. But it's also the mental side,
having them have to focus for the whole game.''

EDITORIAL: GUN-CONTROL SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations in Congress over the fate of the modest menu of gun
control measures the Senate approved last spring may finally be
coming to a head. The House-Senate conference committee dealing
with the issue is expected to meet later this week to decide what,
if any, new restrictions on firearms will be included in the
juvenile justice measure being readied for a vote by the full House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A major logjam has developed over extending the Brady law's
background check requirement to all gun-show sales. There is talk
of a possible compromise that would require background checks, but
allow the government well under the three business days that are
the minimum needed to track down criminal and mental health
records. It is unclear whether the GOP might now be amenable to
stronger record-keeping requirements, so that weapons bought at gun
shows and used later in crime are easily traceable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a study released last week by the Justice Department
underscored, the only reason to limit the time for background
checks is to make it easier for prohibited purchasers to obtain
weapons _ hardly a worthy goal for the nation's top lawmakers. Most
gun purchasers sail through the process. The study showed that
almost three-quarters of the people buying guns from federally
licensed dealers received a response through the new instant check
system in about 30 seconds, and that 95 percent have their checks
completed within two hours. But other cases take longer, for very
good reasons _ typically because a preliminary check turned up a
felony arrest, a domestic-violence restraining order or some other
potentially disqualifying factor.
</P>
<P>
   After all the violence, and with Americans looking to Congress
for strong steps on gun control that go well beyond the meager
items under consideration, Republicans should accept the need for a
record-keeping system that makes all guns traceable. They should
also be willing to extend to gun shows the Brady law's existing
limit of three business days on background checks. Pressing a
watered-down version destined to put deadly firepower in the hands
of felons, fugitives and other prohibited buyers is not the way to
save lives or win votes.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Before this year's U.S. Open even started, Steffi Graf retired
from professional tennis and Pete Sampras withdrew from the
competition with an injury. Yet despite these prominent no-shows _
and the early, injury-related default of the 1998 champion, Patrick
Rafter _ the last Grand Slam tournament of the 20th century was a
dandy, providing two weeks of compelling tennis, heartening
comeback stories and, in Serena Williams, the first
African-American women's champion since Althea Gibson in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The results confirmed a generational shift in the women's game.
Jana Novotna, the former Wimbledon champion, will soon follow Graf
into retirement, leaving the top of the women's field to a handful
of supercharged teen-agers. Serena is just 17, Martina Hingis, whom
she defeated in the finals, is 18, and Serena's sister Venus is 19.
All three hit their ground strokes with incredible power, and the
Williams sisters serve as hard as many of the men.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest comeback story belongs to Andre Agassi. Just two
years ago Agassi was ranked 141st in the world. His thrilling
five-set victory in the final against Todd Martin gave him his
second Grand Slam title of the year and at least temporary claim to
the number-one ranking in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for anyone who remembers the long hair and punk
outfits of 10 years ago to grasp the fact that, at 29, Agassi is
now an elder statesman. But the men's division is dominated by
veterans. Martin is 29, Sampras is 28. The women have had their
revolution. The men are holding the insurgents at bay. In fact, it
is hard to find any insurgents.

   GOLDEN, Colo. _ Midwest Research Institute and its partners at
an energy laboratory have donated $25,000 to endow a scholarship in
memory of victims of the massacre at nearby Columbine High School. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Research Institute, based in Kansas City, Mo., is the
lead partner of a consortium that operates the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory under contract for the U.S. Department of
Energy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In April, two Columbine students shot and killed 12 of their
classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Columbine tragedy struck me and NREL's (1,000) employees
deeply,'' lab director Richard H. Truly said in a news release.
``We all wanted to do something that would capture the spirit of
our community by making a lasting investment in science
education.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship will be at the Colorado School of Mines. That
school, the lab and Columbine High School are in Jefferson County,
Colo., a Denver suburb. The lab and the mining school have a
collaborative research relationship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recipients will be chosen from Columbine and other Jefferson
County schools by the School of Mines Foundation from among
students in disciplines related to the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory's research and development. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other energy lab partners are Battelle Memorial Institute of
Columbus, Ohio, and Bechtel Corp. of San Francisco. No federal
money was used for the endowment, the energy lab said. &QL;

MISSOURI GAS ENERGY CUSTOMERS LOSE HEDGING PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri Gas Energy customers may be far more
vulnerable this winter to the sort of spikes in natural-gas prices
that caused heating bills to soar three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last two years, Missouri Gas Energy customers are
headed into a winter not protected by a program to guard against
sky-high prices for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   After the winter of 1996-97, when natural-gas prices more than
doubled in one month, the utility began to hedge the prices it paid
for gas. For a few dollars a month, customers were cushioned
against such price spikes if they occurred again.
</P>
<P>
   But when the hedging program lapsed earlier this year, Missouri
Gas Energy didn't ask regulators for permission to renew it. Now
the utility is entering the winter without the program and with
prices for natural gas already as much as 50 percent higher than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Missouri Public Service Commission said
regulators could not force Missouri Gas Energy to hedge prices. But
the utility will face extra scrutiny over the decision not to hedge
if customers pay sharply higher prices this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff view is that MGE is accountable for the decision,''
said David Sommerer, manager of the Public Service Commission's gas
procurement division.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gas Energy, which has about 471,000 customers, said
Monday that a utility executive was not comfortable discussing the
decision until a proposal was filed with Missouri regulators on
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the utility probably will submit an incentive
program. Such programs can benefit consumers when Missouri Gas
Energy spends less than it expected to buy gas for its customers.
The utility has used the incentives the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though we've been operating in a vacuum,'' said
Kevin Crockett, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. Details of the
incentive plan were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The utility is exploring options, including hedging, that it
might include in its request to Missouri regulators, Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are now questions whether any plan would be too late
to benefit customers this winter. Kevin Kelly, a spokesman for the
Missouri Public Service Commission, said the soonest a decision
could be made on a Missouri Gas Energy proposal would be 30 days
after it was submitted, and that's only if no questions arose. That
would push any approval to Nov. 1 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Even now is too late to effectively hedge gas prices, in the
view of many observers. Because of the recent increases in prices,
hedging would be far more expensive, or price caps would have to be
set much higher than they could have been a few months ago.
Typically, the programs are more effective when done in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally you want to hedge when prices are lower,'' said Chris
Ellsworth, manager of natural gas for Energy Security Analysis Inc.
in Washington, which conducts research on energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators in June renewed the hedging program for
Laclede Gas, the gas utility serving St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   After the price spikes of three years ago, utilities were
criticized for not doing enough to protect consumers. One problem
was that any price increases for natural gas could be passed
directly on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Although utilities could traditionally put gas in storage or
contract to buy some gas at fixed-rate prices to lend stability to
prices, Missouri regulators decided utilities could do more. They
gave the OK to hedging for any gas utilities that wanted to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge works something like an insurance policy. A financial
institution for a premium will guarantee that a utility will pay
only a specified amount for gas. If the price goes above that
amount, the institution pays the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Missouri Gas Energy paid $3 million _ about $7 a
customer _ to hedge its gas costs. Those costs were paid by its
customers. Because gas prices were low last year _ usually below $2
a thousand cubic feet _ the hedges didn't pay off.
</P>
<P>
   So far prices have already edged above $3. On Monday they were
at about $2.80, according to one price index. In January 1997, gas
prices topped $4 a thousand cubic feet. A typical household in the
Kansas City area uses 120,000 cubic feet of natural gas a year.
</P>
<P>
   At Kansas Gas Service, a majority of the gas it expects to sell
this winter has been hedged. This year that means that if gas
prices go above $3.05 a thousand cubic feet, then the utility's
customers will get some relief, said Steve Johnson, a spokesman for
Kansas Gas Service.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the utility asked some customers in focus groups if
the cost of the program _ about $5 a customer _ was worth it. The
results were encouraging, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people said yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how much natural gas will end up costing this
winter. The threat of hurricanes and what that could do to some
natural-gas wells was being blamed by traders Monday for some of
the recent increases.
</P>
<P>
   John Zekoll, a deputy director of the New York State Public
Service Commission, said that whatever the reason, this serves as
another wake-up call for utilities to manage their gas costs,
including the use of hedges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't, they will after this winter,'' he said.

U.N. MOVING AHEAD TO ORGANIZE FORCE FOR EAST TIMOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (See also TIMOR-RDP, TIMOR-U.S.) 
(sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Security Council members worked late Monday
night on a draft resolution to authorize the use of force in East
Timor, and some members assembled troops, ships, advisers and
aircraft in preparation to move quickly into the territory to end
the violence there.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali A. Alatas, told Secretary
General Kofi Annan and the Security Council on Monday that his
government would welcome speedy deployment of a multinational force
but had some questions about the nationalities of its commander and
the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council was refining a draft from Britain that
would mandate troops to control militias that have been terrorizing
the East Timorese and driving them from their land. The draft,
which the council is expected to act on in a day or two, indicates
that the commander would be an Australian, a decision strongly
backed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alatas said Indonesia would place no conditions on the
force, he said it would prefer soldiers from members of the
Association of South East Asian Nations. Some of those nations,
including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, have
said they will take part. British Gurkha troops based in Brunei are
also on call.
</P>
<P>
   For many Indonesians, however, Australia is a provocative and
politically explosive choice to lead the troops because it has been
a strong supporter of East Timorese independence leaders in the
past and the two countries had very rocky relations until
relatively recently. Some council members also have qualms about
the choice, a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   In Darwin, an Australian port 250 miles from East Timor,
preparations for action already have begun, with the Australians
apparently confident they will lead the force.
</P>
<P>
   Australia has appointed a commander, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, a
Vietnam War veteran, and is assembling ships, helicopters and a
high-speed catamaran capable of carrying more than 500 troops.
France has sent four military officers to advise the Australians,
and 10 American military experts are in Darwin to help draw up
plans.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, said the
United States is preparing to use cargo planes to transport troops
and equipment, but had not selected ships or soldiers for duty.
</P>
<P>
   The council appears united on the need for a quick deployment to
restore order in East Timor; on Tuesday in Dili, the United Nations
closed its besieged compound there and, with Jakarta's permission,
began evacuating 1,300 refugees hiding there to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting a commander, the council is unlikely to specify
the number or nationalities of soldiers in the force, leaving those
decisions to the countries contributing troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, nationalists are demanding that no Americans, New
Zealanders or Portuguese take part. Portugal was the former
colonial power in East Timor, and Americans, New Zealanders and
other non-Asians are apparently viewed as prejudiced against
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat suggested that Indonesia's long years under often
harsh Dutch rule left a legacy of revulsion against European
domination that explains the persistent racial subtext in the
debate about peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told the council on Monday that Indonesian
``sensitivities'' had to be taken into account, diplomats said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We didn't come here to prevent any country from
participating,'' Alatas said, but he hinted broadly that the issue
should be weighed. ``It is up to the countries themselves to
consider whether it is appropriate, whether their presence would or
would not exacerbate the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobs in Indonesia have been attacking Australian diplomatic and
trade missions during the last week, including an attack Monday on
the office of the representative of Western Australia in Surabaya.
Alatas called the demonstrations responses to protests at
Indonesian consulates and its Embassy in Australia, which he said
cannot get basic supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outside chance that mounting political pressures
will cause Habibie to balk, diplomats here were relieved to hear
Alatas' message on Monday and are more or less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if I'm optimistic or pessimistic,'' Richard C.
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, said in
an interview after the council meeting. But he said he saw no real
opposition to quick action, and he marveled at the speed with which
the situation had turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-eight hours ago we were looking at the worst,'' he said.
``Twenty-four hours ago we were trying to parse the meaning of
Habibie. Now we're working on implementation. That's a pretty
impressive record for the Security Council and for Kofi. So far,
even if we got there too slowly, the last 48 hours have been a
major step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's envoy, Antonio Monteiro, said he welcomed Alatas'
assurances that he would not set conditions. ``We are very
encouraged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative and one of five
envoys sent to Indonesia last week to urge the government to accept
outside help in East Timor, said Monday on his return that he
thought government officials had underestimated the scale of the
crisis. The week of violence by pro-Indonesian forces was set off
by a vote for independence by the territory's population.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas told reporters on Monday that while he would like more
discussion on the composition of the force, ``what is important is
that Indonesia would like to see this security cooperation, the
sending of a force, as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an international peacekeeping force had been authorized
under a May 5 agreement on the future of East Timor, but only in
the third phase of the process, after the Indonesian Parliament had
ratified the referendum results, probably in November, and the
United Nations took over administration of East Timor until the new
country's first elections. Until the parliamentary ratification,
Indonesian troops were supposed to be responsible for law and
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, however, the situation is different,'' Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a multinational force with Security Council backing
rather than an full-dress U.N. peacekeeping operation is essential
to the Clinton administration because of congressional restraints
on any American role in the latter type operation and on payments
for such operations. A Security Council force does not require
congressional notification and the bills for it go to the countries
involved.

MAN'S PERSISTENT JOB HUNT FINALLY PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, ``Z'' became a trailing spouse. His wife's company
promoted her and moved her from one Midwest city to another _
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had to look for a job in 10 years,'' Z said earlier
this year. ``I've forgotten what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   Z, sharp, experienced and in his mid-30s, worried, too, about
job-hunting in a city where he knew no one. He didn't necessarily
think, though, that the search would take eight months.
</P>
<P>
   He now has a job that fits his professional goals. And something
else: a job hunter's diary that he agreed to keep and share.
</P>
<P>
   To give readers candid and free-flowing insights into one
applicant's job-hunting odyssey, Z's identity was protected. In the
interest of fairness, none of the companies he named in his diary
are identified. Z's previous employment has been verified.
</P>
<P>
   Z's job hunter's diary is being shared because his experiences
mirror those of many other unemployed midcareer professionals. They
wonder why the statistics say it's a time of ``full employment''
and news stories talk of a ``job hunter's market.'' How can this
be, they wonder, when they are having trouble finding work.
</P>
<P>
   His story shows that help-wanted signs may be plentiful, but
there often are imbalances between the jobs offered and the jobs
sought.
January
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, still living in his former city, Z searched
on the Internet. He was concerned about job hunting in a strange
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been based upon networking in my community, and
I really have not had to look for a position,'' Z wrote. ``They
came looking for me. Welcome to my dose of KC reality!''
</P>
<P>
   Z's resume showed a strong career progression in the financial
services industry. From an assistant branch manager and loan
officer in 1990, he'd moved on and up to be an investment
consultant for a securities corporation, then an assistant vice
president and trust officer at a large bank. A year ago, he
transferred his financial skills to a health-care management
company where he would have liked to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Z accessed the KCJobhunter and Headhunter Web sites for leads.
He posted his resume. He tried two other job posting sites, too,
but found them ``to be very slow and loaded with tech positions''
that didn't fit him.
</P>
<P>
   He also contacted an executive recruiter, and ``after an
in-depth discussion of my skills, he requested my references and
stated that he would call me tomorrow to discuss the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiter, who works to fill positions for corporate
clients, did call the next day. The day after that, Z was on a
plane to Kansas City, airfare and car rental paid for by the
recruiter. He had interviews with the president and trust
department head of a bank on the Kansas side of the metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my interview,'' Z wrote, ``I went for psychological
testing. I sat across from a nice, if not stone-faced person, who
for the next four hours gave me timed tests that would compare my
skills to the best bank sales and management people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first test, I felt as if I should be working the
window somewhere (May I super size that for you?), and Stoneface
was not giving me any hints on how I was doing. By the end of the
testing I was a mess. My shirt was soaked with sweat and I was
telling him about my childhood ...
</P>
<P>
   ``After an eternity, he came out of his office smiling. He said
I ranked in the upper 10 percent of my peers. Yeah, Baby!''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiter called Z at the hotel that night. The bank wanted
someone who had more local contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But the recruiter said he'd keep Z's resume. He thought another
corporate client might be interested in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Z also found on the Internet and contacted:
</P>
<P>
   - A medical center, which advertised for a business director. Z
received no response, even after sending three letters by an
express mail service.
</P>
<P>
   - A financial services company, which acknowledged receipt of
his e-mail within a day, but offered no immediate follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   - A national bank, which wanted a trust officer. No response.
</P>
<P>
   - A state credit association, which wanted a consultant. No
response.
</P>
<P>
   - A regional bank, which advertised for a portfolio manager. Z
e-mailed, faxed, called its job hot line and met representatives at
two job fairs before getting an interview scheduled for February.
</P>
<P>
   - A telecommunications corporation, for a business manager's
post. No response.
</P>
<P>
   - A health maintenance organization, which wanted a medical
manager. It acknowledged receipt of his resume within a week but
didn't offer an interview.
</P>
<P>
   - Another regional bank, for a portfolio manager. No response.
</P>
<P>
   - A credit union, for vice president of member services. No
response.
</P>
<P>
   - Two local executive job recruiters. One seemed ``terribly
annoyed with my call, but she did put my name into her junk e-mail
file, so I get way too many `do you know someone?' e-mails. The
other one ``was wonderful and took the time to talk, in great
detail, with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``annoyed'' recruiter told Z his salary expectations were
out of line for the Kansas City market. He shared comparable income
and expenses statistics he'd researched on the Wall Street Journal
Web site, but she rejected the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The ``wonderful'' recruiter said Z's expectations were ``right
in line with the local marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Z also put his name in with a national recruiter specializing in
financial institutions.

</P>
<P>
   in financial institutions.
February
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of February, Z checked into an area hotel. It
would be his home base for a couple of days of house and job
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   He also sent an e-mail to the careers columnist at The Kansas
City Star, asking whether it would be valuable to attend a
Star-sponsored job fair advertised for Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Career Expo ad piqued my interest, but my peers have
stated that Expos are for rookies and a total waste of time for
someone with experience,'' Z wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the job fair, Z approached. He was well-dressed,
well-groomed, carrying a nice briefcase. His handshake was firm.
His voice confident, brash even _ except for one thing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I'm talking to are young,'' he said at the job
fair. ``I feel old. I'm asking them more questions than they're
asking me.''
</P>
<P>
   Z wrote later: ``It's scary. I'm seeing lots of middle-aged,
middle-level management people wandering around, looking out of
place here. I.T. (information technology) rules, and if you're not
I.T. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   All told, he admitted, it was a depressing day.
</P>
<P>
   He tried two other job fairs while in Kansas City. At one, Z had
a pleasant 20-minute conversation with a bank recruiter. She said,
though, that she didn't recruit at his level; her boss did that,
and her boss wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   At the other fair, the hiring department head was there and
seemed to be impressed with Z, but his openings were all more than
an hour commute from where he'd be living.
</P>
<P>
   Z also made a side trip to the medical center where he'd sent an
e-mail. Its advertised financial position sounded perfect for his
skills and experience.
</P>
<P>
   He said a rude receptionist said the employment ad was in error
and that hospital experience was required. He couldn't get past the
receptionist to plead his case.
</P>
<P>
   On the way out of town, Z said he embarrassed his wife by
handing his business card to a bookstore clerk. He had learned in
casual conversation that the clerk's mother was in human resources
at the telecommunications company he'd contacted.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-February, Z had sent 16 resumes to 16 companies. He got
one immediate response _ not from the resumes, but from the mother
of the bookstore clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in compensation, not HR ... and could not help me
directly, but she would pass along my resume and would welcome my
telephone call,'' Z wrote. ``I called.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some nice people in the world, and she is one
of them. She told me about the area and where to look for homes and
where not to, as well.''
March
</P>
<P>
   Z flew back to Kansas City for interviews with two regional
banks and with the bank client that the executive recruiter had
said might be looking for someone within the month.
</P>
<P>
   The interview with one bank's department head went well. Z then
was led into a conference room and found five persons seated around
a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambushed! The questions started with `tell us about yourself'
and got worse,'' Z wrote. ``The group did not really seem prepared
to ask questions. So I asked them questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Z received a call the next day. The bank wanted a candidate who
had better local contacts. Z was somewhat disappointed; he thought
it could have been a decent fit.
</P>
<P>
   Z's next interview was with the bank referred by the executive
recruiter. He described a long, ``rambling'' interview with two
bank executives. One questioned Z's sales skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stated that I was a great salesman with a great closing
rate, but I also knew when to walk away from a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank executive said he'd never walked away from a deal, and
no sales person on his staff would ever walk away from a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The interview deteriorated. Z felt insulted. He left convinced
he wouldn't get an offer and didn't want to work there anyway. He
took his anger out on the executive recruiter, complaining about
being exposed to such a bad fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I burned a bridge.'' It was his last contact with the
executive recruiter, whom Z otherwise thought was a terrific
professional.
</P>
<P>
   An hourlong interview with an HR official at the other regional
bank was promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interview questions were obviously well thought out and
put my mind to work,'' Z wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He was told to expect a call the following week.
- MORE -
</P>
<P>
   the following week.
April
</P>
<P>
   Z moved to a Kansas City suburb. His wife was nine months
pregnant, so the bulk of the physical work fell to him. His job
hunt waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a follow-up call from the bank where I thought the HR
interview went so well. They basically said there's nothing to
offer you right now, but we'll keep you in a decent file. Really, a
decent file.''
</P>
<P>
   Z took time out from moving to read the newspaper religiously.
He paid close attention to lists of professional meetings and
breakfast clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started showing up at the door and filling out a name
tag. `Hi. I'm new in town. Tell me about your group.' I sat down
next to strangers and started talking.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to sales groups, finance groups, banking groups,
anything that looked like it might provide a job-referral link. At
one breakfast he met a commercial loan officer who promised to pass
along his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happened to have some along,'' Z joked.
May
</P>
<P>
   Z took the month off.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife spent days and nights with an extra-fussy new
baby. Thoughts of job-hunting paled in comparison to the desire for
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew job hunting could be ugly, that it could take time. I'd
put away some nuts for the winter,'' Z said. ``My wife had
disability income from the maternity leave. We weren't in financial
trouble, so we could just take time to focus on family.''
</P>
<P>
   May memories blur. Once, unshaven, he took his newborn daughter
to the doctor's office and ran into someone he'd met while
interviewing. The woman, watching him slick down his disheveled
hair with water from a drinking fountain, laughed.
June
</P>
<P>
   Z took more time off _ partly on purpose, partly not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am beginning to get irritated because no one is calling
back. They said they would,'' Z said. ``I couldn't believe the lack
of courtesy, the lack of professionalism. I couldn't believe
businesses operated that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Z also admitted he'd made some poor decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put my professional future in the hands of others. I'd put
too much stock in the recruiters. I'd never tied my fate to
headhunters before.''
</P>
<P>
   Z's irritation turned on himself. He had stopped doing the
networking that he knew he needed to do.
July
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the saddle. I went to networking breakfasts again. I
started a series of interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The first interview was rocky. In the cash management department
at a telecommunications company, the interviewer described himself
``as a den mother to a bunch of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Z didn't like that, and liked it less as the interview
progressed. Repeatedly, the interviewer ``hollered at his assistant
with language that would have gotten my mouth washed out by Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The next interview was great. At an energy company, Z's
interviewer was ``intelligent, thought-provoking and had a genuine
interest in what I had to say. I could work there in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Z heard back within two weeks: The spot had gone to someone
promoted internally, but the company was holding on to his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Z's third July interview was with the regional bank holding
company where he'd made promising HR contacts in March. This time
he met with members of the senior management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well-thought-out questions, and they actually shared their
vision of the future for the organization with me ... the first
company to do so. I could work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Z believes he got the follow-up call because of the resume he
handed the commercial loan officer he met at a breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Z's fourth July interview was with another regional bank. Z was
surprised that the HR interviewer took two personal calls during
the interview. From hearing half the conversation, Z thought one
call was about an oil change and the other was about a tee time.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to talk with the bank but was disturbed to learn
about the possible pay offer: Because of his earlier contact with a
headhunter that had a contract with the bank, his placement would
cost the bank $12,000. To pay the headhunter, the bank essentially
would offer him $12,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   Z's fifth July interview was with a national bank undergoing a
big transition. The interview and pay were great, but Z learned
that crucial stock research and investment decisions were handled
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to just babysit accounts while someone else
picked every investment for their clients,'' Z wrote. ``I could
work for the people, but not the company.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the month, Z had three bank-related offers and a
promise of continued interest from the energy company.
</P>
<P>
   He took the bank holding company job ``that, in the end, seemed
to be the only one that was right for me _ moneywise, visionwise,
careerwise. It was truly the best fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The job he took paid about $8,000 less than one of his other
offers, but the tradeoffs seemed worth it.
August
</P>
<P>
   Z is working. He likes his job. He even liked part of the hunt.
Looking back, he has two overriding thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   ``Network. I can't believe I'd forgotten that. I'd forgotten to
shake hands. I got lulled into thinking I need headhunter help
because I was new in the city. I forgot to use my own sales
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   And this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how many CEOs actually know what their HR departments
are doing and saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Z said the failure of HR representatives to follow up on
applications or to call back when they said they would paints a
rude and uninviting picture of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   He's also afraid that HR generalists don't have the specific
knowledge or experiences needed to evaluate applicants for skilled
positions in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question the screening abilities of many I met.''
</P>
<P>
   Z is careful to add that he excludes his new employer from the
criticism.

TOLEDO DECISION GIVES ONE PAUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Toledo could have dumped the season off to
Drew Bennett. To pass the torch, that would have been the quaint,
conservative play. After all, the UCLA redshirt junior has more
exposure to the offense, fewer interceptions and a better
completion rate after two games than redshirt freshman Cory Paus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bruins' fourth-year head coach checked off on the
easy call and looked way downfield.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday the onus is on Paus, the Bruins' starting
quarterback from here to maturity, to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo picked Paus, on the basis of his promise, to be Cade
McNown's successor and then got down to nit-picking.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the honeymoon. If this is going to be a happy
marriage, Toledo intoned, Paus is going to have to find his wide
receivers. Preferably as soon as Saturday, when the Bruins host
Fresno State at the Rose Bowl in a final tuneup before tackling
their Pacific-10 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to to get the ball down the field to the guys who
are our playmakers,'' Toledo said during his weekly press
conference. ``That's got to be a point of emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   If the offense hasn't exactly been purring like a Porsche, it's
because neither Paus nor Bennett has shifted Freddie Mitchell or
Brian Poli-Dixon out of first gear. Too, Danny Farmer has been
clunking along on one bad tire.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Rolls-Royce of receiving corps has a total of 17
catches. The Bruins' tight ends and running backs have combined for
20 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a marvelous playmaker, has as many completed passes
(one) as he does receptions.
</P>
<P>
   In their hunger to succeed, Paus and Bennett have been settling
for hamburger instead of holding out for prime rib. They've been
choosing the expedient option over the excellent one. It doesn't
take a football connoisseur to understand why. That which is
well-done takes time to perfect. It's no easy thing to remain
patient when opposing linebackers are coming at you as though you
were a T-bone steak.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a new quarterback the Bruins have thrown on the
barbecue; they have three new offensive linemen, too. Until
everybody gets his directions straight, the veteran receivers are
apt to feel disconnected. They're out there and open, yet out of
reach, like remote islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, for one, is far too hale and hyper to live in such
isolation. He has only one reception in two games, and no amount of
trick plays _ in which he seemingly pulls the football out of the
quarterback or running back's ear _ can make him forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was frustrating,'' Mitchell said. ``It hurts, but
you just have to go with the flow. The first year, I remember I had
jitters too. It's especially hard for Drew and Cory, trying to fill
Cade's shoes. It took Cade until his junior and senior seasons to
get as good as he was. That's why I don't feel it's in my best
interests to say to them, `You need to get me the ball.' They're
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying is one thing, succeeding something else. During the loss
at Ohio State Mitchell had so much space around him it looked like
he was flying first class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was open,'' he sighed.
</P>
<P>
   But not many balls came close to penetrating his air space.
After the game someone asked Mitchell who he would pick to start at
quarterback. The redshirt sophomore demurred. He was not the best
judge of passers, he explained, given how few passes he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   His words read all wrong in the papers the next morning.
Mitchell was so mortified he has been bending over backward to make
amends. Who would have thought his apologies could be as acrobatic
as one of his signature catches?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to sound like I was whining,'' Mitchell said
Monday in an unsolicited soliloquy. ``I don't think I'm a selfish
player. It really kills me that people might be thinking that.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo didn't take offense. In fact, he considered it a grand,
grown-up gesture when Mitchell came knocking on his office door
first thing Monday morning, groveling for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, Freddie's right,'' Toledo said. ``I respect that
he wants the ball. He should get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo allowed himself a chuckle. ``He just shouldn't be telling
anybody he should.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, selfish is an ill-fitting adjective for Mitchell,
who fractured his right leg last year while returning a kickoff in
the first quarter of the Bruins' second game. If he was looking out
for No. 1, would Mitchell have been so eager to grace special teams
or get back in the lineup to play in UCLA's Rose Bowl loss to
Wisconsin?
</P>
<P>
   We think not.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment what's best for Mitchell _ even if friends
can't seem to; they keep telling him HE ought to be the next UCLA
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The honest truth is it's in the best interest of the Bruins to
get Mitchell, Poli-Dixon and Farmer the football.
</P>
<P>
   With Cory, Toledo obviously feels it's Paus-ible. &QL;

BLUE JAYS NIP YANKEES, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Mirror-shaking loud music had not been heard in the
New York Yankees' clubhouse since the departure of David Wells, but
on Monday afternoon, one of the Yankees turned up the stereo to
play ``Let's Go Crazy,'' a song built on the screams of an electric
guitar, the lyrics and beat meant to increase adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happened that Wells pitched against the Yankees on
Monday night, and assuming he could have heard the tunes, they
inspired him a lot more than the Yankees, who may soon need an
adrenaline injection. Wells held the Yankees to four hits and the
Blue Jays hung on to win, 2-1, the fourth consecutive defeat for
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, coming off its three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium, lost
to Cleveland on Monday night and the Yankees' lead in the American
League East remains at three and a half games, but far more
alarming is the diminishing gap between the Yankees and Oakland,
the team with the fifth-best record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics (80-64) are five and a half games behind the
Yankees (85-58), and there is a remote danger that the Yankees will
be knocked out of the playoffs altogether _ especially because the
Yankees must play the Blue Jays twice more here before facing the
Indians in a four-game series that begins Thursday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees Manager Joe Torre remained as calm as usual after Monday
night's loss, deflecting a question about his team's spiraling
fortunes by saying that it would not be right to overlook Wells'
stunning outing; the larger-than-life left-hander, who is even
larger now, walked two, struck out two and dominated the Yankees
with a mixture of fastballs and off-speed pitches. ``Let's not take
any credit away from the Boomer,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees, the patient and calm machine that dismantled
opponents last season with a wrecking-ball impact, are coming
undone in bits and strands. Paul O'Neill and Tino Martinez, who
usually make up two-thirds of the middle of the Yankees' lineup,
were out of the batting order on Monday night because they have not
hit left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   The middle of the order has not generated consistent run
production, so in recent days the swing of the leadoff batter,
Chuck Knoblauch, has got much longer; he is back to hitting fly
balls, a bad habit for someone who thrives on line drives. Chili
Davis, the Yankees' designated hitter, felt compelled to swing at a
3-ball, 0-strike pitch in Sunday's game, even though he was leading
off an inning.
</P>
<P>
   No one is struggling more than Bernie Williams, who went 0 for 4
on Monday night, hitting into a double play in the ninth inning.
Williams has just three extra-base hits in his last 25 games, and
his swing these days is terrible, perhaps a result of his sore left
shoulder. ``There's no question that he's fighting it right now,''
Torre said. ``He feels like he's letting people down.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' feelings are common in the Yankees' clubhouse these
days. Players are sensing that there is more of a load to be
shared, so they try to do more and ultimately wind up contributing
less. During batting practice on Monday, Torre strolled around the
field, chatting with Martinez and others, trading idle laughs.
Torre wants the players to feel confident and make them understand
he has confidence in them. He has not changed the lineup
dramatically; he has not benched anybody or changed his approach or
handling of them.
</P>
<P>
   Such faith is a good thing, David Cone said before the game. But
the Yankees must do a better job of executing, he continued. They
must advance runners, perform better at those crossroads each game
presents, such as first and second and nobody out in the sixth
inning, with the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees didn't really have a chance to execute offensively
on Monday night. Wells held them to a single hit over the first
seven innings, and while Orlando Hernandez pitched an ``inspiring''
game, to use Torre's word, the Yankees just never hit.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took a 1-0 lead in the second inning and added a run on
Vernon Wells' first career home run in the sixth. Chad Curtis
singled home Jorge Posada in the top of the eighth, but Wells
closed out the Yankees in the ninth, Davis grounding to third for
the final out.

MESA MISFIRE CAPS COMEDY OF ERRORS FOR MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For a series that was truly a comedy of errors,
Mariners manager Lou Piniella had an appropriate punch line after
Monday night's 5-4, 10-inning loss to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a one-hopper,'' Piniella said of Jeff Conine's decisive
comebacker. ``When he hit it, I thought we were out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were.''
</P>
<P>
   They were, but not the way Piniella or any of the fans at Camden
Yards expected. Closer Jose Mesa gathered the ball, took a moment
to gather himself, then attempted a throw to second to start an
inning-ending double play. But the throw had all the precision of
an alley-oop pass tossed over the backboard, and it landed in
center field as B.J. Surhoff raced home from second with the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The error capped a series in which the also-ran Orioles, playing
their best baseball of the season, allowed the Mariners no room for
mistakes. Seattle needed that room, making crucial errors in the
first two games and losing a ball in the sun in the third game even
before Mesa's miscue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 'em breaks and make mistakes and lose,'' said Piniella,
who missed Sunday's game to attend the funeral of former teammate
Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter. ``I didn't see yesterday's game, but the
three I saw were all carbon copies.''
</P>
<P>
   An off day and three losses meant Mesa (2-6) was fresh Monday.
He worked the eighth inning with the Mariners trailing, 4-2, and
after David Bell's two-run homer in the ninth tied the score, Mesa
stayed in and worked another scoreless inning.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff started the tenth with a single, and Albert Belle nearly
ended the game on a deep fly that Raul Ibanez caught at the wall in
right-center. An intentional walk to Cal Ripken set up a
double-play situation with Conine hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa fielded the grounder cleanly but, throwing from the slope
on the front of the mound, lobbed his toss over the head of second
baseman David Bell. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tougher play than most people think,'' Bell said.
``For a closer, that's probably the first time he's had to make a
play like that all year. I remember four or five comebackers to
him, and he's gone to the plate on every one because the bases were
loaded. It's not as easy as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing 95 (miles per hour) to the plate, and then to
get a ball with his arm speed at that rate, it's tough to slow
yourself down. There's no way to simulate a play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a game like so many the Mariners have played this
year, in which they came back on offense but were not rewarded with
a victory. The M's had trailed since the second inning until Bell
connected with one out in the ninth, tying the score 4-4 and giving
former Mariner Mike Timlin his ninth blown save of the year. The
home run was Bell's 19th, extending his career high.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson gave the M's their first run with a single in the
second, and Russ Davis ripped his career-high 21st home run in the
seventh, a solo shot that was one of three hits on the night. The
homer brought the Mariners within a run at 3-2, but Charles Johnson
doubled in a run in the bottom of the inning to give Baltimore a
4-2 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's double drove Gil Meche from the game after 61/3
innings. Meche allowed four runs on five hits, walking four and
striking out one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had good stuff tonight, but, again, I wasn't
throwing my off-speed pitches for strikes,'' the rookie
right-hander said. ``Any major league team, once they realize that,
they're going to sit on your fastball. That's why I wasn't putting
people away _ I had a real good fastball tonight but I couldn't use
it to my advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times when I really needed to get an out, it seemed like I
walked a guy or lost focus a little bit. With the stuff I had
tonight, there's no reason to walk four guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Meche's walks scored, and at least one of the Orioles'
could have. Ibanez walked to lead off the Mariner eighth, and a
walk and a single loaded the bases with two outs for pinch-hitter
Tom Lampkin. Facing Scott Kamieniecki, Lampkin took a 3-and-2 pitch
that seemed high and outside. But umpire Bill Welke _ who two
batters earlier had inexplicably called a foul ball on a pitch that
was nowhere near Edgar Martinez's bat _ called the pitch strike
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the world knows I'm up there swinging the bat,''
Lampkin said. ``It's not like we're tricking anybody by sending me
up there. It was a ball. There's nothing else to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's nothing else to say about this lost, long weekend in
Baltimore, except that it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' Piniella sighed. ``Let's hope things are better in
Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't get much worse.

IT'S PAUS OVER BENNETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's quarterback platoon is dead and the Cory
Paus era has begun. It looks a lot like the start of the Cade
McNown era.
</P>
<P>
   Paus, a redshirt freshman, was named the Bruins' starting
quarterback Monday by coach Bob Toledo after a two-game competition
with junior Drew Bennett. Paus will take 80 percent of the snaps in
practice and he will start the Fresno State game Saturday and every
game beyond _ unless he gets hurt or fails miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine months after it began, UCLA's quarterback quandary
has been cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's best to go with Cory,'' Toledo said. ``If he
makes mistakes, it's not over. I'm not going to have a quick
trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus and Bennett were disappointed with their performances at
Ohio State and awoke Monday figuring the platoon would last another
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd have at least another game to square off,''
Bennett said. ``I'm very disappointed and a little embarrassed. It
was mine to lose and I lost it. It's nobody's fault but mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus, from New Lenox, Ill., took the news with mixed emotions.
He and Bennett have become close friends in recent months and they
are roommates on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it hadn't come down to deciding between myself and
Drew,'' Paus said. ``I wanted to do backflips, but I felt bad. He
told me, `Congratulations.' He handled it awesome. I was worried
how he was going to react and he's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo often has compared Paus to a young McNown, who outplayed
several veterans to win the starting job early in his freshman
season.
</P>
<P>
   Like McNown, Paus has natural leadership qualities, a knack for
big plays and plenty to learn. Just as McNown struggled as a
freshman and sophomore, the Bruins expect Paus to make mistakes. He
made a slew of them Saturday, completing just 8 of 20 passes and
throwing an interception. But because he redshirted last season,
Paus is more advanced at this stage than McNown, who played three
months after graduating from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cory's a lot like Cade, in my opinion,'' Toledo said. ``He's
going to make some mistakes. He just needs to settle down. Also,
eventually he'll give us some leadership and the players respect
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus won the job because he throws better than Bennett. His
spiral is tighter. His passes are crisper, easier to catch and more
accurate. (He had a higher completion percentage in training camp.)
Bennett's passes tend to flutter, sometimes wildly, and his arm
isn't as strong.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's performance against Ohio State was also a factor. The
bizarre first-quarter touchdown to Matt Stanley was a bad pass that
should have been intercepted. He threw an interception and lost a
fumble in the third quarter when UCLA had a chance to reclaim the
lead. He also missed several open receivers, and completing passes
to Freddie Mitchell, Danny Farmer and Brian Poli-Dixon is crucial
to UCLA's aerial attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Drew helped his cause much,'' Toledo said of the
Ohio State game.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches spent several hours on Sunday reviewing game film
and discussing the quarterback situation. Monday morning, Toledo
and offensive coordinator Al Borges agreed on Paus and presented
their plan to the offensive staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unanimous,'' Toledo said. ``Cory throws the ball real
well. He throws it better than Cade did at this stage. He just has
to learn, but he can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is one of UCLA's best athletes and asked about moving to
receiver or playing defensive back _ anything to get on the field.
But Toledo wants a well-prepared backup and declined Bennett's
offer, at least for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little confused right now,'' Bennett said. ``Coach
Toledo told me to stay ready. I'm still one ankle (injury) away
(from playing). But I'm really embarrassed. I didn't even let this
be an option in my head and here it is.''

A LEAK FROM STARR'S OFFICE WAS NOT ILLEGAL, COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd and 3rd grafs to specify nature of charges against
Starr's office) (ms) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court ruled Monday that there was
nothing illegal in discussions by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, or his aides with reporters about deliberations over
whether to indict President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous three-judge panel reversed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson that the independent
counsel's office had leaked secret grand jury information. The
judges told her to rescind her order directing the Justice
Department to investigate Starr's office and his former spokesman
on possible criminal contempt charges over an article that appeared
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling disclosed that Johnson had, last July, secretly
ordered the department to conduct what would have been the first
criminal investigation of the Office of the Independent Counsel and
its former spokesman, Charles Bakaly, who was forced to resign last
March over his role in the Times article.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel said Johnson erred by adopting an overly broad
definition of the kind of grand jury information that prosecutors
may not discuss with reporters. The judges said that any leaks by
Starr's office or Bakaly that may have contributed to the article
were not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported in January that Starr had concluded that he
had the constitutional authority to seek a grand jury indictment of
Clinton before he leaves office in January 2001. The article said
Starr had not made a final decision to do so but his conclusion
that he had the authority to indict a sitting president followed an
intense discussion in the office of the independent counsel. The
article's assertions were attributed to ``several associates of Mr.
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling provides what appears to be a fresh and
expansive definition of what prosecutors may discuss publicly and
with reporters. It came in response to an appeal of Johnson's order
that was brought not only by Starr and Bakaly but also by the
Justice Department itself. The department was concerned that its
hundreds of federal prosecutors could be liable for their regular
discussions with reporters about criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a law that prohibits prosecutors from publicly
discussing ``matters occurring before the grand jury,'' a phrase
contained in Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court ruled Monday that ``internal deliberations
of prosecutors that do not directly reveal grand jury proceedings
are not Rule 6(e) material.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lawyer, David Kendall, had argued before Johnson
that Starr and his associates were engaging in a purposeful and
illegal campaign to leak damaging information about the president
to aid their investigation. Starr had responded that any
discussions he and his aides held with reporters did not disclose
6(e) material and were therefore permissible.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said Monday he strongly disagreed with the appeals court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the decision of the panel is inconsistent with
the precedents of the Court of Appeals,'' he said. Kendall said
that he will seek to have Monday's ruling reconsidered by the full
appeals court, a procedure the court employs in a small number of
extraordinary cases.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, a setback for the president, was a victory for Starr
and a more limited one for Bakaly. According to the opinion, Bakaly
filed a declaration that in his discussions with the reporter from
the Times, Don Van Natta Jr., he ``refused to confirm or comment on
what Judge Starr or the Office of Independent Counsel was thinking
or doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Starr ordered an investigation by the FBI of any
leaks even if they were not illegal. After that investigation,
Starr's office withdrew its earlier assertion that it was not the
source of any information in the Times article. Bakaly resigned
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at the Times have said that they do not and will not
discuss the sources for the article.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was unclear how the appeals court ruling would affect an
earlier decision by Johnson in which she held that 24 other news
articles and broadcasts appeared on their face to show that
prosecutors in Starr's office had leaked grand jury material.
</P>
<P>
   Those 24 news accounts include articles from the Times as well
as Newsweek, Brill's Content, The Washington Post and The Boston
Globe and broadcasts from ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in a ruling last Oct. 30 said the articles demonstrated
``serious and repetitive'' violations of the law against disclosing
grand jury secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office has appealed Johnson's ruling on the other
articles. The case has not yet been decided on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Times article concerning Clinton's possible
indictment by Starr's office, three appeals court judges, Patricia
M. Wald, Laurence Silberman and Karen LeCraft Henderson, ruled in
their unsigned opinion that the appeals court had never meant that
a ``veil of secrecy be drawn over all matters occurring in the
world that happens to be investigated by a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said prosecutors' statements about their
investigations are only a problem when ``they directly reveal grand
jury matters.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
A decade passed between the Astros' last two 20-game winners. Now,
they have two in three days.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Hampton joined the 20-win fraternity Monday night as the
Astros won their club-record 11th straight 13-2 over the
Philadelphia Phillies before a crowd of 44,399 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros remained three games ahead of second-place Cincinnati
in the National League Central. The Reds have won 10 of their last
11 to remain close to the division lead _ but have failed to gain
any ground since Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise that could boast of only five 20-game winners in
37 previous seasons has added two to the club since Saturday.
Hampton (20-3) followed teammate Jose Lima (20-7), who earned his
20th win Saturday against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only NL pitchers to reach 20 wins this season. And
like so many of his previous 19 wins, Hampton's conquest Monday was
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched. He hit. The Astros won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hampton has had a fabulous year and has a chance to make it
even better,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``He did it in his own
style, getting the double play when he got in trouble, helped with
his bat and running the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton held the Phillies to six hits and two runs and struck
out six over seven innings to extend his personal winning streak to
11 games, longest in the majors this season, and chipped in an RBI
single in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The last time teammates won 20 in the same season was in 1993,
when Atlanta's Greg Maddux (20-10) and Tom Glavine (22-6) did it,
as did San Francisco's John Burkett (22-7) and Bill Swift (21-8).
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who tipped his hat to a standing ovation following the
game and blew kisses to wife, Kautia, and oldest child, Gage, said
he never puts any preseason expectations on himself for victories.
Instead, he aims at reaching 200 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never try to set too many goals,'' Hampton said. ``I always
want to pitch at least 200 innings, because by doing that you're
pitching late in the game and giving the team a chance to win. This
has been my most consistent year, and that's what you shoot for _
consistency. So far I've been able to do that, and I want it to
continue for another two months.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies custom-delivered the Astros' latest victory with 11
walks, three hit batters and two errors, which resulted in eight
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are too good to get that much help,'' said Phillies
manager Terry Francona, whose club has dropped 10 straight games
and 17 of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Tied 1-1, the Astros took the lead for good with two runs in the
third. Bill Spiers led off with a double, and Jeff Bagwell was hit
by a pitch by Phillies starter Joe Grahe (0-3). Carl Everett drove
in a run when Ron Gant misplayed a ball near the left-field warning
track for an error, and Ken Caminiti followed with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored at least one run in every inning except the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took advantage of the Phillies' wildness,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio's major-league-leading 54th double in the fourth
inning drove in a run, and Hampton added a run-scoring single in
the fifth. For the season, Hampton is hitting .288 with nine RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past eight days, the Astros have outscored the Phillies
39-16 in five games. Hampton has been the beneficiary of 23 of
those runs.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a first-inning run, Hampton was in virtual
control. When it seemed the Phillies might make a move in the early
innings, Hampton relied on his defense to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton induced three double-play grounders, including one in
the seventh after the Phillies opened with two singles.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have lost only four of Hampton's 30 starts this
season. ``His last five or six starts, he has been untouchable,''
catcher Tony Eusebio said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton passed around cups of champagne to teammates after the
game and plans to send the game ball to his father, Mike Sr., in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very special, actually remarkable, how the whole team
has stepped it up, from Shane (Reynolds) to the bullpen,'' Hampton
said. ``Everybody has been consistent at times when we need it.''

L.A. CITY COUNCIL MAY LEAVE DODGERS, LAKERS BLOWING IN THE WIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles city officials said on Monday they had
made a mistake in letting the ABC network hang street-pole banners
for its fall TV season.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Los Angeles City Council is scheduled to consider
limiting street banners to only those publicizing community,
charitable or nonprofit events. The policy would ban banners for
the Dodgers, Lakers and any other for-profit business.
</P>
<P>
   That means no more banners every spring urging people to ``think
Dodger blue.'' Gone would be those for the MTA's bus service or the
Northridge Fashion Center farmers' market.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advertise a wholesome family product, and the fact we were
able to feature our players means we could entice people to come to
the games,'' said Dodgers Vice President Tommy Hawkins. ``That
creates jobs, entertainment taxes, parking taxes and other revenue
for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Char, director of marketing for the Northridge Fashion
Center was also upset about the possible policy change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand this,'' Char said. ``Right now, we just
advertise on the perimeter of our shopping center. We think most
people don't mind the banners. In fact, it's become an accepted
form of mass communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``By allowing them, it would give the city a guaranteed stream
of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with ABC did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The city waives permit fees for charitable and nonprofit
organizations and the banners have not generated enough money to
cover the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that it costs us about $1.6 million a year,'' said
Jim Washington, chief inspector of the city's street use inspection
division. The money covers putting up the banners and taking them
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're asking for is a clear city policy on what's allowed
and what isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the use of street poles for the colorful
banners developed this summer when the City Council allowed ABC to
hang its yellow and brown banners on about 1,000 poles. ABC paid
$46,000 to have the banners up for two months.
</P>
<P>
   While the City Council develops the new policy, it ordered a
two-month moratorium on all banners, which ends this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, no commercial advertising will be allowed
with the exception of corporate sponsors for charitable or
community events. And then, the corporate logos can only take up a
small portion of the banner.
</P>
<P>
   The city is also looking at changing how banners are approved.
</P>
<P>
   The current system provides for banner companies _ the two main
ones are AAA Banners in West Los Angeles and Gold's Graphics in
suburban Pacoima _ to take out the permits and put up the banners.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Furst, vice president of AAA Banners, said it shouldn't
have a major effect on his business but acknowledged he would like
to see a two-tiered approach where private firms pay a higher
permit fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proponents of any way we can get people's names out to
the public,'' Furst said. ``This is a big business. If this goes
through, you could see a 25 percent drop in the number of
banners.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan has not taken a formal position on the
matter but would be interested in seeing if the program could
generate revenue for the city without resulting in visual blight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people like the banners as long as they are done
tastefully,'' an aide said. ``The mayor doesn't see any reason to
stop those.''

BUMP IN THS ROAD FOR SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Road warriors for the past 10 days, the Red Sox
finally showed signs of hitting the wall Monday night in Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, they still had enough in reserve to offer a belated
challenge to the Cleveland Indians, who were served Tomokazu Ohka
by the fifth inning after driving Tim Wakefield from the mound but
were forced to hang on for an 11-7 win before a full house of
43,264.
</P>
<P>
   If the season ended today, these teams would be meeting in the
first round of the playoffs in a reprise of last year's October
matchup. That Division Series was won by the Indians, just as they
ended Boston's postseason flirtation in 1995, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, honored before the game for winning their fifth
straight AL Central Division title, are assured again of a place at
the postseason table, while the Sox could still have their chairs
pulled out from under them by the unsinkable Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   The A's won their fifth straight game Monday night, completing a
four-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and drawing within two
games of the Sox in the wild-card race with 18 games left. When the
Sox began this 13-day, 12-game excursion, they were two games ahead
of the A's. That hasn't changed, even though they've won 7 of 10,
with back-to-back outings by the Martinez brothers yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez will be starting Tuesday night in place of Pat
Rapp, who left the team for a third time to be with his wife,
Rebecca, who is going through a difficult pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland's playing some good baseball, too,'' rookie Trot Nixon
said. ``Sure, we're not too far behind the Yankees, but we're just
worried about going out and playing good baseball. We want to get
to the postseason, and we don't care how we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon drove in three runs with his 12th home run, a single, and
an infield out but berated himself afterward for not making a
better throw to the plate during the Indians' five-run fourth
inning, when David Justice's single came just before Richie Sexson
unloaded a three-run home run off Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make a better throw to the plate on (Kenny) Lofton, I
might have gotten Wakefield out of that jam, the way Tek (catcher
Jason Varitek) blocks the plate,'' Nixon said. ``Sexson comes up
and hits that home run. A better throw, and he doesn't get that
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Division-leading Yankees, meanwhile, fell to the
Toronto Blue Jays, but any designs the Sox have of overtaking the
Bombers went as flat as Wakefield's knuckleball Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield was clobbered for eight runs on nine hits and four
walks, including home runs by Lofton and Sexson, in his worst
outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched like (fermented compost), basically,'' Wakefield
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox rebounded with a four-run sixth, touched off by Nixon's
home run, but the Indians put it away with a three-spot in the
eighth, when ancient Harold Baines hit his first home run as an
Indian, a three-run blast into the tree nursery beyond the
center-field fence. Baines, a trading-deadline acquisition from
Baltimore, connected off Bryce Florie, who has been used almost as
seldom as Ohka.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, who had missed the last eight games and played just
twice since July 27 because of a strained hamstring and an
irritated sciatic nerve, celebrated his return by leading off the
first with a home run, just as Chuck Knoblauch of the Yankees had
given Bret Saberhagen a similar initiation a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But while Saberhagen closed down the Yankees thereafter, the
Indians were just getting started. Of the 24 batters who faced
Wakefield in the first four innings, 13 reached base.
</P>
<P>
   An infield hit and two walks loaded the bases after Lofton's
homer in the first, and a second run scored when Sexson hit into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, who had three hits, doubled home Jim Thome in the second
when the Indians left the bases loaded. Cleveland teed off again in
the fourth. That man Lofton singled home another run, as did
Justice, before Sexson unloaded his 428-foot home run.
</P>
<P>
   That was No. 30 for Sexson, two more than Thome but nine behind
Manny Ramirez, the major leagues' RBI leader (144) who sat out the
game with a sore right knee. Ramirez was hit by a pitch Saturday by
Jim Parque of the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very explosive ball club, as we all know,'' manager
Jimy Williams said. ``When you have people like Thome hitting
seventh and Baines hitting sixth, that tells you what kind of
lineup they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored in the second off Charles Nagy (of the Fairfield,
Conn., Nagys) when Varitek doubled and Nixon singled him home.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's home run in the sixth was followed by a double by Jose
Offerman and a two-out single by Nomar Garciaparra. Troy O'Leary
doubled home Offerman, and Mike Stanley followed with a two-run
single to make it 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   That was all for Nagy, but it was also all for the Sox' offense
until the ninth, when they scored twice against Paul Shuey. There
were two runners on base when pinch hitter Brian Daubach lined out
to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they're a good team,'' said Nixon, staring solemnly from
behind the glasses he wears when he's not playing. ``But they've
still got to put their jerseys on, hit the ball, and play defense.
We think we can play with anybody. We know we can play with
anybody.''

METS DEFEAT ROCKIES, 6-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The New York Mets and Bobby Valentine were stepping
gingerly toward uncharted territory _ their 89th victory of the
season, a number the Mets had not reached since 1990 and one
Valentine had never achieved as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   They would not make the move easily, but they eventually
defeated the Colorado Rockies, 6-5, to earn that victory and slip
in just one game behind Atlanta in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets grasped leads, then let them slip away, moved in front
with the help of a rare pinch-hit by Bobby Bonilla, only to stumble
again _ much the way the pennant race itself is going.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lapses were a result of fatigue _ the Mets had not
arrived from Los Angeles until 4 a.m. _ but one runner, Roger
Cedeno, was picked off first with the score tied to start the
eighth inning and another, Melvin Mora, was thrown out trying to
score from second with none out in the ninth by right fielder Larry
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won several games recently despite themselves,
doing just enough to win. And they did it again on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Darryl Hamilton at bat and the score tied, 5-5, in the
ninth with Mike Piazza on third, Colorado's Dave Veres threw a 1-2
pitch way inside, almost hitting Hamilton. The ball instead rolled
to the backstop. Piazza, who had advanced to third with sharp
base-running when Walker threw Mora out at the plate, came charging
home. He slid headfirst _ a move Valentine said he would prefer
never to see _ to score the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets had that milestone 89th victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good until we win 90,'' Valentine said. ``We have a
couple of long weeks left and I think we'll win more than 89. We
said we'll be better than we were last year. If you go by the
record, I guess it means we're better, but right now, that doesn't
mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Valentine, in summing up this game, also gave an identity
to the season. ``This is one of those games when we didn't
particularly take advantage of all our situations,'' he said. ``But
you make your own breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell was lucky he did not break something when he
punched his mitt so hard in frustration after taking a loss six
days ago that he bruised a knuckle. He was not available again
until Monday night, when heaving the rosin bag to the mound as if
he was at home, Wendell returned to stanch the Rockies' offense
after Pat Mahomes briefly faltered in the seventh and eighth
innings. Wendell got the victory and even made a cameo appearance
on the bases _ he did not reach base last season _ walking and
advancing to second when Rickey Henderson walked.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine left him in to bat and run the bases _ Wendell shunned
a jacket, fearing that if he was involved in a collision at the
plate, the catcher could get caught on the fabric _ not wanting to
waste Wendell's superb pitching effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was subconsciously conscious,'' Wendell said. ``I've pitched
some of my best games when I'm sick. When you're sick, your power
level goes down so you don't try to do too much. When you haven't
pitched in a while, you have too good stuff and you try to do too
much and you get tattooed. Tonight, I was just concerned with how
my finger felt.''
</P>
<P>
   It felt just fine, no doubt better than Rick Reed was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' coaching staff will meet Thursday to discuss what to
do with their six-man rotation. Reed, making his second start since
coming off the disabled list, once would have been a lock for a
spot. But Valentine sounded none too enthusiastic about Reed's
performance on Monday night in which he allowed four runs on nine
hits in six innings. Valentine thought Reed had left too many
pitches up in the strike zone _ including one that Walker, who went
4 for 5, lofted for a home run that would barely have reached the
warning track at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Reed was all right,'' Valentine said. ``He got too many
up tonight to say he's absolutely in the saddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed saw it differently. Saying he was annoyed by non-baseball
matters on his mind, Reed bit on his words to keep from saying
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know what I think,'' he said. ``I think I threw
the ball well, maybe a couple were up but that's it. I'm not even
going to start. I'll wind up saying something I don't want to say
and I'll regret it. I thought I had pretty good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had plenty of other good things to carry them through.
Bonilla, who had swung at the first pitch in all three of his
recent pinch-hitting appearances, this time waited for the second.
He had not had a hit since June 23 and had spent considerable time
on the disabled list. But in the seventh, batting for Reed, he
belted a line drive that just missed clearing the right-field wall
and wound up with a double. Henderson followed with a home run that
gave the Mets a 5-4 lead. Bonilla, who had put off some of the Mets
with his feud with Valentine, was greeted exuberantly in the dugout
when he was replaced by a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to get the knock and what was better was
everybody was there to greet me,'' Bonilla said. ``I've got guys
pulling for me and that made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of good feeling to spare.

ROTATION? IT WILL MAKE YOUR SPIN
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RYAN COLUMN-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ When you're sitting in the visiting dugout at Jacobs
Field, it's pretty hard to miss the scoreboard staring at you from
the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   So no one had to tell Jimy Williams that the irritating Oakland
A's had picked up a game on both the Red Sox and Yankees Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I use glasses to read, I guess I'm what you call
farsighted,'' reported the skipper. ``I can see the scoreboard. I
can even see that guy banging the drum.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for the Red Sox, those were happy bangs on John Adams's
famed kettle drum. The Indians had beaten the Red Sox, 11-7. The
Blue Jays, behind the spurned David Wells, had beaten the Yankees.
And the A's, now winners of five straight, had once again beaten
the Devil Rays. It almost felt as if that glorious weekend in the
Bronx had never happened. Forget the Yankees. The A's are just two
games behind the Red Sox, and they aren't going anywhere. They also
have a schedule that includes 10 games with Kansas City, Minnesota,
and Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh reality for the Red Sox is that they are the only
major league baseball team contending for anything that has
absolutely no semblance of an orderly pitching rotation.
Spahn/Sain/Pray For Rain? How about Pedro and Pray for Helpo?
</P>
<P>
   Guess who goes to the mound Tuesday night? Big brother, that's
who. Pat Rapp was supposed to pitch, but he's back in Louisiana
with his pregnant wife, and so Williams has little choice but to
entrust the game to the patched-up Ramon Martinez, who will be
coming off 11 days' rest, every one of which he probably needs.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't be wallowing in self-pity if he were placed in
Jimy's shoes? The answer, of course, is Jimy Williams himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go with the people we've got,'' he said after watching Tim
Wakefield get blasted for nine hits and eight earned runs in four
dreadful innings. ``No excuses. We're a team. Ramon will pitch
(tonight), and I feel all right. He can go pitch good.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, but you've got to laugh. The Mets' Bobby Valentine
has an orderly six-man rotation in place. Jimy's current rotation
really does consist of Pedro Martinez and Whoever Can Give Him Five
Innings. Rotation? He doesn't have Kent Mercker, who spent some
time Monday in the ever-present MRI tube, trying to find out what
ails his ribs, side, or whatever. He doesn't have Rapp, whose
bedridden wife is undergoing a very difficult pregnancy. He does
have Mark Portugal, who hasn't won since Aug. 4 and who, frankly,
scares you.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's got me, once every 25 days,'' reminded Bret
Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   And he has Tim Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we all know how valuable Wakefield has been to the staff,
not just this year but for the past five seasons. He can start. He
can relieve. No one else in baseball has started 15 games while
moonlighting in the bullpen long enough to rack up 14 saves.
</P>
<P>
   However . . .
</P>
<P>
   There are nights _ and Monday night was most certainly one of
them _ when a manager has to wish that Wakefield had decided on
some other way to make a living. When he is bad, he is really,
really, really bad. He got ahead of Kenny Lofton, 0 and 2, but
Lofton hit the next pitch over the right-field fence for his fifth
leadoff home run of the season. He walked two men as the Indians
pushed across another first-inning run. He walked the leadoff man
in the second, and he wound up scoring. He looked sharp in the
third, which was only a tease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when he got through the third he was gonna settle
in,'' observed Williams. ``Unfortunately, it just didn't work out.
It was just one of them nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Well put. Singles by Lofton, Roberto Alomar, and David Justice
produced another run in the fourth. That brought up Richie Sexson,
the best-kept 107-ribbie secret in baseball. The elongated left
fielder sent a non-knuckling knuckler to downtown Ashtabula.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can have a bad night, but when Wakefield is like this,
you almost have to go back to the microfilm to verify that the
months of May, June, July, and August really happened. It's been
said before, but it always bears repeating: What Tim Wakefield did
in going 14-1 to start his Red Sox career was the greatest
sustained spurt of knuckleball pitching that has ever been seen in
the history of the sport. It made no sense then, and it makes no
sense now. It is never, ever going to happen again, not by
Wakefield, and not by any other knuckleballer, alive or unborn.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield has since settled back into classic knuckleballer's
groove. He will always have his moments, but he will never inspire
true confidence. But he'll be out there as a Red Sox starter this
season, again and again and again. Williams has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   It's nights like this when you must step back and marvel at what
the Red Sox have done this season. Mike Hargrove did not have the
services of 144-RBI man Manny Ramirez, and yet he was able to write
out a lineup card on which the very dangerous Jim Thome was batting
seventh. For a DH he was able to call upon the wily Harold Baines,
the 40-year-old wonder who would put the game out of reach with his
25th home run, a monster three-run shot to straightaway center off
Bryce Florie in the eighth. When the playoffs do arrive, Thome will
be playing first base, which means that either Sexson, Justice (20
homers, 85 RBI), or Baines (25 homers, 95 RBIs) will not be in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   That's without even talking about the pitching. Hargrove has his
own worries (Jaret Wright, Doc Gooden, etc.) but he's still going
to have Bartolo Colon, Charles Nagy, and Dave Burba. Williams _ if
he can even get there _ will have Pedro Martinez and, um, er, ah .
. .

OFFENSE ANSWERS THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park lasted six innings, allowed four runs
and left with a one-run lead that was later increased to three runs
by the time reliever Alan Mills took the mound.
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest analysis, it's considered a success. Park, one
of the many poster boys for what hasn't transpired this season for
the Dodgers, was en route to his fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers beat Montreal 12-4 in the first of a three-game
series Monday at Dodger Stadium. The 12 runs is the most the
Dodgers have scored since Aug. 8. But apart from the win, much of
what's been wrong with Park for much of the season was on display.
</P>
<P>
   He got behind too often. He was hurt by errors but also appeared
to lose concentration at times. The Dodgers gave him a lead and he
gave it back.
</P>
<P>
   Park, hurt by the long ball since April, allowed two more
homers, the 28th and 29th of the season. He trails Ismael Valdes by
one for most allowed on the Dodgers and is tied for sixth in the
National League in homers allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Light-hitting Geoff Blum, who had a .220 average, gave the Expos
a 1-0 lead with a homer in the third. The second homer was more
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   It came from Vladimir Guerrero, who was down two strikes with
two outs and one on in the fifth. But rather than wasting a pitch
in the dirt, which Park did in striking out Guerrero with the bases
loaded in the third, he challenged Guerrero. A few seconds later
Guerrero was circling the bases with his 36th homer and the Expos
had a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Park's final pitching line was typical. He pitched six innings,
gave up eight hits and four runs. He threw 94 pitches and his ERA
rose .01 to 5.69.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, as in two of Park's previous four starts, the
Dodgers scored a bundle of runs to make him a winner. Though he
entered the game with three wins and a no-decision in his last four
starts, Park had a 5.09 ERA. That included a six-inning, six-walk
9-7 win against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also beat Chicago 8-6 during Park's run back to
.500. He improved to 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the offense that gave Park success, rather than his
pitching against a mediocre offensive club.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-fielder Raul Mondesi had four hits (two doubles)
and stole a pair of bases. Even in a tumultuous season in which his
average has lingered in the .240s for most of the summer, Mondesi
is one homer and one stolen base from the second 30-30 season in
Dodgers' history. Mondesi also owns the first record; he hit 30
homers and stole 32 bases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley hit his 23rd homer of the season, a line
drive into the right-field seats. That number is the most homers by
a Dodgers lefty since Darryl Strawberry hit 28 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's RBI-single in the fifth scored Gary Sheffield, who hit
a two-run homer in the third to tie the game 4-4. Mondesi then
stole second and Todd Hollandsworth scored without a throw on the
back end of a double steal to give the Dodgers a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Dan Smith (4-9) left after yielding five runs on
seven hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley increased the Dodgers' lead to 6-4 when he led off the
sixth with a homer against reliever Miguel Batista.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Alex Cora, whom Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
wants to look at so he knows where the slick-fielding infielder
fits into the picture, then atoned for a pair of errors with a
two-run double down the right field line as the Dodgers went ahead
8-4.

FINALLY, OSUNA MEETS TOMMY JOHN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Antonio Osuna wanted to pitch through his elbow
injury so he would have leverage when it came to his contract after
the season. The strategy backfired and now the injured Los Angeles
Dodgers right-hander doesn't have an elbow to lean on.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna finally gave into the pain Monday and agreed to have
``Tommy John'' surgery on his right elbow Thursday at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center. The 1{-hour procedure to replace a
partially torn ligament in his elbow will be done by Dodgers
physician Dr. Frank Jobe.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials insist Osuna will go through with the surgery
this time. He postponed the same surgery the first week of August.
Earlier in the season Osuna put off surgery to remove bone spurs
from his elbow, only to have it done a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe said the recovery time of the ``Tommy John'' surgery is one
year, which puts Osuna's 2000 season in serious jeopardy. It also
leaves Osuna without a contract after the season. The Dodgers hold
a pair of $1.5 million options for the next two seasons, but they
won't be exercised.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers must rehab Osuna, but they are under no financial
obligation to him next season. If they chose, they can sign him to
a contract, or Osuna can sign with another team. But finding
another team to take a pitcher for the last few weeks of the season
is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we'll deal with at the end of the season,''
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said of Osuna's contract
status.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna ticked off Dodgers management with his refusal to have the
surgery in early August. If he had done it then, he could have been
available for two months next season and raised his value. Now his
nine-year affiliation with the club could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna decided to the have the surgery after experiencing pain
following a rehab appearance Sunday for Class-A San Bernardino.
He's 0-0 with a 7.71 ERA in five games with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started hurting again,'' Jobe said. ``This is sort of what
we expected, but we had to do a rehab and try to let him pitch as
hard as he could. He came in and said, `I guess the time has come.'
It's about a year before you can pitch 95 mph in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Running on Hundley: Even though catcher Todd Hundley has
thrown better since being shut down for nine games in mid-June, the
results are only marginally better.
</P>
<P>
   Before spending time with bullpen coach Rick Dempsey to relearn
the mechanics of throwing, Hundley threw out seven of 60 would-be
base stealers (11.7 percent). Since the aggressive work schedule,
Hundley has thrown out nine of 58 (15.5 percent) of the runners
trying to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we need to improve the delivery time of the pitchers,''
Dempsey said. ``When it's 1.5, 1.6 (seconds) to the plate, it's
impossible for him to throw guys out. Todd's got to work in the
offseason and get his legs in shape. There's got to be a huge
improvement going into next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catchers have thrown out 18.2 percent of runners trying
to steal, well under the NL average of 29.4 percent. Hundley has
thrown out 13.6 percent, Paul LoDuca has caught 22.7 percent and
Angel Pena nailed 27.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Dodgers right-hander Mike Judd is most likely done for
the season because of tendinitis in his pitching shoulder. He was
3-1 with a 5.46 ERA in seven games but is expected to pitch in the
Arizona Fall League. . . . Dodgers minor-league field coordinator
Rick Sofield (Jupiter, Fla.) and Expos bench coach Luis Pujols
(Boynton Beach, Fla.) both went to their homes to help their
families evacuate because of Hurricane Floyd.

DOLPHINS BEAT BRONCOS, 38-21

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ This was supposed to be a night for the Denver
quarterbacks. John Elway would have his No. 7 retired during
halftime. Brian Griese, Elway's successor, would enter the National
Football League on a high note.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino was supposed to be old news. Wait, check that. Old
Man Marino and his bum legs were the best combination on the Mile
High field Monday night. Elway is gone, Griese is promising, but
Marino may still be king.
</P>
<P>
   Marino showed his highly accurate passing arm is still capable
of devastating a defense and thanks to some nifty running by Karim
Abdul-Jabbar and good special teams play, the Dolphins showed they
might be the team to beat in the American Football Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Miami beat Denver, 38-21, before a crowd of 75,623, ending the
defending Super Bowl champions' regular season 24-game home winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we lacked intensity,'' Denver linebacker Bill
Romanowski said. ``We just didn't execute. I thought Brian played
well, and basically we all let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   After Denver took a 7-0 lead, Miami scored the next 24 points.
The Dolphins took a 24-7 third-quarter lead after a J.J. Johnson
1-yard touchdown run. Denver scored on Ed McCaffrey's 11-yard
touchdown catch and was threatening to score again when it faced a
fourth down and one at the Miami 40-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Miami's defense came up with one of many big
plays. As Griese dropped back, linebacker Zach Thomas blitzed and
it happened so fast that Griese seemed to be caught by surprise.
Thomas crushed Griese and the Dolphins took possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried a lot of different things to confuse me,'' said
Griese. ``I'd like to think I held up pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami followed that sack with a four-yard touchdown pass from
Marino to wide receiver O.J. McDuffie that concluded a 55-yard,
eight-play drive and gave Miami a 31-14 lead with under 10 minutes
left. Again, Marino threw nothing but precision passes on the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins added their final score with 3 minutes 56 seconds
remaining after Griese was sacked by Thomas, and the defensive end
Jason Taylor picked up the loose ball and ran in from from the
four-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Denver tried to come back and Elway _ oops _ he retired. There
would be no Elway-led Broncos comeback this time.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, playing in his 17th season, passed for 215 yards and two
touchdowns. Griese was 24 of 40 for 270 yards and three touchdown
passes, all to McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell which was a bigger deal in Denver: the end
of one career or the virtual beginning of another. Elway had his
number retired in the team's hall of fame in what was a grand
halftime ceremony. The Broncos know how to throw a party.
</P>
<P>
   But what matters in the National Football League is the here and
now. Elway was officially gone and the Griese era was beginning. It
was the Bubby Brister era until Coach Mike Shanahan yanked the
carpet from under him in preseason and inserted Griese in the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to when he played at the University of Michigan,
Griese has always been cocky, and if he was nervous the last week
it did not show.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan showed confidence in his young quarterback by having
him throw on six of the first eight plays. Griese had a few drops
by receivers on his opening series, but each throw was a bullet as
he went 4 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   Griese could not have tossed a better ball than the one he threw
to McCaffrey, whose speed continues to be underestimated by
defensive backs. McCaffrey split safeties Brock Marion and Shawn
Wooden while running a seam route down the middle of the field. The
ball landed perfectly on his chest, and the Broncos were up 7-0 on
the 61-yard pass play less than four minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Griese also showed he could take a pounding. Many times after
just getting a pass off, he was smashed by a Miami player. Griese
would simply get up, dust himself off and walk back to the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   As smooth as Griese was, he still had problems moving the ball
consistently. That could indicate a big difference between Miami's
defense last season and this year. Last year, Miami was often
unable to get a crucial stop when needed. That was not the case
against Denver tonight as the Dolphins continually made big plays
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Marino set up both of Miami's first-half touchdowns. The first
was a 28-yard pass to McDuffie that set up a 1-yard run by
Abdul-Jabbar. The second was for 40 yards to speedster Tony Martin.
That play led to a 12-yard touchdown catch by the rookie fullback
Rob Konrad.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams also helped Miami. Denver's Jason Elam had a
44-yard field-goal attempt blocked by Lorenzo Bromell, and Terrell
Buckley returned it 43 yards. That set up the Dolphins' first
touchdown. Later, Miami's Greg Jeffries deflected Tom Rouen's punt
with 1:37 left, leading to Olindo Mare's 37-yard field goal and a
17-7 lead at halftime.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ On a night when John Elway's famous No. 7 was retired in
an elaborate halftime ceremony, the Denver Broncos lost the Mile
High magic he concocted for 16 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elway's close friend, Miami quarterback Dan Marino, guided the
Dolphins to a 38-21 victory over the Broncos, the two-time
defending Super Bowl champions, before a crowd of 75,623 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody let everybody down, and we didn't match the
intensity of last year,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``We
had a chance to take control early, but they didn't let us. Miami
was excellent in all three phases.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Dolphins ruin Elway's induction into the
Broncos' Ring of Fame, they spoiled second-year quarterback Brian
Griese's starting debut.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be inaccurate to blame this defeat on Griese, whose
father, Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese, was
watching from a luxury suite. Brian Griese completed 24 of 40
passes for 270 yards and three touchdowns, all to Ed McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that we lost, and I'm disappointed in the way
we played,'' Griese said. ``There are some things I could have done
to help us, but I know that I left it all on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami's got a great defense. They blitzed from all over the
field, but everyone in the building knew they were going to do
that. We had a game plan for it, but we just didn't have enough for
them tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan knew it wasn't Griese's fault the Broncos dropped too
many passes, committed too many penalties and got dominated up
front on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody had played like Brian, there's no question, we
would have won the game,'' Shanahan said. ``They threw everything
at him, but he kept his poise and showed a lot of composure. I
thought he ran our offense very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins dominated the Broncos' offensive line and kept
running back Terrell Davis under control for the most part. Mainly,
they kept Davis out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a great scheme,'' said Davis, who was limited to 61
yards on 19 carries. ``They were aggressive up front. Their
linebackers filled the gaps, and the secondary forced the run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were so good, nothing short of tear gas and mounted
police could have kept them from the decisive victory that ended
Denver's string of 24 consecutive regular-season victories at Mile
High Stadium. Miami thus protected the NFL record of 27 home wins
in a row set by the 1971-74 Dolphins at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's victory also avenged the Dolphins' loss to Denver in
last year's AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos looked like anything but a defending Super Bowl
champion. The Dolphins spotted them a 7-0 lead, then took advantage
of breakdowns by the Denver special teams to lead 17-7 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   On the first series of the game, the Broncos dropped two passes.
But on a third-down blitz, McCaffrey got behind safeties Brock
Marion and Shawn Wooden to catch a 67-yard touchdown pass from
Griese. Jason Elam added the extra point for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, the Broncos were driving from their
20 to the Dolphins' 24. After Davis rushed for nine yards on second
down, they faced third-and-one. Davis was stopped for a two-yard
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Denver was within field-goal range and about to boost the
lead to 10 points, but Dolphins defensive tackle Lorenzo Bromell
blocked Elam's 44-yard field-goal attempt, and cornerback Terrell
Buckley returned it 43 yards to the Denver 36.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, Dolphins halfback Karim Abdul-Jabbar scored on
a two-yard run, and Olindo Mare kicked the extra point. Rather than
Denver having a 10-0 lead, the score was 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Dolphins got the ball, they covered 80 yards
in seven plays. Marino was perfect on four passes for 64 yards,
including a 40-yarder to Tony Martin to the Denver 25.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Marino threw a short swing pass to rookie
fullback Rob Konrad, who had a wide-open path to the end zone
because of a mix-up in the Broncos' coverage. Konrad's 12-yard
touchdown gave the Dolphins a 14-7 lead with 3:02 left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins weren't done, either. Thanks to another bad play by
the Broncos' special teams, Miami got excellent field position.
</P>
<P>
   After McCaffrey let a long pass slip through his hands, Tom
Rouen's punt was deflected and ended up going 15 yards, giving the
Dolphins the ball at the Denver 43.
</P>
<P>
   With one second left before halftime, Miami had to settle for
Mare's 37-yard field goal and a 17-7 advantage at the break.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Dolphins picked up where they left
off. On their first possession, they shoved the ball down the
Broncos' throats. The key play was Marino's 25-yard pass to Martin.
Another 15 yards were tacked on when cornerback Ray Crockett hit
Martin out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   After Abdul-Jabbar's 11-yard run to the one-yard line, it took
Miami three plays to score. Rookie running back James Johnson
scored the touchdown to give the Dolphins a 24-7 lead with 10:02
left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up 24 unanswered points, the Broncos finally
responded. They drove 54 yards in 13 plays and scored their second
touchdown. On third-and-eight from the Miami 11, Griese thought
about running but pulled up and threw to McCaffrey in the end zone.
Elam's extra point left Denver behind 24-14 with 3:42 left in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos seemed to be getting some momentum when they had the
ball at midfield. But third-string tight end Byron Chamberlain
dropped a long pass down the right side. Then, on fourth-and-10,
Griese was sacked by blitzing linebacker Zach Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins capitalized when Marino threw a four-yard touchdown
pass to O.J. McDuffie, giving Miami a 31-14 lead with 9:31 left.
Marino finished 15-of-23 through the air for 215 yards and two
touchdowns, with no interceptions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A cloak of fear descended on Russia's capital Monday as
the second major explosion in four days demolished an apartment
building, killing at least 95 people as they slept.
</P>
<P>
   While no group claimed responsibility for the 5 a.m. blast,
Russian authorities insisted it was the work of Islamic militants
who had taken their war in the Caucasus to Russia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism has declared war on the Russian people,'' President
Boris Yeltsin said in a nationally televised address.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure anxious residents, Yeltsin ordered tightened
security at airports, nuclear power stations and other possible
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities vowed to check each of Moscow's 33,000 apartment
buildings, especially the storerooms and shops that are often
located on ground floors and in basements.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov announced that all visitors to Moscow would
have to submit to questioning and obtain new residency permits
within the next three days, a decree widely interpreted as directed
against people from the Caucasus, who are often treated with
suspicion by the authorities here.
</P>
<P>
   These measures, however, provided little comfort to the many
Muscovites who live in unguarded and poorly constructed flats _ and
who doubt the government's ability to protect them. Their sense of
vulnerability has mounted in the past month since fighting broke
out in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan, when thousands of
Islamic militants moved from Chechnya into Dagestan and vowed to
turn the Russian republic into an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya S. Saley, a psychotherapist who was counseling residents
near the blast site Monday, said Muscovites feel a new sense of
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people,'' Ms. Saley said, ``are simply afraid to go
back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning's explosion was an especially rude shock because
Moscow had been largely exempt from terrorism. Russians face many
hardships, but this is still a city in which random violence
against defenseless citizens had been rare. Then a mysterious blast
occurred late last month at the up-scale Manezh shopping center
near the Kremlin, killing one person and injuring about 40 more. It
was followed by an enormous explosion on Thursday, which leveled an
apartment complex in southern Moscow and killed 94.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in fact, was supposed to have been a somber day of
mourning for the victims of the Thursday bombing _ and for 64
people killed at yet another blast earlier this month at an
apartment complex in Dagestan for Russian officers in their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Muscovites awoke to wailing sirens and feverish rumors
about who might have been responsible for the blast and why.
</P>
<P>
   Vyacheslav Izmailov, an expert on Chechnya for the newspaper
Novaya Gazeta and a retired military officer, stoked the public's
anxiety by declaring that an informant had had alerted him that
Moscow would be the target of more terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings, he said, had been organized by Islamic militants
and set by a band of Chechen, Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Monday's bombing, authorities circulated the drawing
of a suspect with a Chechen sounding name _ Mukhit Laipanov _ who
they said had rented stores in the buildings blown up Monday and in
the one destroyed last week.
</P>
<P>
   But there also reports that this was the name of a man who had
died years ago and that the renter had used a phony internal
passport to disguise his identify.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, Luzhkov, the mayor, said that two suspects
had been detained. It was unclear, however, whether they were
merely local Caucasians who had been rounded up or whether the
announcement represented a major break in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord who is leading the rebel
offensive in Dagestan, insisted that he was not involved in the
blasts, spawning a new set of conspiracy theories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The building bombed Monday was located along Kashirskoye Shosse,
one of the main thoroughfares leading out of southern eastern
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 150 people are believed to have lived in the
structure, which was adjacent to a public school and a
kindergarten. Erected in 1958, the apartment block was made out of
brick.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddier than the pre-fabricated apartment house that was blown
up Thursday, the building had collapsed into a mound of cement,
metal and dust. Rescuers said the two dozen or so people that
survived appeared to have lived on the upper floors and ended up on
top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This explosion is a carbon copy of the previous one, with one
little difference,'' said Vadim Seryogin, the chief of the Central
Search and Rescue Service. ``There it was reinforced concrete. Here
it is brick.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge metal cranes hauled away the debris as a cold rain fell. A
few possessions _ books, a small icon _ were placed on a blanket in
a sea of mud.
</P>
<P>
   As with most tragedies, luck played a role. Mikhail Kuznetsov
and his family had stayed an extra day at their country cottage.
They learned their apartment house had been destroyed as they were
listening to the radio on their drive home.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechurin family was less fortunate. They had been at home
in their beds. One child survived but lost a leg. His siblings were
missing and his parents were reported to be among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   When the blast occurred teachers rushed to the school to try to
comfort the students. The children were quickly transferred to a
safer location and the school turned into an emergency headquarters
for police, soldiers, fireman and bomb-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling that we are living in a war zone,'' said
Valentina I. Petrova, a mathematics teacher at the school. ``The
only difference is that in Dagestan people know that there is a war
going on in their republic while for us this came like a bolt from
the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives prowled the corridors of the school, desperate for
information about family members who had lived in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya Ivanov, who was looking for information about her niece,
complained that Russia's enemies had taken advantage of the end of
totalitarian controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is to blame,'' Ms. Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Allocating blame appeared to be especially important for
Russia's politicians. Yevgeni Primakov, the former prime minister
and a potential candidate to succeed Yeltsin, complained that the
Yeltsin government was ``completely unprepared'' to deal with the
threat of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a political ally of Primakov, cautioned Yeltsin against
using the bombing as an excuse to declare a state of emergency and
delay elections.
</P>
<P>
   Less partisan voices observed that law enforcement authorities
had contributed to Russia's vulnerability to terrorism by
repeatedly assuring Muscovites that security forces had the
situation in the capital under control. The aim of such statements
had been to avoid panic but instead they had made many citizens
less vigilant than they should be, Izmailov said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the authorities reversed that stance by appealing
to the public for help. Russians, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said, must maintain special vigilance and ``take a careful look at
what is happening around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others reasoned philosophically that Russia, like other Western
countries, had finally been touched by the scourge of terrorism and
would have to prepare for a long fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Zadornov, a former finance minister, warned Monday night
that Russians should gird themselves for even more bombings, much
as the British had to contend with terrorism over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to live with it _ not for one year but for
10 or maybe 20,'' Zadornov said.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIKE Hampton was the starter, so you knew there would be a pitching
clinic at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   What you didn't know was that while Hampton did all the pitching
Monday night, Phillies pitchers were apparently more intent on
sending Astros sluggers to a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Stick and move, Astros. Stick and move.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were having some trouble throwing strikes,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said of Philly's pitchers. ``They couldn't
find the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, find lots of flesh and bone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in this season of Astrodome nostalgia and 35 years of
memories, you'd probably have to go back to Muhammad Ali-Ernie
Terrell to find another day when the old place saw anyone have to
stand there and take such a pummeling.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell got smacked in the biceps by Phillies starter Joe
Grahe, who came to Philadelphia this season by way of Scranton,
which also seemed to be how his errant pitches arrived at home
plate. By way of Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Grahe walked the first two batters he faced, then another in the
second inning, then gave up a couple of runs and hit Bagwell in the
third. By the end of the third, Grahe already had thrown 71 pitches
and was pulled because of a blister.
</P>
<P>
   We can only assume the blister was on his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Grahe's adventures were only the beginning of a miserable
night for Phillies pitchers. Altogether, five Phillies scattered
shrapnel in the general direction of the plate through eight
innings, sending Astros batters scurrying for cover and making this
13-2 hammering look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio was hit by a pitch in the seventh. Bagwell was hit
again, this time in the belt, also in the seventh. And there were
so many other near misses on the way to 11 walks by Philadelphia
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   One fastball sizzled under Tony Eusebio's chin. Another sent
Ricky Gutierrez sprawling. Another spun Carl Everett around.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much a batter's box the Astros were diving into
Monday night as much as it was a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter if 11 walks and three hit batsmen said it all
about why the Phillies lost this game, it also said something about
why Hampton might win the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies pitchers looked awful. Hampton made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies pitchers couldn't work their way out of trouble if you
gave them the keys to the cell. Hampton handcuffed Philadelphia's
bats all night when things were tight, three times forcing
inning-ending double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies pitchers showed just how difficult it is to pitch in
the big leagues, where batters crowd the plate and umpires shrink
the strike zone even more. Hampton showed just how refined and
polished an ace he has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won this game in his own style,'' Dierker said of Hampton,
``getting double plays, helping himself with the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton won this one by bearing down with runners in scoring
position, mixing speeds, nipping at the corners and keeping the
ball down.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most important thing was simply trying to keep the
Astros' franchise-record win streak alive. He called 20 wins
``special'' but said his spring goal was to pitch 200 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you (pitch 200 innings), it means you're keeping your team
in games, staying in the game,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   He drove to the Dome quietly and went through the opponent's
lineup in his head, as always. He put on his serious face, his eyes
burning holes in the catcher's mitt. He made the ball move, slide
and break in all the right ways.
</P>
<P>
   And then he celebrated quietly, as always. He smiled, stood in
front of the Astros' dugout and doffed his cap to the crowd only
after teammates encouraged him to do so. Later, he gathered
pitchers and catchers together in the Astros' weight room and
conducted a champagne toast out of Styrofoam cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll celebrate a little more at the end of the year,'' Hampton
said. ``That's when it will be real special.''
</P>
<P>
   At 20-3, it's already special for Hampton. A Cy Young Award is a
legitimate possibility, but he's thinking bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll trade the Cy Young for the World Series MVP,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the difference between Hampton and most other pitchers.
It was as clear as Monday night's pitching performances: Hampton
looks like he'll make a difference in the postseason. The Phillies
look like they can't wait for the offseason to start.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ It's over. We won. We won! No, check that. We probably
won.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday afternoon, the race for that 32nd NFL franchise
was, for all practical purposes, down to a single horse, the one
ridden by Houstonian Bob McNair. The three nags from the West Coast
left the league's swank inner sanctum on Park Avenue bound for the
nearest glue factory. There wasn't a single Mr. Ed among them,
either, including Ed Roski. All of the Los Angeles factions fled
for their waiting limos without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what could they say? Since March, when the NFL
conditionally chose LA over Houston for the final new branch office
in our lifetime, none of the groups has made an iota of progress
toward proving it can give the league what it wants _ a viable
venture housed in a palatial, revenue-spewing stadium paid for
mostly by public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Not Roski, the real estate mogul who was pushing for a revamped
Coliseum. Not Michael Ovitz, the Disney defector who proposed
setting up shop on an old dump site in Carson, no relation to
Johnny. And not Marvin Davis, the billionaire financier who has
land next to Hollywood Park in Inglewood but lacks a fire in his
belly for returning pro ball to LA.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who suspect Davis, represented in the building
Monday by his son, Gregg, is less a real candidate than a
dredged-up last-ditch hope for the NFL to salvage its Los Angeles
plans. He has the cash and the clout to do a deal, even at this
late date and with virtually no help from the city of Los Angeles
or the state of California, but it appears unlikely to happen.
Which leaves McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' he said, ``I don't object to a one-horse race.''
</P>
<P>
   The analogy is somewhat ill-timed, alas. McNair's real
thoroughbreds, the four-legged variety, had a rough afternoon in
the Garden State Handicap at Belmont Park on Sunday. So if you
believe in bad omens Just because McNair stands somewhere between
being the runaway leader in the clubhouse and the only player on
the course doesn't mean the NFL is dedicated to doing a deal with
him that works for him. ``Remember,'' he said, ``they don't have to
expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one teams does not an even number make, causing obvious
scheduling problems. San Diego had a bye Sunday before it had
played a game, something that hadn't happened in the NFL since the
time of the Decatur Staleys.
</P>
<P>
   But financially, expansion means an extra mouth to feed from the
TV revenues, and the 31 rich guys who are already chowing down at
the trough didn't get there by giving stuff away.
</P>
<P>
   It has already been established that McNair will have to pay
through the nose for the privilege of replacing Bud Adams in
Houston. The figures bandied about during what amounted to the
first official, exploratory negotiations were said by one
participant to be ``staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Staggering? Yeah, as in somewhere well north of the paltry $466
million Cleveland had to cough up to rejoin the party. And look
what the Browns' Al Lerner got for his bucks. He got a 43-0 licking
courtesy of the Steelers on Sunday night, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the NFL, Al.
</P>
<P>
   McNair admitted he watched the game. And he's still interested
in pursuing this? Amazingly, it didn't dim his enthusiasm in the
least. ``The town went crazy,'' McNair said. ``That was fun to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who really know McNair believe he will stay the course as
long as the NFL treats him fairly. Or, in his words, if ``they
negotiate in a businesslike manner and don't just start pulling
numbers out of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like $1 billion. Al Davis and a couple of his usurious
cronies actually think that should be the asking price. But then
Davis, who continues to believe he's a genius, lost touch with
reality years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only McNair can be sure where he'll draw the line. He doesn't
have to do anything here, either, no matter how badly he may want
to. It's clear he won't be easily deterred, and if he has to take
on a full complement of 24 minor partners _ the league's limit _ to
ease his personal burden, he will. He claims folks are lined up to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't be taken for a chump.
</P>
<P>
   McNair hopes the details can be hammered out by the Oct. 5-6
meetings in Atlanta and that his bid will go to a vote of the NFL's
full membership there. Chances are, however, the November confab in
Chicago is the best-case scenario for a resolution, and it may drag
into the March 2000 meetings, although commissioner Paul Tagliabue
is said to be tiring of the expansion question and wants it
resolved yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Since McNair intends to be up and running by the 2002 season,
comfortably ensconced in his new retractable-roof stadium, he's
anxious for a reply, but only one tethered to reality. Otherwise,
he'll take his horse and go home.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THIS is the way they would have us remember them: Emmitt Smith
slashing through holes, Michael Irvin pulling in balls from out of
the crowds inside the end zone, Troy Aikman confidently leading the
orchestra as if he were a Leonard Bernstein in shoulder pads and a
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   For a sun-splashed afternoon on another dramatic opening day of
the regular season in the NFL, we were all strapped into a time
machine and transported back to the days when the Cowboys' offense
was the hottest ride this side of Marty McFly's souped-up DeLorean.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 frantic minutes at the end of regulation and in one cool
bolt of inspiration and execution on third-and-two in overtime, you
could close your eyes and see piles of Dallas touchdowns and a
41-35 win over the hated Redskins and a road of promise that leads
all the way to Atlanta and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But when you open those eyes, what stares back at you in the
face is the harsh reality of a defensive effort on the outskirts of
the nation's capital that was as clueless as the Justice
Department. Which in the aftermath of a gripping comeback makes any
fantasy of long-range success, at this point, just that.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the glow of the three-touchdown fourth-quarter rally
was the ugly fact that the Cowboys were still pushed around to the
tune of 504 yards of total offense by a Washington team that has
not made the playoffs in the past six seasons and shows no
indication of being able to find its way with a map and a
flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins may have a new owner in computer-geek boy wonder
Daniel Snyder and a new name on their suburban stadium, but they
are still the very same team under former genius Norv Turner that
couldn't escape from a closet if you pointed at the doorknob.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be a younger, more active, somewhat improved
Cowboys defense from a year ago, yet it was bullied by Stephen
Davis for 109 yards and picked apart by quarterback Brad Johnson
for 382 yards on 20-for-33 passing.
</P>
<P>
   That means the toughest decision facing upcoming opponents is
this: Should we run or throw on the Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   The response from the chorus, of course, is that the Cowboys
were playing without regular starting cornerbacks Deion Sanders and
Kevin Smith and without their best defensive lineman in Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   However, that is not a situation that would appear to be
changing any time soon. Sanders was not at all up to going through
a full workout last week, and nobody knows whether the pain from
offseason surgery on a severe case of turf toe will allow him to be
anything close to his All-Pro best when he does make it back.
Smith's status is up in the air as well. Which means Cowboys fans
could be treated to a good deal more of Kevin Mathis and Charlie
Williams looking as helpless as a pair of turtles turned on their
backs in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And the word circulating around the NFL concerning Lett, who
again violated the league's substance-abuse policy, is that
commissioner Paul Tagliabue plans to keep him on the sidelines for
roughly eight games. Which means Alonzo Spellman, Chad Hennings and
the rest of the defensive front had better find a way to close the
holes and stop the run in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cowboys start to make too much out of this so-called
``character'' win in Week 1 of the long march, they have to
remember that the Redskins did just about everything except carry
them across the street at busy intersections to make the win
possible. Even before the Dan Turk-to-Matt Turk bad-snap-and-bobble
on the would-be winning field goal at the end of regulation, the
Redskins coughed up two fumbles inside the Dallas 10-yard line,
aborting drives that could have made the score look like one of
those old Nebraska-vs.-East Somebody State whuppings.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the Cowboys' 90-yard drive for the touchdown that tied
it at 35, they were helped along by the blundering Redskins, who
committed four penalties, three for jumping offside.
</P>
<P>
   What it all means is that if the Redskins were anybody but the
Redskins _ or maybe the expansionist Cleveland Browns _ then the
door to the triumphant comeback would have been slammed shut long
before the Cowboys ever got to stick a foot in it.
</P>
<P>
   If Norv's gang had taken care of business, the buzz surrounding
the Cowboys as they head into Week 2 against Atlanta would be less
about the supernatural fourth quarter and more about the miracle
it's going to take to prop up the defense.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it still should.

SAN FERNANDO VALLEY'S HOUSE, CONDO SALES HOT AS LAST YEAR'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The San Fernando Valley's real estate market
dodged summer's dog days during August as home sales kept pace with
last year's decade-best level and prices continued climbing, a
trade group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow closed last month on 1,487 houses and condominium homes,
only nine fewer than in August 1998, said a report from the
Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``While sales counts are flat, they are flat at high levels,''
said John Karevoll, an analyst at Acxiom/Dataquick, a market
research firm, who noted that a strong local economy continues to
help drive sales.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical, single-family houses accounted for most of the
Valley's action during August with sales of 1,131, a decline of 76
or 6.3 percent, on an annual basis. The median price of $212,000
was 8.7 percent higher than in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the smaller condominium market turned in an especially
robust performance as buyers looked for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   During August, sales of condos spiked up 23.2 percent to 356
units on an annual basis. And the median price climbed $5,500 to
$122,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first-time buyers' chief market,'' Beth Summer,
president of the Realtors group, said of the condominium market.
</P>
<P>
   Rising prices, slightly higher interest rates and a tight
inventory of single-family homes on the market is helping to fuel
condominium sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take all the forces coming together today, and that translates
into renewed emphasis on condominiums by first-time buyers,'' said
Jim Link, executive vice president of the Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers are also feeling pressure from a tight inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, there were 5,972 properties listed for sale
throughout the Valley, only 6 percent more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of pending escrows _ sales that
will close this month or next _ jumped 20 percent on an annual
basis. They also increased 1percent on a monthly basis, indicating
that a drop-off on sales is not likely for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Karevoll said that while interest rates have been
bouncing around a bit this summer the jumps have not been enough to
cool off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither sales counts nor prices are going up so fast that
there is danger on the horizon,'' he said.

SANDPIPER TO PROVIDE AOL WITH AUDIO, VIDEO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Sandpiper Networks is expected to
announce Tuesday that it has signed an agreement with America
Online to be the conduit for delivering audio and video broadcasts
to the service's 18 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the result of a relationship begun earlier this
year, when America Online was the largest investor in a $21.5
million round of venture funding for Sandpiper, based in Thousand
Oaks northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Yara, Sandpiper's vice president of marketing, said the
agreement is the latest in a series of deals in which Sandpiper
becomes the means for distributing content to large Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper also has alliances with Inktomi, RealNetworks and Sun
Microsystems, Yara said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper provides Internet sites with a network of servers that
duplicate content on multiple servers in order to speed access to
information, Yara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real key to getting true quality performance is to avoid
all of the net congestion that occurs,'' Yara said. ``To bring true
broadcast quality, you need to serve the content as close to the
edge of the media network as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper's Footprint service delivers streaming audio and video
to online customers. It allows for the live broadcasts of concerts
and other events, Yara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're effectively building the broadcast networks of the
Internet,'' Yara said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements with various content providers has created
explosive growth for the Thousand Oaks-based company, he said. It
has gone from 30 employees a year ago to about 90 now, with plans
to grow to 100 by the end of the year.

   `Big Cat' Williams dies after car accident &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By RICHARD DEAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ Cleveland ``Big Cat'' Williams, who fought world
heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali at the Astrodome in 1966 at the
pinnacle of his boxing career, has died from injuries sufferred in
an auto-pedestrian accident Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 66, who battled a kidney problem and diabetes for
years, died Friday afternoon at Ben Taub Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was crossing the 7300 block of Fannin from east to west
at 6:35 a.m. Sept. 3 when he was struck by a 1989 silver Nissan
Maxima, according to police reports. No charges were filed against
the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good man,'' Williams' son, Reuben, said of his
father. ``Loved people, loved children and loved to fish. And loved
the sport of boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben was the only child of Williams and his wife, Irene, whom
he married in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great man,'' said Irene Williams. ``Was loved by a
lot of people. Children and old people were his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Griffin, Ga., but raised in Houston, Williams was an
accomplished boxer who made a name for himself locally before
embarking on a professional career. In 1997, Williams was inducted
into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Commerce, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Williams reached the national spotlight in November 1966 with
his heavyweight fight against Ali. He lost to Ali in a three-round
knockout and was never a serious contender again.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider it a miracle that Williams had the opportunity to
fight Ali at all since Williams had been shot in the midsection by
a state trooper a year and a half earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On a dark night along a stretch of highway north of Houston,
Williams was stopped by a Texas state trooper for an alleged
violation. According to reports, words were exchanged, and moments
later Williams lay on the roadside wounded by a bullet from a .357.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had kidney problems as a result of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he was the champion before he got in the ring,''
Irene Williams said, referring to the Ali fight. ``That was a fight
we didn't think would ever happen. He fought Ali with one kidney
and only half of his intestines. He was the people's champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams fought professionally only a couple of more years after
the Ali fight, and then the boxer who fought Sonny Liston twice
called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, Williams underwent dialysis treatments at a
hospital in the Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was on his way back from dialysis that Williams was hit by
the automobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy we had to lose him,'' said Irene Williams.
``It's hard to take. The shooting couldn't take him. Diabetes. None
of that took him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services will be Friday from 7-9 p.m. at Eternal Rest
Funeral Home, 4610 S. Wayside at Loop 610 South. Burial will be
Saturday at 11 a.m. at Paradise North Cemetery, 9235 West
Montgomery Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was well-loved,'' said Reuben Williams. ``We've been
getting a lot of condolences. Daddy didn't have much money, but he
gave a lot to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial donations to help pay for funeral expenses can be made
to Eternal Rest Funeral Home.

WALK A MILE IN SIZE 11s 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's gotta be the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Raul Mondesi wore a pair of Gary Sheffield's
shoes and hit a pair of homers.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Sheffield on Monday, Mondesi slid on a pair of
Sheffield's size 11s, partially as a reminder to do the little
things. Mondesi promptly had four hits, two stolen bases and an RBI
in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 12-4 thrashing of Montreal at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That's the type of havoc the Dodgers hope Mondesi creates each
night. His talent matches or exceeds anyone's in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the last few months of a tumultuous season in which his
average has lingered in the .240s, Mondesi is one homer and one
stolen base from the second 30-30 season in Dodgers history.
Mondesi already owns the record; he hit 30 homers and stole 32
bases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him if he wore my shoes, he's going to get four hits
and he put on my shoes and got four hits,'' Sheffield said. ``It's
just a little reminder for him to do the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   The little things don't include swinging for the fences, which
is how Mondesi got into his horrendous post-May slump.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was the spikes. Mondesi usually wears metal
spikes. On the advice of Sheffield, he wore plastic against the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't try to hit the ball nine miles . . . this is
what I want from him,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``Hit
the ball up the middle, take the extra base. If he tries to be
(Sammy) Sosa or (Mark) McGwire, that's another story all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can hit the ball as hard as both of them, but they can't do
the things he can do. He should hit for a better average, stolen
bases, better defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Mondesi's tirade in mid-August, and even though there
have been disciplinary problems, Johnson has told people within the
organization that he likes Mondesi, both as a player and a person.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has taken the leadership role and tried to help
Mondesi through what has been a difficult month, has had increased
conversations with Mondesi about maturing as a ballplayer and not
taking everything to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player just on his ability,'' said Sheffield, who
moved from right to left field this season to suit Mondesi. ``He
can be a great player every day if he remembers to do the little
things. I think (the outburst) was a wake-up call. `Do you want to
be here?' Don't take everything personally, but take it and make
yourself better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mondy's is a great player and you hate to give up on a guy
that like. He's going to have one of those seasons where he's the
best player and has the best numbers in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Mondesi's second four-hit game of the season were a pair
of doubles. He scored on Devon White's single in the third to give
the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers trailing 4-3 in the fifth, Mondesi singled to
score Sheffield with the tying run. He then stole second and Todd
Hollandsworth stole home on the back end of a double-steal to give
the Dodgers a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It helped starter Chan Ho Park (10-10) win his fourth straight
despite allowing his 28th and 29th homers of the season in six
innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheff told me to wear them,'' Mondesi said. ``It's one of
those things to make me remember the little things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will Mondesi do today?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear them again,'' he said.

L.A.'S LONG BALL TO LEAGUE BOMBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three potential owners for a professional football
team in Los Angeles slipped out of NFL headquarters Monday
afternoon, and with them went virtually any chance the league will
put its 32nd franchise in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials said they were still intrigued with the stadium
site at Hollywood Park race track funded by billionaire Marvin
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Houston businessman Robert McNair who was beaming and
talkative as he emerged from a three-hour meeting with members of
the league's expansion committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind this being a one-horse race,'' said McNair, who
has engineered public and private funds, hoping to bring the NFL
back to Houston in 2002. ``I just don't see how Los Angeles can
come up with a new plan by Oct.5.''
</P>
<P>
   No decision is expected until then, when the league's 31 owners
are scheduled to meet in Atlanta. The committee will make its
recommendation and 24 votes are needed for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the deadline for Los Angeles to finalize its
ownership plan, but the league said it will not close the door
until Atlanta. There is a chance the vote will not be taken until
early November at an owners' meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now appears to be whether the NFL is using Los Angeles
as leverage to raise the price tag on an expansion team in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating competition?'' NFL spokesman Greg Aeillo said. ``It
might be. I don't know, you'll have to ask (McNair). Houston is not
a small town, it is a big city. We have a tough choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairmen Jerry Richardson of the Carolina Panthers and
Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots met separately Monday with
three groups representing Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Kraft will meet through a conference call with
the other 12 members of the expansion committee.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, whose original plan for a stadium in Carson was
shelved when the city swung its momentum toward remodeling the
Coliseum, left the NFL offices through a back exit and did not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The league said Ovitz wants to own a team, but is no longer
affiliated with either Carson or the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he will speak at some point,'' Aeillo said. ``But not
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Roski, who headed a group that wanted to combine the Coliseum
with the Staples Center to create a sports and entertainment
corridor downtown, also left without speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Aeillo said the league still is looking for ways to include Los
Angeles, the nation's second-largest media market, in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, however, dismissed the Coliseum on
Sunday, saying, ``Maybe it can get done in Carson or Hollywood
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Which left the Davis plan for Hollywood Park as perhaps the only
viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was represented Monday by his son Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably the most doable of the three sites,'' Aeillo
said. ``They have parking available, they have the land, and it
could be done more easily than the other two.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has led the
Coliseum fight, did not attend Monday's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   After the Los Angeles groups left, the expansion committee
members met with McNair, who claims he has $800million committed to
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked when we could be ready,'' McNair said. ``We said we
would like to start playing in 2002. I'm not saying this is a done
deal. But (L.A.) has a steep hill to climb.''

GORE WILL HIT THE GROUND RUNNING IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore heads to California this
week for a highly visible endorsement tour with the popular Gov.
Gray Davis. But even as the Democratic presidential hopeful tries
to showcase his strength in the nation's most populous state, he
must fight a growing perception that he is playing catch-up on his
most crucial battlefield.
<P>
   ``It is a dogfight,'' said political analyst Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe. ``It is now a battle joined _ and it's one Gore has to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's two-day trip, which begins Thursday, will culminate in a
state tour at the side of Democrat Davis _ who battered the GOP
last November with a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
   But his 59th visit to the state comes at a time when Republicans
claim that, compared with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Gore is thin
on endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has appeared to upstage the vice president on a few
other fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will travel to San Diego, Los Angeles, Fresno and San
Francisco on a trip that will include outreach to Latino business
groups and talk about education. Bush, for his part, hit California
two weeks ago to deliver a major policy address on education _ the
state's top issue _ to the Latin Business Association, representing
the state's most hotly contested voter group.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will return at the end of the month to collect checks from
supporters in Silicon Valley _ another group Gore has long
cultivated in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, it does look as though George W. is shaping
the political game plan here,'' said Bebitch Jeffe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Bill Bradley is breathing
down Gore's neck. That means ``Gore has got to pay attention to
California ... not only as part of the general election strategy,''
Bebitch Jeffe said, ``but to keep it in line for the laundry list
of the (March 2000) primary.''
</P>
<P>
   With six months to go before that crucial vote, Democratic
insiders and strategists for rival campaigns in the state say the
vice president's effort to win his party's nomination is entering a
critical phase. Among the tough questions he faces: Does he have
the stuff to make his case to state voters? Or is he too boring,
too battered by ``Clinton fatigue'' to win the primary?
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that Gore remains in a virtual dead heat with
Bush on the open primary ballot _ even though he isn't facing the
crowded field of competition from his own party that the Texas
governor does.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say those polls, though early, are harbingers of bad
times ahead for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has proven that Woody Allen was wrong: Ninety percent
of life isn't just showing up,'' said Dan Schnur, communications
director for GOP hopeful U.S. Sen. John McCain, who will cross
paths with Gore in California while promoting a new best-selling
memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The twin pillars of Bill Clinton's California support have
been the entertainment community and the high-tech industries,''
said Schnur, whose candidate hits Silicon Valley again next month.
``Both of those groups have pretty significant policy differences
with Gore, so they're taking a look at their other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran political strategists say that  &LR; Gore's fortunes in
Silicon Valley _ and beyond _ reflect a shift that has been
occurring for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back six months, what you saw (was) that he had
been here 54, 56 times. ... The presumption was that the state was
locked up,'' said Gale Kaufman, the Sacramento-based political
consultant who is now a strategist for Bradley's California
campaign. ``That was then; this is now. It's a very different set
of circumstances. He came as vice president. He's now a candidate
for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, however, insists the vice president's current
trip isn't about reacting to other candidates _ or other
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that are important to the working families of
California is what drives Al Gore's schedules,'' said Gore 2000
spokesman Roger Salazar Monday. ``He has fought for them throughout
his career, and the people of California know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent media reports may ``have an impact on the perception _
but only the insiders are paying attention right now,'' said Julie
Buckner, the former spokeswoman for the successful Clinton-Gore
statewide operation in 1996. ``The Gore operation here is taking
shape and moving forward. They're touching all the base groups,
they're raising the money. ... They have smart people on board, and
they will do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic insiders _ even longtime friends of Clinton's _
insist Gore can and will match the president's legendary ability to
connect with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched Al Gore hundreds of times ... and what is
frustrating for me is to hear people say he's not interesting and
doesn't have charisma,'' said Martha Whetstone, a college friend of
Clinton's and a major Democratic mover in San Francisco. ``I've
watched him give speeches equal to any Bill Clinton has given as
far as being exciting and generating enthusiasm. He's totally
capable of doing that. He's funny and personable. And it's the
biggest misconception about Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garry South, the Democratic adviser who masterminded the
victory of underdog Davis _ another candidate tagged as too boring
to win _ acknowledges a potentially bigger problem, what he calls
``a lack of traction'' in the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   South said that given the administration's strong economic
record in California _ and voters' positions here on such issues as
abortion and guns _ Gore has the credentials he needs against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tried to approach California as an underdog campaign
for the presidency ... small announcements with the vice
presidential seal hung on the podium,'' said South, who has
consulted for the Gore campaign. ``(Gore) has to approach it like
an underrated underdog. He has to adopt the mentality and fighting
posture of an underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   South insists that California voters _ whose winning campaign
for Davis cited his long government experience _ will balk at a
candidate, however magnetic, who is perceived as ``not ready for
prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is starting to sound a lot like William Jefferson
Clinton, parsing words,'' said South. ``He's a charming rogue _ but
that's what we have in the White House. Do we want a replay?''

 HOMELESS IS WHERE THE HEARTLESS IS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the heart of Richmond, Calif. _ if Richmond has a heart _ is
a big empty building.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the owners of the building offered it to the
city, free, as a temporary homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   And after months of effort by the owners, after volunteer
offers, bureaucratic red tape, bureaucratic red quicksand,
meetings, inspections, pleas and hopes _ it has happened.
</P>
<P>
   The empty building has been converted to ... an empty building.
</P>
<P>
   And just in time, since we're approaching the cold and flu and
freeze-to-death-in-the-gutter season.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the city of Richmond and Contra Costa County issued
a plea: Will anyone offer two-year use of a 3,000-square-foot
building for a temp homeless shelter for families, while permanent
shelters are being built? Please?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to believe,'' said Bruce Borjesson when I
told him of the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and his wife Theresa's building is 6,000 square feet, with
four bathrooms, and they offered it for three years.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to hang onto the building for about five years as
an investment but had no immediate plans for it. They were moved to
make their offer after hearing of a homeless woman and her three
kids being evicted from a Richmond church.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the saga, reported here a couple times, of the Little
Homeless Shelter That Couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the free building, the Borjessons had elicited
promises from local carpenters' and pipefitters' unions to do any
needed prep work and to pay for shelter insurance, and friends said
they'd pay utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Cost to county and city for a shelter: Fifty cents less than you
invested in this fine newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No dice.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Mayor Rosemary Corbin told me the building, according
to her city inspector, needed way too much work. When I asked if I
could see the inspection report, she said she'd never seen one, but
``The building inspector said it needed a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Mayor Corbin tell it, the building would never pass the
Big Bad Wolf Huff-Puff Test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county said (the Borjessons) weren't offering it for long
enough and there were too many strings attached,'' Corbin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Borjessons say: Three years, no strings.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad the Borjessons didn't decide to start a garden for
the homeless, because there's no shortage of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Contra Costa County Supe John Gioia, who comes across to me as a
guy interested in helping the homeless, toured the building and
told the Borjessons it would be fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Gioia says the plan stalled because he could never get a written
report or waiver from the Richmond building department, despite his
multiple requests.
</P>
<P>
   Gioia says a county official finally told him that Richmond was
nixing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our program,'' Mayor Corbin told me Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But it's her city, according to Gioia, that provided the final
roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the bouncing buck.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Borjesson was knocked out by the excitement and enthusiasm
from everyone who toured and inspected the building. He wonders
what happened. Nobody bothered to call and explain. His calls
weren't returned.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hears of the public plea for a building from the same
people who rejected his offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians and bureaucrats aren't going to let anything
happen,'' he says. ``They're not looking for (a building).''
</P>
<P>
   What are they looking for? Well, maybe votes. It looks
compassionate to say, ``Please, we need a shelter.'' It gives the
appearance that you care, maybe in lieu of actually caring.
</P>
<P>
   Also, that plea might help with government fund-raising, though
it's worth noting that a civil grand jury four months ago found
that in CC County, ``homeless officials were unable to provide a
mission statement or written report on how money and time were
spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hurdles, the building actually is a homeless
shelter. When it rains, folks often huddle in its doorways.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when Bruce sensed that his offer was being beaten
to death with a b.s. stick, he said to a couple county officials,
``The first time it gets real cold, what if I just unlock the doors
and people come in? Would you arrest me?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be rash, Bruce. You wouldn't want homeless people in an
unsafe building. Better they camp under freeway bridges, which we
know are 100 percent quakeproof, and in buildings that have been
abandoned because they're so darned safe and nice.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Homeless folks won't have to worry about having to
huddle inside the unsafe building at 332 Harbour Way in Richmond.
The Borjessons, jacked around for months, recently gave up.
</P>
<P>
   I called Bruce on Sunday when I read of the county's new plea,
asked if his building was still available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold it,'' he said. ``We got discouraged. I signed the
papers yesterday.''

 FINDINGS OFFER HOPE OF PREVENTING MEMORY LOSS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fading memory and a steady decline in mental agility have long
been considered hallmarks of aging. Now, brain experts claim to
have found the source of the cerebral cobwebs _ and how to clear
them out.
</P>
<P>
   A team of California researchers traced the phenomenon of
age-related cognitive loss to a small cluster of atrophied nerve
cells buried deep in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are located below the cerebral cortex, these
neurons rarely get much attention. But they make up the active
elements of a vital subcortical system that choreographs activity
throughout the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a series of laboratory experiments, scientists reported
Monday that the key brain cells seem to have plenty of firepower
left even after they appear to quit working. The results were
detailed in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hear this dogma that from the age of 20 we lose 10,000
neurons a day, but that's just not true,'' said lead researcher
Mark Tuszynski, a neuroscientist at the University of California at
San Diego. ``These cells are degenerating, they're dysfunctional,
but they're not dead. And the atrophy can be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   If your thoughts can be likened to jets landing and taking off
in your head, the subcortical system _ a tiny cluster of so-called
cholinergic neurons sandwiched between your ears _ would be the
air-traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   They send neurotransmitters into the cerebral cortex and to a
vital region for memory known as the hippocampus. By regulating
memory and attention, the cells enable the higher regions of the
brain to function smoothly. Extensive decline in the same area is
among the signs of Alzheimer's disease and of less pronounced forms
of age-related memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   The system provides a way to ``pay attention to the relevant
things and filter out the irrelevant things,'' Tuszynski explained.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments in aged rhesus monkeys housed at the University of
California at Davis produced evidence that these low-profile brain
cells can shrivel and eventually stop functioning with advancing
years. One possible reason appears to be loss of a protective
factor produced elsewhere in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies of age-associated mental decline turned up
little sign of neuron loss, although some preliminary studies in
rodents had implicated the same region Tusczynsi studied.
</P>
<P>
   The aged monkeys, however, showed a dramatic 43 percent loss in
the number of full-functioning subcortical neurons compared with
young monkeys. Even the cells that remained active were about 10
percent smaller than their youthful counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also were astonished to find that the inactive cells
could be brought back to full flower.
</P>
<P>
   In the monkeys, whose brains grow old in a process remarkably
similar to human aging, recovery was achieved by surgically
implanting cells that had been genetically modified to secrete a
rescue protein known as human nerve growth factor.
</P>
<P>
   About 92 percent of the target neurons in the treated animals
once again showed full production of neurotransmitters and other
vital brain-signaling substances. Cell size returned to within 3
percent of normal.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Tuszynski, the study authors included Jeff Roberts at
the UC Davis California Regional Primate Research Center and Fred
Gage at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Other leading brain experts said the experiments were
intriguing, but that it would take more study to prove just how the
activity in the subcortical system affects brain function and just
how big a role the system plays in human cognitive function.
</P>
<P>
   Even if further studies confirm that the aging process is
essentially the same in humans as in monkeys, the implications for
humans are ``not clear at all,'' said Ron McKay, a neuroscientist
at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an interesting finding that suggests a lot of the
stuff we know from rodent models can be applied in primates,'' he
said. ``It certainly should provoke some discussion about how this
is really going to matter to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers looking into aging and the brain have focused
on genetic approaches. McKay said the new study is part of ``an
important transition'' in the field, where the goal is to more
directly unmask anatomical changes linked to mental processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't want to say this is the answer in any sense, but
it does represent a new ability to focus on the problem in a
detailed way,'' McKay said. ``We're beginning to see our way
forward.''

<P>
   TIPS FOR TRAVELERS TO PUERTO RICO:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Air connections are good to Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport in San Juan, with American Airlines the
dominant carrier from the U.S. Delta, TWA and United also fly
there. Cruise ships also dock in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND: Puerto Rico is served by all the major
American car rental companies, which have desks at the
international airport. Rates are comparable to within the U.S.,
with a full-size car going for about $50 a day. Taxis are numerous,
but can get expensive if you move around much. Driving a rental car
isn't a problem _ roads are well-marked with good signals, although
parking can be tough to find in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MONEY: Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the U.S. and uses
American dollars, making things very easy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TRAVEL DOCUMENTS: None required for U.S. citizens entering
from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LANGUAGE _ Spanish is most common, of course, but nearly
everyone, it seems, speaks English, especially if they work in the
tourism industry. In the countryside a phrasebook would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE _ Tropical, but surprisingly mild. The seabreeze keeps
things relatively cool, although be prepared with plenty of
sunscreen if you plan a beach visit. Average daily high
temperatures in San Juan are a mild 81 degrees in August, a
pleasant 75 degrees in January.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SECURITY _ Like most states with a significant population of
poor, petty theft is present. Use common sense and don't leave bags
unattended at the beach or airport. Don't flash big wads of cash in
public places and don't leave items inside a parked car; lock them
in the trunk or leave them at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHERE TO STAY _ For beachtime, Isla Verde near the airport has
plenty of new, modern hotels, some with casinos. This is about 10
miles from the historic Old San Juan district. The Condado is
another beach district closer to Old San Juan, but many of the
properties here are in the midst of remodeling. Old San Juan
features a few hotels, including a new, upscale Wyndham; a charming
converted nunnery called El Convento and a few smaller properties.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OLD SAN JUAN TIPS _ If you drive in, park in one of the
municipal parking garages noted on most tourist maps. The streets
are too narrow and maze-like and parking is too much of a hassle
otherwise. Walking the district is a delight and not too taxing,
but wear comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EATING OUT _ Puerto Rican food is a delightful mix of
Caribbean, European and Creole, and is served at fine restaurants,
many of which are in hotels. Every conceivable variety of American
fast-food is also available _ and ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OTHER ACTIVITIES _ Scuba diving and snorkeling are excellent
and can be arranged through travel agents. Touring the small island
in a car can take a day or more, but will give you the flavor of
the old Puerto Rico of small farms and villages. Sidetrips to El
Yunque, a mountainous tropical rainforest, and the Arecibo
Observatory, a giant radio telescope where NASA searches for
extra-terrestrial life, are highly recommended.

<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ You sort of feel sorry for them.
Pasty-white tourists who arrive at Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport and go straight by shuttle bus to the shadowy confines of
the opulent casino-hotels that line large sections of the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Days later they stagger back on the bus, pockets either bulging
with winnings or more likely picked clean by the ubiquitous slot
machines, and jet away back home, their Puerto Rican vacation a
cloistered, gambler's binge.
</P>
<P>
   You even feel a bit sorry for the ones who venture outside but
go no farther than the gorgeous _ but building-lined _ beaches of
Isla Verde or Condado, San Juan's two thriving beach districts.
</P>
<P>
   Because if beaches and blackjack are all you get out of a Puerto
Rican vacation, you're missing some of the most intriguing,
picturesque history this hemisphere has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan _ a 20-square-block district of cozy streets, shady
plazas and Spanish colonial architectural gems _ beckons with
Caribbean lore and legend, a window into the fascinating early
years of European discovery and conquest.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always a pretty history, what with massacres of native
Indians, vicious battles among warring empires and centuries of
exploitation. But the setting couldn't be more eye-grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1521, the city perches atop a narrow, rocky island
guarding the mouth of San Juan Bay. Look inland and the vast bay
spreads out like a tableau, the modern San Juan suburbs rising in
the middle ground and Puerto Rico's green, forested mountains
towering in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Look seaward and the Atlantic Ocean crashes into the rocky coast
at the city's feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish were master fort-builders, and their handiwork
abounds in San Juan. Most of the island is ringed by a massive,
20-foot-thick wall, in places topped by streets, parks and plazas,
or dramatic buildings like La Fortaleza.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the 1830s to defend the bay, it was transformed over
the years into the residence and offices of the island's governor,
and now holds the distinction as the oldest continuously-occupied
executive mansion in the New World. Daily tours offer a peek into
non-working parts of the mansion, including the stunningly tiled
courtyard surrounded by arched-and-columned walkways.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks up the hill from La Fortaleza, through a small
plaza and up a shaded street with dramatic views of the bay,
visitors suddenly find a broad grassy field that leads to Castillo
San Felipe del Morro, a massive fort dominating the bay's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Known simply as ``El Morro,'' this huge fort has six levels of
gun decks and monstrous walls broken by battlements and turrets.
Built over several decades in the mid-1500s, it towers 140 feet
above the Atlantic. Through the years, Spanish soldiers used it to
repel attacks by competing empires, repulsing such luminaries as
Britain's Sir Francis Drake.
</P>
<P>
   The view from El Morro's battlements down San Juan's Atlantic
waterfront is breath-taking, with white-capped waves crashing on
the rocky shore. San Juan Cemetery, featuring elaborate statuary
and bone-white crosses, dominates the foreground, hugging a rocky
cliff. The city's wall stretches into the distance, leading to El
Castillo de San Cristobal, yet another fort built to protect the
island's eastern fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their war-making, the Spanish thrived at
cathedral-building, too, and San Juan Cathedral is a shining
example of their New World handiwork. Plain stucco walls on the
outside give way to a vaulted, tiled interior where religious icons
and statues line the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon _ discoverer of Florida but
also Puerto Rico's first governor _ lies interred here, his remains
guarded by a virgin warrior. He may have needed her help when he
was alive: de Leon had running political battles with Christopher
Columbus' son, Diego, who felt his father's discovery of the place
on his second voyage in 1493 entitled him to rule Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   If 500-year-old politics gives you a headache, you can find
respite only a block away from de Leon's grave at El Convento. No
vows required for entry today, the place was built as a Carmelite
nunnery in 1651 but was converted this century into one of the
district's finest hotels. Dinner and drinks in the courtyard
restaurant are a treat, with formally-dressed waiters who give the
best in European-style service.
</P>
<P>
   But Old San Juan offers more than just history.
</P>
<P>
   Art-lovers will find numerous small galleries and antique shops,
often tucked into the courtyards of buildings with gorgeous iron
balconies and weathered wooden shutters. There is also upscale
shopping, with boutiques offering fine clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   You can even bird-watch in Old San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Parque de las Palomas _ Pigeon Park _ offers close encounters of
the feathered kind, as hundreds of pigeons wait each day for
tourist hand-outs, often flocking all over the people feeding them.
If Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds'' gave you shivers, keep your
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to avoid is driving inside the district. The
narrow streets can turn into a maze best left to locals. If you're
staying at the beach, taxi in or take a rental car and park it in
one of the several municipal parking garages on the district's
fringes.
</P>
<P>
   The area is a delight to walk, even on hot summer days, as the
seabreeze keeps San Juan several degrees cooler than spots like
Miami or Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   So even if gambling or beach-combing is the main aim of your
Puerto Rican sojourn, consider at least a daytrip to Historic Old
San Juan. The jackpots may be of a different variety, but the odds
are better that you'll go home with something to show from your
trip.

   TIPS FOR TRAVELERS TO PUERTO RICO:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Air connections are good to Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport in San Juan, with American Airlines the
dominant carrier from the U.S. Delta, TWA and United also fly
there. Cruise ships also dock in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND: Puerto Rico is served by all the major
American car rental companies, which have desks at the
international airport. Rates are comparable to within the U.S.,
with a full-size car going for about $50 a day. Taxis are numerous,
but can get expensive if you move around much. Driving a rental car
isn't a problem _ roads are well-marked with good signals, although
parking can be tough to find in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MONEY: Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the U.S. and uses
American dollars, making things very easy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TRAVEL DOCUMENTS: None required for U.S. citizens entering
from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LANGUAGE _ Spanish is most common, of course, but nearly
everyone, it seems, speaks English, especially if they work in the
tourism industry. In the countryside a phrasebook would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE _ Tropical, but surprisingly mild. The seabreeze keeps
things relatively cool, although be prepared with plenty of
sunscreen if you plan a beach visit. Average daily high
temperatures in San Juan are a mild 81 degrees in August, a
pleasant 75 degrees in January.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SECURITY _ Like most states with a significant population of
poor, petty theft is present. Use common sense and don't leave bags
unattended at the beach or airport. Don't flash big wads of cash in
public places and don't leave items inside a parked car; lock them
in the trunk or leave them at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHERE TO STAY _ For beachtime, Isla Verde near the airport has
plenty of new, modern hotels, some with casinos. This is about 10
miles from the historic Old San Juan district. The Condado is
another beach district closer to Old San Juan, but many of the
properties here are in the midst of remodeling. Old San Juan
features a few hotels, including a new, upscale Wyndham; a charming
converted nunnery called El Convento and a few smaller properties.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OLD SAN JUAN TIPS _ If you drive in, park in one of the
municipal parking garages noted on most tourist maps. The streets
are too narrow and maze-like and parking is too much of a hassle
otherwise. Walking the district is a delight and not too taxing,
but wear comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EATING OUT _ Puerto Rican food is a delightful mix of
Caribbean, European and Creole, and is served at fine restaurants,
many of which are in hotels. Every conceivable variety of American
fast-food is also available _ and ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OTHER ACTIVITIES _ Scuba diving and snorkeling are excellent
and can be arranged through travel agents. Touring the small island
in a car can take a day or more, but will give you the flavor of
the old Puerto Rico of small farms and villages. Sidetrips to El
Yunque, a mountainous tropical rainforest, and the Arecibo
Observatory, a giant radio telescope where NASA searches for
extra-terrestrial life, are highly recommended.

<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ You sort of feel sorry for them.
Pasty-white tourists who arrive at Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport and go straight by shuttle bus to the shadowy confines of
the opulent casino-hotels that line large sections of the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Days later they stagger back on the bus, pockets either bulging
with winnings or more likely picked clean by the ubiquitous slot
machines, and jet away back home, their Puerto Rican vacation a
cloistered, gambler's binge.
</P>
<P>
   You even feel a bit sorry for the ones who venture outside but
go no farther than the gorgeous _ but building-lined _ beaches of
Isla Verde or Condado, San Juan's two thriving beach districts.
</P>
<P>
   Because if beaches and blackjack are all you get out of a Puerto
Rican vacation, you're missing some of the most intriguing,
picturesque history this hemisphere has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan _ a 20-square-block district of cozy streets, shady
plazas and Spanish colonial architectural gems _ beckons with
Caribbean lore and legend, a window into the fascinating early
years of European discovery and conquest.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always a pretty history, what with massacres of native
Indians, vicious battles among warring empires and centuries of
exploitation. But the setting couldn't be more eye-grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1521, the city perches atop a narrow, rocky island
guarding the mouth of San Juan Bay. Look inland and the vast bay

WACO NEWS NO SURPRISE _ FBI LACKS RESTRAINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the

Amendment commentary. His email address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Why should anyone be surprised at the inquiry into the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's role in the siege of the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993?
</P>
<P>
   Why should anyone be surprised that the FBI and the Department
of Justice may have attempted to cover up the use of incendiary
tear gas projectiles that might have started the fire that killed
80 members of the Davidian group?
</P>
<P>
   This nation has paid a price every time Congress has granted the
FBI too much power and exercised too little oversight.
Accountability is the issue here. Congress must at least share the
blame for not reining in the enormous powers of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has a difficult job fighting organized crime, public
corruption and terrorism aimed at Americans. One of its tasks is to
protect us from the militant radicals among us who would kill for
some political ideal. For the most part, the FBI does its job well.
For the most part, it has resisted petty corruption. But as with
any law enforcement agency, it needs strict oversight. And it needs
to be held to the legal standards required by the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Where law enforcement confronts the suspect is where
constitutional protections of the individual come into play. And a
law enforcement agency subject to little oversight is likely to
overlook the niceties of constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   We do no favors to any law enforcement agency by not holding it
accountable. Someday the facts will come out. But the damage will
have been done. And the agency responsible for acts of lawlessness
will lose its credibility and its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement depends upon the cooperation of the citizenry.
When citizens are too scared to cooperate or too skeptical of a law
enforcement agency, then important information may be delayed or
even lost.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum, when a law enforcement agency
is on a loose tether, it may build a tradition of ignoring the
rights of suspects -- an underground, unspoken tradition that is
all too difficult to break, as a number of major urban centers,
like Chicago and New York City, have come to realize.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nation born of dissent. It is a part of our character.
Most of us cherish this aspect of liberty. There is little doubt,
when one looks at the history of our nation, or any nation, for
that matter, that dissent is a significant part of political
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   At key junctures, movements of political and social dissent have
changed the direction of our nation, made us open to greater
diversity and helped us include segments of our society that had
been ignored, excluded, or forced into ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who saw or participated in the civil rights movement
of the 1950s and '60s know that it was essential in order to make
white Americans face their darker brothers and sisters. The
movement helped secure a semblance of equality for racial
minorities, though the battle is not over yet. Still, it was a step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that communists had infiltrated the civil rights
movement, the FBI played a sinister role during those years,
tapping civil rights leaders' telephones, manufacturing phony
evidence against them and attempting to discredit the leaders of
that great movement. It was an out-of-control FBI run by a man who
had been in power too long, J. Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who saw or joined the `free love/free drugs`
protesters of the 1960s understood the movement as a reaction
against the straightjacket militarism and anti-communist hysteria
that had gripped our nation in the '50s. We may not have welcomed
the extremes to which the dissenters took us, but we understood it.
The FBI was there, too, taking photographs, wiretapping phone lines
and interfering with the free speech rights of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The political dissent of the 1970s against the Vietnam War,
whether we agreed with it or not, played an important role as a
check on our elected leaders and the nation's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental movement that began with the celebration of
the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, was also under surveillance
and infiltrated by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, chaired a Senate committee to
probe FBI activities and found that in the mid-1970s, the FBI had
conducted a widespread campaign of monitoring and disrupting
political groups engaged in legal demonstrations and activities.
The target groups were as disparate as Vietnam protesters and the
women's liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of our long and honorable tradition of political
dissent, the FBI conducted a massive campaign against these
dissenters: breaking into homes and offices; bugging them; placing
wiretaps on home and office phone lines; spreading misinformation
to discredit the groups; and FBI infiltrators attempted to provoke
protesters to commit illegal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Church Committee published a six-volume report that
documented these despicable FBI's tactics. With all their
activities, the FBI produced very little evidence of criminal
conduct on the part of political protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Congress initiated a series of reforms after the Church
Committee report, but they didn't last. And congressional oversight
once again became blind.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the FBI continues to investigate Muslims, Arab-Americans,
Palestinians, environmental activists, those protesting America's
policies in South America and even members of Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiterrorism Act of 1996 has made it possible for the FBI
to deport foreigners based upon secret evidence, that not even the
defendant's lawyer can see. The law has made it a criminal act to
support the humanitarian activities of selected foreign groups. And
the law has made it possible for the FBI to, once again,
investigate those who are exercising their First Amendment rights
of free speech, dissent and freedom of association.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wise for Congress to conduct an in-depth probe of
FBI activities after the independent review of the Waco disaster,
headed by former Republican Sen. John Danforth, is completed. The
FBI needs the restraint of careful oversight -- the nation needs
it.

 &HT;    A lovely affair, nevermind the hat
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It was a lovely wedding. The bride was
breathtakingly beautiful, and the groom, heartbreak handsome. The
garden was picture-perfect and the rain clouds held.
</P>
<P>
   Violinists seated behind a border of late-summer blooms, drew
family and friends to the grass, two steps beneath the rock-edged
terrace where the minister waited, book in hand, ready to ask the
questions and say the words that would change the bride's name and
two people's lives forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time,'' the bride's mother whispered, shaking me out of
my reverie. Time, I recalled, for the two of us to be claimed by
the young gentlemen who had been charged with walking us to our
places of honor in the garden, among the rose petals at the foot of
the terrace steps. Time to smile. Time to remember.
</P>
<P>
   The young man standing beside Pastor Dan never looked so tall or
handsome before. He is my son. The gentleman to his left, his best
man, used to be my husband. I've known both of them a very long
time. I couldn't help remembering that.
</P>
<P>
   The three of us had grown up together.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the violins eased into a Pachebel Canon, the signal for
the processional to begin. The groom turned, straightened himself,
and focused expectantly on the opening in the tall hedge at the
back of the garden. That's where he would catch the first glimpse
of the lovely lady in white who would soon be his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The one he'd hoped for and waited for all of these years.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends moved slightly aside to form the aisle the
bride would follow as she walked with measured steps from the
backyard of her childhood, on the arm of her father, to the hand of
her husband-to-be. I couldn't help wondering if ever in her
small-girl imagination she had pictured such a summer's evening
while playing hide-and-seek with her friends _ on the same grass,
around the same bushes.
</P>
<P>
   The tall young man with the rose in his buttonhole (the one
whose stem I'd broken trying to pin in place), watched as his
bride-to-be made her way to him. He looked at her the way all women
would like to be looked at at least once in their lifetimes. A tear
welled in his eye and he left it there. The bride beamed.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma Butler sang the wedding prayer, as she had for the
bride's sister a few years before.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Dan asked who was giving this woman in marriage and the
bride's father answered: ``Her mother and I do.''
</P>
<P>
   For just a moment my mind wandered to thoughts of how it must
feel for a father to place his daughter's hand into the hand of
another man _ a man who had never dried her baby tears or bandaged
her skinned knees. A man who couldn't yet know those special
feelings between a father and his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day he would.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Dan spoke words that most of us there had heard before _
well before these children were born. He reminded them always to be
fair and honest, and to stand by one another when times were tough.
They did solemnly promise.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Dan pronounced they were husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, August 14, 1999, Amy and Kristofor were
married.
</P>
<P>
   I wore a silly hat.

 &HT;    Tae-Bo in water proves powerful workout
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They're all breathing hard by now, halfway
through their nonstop 45-minute workout. Some weigh more than 300
pounds and some weigh less than 200, but none of the 15 women are
letting up noticeably. Most of them look downright happy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they're singing. As they begin ``Joy to the World,''
they punch an imaginary speed bag rapid-fire and sing about
Jeremiah's mighty fine wine. After that, they kick to the front
with one leg, then to the back with the other. By the time they
finish offering ``joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea,'' they
have added a sharp punch to each kick.
</P>
<P>
   There's no singing in aerobics, you say? No smiling in exercise
workouts? Don't tell anyone at the aqua kickboxing classes that
meet four times a week in the swimming pool at Franciscan Medical
Center's Sports Medicine Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have fun, they're never going to come back,''
says Cea Cohen-Elliott, the instructor. ``One of the biggest
reasons people don't exercise is because they don't enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been teaching aerobics since 1983 and started shifting
to water aerobics seven or eight years ago. She replaced the basic
water aerobics with kickboxing in January after seeing Billy
Blanks' popular Tae-Bo video. In the water, she decided, kickboxing
was something people could do regardless of their size and at any
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are ladies who have struggled because they can't
exercise on land,'' Cohen-Elliott says. ``But in the water, the
buoyancy supports them, and it doesn't matter what they look
like.'' They go to these classes comfortable that there will be no
snickering or staring, and they come out of them with more
confidence and better fitness, less stress and fewer pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We full-figured women have discovered that water aerobics
gives us a measure of freedom afforded to those who are agile on
the tennis courts or the jogging paths,'' says Joan Padgett. She
doesn't expect to be enlisted for diet cola commercials, but she
now fits her shrinking hips, thighs, arms and abdomen comfortably
into her business clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Although nominally coed, the class doesn't often have men in it,
but it has women from 24 to 78 years old. Rhoann Carlin is a
50-year-old dental hygienist who started six weeks ago and is
halfway from a size 16 to her size 12 goal. Robin Harris is a 911
operator who has lost 36 pounds in a little more than a year and
calls the aquatic classes ``a way of life.'' And Violet Moster is a
diabetic whose doctor had begged her to exercise for two years
before she gave it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared I was going to be intimidated,'' Moster says. ``I
thought everybody was going to weigh 110 pounds. I always thought:
`Exercise? Oh, come on! ' But this is so much fun, it's, `Wow! I
can't wait for the next one.' ``
</P>
<P>
   When she started in mid-April, Moster's doctor was about to
hospitalize her with a blood sugar level above 500. Since mid-May,
it hasn't been over 80. She says she's more ambitious, with more
energy. She has even started working out on dry floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed my life,'' Moster says. She used to get tired
just going to work, ``and forget about going up a flight of
stairs.'' She needed an electric cart to keep up with her kids in a
shopping mall. She didn't bother getting her nails done or her hair
styled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they just get discouraged about everything,''
Cohen-Elliott says of large, sedentary women. ``But these women are
so proud of themselves. Did Violet tell you about her vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   It was just last month, Moster offers without prompting. ``For
the first time in 13 years, I put on a suit and went swimming with
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori Kelley has been taking Cohen-Elliott's aquatic classes for
seven years, so reluctant to miss even one that she showed up three
days before giving birth last year. Like many in the class, she had
tried a variety of exercise programs. ``On land, it was hard to get
motivated to get back,'' she says. ``Plus there was a little bit of
nonacceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley sometimes sees joggers whose faces ``are in excruciating
pain'' and wonders why they put themselves through it. ``This is
hard work, too, but it's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kickboxing alone is a good cardiovascular workout that burns 350
to 450 calories an hour, the American Council on Exercise says.
That's comparable to a brisk walk or slow jog, but ACE points out
that kickboxing has added benefits for strength, flexibility,
coordination and reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   It can be dangerous, though. ACE warns against overextending
kicks, locking joints and exercising beyond fatigue. But the water
not only cushions some of that stress on the joints, it also adds
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel like exercise,'' Padgett says. ``I'm light as
a feather in water. I have greater flexibility and enjoy the
stretch just a little further without gravity taking its toll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have thought you could get such a great workout
in water,'' says Cohen-Elliott, who considered stress fractures
just part of the job when she was a dry-floor aerobics teacher. As
a conflict-resolution counselor and motivational speaker on health,
humor and healing, she also understands the water workouts' mental
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stress buster,'' Padgett calls her after-work workouts that
enable her family to share the evening with someone who's not
dragging. Kelley says after she missed a session last week, she was
tired the whole next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come in half dead,'' Joni Kakatolis says after drying off
and dressing. ``And now I have a second wind.''
</P>

 &HT;    Advice for ministers is good for all
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Building a budget and saving some money are just the
beginning for recent college graduates, newlyweds and others who
yearn to secure their futures.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is considerably more complex: turning those
savings into investments that do what you want and don't worry you
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Hamilton, a certified financial planner who counsels
Baptist ministers on retirement and other money matters, has given
a lot of thought to the challenge of setting up a long-term
investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with defining what's important to you,'' he
said. ``What do I want in my future, and what will it take to get
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a 42-year-old who works for the Georgia Baptist
Convention, suggests a three-step process.
</P>
<P>
   The first is setting up an emergency savings account and putting
in enough money to cover three to six months of basic expenses.
This doesn't actually move you ahead, but it protects your savings
if things go bad. Hamilton suggests putting the money into a
readily available money market account.
</P>
<P>
   Step two is organizational _ writing down your goals and what
they will demand of you.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way is a do-it-yourself worksheet. You need to fill
out four columns of information: each goal, what you think it will
cost, when you need the money and how much you need to save each
payday. It's best to start with goals for the next year. Further
down the page, record goals that are one to five years away, then
the really long-term ones.
</P>
<P>
   The tough part, especially for faraway goals, is guessing the
cost. That involves a number of uncertain factors, such as
inflation and the returns you will actually get from your
investments. You may need to read a good book, such as Jane Bryant
Quinn's ``Making the Most of Your Money,'' or hire a financial
planner for a one-time consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton recommends careful attention to near-term spending
plans, such as Christmas gifts and buying a new car. In his family,
a short-term goal is saving enough to celebrate his 20th wedding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you plan for expenses like this, they don't become a
crisis,'' he observed. ``They don't impinge on your longer-term
savings plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Step three is the big one: Picking the investments that will get
you to each of those goals. It's either the scariest step or the
most rewarding one, depending on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton believes it's best to sort out your investments the
same way you did the worksheet, matching your choices to how soon
you need the money. His investment advice:
</P>
<P>
   _ For the next year's needs, put the money into money market
mutual funds. Another possibility is certificates of deposit that
will mature before you expect to need the cash.
</P>
<P>
   These are best because they are the least volatile. The stock
market might sink in the next year but not a money market or CD.
</P>
<P>
   _ For one- to five-year goals, Hamilton recommends slightly
higher-yielding but still conservative investments. He has in mind
government-backed securities, such as Treasury bills, or mutual
funds that invest in high-quality corporate bonds. For the more
adventurous, he would consider mutual funds specializing in utility
companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the long-term goals, Harrison is ready to move to the
stock market and its usually higher returns. Volatility also is up,
but you can reasonably expect to have time to wait out any market
declines.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton tells his clients to stick with mutual funds rather
than trying to be your own stock picker. The first one should be an
index fund that tracks the S&AMP;P 500 index. ``That's your
foundation,'' he said. ``Then you move on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton does not recommend particular funds. But he favors
certain families of mutual funds, including Putnam, T. Rowe Price,
Vanguard and USAA.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that beginners need to search out mutual funds
that will open an account with a small initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   You will have more choices if you set up an automatic investment
plan, meaning that you authorize your bank to send along a given
amount every payday.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price's Equity Index 500 fund will open such an account
with a $50 investment. Other fund families will do the same, but
they charge higher fees for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Note that Vanguard and USAA have index funds with substantially
lower expenses, which is a considerable advantage if you expect to
leave your investments alone for many years.
</P>
<P>
   But their cheaper alternatives require an initial purchase of
$1,000 or more for retirement plans, or $3,000 for regular
accounts. That may be something you'll move up to later on.
</P>
<P>
   As you accumulate more savings, Hamilton suggests diversifying
into mutual funds with different investment goals, including growth
or income funds and those that specialize in either small or large
companies.
</P>
<P>
   How do you pick funds? Hamilton recommends starting with the
research reports issued by Morningstar, one of the best-known
mutual fund trackers. You can find Morningstar information at most
libraries or on the Internet at www.morningstar.com.
</P>
<P>
   He tells minister-clients to limit their searches to funds that
have earned four- or five-star ratings. He would steer away from
funds that charge a load, or sales fee, and would favor funds that
have been around at least 10 years. He also suggests comparing the
annual expense ratios of your nominees and looking back to see how
well they performed during market declines.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think the selection will be easy. You will probably
have to balance the good and the bad aspects of each mutual fund
you study. For example, among the index funds mentioned above, only
Vanguard's has been around for longer than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll have to make some judgment calls. Your faith
may also come into play. More than half of Americans said in recent
survey that they pray before making major financial decisions. One
in four said they talk to clergy _ perhaps including the ministers
Hamilton counsels.

 &HT;    Feelings of unity ties that bind at high school where no one is
minority
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Up to the ceiling, at least, the student center of
Meadowcreek High School looks like Anyschool, U.S.A. Clean brick
walls and orange molded-plastic chairs lined up neatly at lunch
tables fit the archetype of a middle-class, Gwinnett County school.
On one wall, between Fruitopia vending machines, 10-foot-high,
hand-lettered signs give the rosters of the Mustangs football team
and cheerleading squads.
</P>
<P>
   But above these familiar landmarks, the flags of 60 nations hang
from the ceiling. They mean more to the students than an exercise
in geography. For each flag, at least a few students can point and
say, ``That's where I was born.'' Which makes Meadowbrook one of
the two or three most diverse schools in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother keeps telling me I need to see other countries,''
says Sergio Lozano, 16, a native of Colombia. ``And I tell her, all
I have to do is go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Meadowcreek is 26 percent white, 35 percent black, 20 percent
Hispanic and 16 percent Asian. But those cold stats don't really
describe the school's diversity; there are scores of students of
Indian, Pakistani and Saudi Arabian backgrounds, for example, who
list themselves as white. Taking in a Meadowcreek hallway between
classes is a bit like strolling through a cheerful port city on
market day. You see clusters of chattering friends where three or
even all four of those major racial groups are represented.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers also don't capture the extra patriotic shiver that
one feels _ at the jam-packed open house for parents the other
night _ when a school choir of every shade of skin color sings the
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is a minority here,'' says Ronni Ford, the warm but
no-nonsense Anglo principal. ``I honestly think that's the key to
the feeling of unity.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, too, are aware _ in their unassuming,
did-you-see-``Dawson's Creek''-last-night? way _ that they're a
vanguard, that Meadowcreeks will eventually be more the norm than
the exception across the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by walking around this school we're learning to deal with
what America is going to be later in our lives,'' says Charlie
Charoenlap, an American-born 17-year-old of Thai, Vietnamese and
Anglo heritage. ``We're not even conscious that we're absorbing the
social skills, but we are. Future leaders will come from places
like Meadowcreek because we've dealt with diversity and learned the
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The look, though, is all-American. Foreign costume, as well as
food, are rare at Meadowcreek, except at the school's well-attended
annual International Festival. ``The whole world copies the
American teenagers they see on TV,'' says a smiling Muhammed
Saleem, a Pakistani accountant accompanying his son to open house.
There's one outward sign of diversity, however: The school has made
one exception to its no-hat rule, permitting turbans, which have
cultural significance for some Muslim males.
</P>
<P>
   Meadowcreek may also be a model for the future in that it draws
families that are themselves multi-ethnic. Roger Flot, who
describes himself as ``Louisiana mix: French, black, creole,'' and
his Anglo wife, Bonnie Flot, say they could have moved into other
metro-area school districts but, ``We chose Meadowcreek's because
it's so multicultural, like where we used to live in Southern
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Meadowcreek does not simply have many-colored threads; it
appears to be tightly woven. Visiting the school is like seeing the
dollar-bill motto _ ``E pluribus unum,'' or ``from the many, one''
_ in action. Soon after Meadowcreek opened in 1987, the
administration set up a mediation group of diverse students to open
up communication, and perhaps because of that foresight, serious
conflicts have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is never negative for us,'' claims Lauren Bellamy,
the 17-year-old African-American student-body president. Laughing,
she adds that the mediation group ``deals more with typical
problems like, `I heard a rumor that she said something bad about
me because another girl thought I was looking at the boy that this
other girl used to date!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of dating, it's another phenomenon that appears to
cross ethnic and racial lines with relative ease. Lauren Hadden, an
Anglo 17-year-old raised in Georgia, says, ``My parents pick on me
because I've gone out with Italian, Spanish and Russian guys, but
to me it's such a non-issue. I didn't even know he was Russian till
the second date!''
</P>
<P>
   If it all sounds a little too sweet, a little too
We-Are-The-World _ there's more to the story. There are huge
challenges to educating such a diverse population of 2,100, where a
quarter of the students grew up speaking one of 35 languages other
than English. The school's average SAT score this year was 940,
lowest in Gwinnett and lower than the state average of 969.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Yoo, who moved from Korea a year ago, and Darya Sofiyeva,
from Ukraine three years ago, find the Meadowcreek curiculum easier
than that of their native countries, but they are still among the
hundreds at the school who must work even harder than American-born
peers to master the English language. In Darya's words, ``I learned
English in Ukraine, but it's not the same as American!''
</P>
<P>
   Drop-in classroom visits reveal that immigrant students murmur
among themselves in their native tongues even while the teacher is
speaking _ ``I'm hearing a lot of Spanish back there!'' warns one
teacher, without much effect _ creating a kind of underground
classroom from which other students are excluded. When one Korean
boy arrives late for his first class in English for Speakers of
Other Languages, he not only fails to sit down when a teacher asks
him twice to do so (he may not have understood her) but won't even
acknowledge her. It is soon discovered he is in the wrong class and
he's ushered out, so it's unclear how his rudeness would be
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are no numbers to measure the spontaneous cultural
education of Meadowcreek's halls, lunch tables and playing fields:
``You don't just talk about tolerance here, you learn it,'' says
Pakistani-born Sajid Saleem. Of the conflicts in the school, ``The
few that occur are not about diversity,'' maintains Assistant
Principal Jane Moser.
</P>
<P>
   Parents at the open house agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my daughter first came to this school 10 years ago, I
thought, `Oh no _ the gangs!''' says Efat Ghalagol, a housewife
from Iran whose son is a sophomore. ``But there are no gangs. This
is the melting pot school _ wonderful experiences for my children!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the race of the children,'' she adds. ``It's
how they were raised in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   The misperception about gangs is not uncommon. When the
Journal-Constitution convenes a panel of eight students to discuss
the school, the subject that aroused the fiercest passions is
Meadowcreek's reputation among other schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call us `Ghettocreek,' '' declares Sergio. He tries to
laugh in a casual way, but one can sense the hurt underneath. The
feeling of being misunderstood, put down, is echoed all around the
conference table. Dhruv Parekh, a 15-year-old of Indian parentage,
says that he's been asked by an adult professional in his
neighborhood ``if it's wise to go to such a rough school'' _ a
notion that becomes almost laughable as one drives onto the
well-tended Meadowcreek campus and sees the playful ``Mustang
Trail,'' blue horseshoe prints on the sidewalks, leading to the
playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It irritates me to hear those comments,'' Dhruv says,
``because I take a lot of pride in my school.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an us-against-the-world spirit seems to be one of the
glues binding Meadowcreek together. It's a palpably happy school
whose identity is more than the sum of its ethnic parts: in a word,
American. There are cliques, of course, the students say, but the
so-called preppies, jocks and other upper castes do not have the
intimidating power seen at more typical high schools, that has
lately led to despair and violence among alienated students.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Mullins _ accompanied at the open house by his
African-American father and Sicilian-Mohawk mother _ name two
mostly Anglo high schools nearby and declares, ``They think they're
higher than us.'' Then, letting his emotions get the better of his
grammar, he adds, ``At Meadowcreek, ain't nobody higher than
nobody.''

 &HT;    Faith, family sustain Dion's joy, talent
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``I wanna play you something,'' Dion
says, making his way down the staircase of his Boca Raton home,
speaking in a heavy New York accent. He's the same pop legend seen
in countless photographs _ the cocky born-in-the-Bronx stride, the
trademark cap covering his jet-black hair.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a difference: He's gentler than one might imagine, a
Rock and Roll Hall of Famer who's got the measured demeanor of a
street-corner philosopher. And he's got a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, comes the song. From a corner of his study, the
stereo blasts a sweet slice of '50s rock 'n' roll:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tearin' down the highway, look at all that ice and
snow/Headin' for that next town, gettin' ready for another show/I'm
gonna hug my radiator when I hit my hotel room . . .''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds dated, that's because it is. ``Hug My Radiator''
was written during a 1959 winter tour, when Dion DiMucci was a New
York kid climbing the charts with his group, Dion and the Belmonts.
A couple of other budding rockers _ Ritchie Valens, Buddy Holly _
were part of the show. For them, the Midwest cold proved too much
and they chartered a flight. Dion stuck with the highway and the
bus, saving himself the $35 air fare _ and his life.
</P>
<P>
   On that night the music died _ the plane crashed en route to
North Dakota, leaving no survivors _ Dion was given a second
chance. There would be more revelations in the years ahead _ and
more brushes with death. But it's only now that he's reached 60 and
built a new life in this pretty-in-pink city that Dion is willing
to revisit the past and celebrate the future. ``Hug My Radiator''
is featured on an album he's just finished. It's also part of the
soundtrack to a film that actor-screenwriter Chazz Palminteri (``A
Bronx Tale'') wants to make about Dion's life. And there's a boxed
set due from Capitol that will trace Dion's 40-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The Wanderer has found a home at last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 11 years in Boca, they have been the greatest years
in my life,'' he says during a conversation in his kitchen,
surrounded by a close circle of pals munching on slices of pizza.
``I developed friendships that have kept me full of life, kept my
spirit young.''
</P>
<P>
   The rock legend _ a father of three and grandfather of two _
looks remarkably young. His buddies may kid him about the hair _ or
possible lack thereof _ under that trademark cap, but the body is
trim and toned, the result of regular workouts in a local gym. More
importantly, the Bronx hoodlum who knew all the angles still knows
them. But the angles have changed. Now, Dion's life isn't about
talking tough, scoring drugs or even making hit records. It's about
friends and family _ and an abiding faith in a higher power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that defines Dion today beyond a shadow of a
doubt is his relationship with God,'' says Ben Troxell, a Deerfield
Beach financial consultant who met the singer-songwriter on a
spiritual retreat more than 15 years ago and has remained a friend.
Not that Troxell sees any diminishing of Dion's talent. ``He's
probably at least as creative as he was in his 20s and maybe even
more so. There's a richness and a texture to his experience that he
brings to bear along with the fertility of his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   A great white blues singer
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marsh, one of America's foremost rock critics and a diehard
Dion fan, offers even higher praise. Noting how most '50s rockers
either died or dried up creatively, he says the voice behind such
doo-wop classics as ``A Teenager in Love,'' ``Runaround Sue'' and,
of course, ``The Wanderer,'' is the true exception _ a pop pioneer
who grows with the times. ``He's one of the few great white blues
singers,'' he says. ``He completely understands that music from its
emotional insides.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does the man who wedded a black beat to a Bronx
attitude have to say on the subject? For him, music is an extension
of a search for knowledge. ``I know a lot of guys who sing about
wonderful, beautiful things and they don't even get their own
message,'' he explains during lunch at a Mizner Park eatery. ``But
I wanted to know what the truth was and how you apply it to your
life. Not just talk about it, but live it. That's what I'm about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff for a guy who grew up on the rough streets of
New York, became a millionaire at 21, then nearly threw it all away
on drugs and booze. But that's part of Dion's journey, the road
that's led him to his semi-anonymous, spiritual life in Boca today.
He still gets recognized occasionally on the street _ and the
neighbors in his relatively posh gated community surely know who he
is. And he has something of an ego: His wife of 36 years, Susan,
teases him about the ``store'' he keeps in the trunk of his Jeep
Cherokee, which holds boxes of his CDs that he passes on to curious
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise it's a quiet existence. Dion's daily routine might
consist of a visit to St. Jude's Catholic Church in Boca, where he
regularly attends Mass and leads recovery programs for substance
abusers. ``It's kind of the center of my life,'' he explains. From
there, it's lunch or dinner at a local restaurant _ he can name
practically every red-sauce joint between Fort Lauderdale and West
Palm Beach _ with one of his friends, most of whom are
nonmusicians. They joke that he's so discreet about his identity,
it's hard for people to believe he's really Dion. ``He called up my
office a couple of weeks ago and one of the girls hung up on him.
She just thought it was a crank call,'' says Mike Apter, a Boca
business owner.
</P>
<P>
   Dion also spends plenty of time with family members, whom he
prefers to keep out of the spotlight. Wife Susan runs the business
side of his musical affairs. His two older daughters live in South
Florida _ Tane is a teacher, Lark is a homemaker. The youngest,
August, just finished a master's degree in art in Baltimore. The
family gets together for holidays, cruises and, most recently,
August's graduation. ``We caused quite a racket,'' Dion says with
pride.
</P>
<P>
   Between everything else, Dion makes music in his tastefully
decorated but hardly ostentatious home, where figures of Christ
hang next to photos of grandchildren. The closest thing you'll find
to a piece of priceless artwork is his own painting of blues great
Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He leads a visitor to his ``studio,'' a small room on the second
floor decorated with bits of memorabilia _ Lou Reed's speech
inducting him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an autographed
chart for a Bruce Springsteen song he once sang in concert with The
Boss, even an original poster for the ill-fated 1959 ``Winter Dance
Party'' tour with Holly and Valens. There's also a mixing board and
a microphone. ``If I get really inspired, I turn the chair around,
turn the equipment on and go,'' Dion explains.
</P>
<P>
   Comeback? He never stopped
</P>
<P>
   He's been inspired lately. Although he's continued to record
since his late 1950s-early '60s heyday _ ``I don't think in Dion's
mind he ever made a comeback album because he never stopped,'' says
Marsh _ he's clearly approaching his art with a newfound
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this album,'' Dion says of his newest effort, which
he's just begun shopping to record labels. It's self-consciously
retro, recorded with a single microphone in the style of the old
days. And musically, it brings Dion back to his doo-wop roots. ``My
wife keeps saying, `Dion, this is a work of art.' She feels like
it's full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from the mid-'60s to the late '80s, Dion really was a
musical wanderer: He traded in his early pop success for a
quasi-beatnik life, singing the blues and folk ballads in Greenwich
Village coffee houses and all but abandoning his five-year
recording contract with Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He did have one hit as a folkie, ``Abraham, Martin and John,''
an ode to fallen heroes recorded in the aftermath of Bobby
Kennedy's 1968 assassination. But that was followed by a long dry
spell, during which he recorded a fair bit of Christian music,
played more coffee houses, reunited briefly with the Belmonts and
made what even he admits was a terrible album with legendary
producer Phil Spector.
</P>
<P>
   The sign that Dion wasn't finished musically came in 1989, with
the release of ``Yo Frankie'' on Arista. Although hardly a
commercial success, it signaled a new beginning: Here was the
culmination of a lifetime of roots influences, from country (Dion's
childhood idol was Hank Williams) to rock to blues to folk.
</P>
<P>
   Biopic in the planning stages
</P>
<P>
   The new album is even rootsier _ with a sound that takes you
directly back to the '50s. The idea came from the movie that
Palminteri is planning. Actually, it's the second attempt at a Dion
picture. Around the release of Dion's 1988 autobiography, ``The
Wanderer: Dion's Story,'' director Barry Levinson (``Rain Man,''
``Diner'') expressed interest and a script was developed. But the
focus remained on Dion's early years in the Bronx, when he emerged
from the confines of a tough-love Italian family _ his parents now
reside in Broward County _ and became a gang member and finally a
recording star.
</P>
<P>
   To Dion, however, the real story was what followed _ how he was
given a second chance after declining to fly with Valens and Holly.
Not that he couldn't afford the $35 fare. But the sum equaled what
his parents paid for rent each month on their tenement apartment.
``My head just hadn't stretched on spending a whole month's rent on
a 45-minute flight. So, I said no,'' he recalls. When he got to the
next town and heard the news, ``Reality started trickling down in
my head, my heart, my soul. You start thinking, `Who am I? Where am
I? What's life about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the time his career peaked in 1963, when he had six Top 40
singles as a solo artist, he still hadn't found the answers.
Walking away from his success, he became a junkie and alcoholic.
``It was like the prodigal son thinking he found heaven when he
found hell,'' he says. In his book, he describes harrowing scenes
of throwing his pregnant wife out of a car, shooting heroin in the
garage of his ritzy Manhattan apartment building and nearly
attempting suicide.
</P>
<P>
   His redemption came in 1968, after he moved to Miami to escape
the mess of his life. At first, little changed. ``I was looking for
a geographic miracle and I found out I brought myself with me,''
Dion says. But then his father-in-law, a recovered alcoholic,
forced Dion to face the truth: On April 1 of that year, he started
a new life, one firmly committed to God and free of drugs or
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it backwards, now I'm home,'' Dion says, recalling how
all the fame and fortune led to his despair. ``It used to be that
what I did determined who I was. Now, it's who I am that determines
what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion's spirituality is something he doesn't hide. In his book,
he relates how during a morning jog in 1979, he experienced the
divine revelation _ a visit from Jesus. At the same time, he
doesn't force his views on other people _ nor does he expect them
to take his words as the gospel truth.
</P>
<P>
   But his friend Ben Troxell, a devout Christian, says that Dion
will gladly tell his story to those inclined to listen. ``First, he
wants to be a friend. Then, if you're interested, he will share . .
. He's so disarming that by the time you have a relationship with
him, you are at least receptive to what he has to say and aren't
the least offended if your beliefs don't line up with his.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this rocker-turned-gentle philosopher's story that
Palminteri, another Italian Bronx native, is determined to capture.
``It's a story of personal triumph with music as a background,'' he
explains. The actor-turned-director _ this will be his first
feature-length directing job _ doesn't hide his admiration for
Dion. ``He's like a great soul,'' he says. ``His story has to be
told.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the most imaginative filmmaker might have trouble
finding much excitement in Dion's life today. Since moving to Boca
Raton 11 years ago _ he wanted to escape the crime of Miami and
find a better place to raise his three daughters _ he has led that
fairly mundane existence described above. He still plays an
occasional concert locally or out-of-town; he did a church benefit
earlier this year at the Eissey Campus Theatre in Palm Beach
Gardens. He also released a second book last year, collaborating
with Andi Litt Wiener on a self-help title, ``Chapters: Writing the
Adventure of Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the only time he really steps into the spotlight is when
he's asked by other rock legends. Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, for
example, saluted him during their recent performance at Coral Sky
Amphitheatre by singing ``The Wanderer,'' pointing him out in the
crowd and inviting him backstage.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't even bother attending the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
ceremonies, even though he's been invited annually since his
induction in 1989. The one exception was last year, when he took
his close friend, Ric Newman, a Boca commercial real-estate
developer, as a special gift. Newman, the only local buddy who's a
real rock buff, says he was amazed to see the respect Dion was
accorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody like Billy Joel walks into the room and they see
him, they make a beeline for him. They hold him in very high esteem
as a pioneer of rock 'n' roll,'' Newman explains. ``I think he
(Dion) is starting to appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   `You can make a niche hit'
</P>
<P>
   But the question is whether Dion can have another hit.
Certainly, in a music scene dominated by fashion-conscious
hip-hoppers and angry alt-rockers, it seems unlikely. Dave Marsh
doesn't write off the possibility, though. ``I don't think it's
inconceivable. Circumstances can conspire. And these days, there
are different kinds of hits. . . . You can make a niche hit,'' he
explains, noting the many radio formats. But Marsh's faith is based
on something deeper. ``God knows, Dion has talent. One of the
things that struck me about this new group of songs is that his
singing is so strong and sooner or later, people are going to get
interested in strong singing again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dion, he's not holding his breath. ``I guess it would be
nice, but it's something I certainly don't focus on. If I really
look at it, I have had much more than my share. I have a lot to be
thankful for.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Dion seems more interested in connecting with an
audience than on selling them something. His belief is that rock is
simply the great communication medium of popular culture _ and that
anyone can qualify as a rocker, even a classical violinist he
caught on television the other night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `This guy is a rock and roller,' '' he recalls.
``There was a sound coming out that had nothing to do with the
violin under his chin. He played with such passion, it stirred
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that same passion with which Dion approaches the nonmusical
part of his life. During a two-hour lunch, he answers most
career-related questions politely, but seems far more interested in
offering child-raising advice. ``That's the real important stuff,''
he explains, relating a conversation he once had with Springsteen
during a 1997 concert stop in Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody backstage, just him and a guitar. I said to
him at one point, `Bruce, life is the art,' '' Dion recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's response? ``I know, and it's rough.''
</P>
<P>
   At 60, Dion has finally made it look easy.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The young man standing
beside Pastor Dan never looked so tall or handsome before. He is my

husband. I've known both of them a very long time. I couldn't help
remembering that. The three of us had grown up together. (Schuett,

In fact, they're singing. As they begin ``Joy to the World,'' they
punch an imaginary speed bag rapid-fire and sing about Jeremiah's
mighty fine wine. After that, they kick to the front with one leg,
then to the back with the other. By the time they finish offering
``joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea,'' they have added a sharp
punch to each kick. There's no singing in aerobics, you say? No
smiling in exercise workouts? Don't tell anyone at the aqua

of gardeners will visit. To do that, gardens know they need more
than seeds and trowels to compete with computer games and MTV.
High-tech interactive exhibits designed to raise awareness about
the environment have become one strategy, and each children's
garden to open in the past few years has targeted its own niche. In
Atlanta, it's all about wellness, aimed at teaching children's how
plants affect their every day lives. (Flanders, Atlanta

limited to mansions of the well-to-do, are now appearing in homes
near you _ those of middle-class consumers spending anywhere from
$2,000 for a simple 27-inch TV, VCR and recliner to $300,000 for a
state-of-the-art system with 9-foot screen, Dolby sound, DVD player
and theater-style seating. Some consumers say in the end it's worth
it considering all the distractions and hassel of actual
moviegoing. Find out what systems people are buying and why.

 &HT;    The ups and downs of home parties
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Imagine: Making money while you have
fun!
</P>
<P>
   That's at least part of the idea behind home party sales, a
subset of the growing home-based sales industry.
</P>
<P>
   Working at home has some obvious ups and downs: Everybody likes
the idea of flexible hours, but most people like the idea of a firm
payday even more.
</P>
<P>
   The upside is strong enough to draw nearly 10 million Americans
into sell-from-home businesses, a number that nearly doubled in the
past decade, according to the Direct Selling Association trade
group. More than 60 percent are women; most work part time.
</P>
<P>
   With a wide range of home care products, cookware and cosmetics
leading the way _ and big-name companies such as Avon, Amway and
Mary Kay _ total sales topped $23 billion last year. More than a
quarter of that was sold through home parties.
</P>
<P>
   While most companies encourage home-based sellers to use
traditional one-on-one sales techniques, a growing number are
following the Tupperware path. The World Wide Web glitters with
prospects for profit-minded hosts, such as:
</P>
<P>
   Pampered Chef kitchen tools. (``If you would like to Host a
Pampered Chef show to see what Pampered Chef has to offer, you will
receive at NO cost to you a wonderful Hostess Gift chosen by
yourself. Whichever you decide you can't lose!'')
</P>
<P>
   Fun-Zee's Funwear clothing (``As a new Sales Rep you can earn
free clothes from Fun-Zee's by conducting 7 presentations within
the first 30 days after receiving your clothes.'')
</P>
<P>
   PartyLite candles (``We're ready to help you enrich your life
with candles, friends, and additional income.'')
</P>
<P>
   Jewels by Park Lane (``A Park Lane show held in the home or
office: Brings friends and co-workers together. Is fun,
interesting, and exciting . . . Offers tremendous free credit,
gifts, discounts, and exciting specials for our hostesses and
guests.'')
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's Home Sales Network, including home decor and
collectibles. (``Our party plan is phenomenal . . . As an MWN Home
Party Sales Representative you can make $125 and more with a 1
1/2-2-hour party!'')
</P>
<P>
   The first step to reward, of course, is investment. Most
party-sales companies require a seller to buy a demonstration kit,
typically $25 to $100. Some, like Tupperware, don't charge
anything.
</P>
<P>
   A high initial fee may be cause for hesitation, but a low
initial fee doesn't necessarily mean a good deal. The Direct
Selling Association advises prospective sellers to find out whether
they'll be required to buy more inventory later, and whether the
company will buy back unsold merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The association offers other tips at its Internet site,
www.dsa.org.

 &HT;    There's no trick to selling Tupperware, consultant says
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jo-Ann DiLorenzo received her Tupperware
calling 27 years ago this Oct. 2. There's no other way to put it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since she threw her first party, Tupperware has come to
fill her life. And her house. Not merely the kitchen cabinets,
freezer and pantry, but darn-near every bit of her three Boynton
Beach bedrooms, two baths, living and family rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what you see were Tupperware earnings,'' says
DiLorenzo, who ranks among the top 10 percent of Tupperware sales
managers nationally. ``The linens, the TV, the mirror, the
pillows.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus the dark-wood credenza, the crystal that lines its shelves,
the dining room set, the kitchen set, the end tables and the
minivan in her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the inanimate rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my best friends, I've met through Tupperware,'' she
adds. ``My children's godparents I met through Tupperware.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as though her entire world whooshed out of a giant
plastic tub with one pop of Earl S. Tupper's ingenious, airtight
lid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it took a lot of hard work,'' says DiLorenzo. ``You
get out what you put in.'' DiLorenzo, 50, expected to be putting
her efforts into something a little more concrete than plastic. She
started out as an architectural draftsman in New York City, working
on urban renewal projects. Then she got pregnant and asked for some
time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told I had to make a choice between a family and my
job,'' she says. ``But the choice was already made. I said it was
nice knowing them and left.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband chose to live on one income until she found
a job that gave her enough flexibility to care for her family. Her
daughter was 2 years old when a friend of a friend invited
DiLorenzo to a Tupperware party.
</P>
<P>
   At evening's end, the guests were told that any of them could
earn $25 to $30 by giving a Tupperware demonstration. DiLorenzo
signed up for a kit and began planning a party of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother told me not to invite the relatives because it was a
disgrace,'' she says. She scraped up a few friends and managed to
sell $47 worth of Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '70s, it sold for less than half what it does
today,'' she says. ``It was probably $7 to $8 for an average
container.''
</P>
<P>
   With the standard Tupperware commission of 35 percent, she kept
$16.55 _ not quite what she expected. Her second party was slightly
more profitable, but the third was her breakthrough: $550 in sales,
plus five recruits who agreed to host parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were all women who had never been to a Tupperware
party,'' she says. ``They all brought their moms, and none of them
could get enough Tupperware.''
</P>
<P>
   Product sells itself, she says
</P>
<P>
   There's really no trick to getting people excited about plastic
kitchenware, DiLorenzo insists, as she slaps, taps and bumps a few
bowls to show how rugged they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tupperware is the premier food storage system,'' she declares.
``They're all dishwasher safe. A large variety go into the
microwave. Did you know we now have Tupperware you can put in a
conventional oven?''
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo reaches into a cupboard and produces a deep, tan bowl
that looks vaguely like a German army helmet. ``This is called Oven
Works,'' she says. ``It goes into the oven up to 450 degrees. If
it's burnt black from baking, you can wash it right off.``
</P>
<P>
   By the time she's done explaining how Tupperware Oven Works can
cut cooking time (``Remember, it costs 75 cents an hour to run a
conventional oven, and you're paying Mr. FPL even more while you
turn up the air conditioning''), $45.50 sounds downright cheap for
a plastic casserole dish.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo's Tuppermania is so deep, so infectious, that
customers from her early parties are still sending business her way
27 years later. Many of the party-goers she's met since have also
remained loyal, despite the profusion of burp-alike food systems
available everywhere at discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give people service,'' she says. ``I call them. I send them
recipes. If they want a little gadget, I just send it to them. I do
what it takes to make the customer feel appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo sees just about everyone as a potential customer and
rarely misses the opportunity to explain how much better life can
be with Tupperware. (``You can bang on it, step on it, throw it.
You get lifetime replacement.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, the neighbors don't run when they see her
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never pushy,'' she says. ``I'm informative. There are
many, many customers out there looking for Tupperware
consultants,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message DiLorenzo has been most successful at getting
across. She attracts her own faithful following of ``consultants''
(Tuppertalk for sales people) who can work their way up to being
managers like her by recruiting others. She has 32 of them,
including two former teachers and other professionals who found
Tupperware more lucrative than their previous jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a career choice, not something you do because you
can't find a real job,''
</P>
<P>
   Associates, consultants profit
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo and her consultants persuade friends and, sometimes,
strangers to host parties. DiLorenzo or one of her associates does
the selling; the host gets a gift, usually Tupperware. The more
Tupperware guests buy, the more expensive the gift.
</P>
<P>
   Her consultants make commissions on their sales, and so does
DiLorenzo. She also gets a bonus for each recruit she brings in.
When her team meets its sales goal _ which it almost always does _
she gets a little something on top of that. The credenza, for
example, was a bonus for a team sales total of $90,000 in just four
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This jewelry is all from some sort of bonus,'' she says,
showing off several gold-and-diamond bracelets, earrings, rings and
a gold watch with her name engraved in it.
</P>
<P>
   Cars, minivans, lots of trips
</P>
<P>
   She does well with her own parties, too, selling about $50,000
worth of Tupperware last year: $17,500 in base commissions before
all those bonuses. Her sales have been consistently high enough
since her second year on the job to qualify for a company-leased
car or minivan: more than 20 of them, including her current Dodge
Caravan, so far.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she gets free trips to sales conventions. She came back
from the recent national meeting in Las Vegas with several awards,
including a $400 credit at Sears. The rewards more than make up for
the nights and weekends given to parties and sales meetings in
addition to days devoted to making and taking calls and filling
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is retired on Social Security,'' she says. ``Other
than that, the only money coming into this house is from my
Tupperware business. We take plenty of vacations every year. We
just married off my daughter with a very nice wedding. I'd say you
can do very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Joe, was not a Tupperware bonus, but (unlike her
first husband) he is a Tupperware enthusiast. He helps with the
mailing , the paperwork, the parties. He understands that his
wife's dedication is as emotional as it is financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hit the lottery tomorrow, she'll still sell Tupperware,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   She nods in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do this as long as I can walk,'' she says. ``A friend of
mine used to say, 'Let me know when there's a Tupperware coffin.
Then I know they'll preserve me forever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   TUPPERFACTS
</P>
<P>
   _ About 950,000 people sell Tupperware around the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Tupperware party starts every 2.2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 105 million people attended Tupperware parties last
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Total purchases: more than $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS TUPPERWARE?
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware started as a line of food storage containers made of
nonporous plastic and covered by a lid that makes a distinctive
sound when opened. (Most call it a burp; Jo-Ann DiLorenzo prefers
``whisper.'') The brand now includes a range of mostly kitchen
products, including cooking pans and utensils. The company is based
in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   WHY THE FUNNY NAME?
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware was invented by Earl Silas Tupper, a New Hampshire
scientist, tree farmer and tinkerer who became fascinated with a
newfangled petroleum derivative called plastic while working for
DuPont in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Tupper struck out on his own, making plastic gas masks and other
military supplies during World War II. After the war, he became a
consumer plastics pioneer. Plastic tumblers and plastic toothpicks
were among his innovations.
</P>
<P>
   He not only made plastic accessible, he made it respectable.
Before Tupper, plastic was synonymous with junk: Brittle, oily,
ugly and smelly. Tupper developed a method of transforming
oil-refining waste into clean, flexible, translucent sheets.
</P>
<P>
   His second breakthrough was the plastic Tupper lid, an air-tight
seal modeled on the metal lids used for paint containers. Tupper
used them on his early food storage containers in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF A TUPPERWARE PARTY?
</P>
<P>
   Tupper tried to sell his containers in stores, but he had little
success. Who could stomach the thought of food stored in plastic,
much less figure out how to work that crazy lid?
</P>
<P>
   A divorced mother named Brownie Wise discovered that lots of
people could, once they'd seen a proper demonstration. She added
Tupper's wares to the Stanley Home Products line that she was
already selling at gatherings in customers' homes. Tupper was so
impressed by her success that he adopted the home-party idea as his
exclusive sales outlet and made her vice president for sales in
1951.
</P>
<P>
   Tupper, who sold his company to Rexall in 1958 for $16 million,
is regarded as a brilliant inventor and businessman. He died in
1983. His papers are archived at the Smithsonian Institution. The
collection's introduction acknowledges Wise, who died in 1992, as
co-genius for creating and nurturing her army of party throwers.
</P>
<P>
   WHY HOST ONE?
</P>
<P>
   The host gets a gift worth $8.50, even if no one at the party
buys anything. The more people buy, the more you get, especially if
guests agree to host their own parties. If, for example, the guests
spend $300 and agree to host two parties, the host gets a $67.50
Tupperware picnic set, including bowls and utensils. For $450 in
sales and two parties, the hosts gets the picnic set plus an
insulated bag and other containers.
</P>
<P>
   HOW LONG WILL TUPPERWARE PARTY ON?
</P>
<P>
   Indefinitely, the company says, even though it shattered
tradition Aug. 10 when it started selling some of its products
directly through its Internet site (www.tupperware.com). Also new:
mall kiosks and infomercials. But Tupperware says these new sales
outlets will augment, not replace, the traditional parties.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ We've been hearing lately just what a tin ear
some over-eager religionists have for the harmonies that are
necessary to keep this religiously diverse nation humming.
Especially egregious is the declaration of a proselytizing war by
Southern Baptists on Jews during this season of the Jewish high
holy days. (Teepen, Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Some Cuban exiles like to boast that Miami
was a sleepy little town until they got here beginning in 1960 _ it
was far more advanced than they like to think _ but what has
happened in the last three decades is that Miami's politics has
fallen under the control of a cabal, elected and self-appointed.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ I never understood why the cotton swabs
were in the top of the aspirin bottle, except as little symbols of
stability in a changing world. I felt care was being taken for a
good cause I could not fathom. Such steps will no longer be taken.
I'm on my own now, a little lonelier, a little more frightened.
Progress. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED.

<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The young man standing
beside Pastor Dan never looked so tall or handsome before. He is my
son. The gentleman to his left, his best man, used to be my
husband. I've known both of them a very long time. I couldn't help
remembering that. The three of us had grown up together. (Schuett,

In fact, they're singing. As they begin ``Joy to the World,'' they
punch an imaginary speed bag rapid-fire and sing about Jeremiah's
mighty fine wine. After that, they kick to the front with one leg,
then to the back with the other. By the time they finish offering
``joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea,'' they have added a sharp
punch to each kick. There's no singing in aerobics, you say? No
smiling in exercise workouts? Don't tell anyone at the aqua

of gardeners will visit. To do that, gardens know they need more
than seeds and trowels to compete with computer games and MTV.
High-tech interactive exhibits designed to raise awareness about
the environment have become one strategy, and each children's
garden to open in the past few years has targeted its own niche. In
Atlanta, it's all about wellness, aimed at teaching children's how
plants affect their every day lives. (Flanders, Atlanta

limited to mansions of the well-to-do, are now appearing in homes
near you _ those of middle-class consumers spending anywhere from
$2,000 for a simple 27-inch TV, VCR and recliner to $300,000 for a
state-of-the-art system with 9-foot screen, Dolby sound, DVD player
and theater-style seating. Some consumers say in the end it's worth

moviegoing. Find out what systems people are buying and why.

BUSH EDUCATION PROPOSAL RAISES QUESTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush has done as much as anyone
to make ``accountability'' the dominant education buzzword. And he
proposed raising the stakes with his plan, recently unveiled, to
take federal money from failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bush's version, although the Republican presidential
front-runner is reluctant to admit it, of the federal government's
favorite tool for forcing state and local governments to comply
with its will: attach strings to federal dollars and threaten to
cut off the money if certain federally dictated conditions aren't
met.
</P>
<P>
   It has worked on numerous policies, from environmental
protection to highway speed limits and drunken-driving enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan is somewhat different because he wouldn't keep the
forfeited education Title I funds in Washington or transfer them to
another state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he would let the parents of students in schools that
have been judged low-performing for three years in a row to use the
federal money to educate their children elsewhere, including at
charter or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents, of course, immediately started taking shots
at the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Bush of trying to establish a national voucher
system for private schools, and Republican detractors said Bush was
trying to do a very un-Republican thing _ promote Big Government
intrusion into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The latter criticism was of more immediate concern to Bush, and
it obviously was on his mind last week in a campaign swing through
southern New Hampshire, where he courted votes for that state's
crucial Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, he took pains to reassure voters that he was
firmly for ``local control'' of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``My education policy is, first and foremost, trust the people
of New Hampshire to make the right decisions (for their schools),''
he told a crowd at the Milford fire station.
</P>
<P>
   Even a group of fifth-graders in nearby Bedford heard the
``local control'' mantra at least twice during a brief visit by the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   If the youngsters didn't understand what their visitor was
talking about, Bush was confident that their teachers _ and media
covering the event _ did.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that he wasn't dancing a sidestep from local
control with his proposed, new federal hammer over the public
schools. He said that was because he would have each state _ not
the federal government _ design its own student test to determine
which of its schools were passing or failing.
</P>
<P>
   But there are, nevertheless, some potential conflicts with local
control whenever the federal government intervenes in local or
state policies, even if the intervention is proposed by a strong
advocate of local control.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal, for one thing, would force some states to begin
evaluating the performances of their public schools. Although that
would be a good thing and serve to boost public accountability of
education tax dollars and maybe improve their schools, it would
remove some local control.
</P>
<P>
   And if states, influenced by their own political considerations,
set widely different standards for assessing the quality of their
local schools, pressure would inevitably increase for the federal
government to set a uniform standard. What would happen to local
control then?
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to vouchers _ which remains strong across the
country, including in Texas _ also may affect standards in some
states. So could concerns over higher taxes and any number of other
political and pocketbook factors.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the educational failures that Bush and other
reformers are so strongly criticizing were, for the most part,
produced by educational systems designed, administered and funded
at the state and local levels.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that the federal government could do a better
job. Far from it. But the very fact that Bush is proposing federal
intervention raises questions about his own confidence in the
accountability of local control.
</P>

HAS IF YOU GO BOX; slugged CORONADO-GO 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; CORONADO, Calif. _ In an era when vacation, for most Americans,
meant Sundays off, a couple of entrepreneurs from points east stood
on the edge of San Diego Bay, peered out at two desolate islands
that lay offshore, and envisioned a site that would exist solely
for leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, they were onto something.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 111 years of tourism evolution since that time,
and Coronado got it all right. It's a peninsula now, but it retains
its island feel, and it has justifiably earned a distinction as one
of the most desirable travel destinations in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado is beach _ 28 miles of broad, white beach, the result
of decades of dredging of San Diego Harbor to make room for Navy
ships. It is bike paths and sailboats in a sheltered bay and tiny
cottage architecture and numerous sidewalk cafes. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; It is also an ancient, elaborate, wedding cake of a hotel on
the beach, the enduring symbol of what got all of this started in
1888 _ the Hotel del Coronado.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors, whether they arrive by ferry or the towering sweep of
a bridge that connects Coronado to downtown San Diego, are drawn to
the quirky Hotel Del as if by some unseen force. Its Victorian
touches and distinctive, red-shingle turrets present one of the
most photogenic structures in the West _ which might explain its
prominence in such movies as ``Some Like It Hot'' and ``The Stunt
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In its youth, it was the exclusive province of the filthy rich,
captains of commerce and mavens of high society who nurtured their
fortunes in the Northeast _ but weren't foolish enough to spend
their winters there.
</P>
<P>
   Its design would never gain approval for an oceanfront resort
today. It faces (ITAL BEGINS)south(ITAL ENDS), sideways to the
brilliant blue of the Pacific Ocean to the west. Its lobby is
ornately paneled _ walls, ceiling, grand staircase _ in
dark-stained oak, and only an occasional glint of indirect sunlight
can penetrate the cavern. The focal point for most of the rooms in
the original building is not the infinite sweep of sea but a
central garden court. Century-old redwood timbers creak beneath
your feet when you walk, and hallways sag this way and that.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, however, only serves to heighten the romance of the
Del, which is registered as a National Historic Landmark. To stay
here is to immerse yourself in the elegance of a departed era.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of room for the present, though. A modern tower
just south of the original building features rooms with
floor-to-ceiling windows, balconies and breathtaking views to the
west. The original building, meanwhile, is scheduled for a $50
million restoration beginning this fall. Among other improvements,
air conditioning will be added (they'll hide the ducts in the
abandoned steam-heat shafts) and the tennis courts that lie between
the hotel and the beach will be ripped up and replaced with a Grand
Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Del was built long before the development of _ or
desire for _ sunscreen, in-line skates or anti-cellulite spa wraps.
It's certainly done a commendable job of adapting to the changing
tastes of its clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The priceless archival photos displayed on the third floor show
guests embarking for a walk on the beach in spectator shoes,
three-piece suits and ankle-length dresses. The hotel's History
Gallery also chronicles the lavish dinner held in 1920 for the
Prince of Wales, when Edward may or may not have been introduced to
a Navy officer's wife _ she was the future Wallis Simpson, whom he
would ultimately forsake the crown to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you're more likely to see youngsters trooping through the
corridors in wet bathing suits and sandy feet, and boogie boards
propped up against balcony railings to dry. The Del, despite room
rates that range upward from about $205 nightly, seems to attract
an astonishing number of families.
</P>
<P>
   The parents may reflect wistfully on the heady events of the
hotel's past, but the kids simply can't get over the quality of
that beach. They can be found there swimming, riding waves,
building sand castles, playing paddle tennis, throwing footballs.
And of course never getting tired.
</P>
<P>
   It is an impressive stretch of beach. And to think it came into
existence for the sake of industry.
</P>
<P>
   When Coronado was two small chunks of offshore land _ islands at
high tide, a marshy-edged peninsula at low tide _ San Diego Bay was
perfectly sheltered but much too shallow for big ships. A major
dredging operation was begun at the start of World War II, and it
continued for years.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with all that sand scooped from the bottom of the
harbor? Why, fill in the gap between the two islands, to begin
with. Then keep spreading it in the marshlands and along the
western edge until Coronado was a permanent peninsula, connected to
southerly Imperial Beach by a narrow spit of land that has come to
be called the Silver Strand.
</P>
<P>
   The rearranging of sand has also produced a beach that is much
flatter than most of those found along California's southern coast.
This reduces some of the treachery of the sea here. Walk 50 feet
into the water, it's knee-deep. Walk another 50 feet, it's
midthigh. This results in small, gentle waves, ideal for very young
beach bums who are just learning to ride some flotation device
through the froth.
</P>
<P>
   The beach itself is every bit as flat, such that it's ideal
terrain for walkers and joggers. It's not even unusual to see
someone pushing a baby's stroller along that firm, damp sand. The
ocean washes so gently onto this expanse that sea shells and sand
dollars are often deposited here entirely intact.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the best times for a walk along this beach is at
dusk. As the tide works its way out, a thin sheet of water spreads
out across this sandy plain. Then the setting sun catches it and
turns it into a vast, glistening mirror. So (ITAL
BEGINS)that's(ITAL ENDS) how the Silver Strand got its name.
</P>
<P>
   Natural geography also treats this area kindly. Slightly
northwest, Point Loma extends a long finger of land along the
coast, curled protectively around Coronado. The marine layer tends
to smack full into this outer land mass and accumulate against it,
leaving Coronado blissfully clear most days (the morning fog
usually lifts by 9 o'clock).
</P>
<P>
   Directly across the Silver Strand from Coronado Beach is
Glorietta Bay, a crook of sheltered water ideal for polishing up
(or establishing) your sailing skills. At Coronado Boat Rentals,
they'll rent you everything from a 14-foot Capri sailboat ($25 an
hour) to a 30-foot Catalina ($195 for a half day). Dry-land
pointers are not provided, but you can hire a captain ($60 for two
hours) to get you oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Too ambitious? It might be better to opt for a pedal boat or a
kayak, both of which rent for $15 an hour, $40-45 for a half day.
</P>
<P>
   More bay _ and still more beach _ await to the south, and this
strand is best toured on two wheels. A bike path parallels Silver
Strand Boulevard on the bay side; a merciful feature, given the
frenetic pace of vehicle traffic here. Sunset magazine, in its
September issue, included this route among its finest bike rides of
the West, and the terrain is so flat you won't need anything more
exotic than a one-speed beach cruiser (they rent for $5 an hour,
$12 for four hours at Little Sam's, across from the Del at 1343
Orange Ave.). The views of the beach on one side and the bay on the
other are so mesmerizing, you almost have to be careful to pay
attention to your riding so as to avoid a collision.
</P>
<P>
   While pedaling south, you can't miss the U.S. Naval Amphibious
Base, where the Navy trains its SEAL commandos in such pleasantries
as underwater demolition and beach reconnaissance. You'll see
burned-out hulks of helicopters and other military craft _
incongruous in this idyllic setting _ and the climbing towers on
which trainees scramble up rope ladders.
</P>
<P>
   A series of tunnels connects the bike path with Silver Strand
State Beach, which is a gentle ride of about four miles south of
the Del and Glorietta Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Back in town, which seems to have put up a spirited fight in
keeping chain establishments at bay, it would be easy to while away
the hours in one of several sidewalk eateries or privately owned
shops.
</P>
<P>
   But Coronado also brims with a colorful history, and it
shouldn't be neglected. An excellent way to get a taste of it is to
sign up for a walking tour with Coronado Touring. Conducted
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 11 a.m., the tour, which costs
$6 per person, offers a fascinating and often-hilarious mix of
facts, figures, anecdotes, commentary and local gossip. Phone:
(619) 435-5993 or 435-5892.
</P>
<P>
   (The Hotel Del also offers historical tours of its property, for
$10, but that tour was found to be much less satisfying. The
befuddled volunteer from the Coronado Historical Association
repeatedly confused dates and names, misidentified the wood used to
panel the hotel lobby, and thoroughly mangled the mystery of Kate
Morgan, the Del's resident ghost.)
</P>
<P>
   For the Coronado Touring program, guide Nancy Cobb first
gathered a dozen or so tourists in the music room of the Glorietta
Bay Inn, the former mansion of sugar baron John D. Spreckels, a
former owner of the Del.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb then held forth for nearly an hour, providing intricate
detail of Coronado's growth _ and its personality as a community.
She revealed with a roll of her eyes that a recent dispute about
the lights strung on the trees of Orange Avenue at Christmas _
white or multi-colored? _ ended up on the (ITAL BEGINS)ballot(ITAL
ENDS) in a local election.
</P>
<P>
   The second hour involved a walking loop around the Del (the
hotel won't permit the tour inside), along the beach at Ocean
Boulevard and through Coronado's back streets, which offer a
charming mix of beach cottages and postwar apartment buildings _
plus, unfortunately, the blight of overbuilt mansions on cramped
beachfront lots.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood that featured three houses dating to the late
1880s, Cobb indicated a small dwelling of Midwest architecture that
was the home of author L. Frank Baum when he briefly lived on the
island at the beginning of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Baum is known to have completed four of his ``Oz'' manuscripts
while living here, and possibly six. In ``The Wizard of Oz,'' he is
believed to have based the peaked grandeur of the Emerald City on
the turrets of the Del.
</P>
<P>
   It was beneath those turrets that Baum, on winter escapes to
Coronado from his home in Chicago, reportedly cut loose with his
book fees. ``A partier of the first order,'' Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she continued, this house was built because Baum
couldn't seem to get any work done while staying in the hotel. Once
he'd complete a manuscript and get his publisher off his back, he'd
bolt right back to the frivolities of the Del again.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone visiting this area today can probably empathize with the
man.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado was conceived and developed to be a leisurely, seaside
retreat, safely removed from mainland realities by the moat that is
San Diego Bay. Coronado was never intended to be anything but this,
and for more than a century, it really hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it's so popular with vacationers today. Work, in this
place, almost seems a sacrilege. &QL;

   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: San Diego lies 121 miles south of downtown Los
Angeles via Interstate 5. Coronado is directly west of downtown,
and can be reached from I-5 by the Coronado Bay Bridge (Route 75).
The toll is $1, but carpools of two or more are free; there is no
toll on the return drive. Another option is a ferry boat from the
Broadway Pier in San Diego Harbor. It departs every hour on the
hour starting at 9 a.m. Fare is $2; bicycles 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The 692-room Hotel del Coronado offers accommodations
both in its original building, which dates to 1888, and its modern
Ocean Towers, whose rooms were recently redesigned in fabrics and
colors reflecting a water theme. The Del also offers several
packages (romance, family, marriage proposal, New Year's Eve,
etc.). The New Year's 1999 packages, which require a three-night
minimum stay, are priced from $1,615 to $7,300 per couple and
include a dinner and a party; the hotel reports it has availability
in all categories and has sold about half the packages. Also during
the holidays, a dazzling Christmas tradition features 30,000 lights
strung from the hotel's distinctive roof turrets and along its
exterior lines. Reservations and information: (800) 468-3533 or
(619) 435-6611. Other options on the peninsula include the
Glorietta Bay Inn, the former mansion of sugar magnate and one-time
Del owner John D. Spreckels, (800) 283-9383; Loews Coronado Bay
Resort, (800) 815-6397; and the Coronado Island Marriott, (800)
228-9290.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: An outstanding fine-dining option can be found at Azzura
Point, the upscale restaurant at Loews Coronado Bay Resort. The
Chef's Menu features a six-course dinner with wines matched to each
course by the restaurant sommelier; $100 per person. On a recent
visit, the fare included sweet pea risotto, oven-roasted Pacific
salmon and herb-crusted loin of Colorado lamb on a warm salad of
spinach, olives and roasted peppers. The wines toured the globe
from Italy to Austria to Argentina to California's Russian River
Valley. Reservations: (619) 628-5479. To keep a tighter curb on the
budget, there is Island Pasta (1202 Orange Ave.), a casual joint
with main courses in the $8 to $12 range and a children's menu. It
gets heavy tourist traffic, such that service was found to be a bit
overwhelmed and inattentive.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Coronado Visitors Bureau can offer information
on lodging, dining, recreation, shopping and sightseeing. It has
free brochures available. Phone: (800) 622-8300 or (619) 437-8788.

WHAT'S IN FALL TV'S BAG OF TRICKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new fall TV shows are here. It's the moment you've all been
waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   Well, most of you have been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting down to sample the new network offerings used to be a
September ritual in most American homes. But the multiple-TV home,
and cable television, may have put an end to that. According to
research from USA Networks, the combined audience for the six
broadcast networks during ``premiere week'' has been falling
steadily and will dip below 50 percent in 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, chances are good that this Sept. 19-26, when
NBC, CBS and ABC roll out most of their new shows, close to half of
the viewing public will be watching cable.
</P>
<P>
   The ironic thing is that those cable watchers likely will be
watching programs created by and for network TV: repeats of ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' ``Northern Exposure,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Roseanne,''
``The X-Files'' and ``NYPD Blue.'' The reason is simple. Unlike
cable _ which builds its schedules on the cheap _ networks spend
money, lots of it, to create hits. They pay the best and brightest
creative talent to create the hits of 2000 _ not to mention the
cable hits of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely why you should at least sample the fall
offerings, starting about now. My take on the new shows starts
today (see accompanying short reviews) and will continue in this
section and daily FYI as they have their premieres.
</P>
<P>
   And this year the networks have assembled as talented a stable
as any in the entertainment business. People such as:
</P>
<P>
   - Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who concocted ``The American
President'' and ``A Few Good Men'' for Hollywood before writing his
first TV show, ``Sports Night,'' for ABC last season. Drawing once
again on the White House, Sorkin has concocted the season's most
buzzworthy new show, ``The West Wing,'' for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing,'' in which Martin Sheen plays the president,
has the same Sorkinesque devices as ``Sports Night'': walking
scenes through labyrinthine hallways, heroically constructed
speeches and crafty, even slightly absurd, episode codas.
</P>
<P>
   - John Wells, creator and executive producer of the '90s most
successful show, ``ER,'' who is being asked to make lightning
strike again. His new series, ``Third Watch,'' filmed on the
streets of New York City, depicts the firefighters, cops and
paramedics who (as the promo says) bring the patients to the ER.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``ER'' made a group of less-than-lovable doctors
into a memorable ensemble by throwing them into a crucible of
nonstop rescue work. That same premise is replicated on ``Third
Watch,'' as are many of the same character types, but it was not
entirely clear after the first episode whether viewers will warm to
this ensemble the way they did to ``ER's.''
</P>
<P>
   - Jennifer Love Hewitt and David Boreanaz, stars on other
people's hit shows (``Party of Five'' and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' respectively), who are being given one-hour spinoffs of
their own. Both are highly anticipated, yet neither has produced an
episode for critics to preview.
</P>
<P>
   - Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, two more in the growing alumni
of writer-producers on ``The Simpsons,'' who were recruited to
create the WB's first prime-time cartoon, the edgy, funny and
occasionally crass ``Mission Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   - Jay Mohr and Illeana Douglas, actors whose pasts and futures
are in the movies but who jumped at the chance to star in
``Action,'' the funniest new comedy of the season. ``Action'' is
``The Larry Sanders Show'' if it took place at a film studio _ with
all the curse words left in (bleeped, of course, for network
purposes).
</P>
<P>
   - Glenn Gordon Caron, who created ``Moonlighting'' in the 1980s
and returns with a moody and unpredictable new drama, ``Now and
Again,'' for CBS. ``Now and Again,'' which has the most riveting
first scene of any of this year's premieres, stars up-and-comer
Eric Close as a man whose brain is joined to a superbody by a
top-secret government agency.
</P>
<P>
   - Bill Rabkin and Lee Goldberg, professional show doctors who
have come in to mend ``Seaquest DSV'' and ``Diagnosis Murder.''
This summer they were brought in to perform surgery on ``Martial
Law,'' a Saturday-night action-adventure that in its first season
was best known for its entertaining fight scenes and for star Sammo
Hung's terrible English.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rabkin and Goldberg, half the cast has been replaced. The
writer-producers also are punching up the show's dialogue, which at
times last season could be embarrassingly bad. Goldberg also
promised that Hung's co-star, Arsenio Hall, ``isn't going to be
such a wuss'' this season.
</P>
<P>
   - Perhaps the biggest name recruited to network television this
fall is Joel Silver, the producer of such trigger-happy action hits
as ``Die Hard'' and ``Demolition Man.'' Silver serves as executive
producer of two series this fall: ``Action'' on Fox and ``The
Strip,'' a new action hour, for UPN.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it together
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the budget for one Silver film could bankroll several
TV series. And there are easier ways to make a fortune. As I
visited some of the Los Angeles sets where TV shows were filming in
mid-August, 14- to 16-hour days, six to seven days a week, were
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   On a stage in Culver City, a single scene from ``Action'' took
most of a day to shoot, over and over from different camera
positions. At the other end of the spectrum was the industrious
second unit of ``Martial Law,'' which films that show's numerous
outdoor and action scenes. They were moving methodically from setup
to setup, shooting as many as 75 scenes in a day.
</P>
<P>
   And at a Santa Monica recording studio, a roomful of actors
worked late into the night, supplying voices for scenes in
``Mission Hill'' that were still being drawn in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer productivity and variety, there is nothing else to
match the TV industry in August as dozens of programs churn out
their orders of 13 or more episodes.
</P>
<P>
   In August, no one knows which of the new shows will still be on
the air in December. In the oft-heard phrase that every producer
and network suit is trained to use, they're ``just trying to make
the best show possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a little mind-boggling to consider that roughly
three-fourths of these productions will close up shop sometime this
season based on a handful of Nielsen ratings reports. But those
sacrifices are made by the networks to keep their advertisers
happy. And advertisers, after all, are the ones who allow this
spendy cycle of show production to continue year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Chris Thompson, a veteran producer whose credits
include ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' and ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' This
season Thompson created and is executive producing ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a purely creative exercise, you wouldn't want to do
anything but cable,'' Thompson said. ``You're left virtually alone.
The shows don't have to be 21 minutes and 45 seconds. The world is
opened up to you, subject-wise and language-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``the thing about the networks is bags _
gigantic bags _ of money.''

COMEDIES ARE RISQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is it possible to describe even one scene from
this fall's hottest new comedy in a family newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   We're going to try.
</P>
<P>
   When comedian Jay Mohr first read through the script for
``Action''_ a raucous sitcom about life behind the scenes in
Hollywood _ he loved it. Then he called up Joel Silver, who as
executive producer of ``Action'' had offered Mohr the lead role,
and turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Joel, there's no way that what I read is going to be
on television,' '' said Mohr, a former ``Saturday Night Live''
player best known for playing Tom Cruise's nemesis in the film
``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Silver assured Mohr; Fox had already agreed to
green-light the script, even though it was full of obscenities. The
plan was to film the scenes, then simply bleep out any
objectionable words and use different camera angles so viewers
couldn't read the actors' lips.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like this had been tried before on network TV _ yet sure
enough, a second, Fox-approved script soon arrived, dirty words and
all. Mohr took the part.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is an extreme case, ``Action,'' which premieres
tonight, is not the only new sitcom this fall willing to risk the
wrath of viewers, and family-values watchdogs, in order to stand
out.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in CBS's ``Ladies' Man'' (premiering Sept. 20), also from
the creator of ``Action,'' an obnoxious Stephen Root declares his
envy of gay men because ``they have the best clothes ... and the
sex! The sex is phenomenal!''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC comedy ``Oh Grow Up'' (Sept. 22) features two straight
men living with a male friend who's recently come out of the closet
and is divorcing his wife. It's a premise the show's creator admits
would not have gotten on TV even five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fall's only new animated series, ``Mission Hill'' on the WB
(Sept. 21), also promises to test the limits of broadcast
acceptability by exploring the sex lives of its post-college-aged
characters. The group's next-door neighbors, a gay couple in their
60's, may also raise some eyebrows; in their very first appearance,
they are seen making out in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   No network, however, is pushing the envelope harder than Fox.
Doug Herzog, Fox's head of entertainment, was an executive at
Comedy Central for four years, where he was best known for
shepherding ``South Park,'' the raunchy cartoon that was the first
weekly series to earn a TV-MA rating (adults only). Like
``Action,'' ``South Park'' avoided the censor's pen by bleeping out
foul language.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer sexual aggressiveness, nothing on ``South Park''
comes close to the dialogue of ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Mohr plays an arrogant, hotheaded movie producer; Illeana
Douglas (``Grace of My Heart'') plays his current love interest and
a script-reader in Mohr's office; and Cindy Ambuehl plays Mohr's
ex-wife who happens to be married to his boss.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to watch a scene from ``Action'' filmed, as I
did last month, with the knowledge that viewers would hear none of
the choicer exchanges nor even see them mouthed. This is a point
Mohr likes to make with the show's critics: ``How do you know I'm
not just saying `biscuits and flapjacks'?''
</P>
<P>
   Trust me _ they don't say ``flapjacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In this scene, filmed for the second episode of ``Action,''
Douglas and Ambuehl are meeting for the first time:
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be difficult to work with such a small staff,''
Ambuehl says, using a thinly-veiled sexual metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas replies in kind. ``He tells me I'm the best he's ever
had in that position,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   You want insults? Ambuehl calls Douglas, in one word, a loose
woman. Douglas fires back, calling Ambuehl a ``skank.'' Ambuehl
calls Douglas, in one word, a female dog.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas looks at Ambuehl's cleavage and says: ``Who did your
(bleeps), Jack the Ripper?''
</P>
<P>
   Another line in the same scene would become a bone of contention
between Mohr and the episode's director, Byron Gordon. Mohr's line
was, ``Where the (bleep) am I supposed to come up with $50
million?''
</P>
<P>
   After several takes, in which Mohr varied the tone and ad lib of
the line, Gordon asked Mohr for one more take _ this time without
the curse word. Mohr refused and walked off the set.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his trailer, Mohr said he knew this was all part of an
elaborately silly tango with the network's word police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game you play with censors. You have 18 four-letter
words but you really only need three. And you drop so many of them
that, hopefully, you take their attention away from the ones you
really need. I learned that at `Saturday Night Live.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason, omitting this one word stuck in Mohr's
craw.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the one percent chance that (scene) got in without the
swear word, and I saw it, I'd throw my TV set out the window and
probably walk off the show,'' said Mohr, adding, ``Then realize
what I was getting paid and come back.''
</P>
<P>
   But why so bothered over a line that won't be heard or (after
editing) seen? To Mohr, it's a creative issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm talking with my friends, I don't say, `Kiss my
behind, you doodyhead,' '' Mohr said. ``We want this show to
represent reality the way it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's creator, Chris Thompson, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with doing a story about show business or rock and
roll is they always sound too phony because the meaty stuff is
always too wild for television,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Thompson, a veteran producer who got his start
writing for the 1976 sitcom ``Sirota's Court,'' created ``Bosom
Buddies'' in 1980, a show best remembered for the unknown cast as
Peter Scolari's sidekick _ Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson wrote the pilot of ``Action'' for HBO, since he assumed
no broadcast network would touch it. But when HBO hesitated over
money, Herzog told the producers he'd like to put it on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   As Thompson recalled it, ``Joel and I actually went to him and
said, `We don't think you can.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Herzog proved them wrong. Thompson is convinced that the
networks are embracing concepts like his because it's the only way
to keep up with cable, which continues to siphon viewers from the
broadcast side and is known for being more permissive on content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this show succeeds or fails, it represents a pylon in
the bridge between broadcast and cable television,'' said Thompson.
``I imagine in 10 years you won't be able to tell the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay characters
</P>
<P>
   One of the most noticeable changes in TV comedy this season is
the predominance of gay characters _ the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation counted 28 of them _ and the acceptability of
gay storylines.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ball, who created ``Oh Grow Up'' for ABC, said the industry
has two shows to thank for that: ``Ellen,'' which recreated its
star's real-life coming-out in an episode; and ``Will &AMP; Grace,''
last year's sitcom sensation, featuring two gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay characters have become less threatening, and I'm glad,''
said Ball, ``because otherwise it would be three guys living
together and dating three different women every week and it would
be boring. The house I lived in was a mixture of gay men and
straight men and you never see anything like that on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball based ``Oh Grow Up'' on his own shared-living experience
seven years ago while writing plays in Brooklyn, N.Y., as well as
on his own coming-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television has always changed, in what you're able to do and
what you're able to say,'' said Thompson. ``I watched that Olsen
Twins show (last season on ABC) and there were jokes on there we
couldn't have done on `Laverne &AMP; Shirley' when I was producing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the foreign sales of ``Action'' are any indication,
American TV has just begun to shock its audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've asked me to shoot more European versions,'' said
Thompson. ``We're literally being asked to spice it up for France
and the Balkan nations.''

POVERTY IN THE LAND OF PLENTY

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The economy is booming. Jobs are everywhere.
Everybody's income is rising. So why do we feel so poor?
</P>
<P>
   Some statistics: In the San Francisco Bay Area, families earn 33
percent more than families in other parts of the country, but homes
cost four times the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon: Designer cardboard boxes for the middle-class
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Some feelings: A 30-year-old woman I know feels trapped in the
apartment she's rented for five years with two roommates. She hates
living like a college kid, but she pays only $500 a month and can't
afford to live alone with studios going for $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   The only way she can quit living with roommates and their
irritating habits is to get married to someone with a good income.
If they managed to buy a house, they wouldn't be able to fill it
with kids _ or even the standard Bay Area allotment of one kid _
because they'd both have to keep working to pay the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   This is an educated woman with a good income, yet she feels as
trapped in that apartment as any sharecropper ever did in the old
South.
</P>
<P>
   OK, she has one heck of a sharecropper's cabin, with hardwood
floors and a view of the Bay. But she has to share that view with
two roommates and whomever they invite over to drink all her wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal says that the Bay Area, with its
technology-driven economy, may be the leading edge of a national
trend. The Journal quoted Cornell economist Robert Frank, who said,
``Extra spending at the top raises the price of admission.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of admission around here is very steep. And man, is
there a lot of extra money to spend for those at the top.
</P>
<P>
   More statistics: Last year, the average corporate chief
executive made 419 times the earnings of the average worker. A
century ago the big boss made only 19 times as much as a worker,
and as recently as 1990 chief executive officers made ``only'' 85
times as much as workers.
</P>
<P>
   Even those of us who were lucky enough to buy a house 10 or 15
years ago _ when we thought they were overpriced at, say, $150,000
_ could sell those houses and make four times what we paid for
them. But we'd have to leave the Bay Area to find another home.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way we want to get into the Bay Area housing market
and have to bid against newly minted millionaires at Internet
companies. No stock options equals no options.
</P>
<P>
   We may look rich by the standards of the rest of America, but
we're just the new Bay Area proletariat.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in this world are chained to two incomes and homes and
apartments they can't afford to leave _ if they managed to get one
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Who ever thought class warfare would look like this? In West
Virginia and Illinois, there are plenty of thin, grimy coal miners
who have faced down fat, unscrupulous mine operators. There is
gritty old-fashioned exploitation in the Bay Area, too, but we also
have the peculiarly intense class warfare between those who drive
Honda Accords and those who drive BMW 7-series.
</P>
<P>
   Workers making 50 grand a year put on ties and go to their
neatly appointed cubicles (which may be bigger than their
apartments) and face inscrutable interoffice e-mail from the
28-year-old company president who says ``cool'' too much.
</P>
<P>
   Who ever thought a ruling class would look like this? Rich
people, the chief executives of Internet companies and their
investors, wear jeans and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   While the middle class tries to keep its homes neat, the upper
class is putting outhouses in front of their homes. The latest
status symbol is a Port-a-Potty for contractors building additions
to the family manse.
</P>
<P>
   The rich people, driven from their homes by contractors (the
rich's particular tormentors), are trying to run us off the road
with their $50,000 SUVs while they're on the car phone making a
reservation to eat a $26 piece of fish.
</P>
<P>
   The class warfare is intense, and the only way Bay Area workers
without stock options can cast off their chains is if they arise
and move to El Paso, Iowa City or Providence.
</P>
<P>
   No, forget Providence. Even my pleasantly seedy hometown in
Rhode Island is getting too expensive, and now has its own TV shows
and movies, just like San Francisco. Some parts of Providence even
have yuppies sitting on the sidewalk drinking caffe lattes.
</P>
<P>
   You can't go home again, contrary to what they say on
``Providence,'' the show.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, who'd want to leave a region with our sense of art and
partying, anyway? ``Party Down,'' a sculpture made partly from a
12-pack of empty Corona bottles, was part of an exhibition at the
California College of Arts and Crafts _ until last weekend, when a
janitor took the bottles to a recycling center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a drag,'' said artist L.G. Williams, ``because it took me
a whole afternoon last week to empty all those bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator of the exhibition rushed out to a liquor store,
and the artist went back to work.

   LEAD: Lead poisoning of children always has been a problem in
Kansas City, but it's only been in the past couple of years that
health authorities have taken a really aggressive approach to
prevention. Armed with federal grant money, new equipment and
tougher laws, hundreds more children now are being tested, and
dozens of homes are being cleaned of lead. Health authorities have
had to work at changing attitudes of doctors, who didn't think lead
was still a problem. And they have had to seek out and train
contractors to do the remediation work. In some Kansas City zip
codes, as many as 26 percent of kids tested have high blood lead
levels, which can reduce IQ and cause learning disabilities, high
blood pressure and kidney damage. Graphics. Photos. Alan Bavley.

   ABORT: If this year's abortion debate in Missouri has left you
mystified, you're not alone: The two sides seem to talk past each
other, claiming hidden meanings, evil agendas and tortured
reasoning behind the wording of House Bill 427. The bill, the focal
point of the legislature's annual veto session that begins
Wednesday, bans a procedure known as partial-birth abortion by
defining it as child-killing. But that is the only point of
agreement between supporters of the bill, led by the Missouri
Catholic Conference, and Gov. Mel Carnahan, who vetoed it in July.

   EVE (with ABORT): Last-minute maneuverings in Jefferson City

abortion bill. Meanwhile, both sides are scrambling for votes at

   FAR: We are looking for Missouri officials' reaction to the

allegedly murdered an elderly KC woman. We're talking to the

   TEN. Those wacky Kansans just can't get through the day without
arguing about religion, it seems; in Manhattan, Kan., the debate
has gone on for months over the Ten Commandments, specifically as
inscribed on a five-foot-tall piece of granite that once stood
outside City Hall; the City Commission has re-inflamed passions by
agreeing to settle a lawsuit challenging display of the
commandments; the council has promised to never again place them on
public property and will pay $12,000 in legal costs for two
out-of-town activist organizations; now the issue may be headed for
a special election; ``We just can't keep talking about this,''
laments Mayor Roger Reitz, who voted for the settlement. John A.

INDEPENDENT 3COM FACES A TOUGH NEW COMPETITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the 3Com Corp. spins off its popular Palm
handheld computer division, it will be fighting off a challenge
from an upstart portable computing manufacturer, headed by the same
people who invented the Palm technology.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara-based 3Com announced Monday that it was spinning off
the division that manufactures the Palm line of small hand-held
organizers, called Personal Digital Assistants, or PDAs. Meanwhile,
Handspring Inc. of Mountain View is unveiling its ``Visor'' line of
PDAs.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor is based on the 3Com software that powers the original
Palm PDAs. It easily lets a user handle a digital phone book,
expense records, calendar and the like.
</P>
<P>
   That software, called an operating system or OS, is responsible
for the success of the Palm, 3Com's ubiquitous gray handheld
organizer that dominates the portable computing market.
</P>
<P>
   There have been more than 5 million Palm devices sold to date, a
number that accounts for 70 percent of the hand-held computer
market.
</P>
<P>
   3Com, in an effort to become the Microsoft of portable
computing, has licensed the Palm OS to rival makers of personal
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The first serious challenge to the Palm's dominance using that
Palm OS is Handspring, which was founded by the creators of the
PalmPilot, the original Palm PDA model.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a competitor and a partner,'' said Donna Dubinsky, the
chief executive of Handspring. Dubinsky and Handspring Chairman
Jeff Hawkins invented and marketed the first Palm Pilot in 1996 for
U.S. Robotics, which was later acquired by 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our use of the Palm OS is very supportive of 3Com,'' she said.
``We could've gone ahead and used someone else's software.''
</P>
<P>
   The Visor is a formidable Palm rival. It is lighter and slightly
more compact than the Palm IIIs, though it is bulkier than the
sleek, brushed-aluminum Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   The device is available in a range of translucent candy colors,
like the popular iMac manufactured by Apple Computer Inc. of
Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the Visor will be significantly less than the Palm
series. Handspring says the new device will retail for $149 to
$249, while the 3Com units cost from $229 for the Palm IIIe to $449
for the Palm V. 3Com's newest PDA, the Palm VII, costs $599 but is
only available in limited markets.
</P>
<P>
   What sets the Visor apart from its Palm competitors is its
so-called ``Springboard'' slot that will allow the device to hook
into two-way pagers, cell phones or digital-music MP3 players. The
Visor will only be available on the company's Web site, and will be
available on store shelves early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing remotely similar,'' said Dubinsky, who added
that the development of the device began in October 1998. ``That's
extremely fast for something that's never been built before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Visor challenge won't go unmet. 3Com is expected to
introduce a new and inexpensive line of Palm PDAs later this year,
offering a translucent candy-colored iMac shell similar to the
iMac.

A HUGE SPLASH IN THE DESERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ruling family of Dubai certainly thinks big. Last Wednesday,
the sheiks not only made the world's richest race richer by raising
the purse of the Dubai World Cup from $4 million to $6 million, but
also added an undercard for the March 25 event worth another $6
million. The Emirates Racing Association, headed by defense
minister Sheik Mohammad al-Maktoum, has, in effect, inaugurated its
own Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup card, which will be held at Gulfstream Park
Nov. 6, offers eight races worth a total of $13 million, with the
$4 million Classic anchoring the program. Dubai World Cup Day now
offers seven races worth $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dubai Duty Free, previously run at 1 1/4 miles on the dirt
(as are both the Cup and the Classic), has been switched to 1 1/8
miles on the turf, and the purse was raised from $500,000 to $2
million. The Dubai Turf Classic, raced at 1 1/2 miles, has been
renamed the Dubai Sheema Classic, and its purse raised from
$500,000 to $2 million. The Nad al-Sheba Sprint has been renamed
the Dubai Golden Shaheen, and is up from $250,000 to $1 million.
Added to the program are the $500,000 United Arab Emirates Derby,
on the dirt for 3-year-olds at 1 1/8 miles; the $250,000 Godolphin
Mile, on the dirt; and the $250,000 Dub Kahayla Classic, which is
for Arabian horses over a mile and one-16th.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the fifth running of the Dubai World Cup. The big
race has been the sole major attraction, and only the connections
of handicap horses who could handle dirt were interested in
shipping over. Now, turf horses will be enticed by both the Duty
Free and Sheema Classic; while sprinters, who usually run for
relatively short money, will be scrambling to enter the Golden
Shaheen. Now that Sheik Mohammad's Godolphin Stable is interested
in the Kentucky Derby (they took their first shot this year with
Worldly Manner, who finished seventh), the UAE Derby will serve as
a major prep for the Godolphin Triple Crown hopefuls, plus anyone
else who cares to participate.
</P>
<P>
   What Sheik Mohammad has done is take a one-race wonder _ The Cup
_ and turn it into an international day of racing, second (?) only
to the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission given to us by His Highness Sheik Mohammad bin
Rashid al-Maktoum and his brothers is one of excellence,'' said Les
Benton, chief executive of the Emirates Racing Association. ``Our
intention is not only to create one of the most significant days of
racing anywhere in the world, but also to make this highly
competitive range of championship races appealing to racing
enthusiasts and viewers around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: ``Think big.''

   Guess what? Trainer Bob Baffert has another star on his hands.
As if Baffert's barn, which includes such standouts as
Silverbulletday, General Challenge, and Forrestry, isn't powerful
enough, Forest Camp emerged to capture the Grade II $250,000 Del
Mar Futurity in a dazzling performance last Wednesday. Baffert was
so strong at Del Mar that he became the first trainer to sweep all
five Grade I races during the meeting, and he conditioned three of
the five starters in the Futurity. But it was Forest Camp, a son of
Deputy Minister, who came through with flying colors. Now 2 for 2,
Forest Camp took the lead passing the three-eighths pole, and drew
away to a victory of nearly 6 lengths in the time of 1:21 3/5 for 7
furlongs. ``He improved a whole bunch,'' said rider David Flores.
``We wanted to get him to relax and he did. He could be any kind.
He's amazing.'' Baffert has now won the Del Mar Futurity four
consecutive years, and he pronounced Forest Camp his ``most
impressive winner.'' Baffert said he will mull over where the
promising juvenile will start next . . . Saratoga, which closed a
36-day stand last week, had another sensational meeting. The
average on-track handle was $3,110,265, up 5.4 percent, and the
average attendance was 25,562, up 3.7 percent. Jerry Bailey won the
riding title with 47 winners, while Bill Mott led the trainers with
16.

   The Red Sox and Boston radio station WEEI will sponsor a
luncheon Friday to benefit the Rudy Baez Assistance Fund. Baez,
long the top jockey in New England, was paralyzed from the waist
down when he was thrown from his mount in a race at Rockingham Park
Aug. 4. He is undergoing rehabilitation at a clinic in New Jersey.
The luncheon will be held at 12:30 p.m. at the 600 Club at Fenway
Park, and is being billed as ``Lunch with Pedro.'' Ace hurler Pedro
Martinez is from the Dominican Republic, as is Baez, and he is
pitching in to help out. Tickets, which are limited to 50, cost
$1,000 each. They can be obtained by calling Eddie Andelman, the
WEEI talk-show host who is a racing fan and originated the idea, at
617-375-8065, or John Ramsay, marketing director at Suffolk Downs,
at 617-568-3313. Baez lives in Wakefield, Mass. with his wife,
Judy, and he has three children, Camilla, Jessica, and Christopher.
Funds are needed to remodel his house to accommodate his condition.
Donations of any amount can be sent to: Rudy Baez Assistance Fund
c/o Eastern Bank. Attn: Rachael Sosnowski, 125 Washington St., Box
309, Salem 01970 . . . Suffolk will show the Oscar De La Hoya-Felix
Trinidad bout from Las Vegas Saturday. The card starts at 9 p.m.
and will be offered free on the second floor of the clubhouse. For
real boxing buffs, there will be a buffet dinner in the Turf Club
prior to De La Hoya-Trinidad honoring two top fighters of
yesteryear, Carmen Basilio and Tony DeMarco. In 1955, Basilio
stopped DeMarco, who is from the North End, in the 12th round of
two title bouts. Basilio and DeMarco will be on hand to comment on
the film of their battles. Tickets for the Basilio-De Marco dinner
are $60 and are available from the Valenti Ticket Agency at
617-227-9332 or from Suffolk at 617-567-3900.

   That's right. I'm done. There will be no more New England pro
sports predictions from me. I've even shredded my registered
Prediction Card. Making predictions here was always tricky, but
this year it has become impossible. Michael Jordan retired (the
first time) because he said he had nothing to prove; I am retiring
because the more I predict, the more I prove . . . nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Want to do me a favor? Please send all miscellaneous items _
including shuffleboard instructions and the famous ``DEWEY DEFEATS
TRUMAN'' headline _ to my new Florida residence. It is obvious that
the pro prediction game has passed me by.
</P>
<P>
   I know I am not alone. If you listened to people in March, you
would have thought the Red Sox were the 1990s version of the '62
Mets. And if you were listening three days ago, the Patriots and
Pete Carroll were going to have to play their best to beat up on
(St.) Bill Parcells and the Jets. In fact, the Jets of three days
ago were the first team in pro football history to secure a spot in
the conference championship game by September.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is understandable. The local sports prediction
business has become craftier and developed a wicked sense of humor.
So what appears to be obvious really is not. You look at a Red Sox
team that has lost Mo Vaughn and figure there is no way the team
will be able to compete for the top spot in the American League
East. You see the Pats lose two of their starting linebackers from
last season and guess that Parcells will target that area to gain a
Week 1 win.
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid to guess what's next. Antoine Walker, Rick Pitino,
and David Stern hoisting a championship banner to the ceiling of
the FleetCenter next spring?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the previous statement was not a prediction. I am
retired. After Sept. 26 _ the date the Pats play the Giants at
Foxboro Stadium _ there will be no more local predictions from me.
Ask me how many games the Carolina Panthers will win this season
and I will answer, ``Six.'' Ask me what the Sox will be doing in
late October and I'll shrug, ``I don't know. What? Celebrating
their World Series win?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm going to enjoy retirement. I may even watch some of
those pregame shows where people sit around and predict the future.
I'll turn to my Shuffleboard Rotisserie League buddies and say, ``I
used to do that before I retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Patriots tackle Bruce Armstrong explained how
non-retirees get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregame shows have gone from 30 minutes, to 60 minutes, to 90
minutes,'' he said. ``We only play once a week, but there are five
or six days when people are analyzing football. That's good, but
there was a lot of talk about what we were going to do before we
even played a game. How many of those people watched us practice?
Nobody really knows what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the case with the Pats, on the field and off.
Really, who could have predicted that Carroll would have a better
coaching day than Parcells? Not only did Parcells lift a slightly
effective Tom Tupa for an ineffective Rick Mirer in the fourth
quarter, he endorsed his offensive coordinator's call to pass late
in the fourth quarter when he should have been running out the
clock. He pays Curtis Martin $6 million a season to run in
situations such as those, but he strangely put the game in the
hands of a shaky, seven-year backup.
</P>
<P>
   Since I am on my way to retirement, I won't tell you what fans
here would have said if Carroll had done what Parcells did.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been talk that Parcells knew a secret that
allowed him entry to Drew Bledsoe's psyche. That theory also joins
me in retirement, especially after Bledsoe's 21-of-30, 340-yard
performance. And don't forget the chatter that Carroll's poor
offseason conditioning program in '98 partly exlained his team's
rampant injuries. One week into the season, Parcells is now missing
his second-best receiver, lead kickoff returner, and starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't even the most puzzling aspect to Sunday's game.
The Jets rely on a solid zone defense, but the feeling on Sunday
was that the Pats could score any time they wanted. And, as
cornerback Steve Israel mentioned after the team's meetings Monday,
``We made a lot of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this was not a case of a team playing far over
its head to get a win. The Pats did not look at themselves as
descendants of Joe Namath's Jets, shocking the sports world with a
win in Super Bowl III. They simply played a good game _ certainly
not great _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us back to the predicting business. It is so
deceiving that it makes you forget what is in front of you. It
baits you into thinking exclusively about all the holes the Pats
have and distracts you from the man they didn't have in their final
three games last season: Bledsoe. As you know by now, I am retired.
But before I retired I realized that Bledsoe and Pedro Martinez
have a lot in common. You have either of them on your team and you
feel a lot better about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   More important for the Pats, the only player talking about Tuna
today will be Shawn Jefferson. Monday, the receiver held a fishing
pole near his locker. Tuesday morning, he was expecting to fish 25
miles outside of Provincetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going tuna fishing,'' he said. He was not joking and did
not see the irony when someone tried to coax a quip out of him. Who
could have guessed that Jefferson would go tuna fishing after Tuna
Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   This business is crazy. So crazy that I would like to tell you
that the Bruins will be in trouble if they don't get Byron Dafoe
into camp soon. But, again, I'm retired. All I do now is watch the
games.

IT SHOULD BE A LOVELY SHOW IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let the show begin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite earlier gloomy reports on New England's annual foliage
show, it appears it will be colorful after all.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage is just part of the show. The season is perfect for
fairs, festivals, apple and pumpkin picking, hikes, white-water
rafting, canoe rides, and bicycle excursions.
</P>
<P>
   The fear this year was that the summerlong drought could cause a
more subdued color or the leaves peaking earlier and falling
faster. However, there is optimism for leaf peepers. While some
areas have been hit hard by the drought, the top foliage
destinations in New England _northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and
Maine _ have had enough rain to keep the leaves in good shape or
color.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forests in Maine are green, and from all indications, we
will have a beautiful fall foliage season,'' said Tom Doak, Maine
State Forest Service director. ``Crews did detect pockets of color
and that may indicate early color statewide. What that tells us is
that Maine trees will display fall color as expected,'' Doak said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Washington Valley in New Hampshire is reporting
above-average rainfall for the year, and is predicting brilliant
foliage hues through late October. ``We expect the full spectacle
of fall colors to delight us through a long and on-schedule fall
foliage season this year,'' said Janice Crawford, executive
director of the Mount Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently asked question at this time of year is,
``What day will the leaves turn color?'' ``We try not to predict
when the colors will be at their peak because Mother Nature has
ideas of her own,'' said Mary Jane McKenna, executive director of
the Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism. She adds,
``Visitors to Massachusetts should be less concerned about just how
spectular the leaves will be, and more concerned about getting a
(lodging) reservation.'' That advice is good throughout New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, though, Mother Nature does have a plan. Fall
colors begin in northern New England in mid-September, then slowly
head south, with the colors peaking in southern New Hampshire,
Maine, Vermont, the Berkshires and elsewhere in Massachusetts, and
the Connecticut border the first weeks of October.
</P>
<P>
   And, traditionally, the long Columbus Day weekend has been peak
viewing time throughout New England. The ``show,'' however, does
extend to the beginning of November. Connecticut likes to boast
that its geography makes it a perfect foliage destination. ``Just
as northern New England's fall foliage is winding down,
Connecticut's colors are getting ready for their big burst of
color,'' said Don Smith, Connecticut's Bureau of Forestry chief.
Smith adds that the show may be earlier because of the summer
drought. ``Columbus Day weekend is my recommendation for a foliage
outing _ I don't think you'll go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason New England's display of color is so good is that the
region is blessed with an abundance of deciduous forests, ample
rainfall, and favorable weather. Connecticut's Smith notes that,
according to Native American legend, ``Celestial hunters slew the
Great Bear autumn, and the spilled blood turned the leaves red. The
yellow of fall came from the fat splattering out of the kettle as
the hunters cooked their prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today how fall colors occur is often misunderstood. ``Many
people who call for foliage information believe trees start
producing different colors in the fall,'' said Susan Benson,
director of information for the Maine Department of Conservation.
``Perhaps that's why folks though the drought would devastate the
foliage color, and that just is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who is known in Maine as the ``leaf lady,'' said the
factors that influence autumn color include wind, rainfall, sugar
accumulations in the trees, and prolonged periods of cool, bright,
sunny fall weather without a killing frost. In summertime, the
leaves of Maine hardwoods _ such as white birch, red oak, and sugar
maple trees _ contain green, yellow, orange, and red pigments.
Chlorophyll produced during photosynthesis gives leaves their green
color and masks the red, yellow, and orange pigments. When the days
get shorter, chlorophyll production declines. The red, yellow, and
orange pigments begin to show and, eventually, become dominant.
Purple and red shades result from the autumn production of another
group of pigments.
</P>
<P>
   Red leaves appear on red and white oak; yellow only _ quaking
aspen, birch, hickory, Norway maple, tulip tree; red or yellow _
cherry, red maple; brown or yellow _ silver maple; bronze _ beech;
bronze or red _ sugar maple and scarlet oak; purple or red _
dogwood; purple, red, or yellow _ ash; purple, red, yellow, or
orange _ sassafras and sumac.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is making it easier to see the foliage show without
leaving home. In Maine, those visiting the www.state.me.us foliage
site can view actual photos taken by parks staff as the color
blankets the hills and mountains of the state. The Foliage Photo
Gallery is updated on the Web every three to five days.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you head this foliage season, you'll find lots
to do. Fairs and harvest festivals are everywhere, especially
Columbus Day weekend. Here is just a sampling of ideas:
</P>

RAIL LOVERS WANT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN _ FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis, the former Massachusetts governor and longtime
rail junkie, knew all about Amtrak's reputation for sluggishness,
but he swore this time it would be different. As much as anyone, he
wanted to take a train to New York City and Washington rather than
an airplane shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a satisfying trip to Washington in my last nine
trips,'' Dukakis, who is on Amtrak's board of directors, told a
transportation group in May. And he delighted in the idea that he
wouldn't have to wait much longer for high-speed service. ``The
Northeast Corridor will begin this fall, no foolin,' '' he pledged.
``October or November.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers in Pueblo, Colo., testing the first of 20 new Acela
high-speed trains, this summer discovered excessive wear on the new
wheels after the train went around curves. Ten days ago, they
reluctantly postponed the debut of long-awaited, 150-mile-per-hour
service to New York until spring _ maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, skeptics have begun the chorus of ``I told you so'' and are
questioning whether revitalized Northeast Corridor service,
whenever it happens, will live up to its billing, including
providing the revenue that will help Amtrak avoid bankruptcy and
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Amtrak's promises, many had suspected the nation's
largest passenger rail company, a debt-ridden, 29-year-old business
with a can't-do-anything-right reputation, wouldn't be ready with
high-speed rail by the end of 1999. A firm date won't be announced
until early November.
</P>
<P>
   The delay disappointed Dukakis and thousands of others who are
eager to trade driving, parking, riding a bus, flying, and long,
costly cab rides from the airport for a nostalgic mode of travel
whose time, they hope, has returned in America.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a fast train with comfortable seats, decent food,
and spacious, office-like work areas, one that runs on time and
arrives in the middle of its destination cities _ not a 45-minute
traffic jam away.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will cost a good deal more than the current $100
round-trip fare for a five-hour ride from Boston to New York,
frequent reliable service between the two cities is expected to cut
seriously into the airline industry's share of the Boston/New York
commuter market.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of rail advocacy groups interviewed last week
were universally sympathetic to Amtrak, and understanding of the
decision to put off the debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the right call,'' said John Haley, ex-general
manager of the MBTA who is now New Jersey transportation
undersecretary. ``No question, this is such a huge undertaking it's
got to be done right.''
</P>
<P>
   That means at least several more months of tweaking and
replacing parts in the so-called trucks, the steel frames that hold
the wheels of the new Acela (pronounced ah-CELL-ah) coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The all-new train, originally designated the Metroliner but
given a new name to connote excellence and acceleration, was
designed by the French company Alstom and built by the Canada-based
Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the trucks, rigid enough to allow a smooth
ride on long, straight stretches at up to 150 miles per hour, were
too stiff for the give-and-take necessary on curved portions of the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetan Roy, manager of truck systems for Bombardier, said the
wheels presented a ``little more serious problem'' than anything
expected in the trial period, which began in May. They had thought
May through December would be long enough to resolve any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking at fine-tuning the elements of the suspension
system,'' Roy said. Amtrak and Acela's designer and manufacturer
will battle it out later who is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, apparently discovered during the assembly
process, is that clearance distances between tracks on curves will
not allow the train's ``tilting'' mechanism to move to its full
5.6-degree position.
</P>
<P>
   The tilt gives passengers a comfortable ride even around curves
at high speeds. Bombardier officials said that, while the tilt
restriction will mean people will feel more centrifugal force, it
won't keep the trains from meeting their three-hour goal between
Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   James RePass, president of the National Corridors Initiative
(formerly the Northeast Corridor Initiative), gives Amtrak high
marks for having the guts to postpone. ``In the past, Amtrak would
have one train in December, a Potemkin train,'' RePass said.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak president George D. Warrington, RePass said, ``showed
real leadership'' by taking time to make sure things work. ``The
bottom line is they didn't anticipate every problem, because no one
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Davis, who is on the board of the National Association of
Rail Passengers and also president of Train Riders Northeast, said,
``I'm glad they found the problem out during testing rather than
having to take it out of service _ but what an embarrassing thing
for Amtrak.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis toured the first new train ``sets,'' as they're called, at
a plant in New York. He called them ``exciting, luxurious.'' And he
is looking forward eagerly to 2000, as the Amtrak high-speed
service begins and, later in the year, intercity service is
extended from Boston to Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year will really be the year of the train,'' he said,
though Davis has had numerous disappointments as Portland service
has been delayed and re-delayed. As one New Hampshire official
said, ``It's been two years away for 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak says in its promotional material that the Acela train
will ``change the face of travel in the Northeast United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of high-speed rail in the corridor is so important
that, to a large extent, the future of Amtrak rests on it. Amtrak
has estimated a positive impact of $400 million from new Northeast
Corridor service through 2002. Dukakis said Amtrak's estimate of
profits may even be conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has a goal of weaning itself from government
subsidies by the year 2002, despite recent annual losses of $800
million, so it has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   According to a July General Accounting Office report,
``uncertainty surrounds Amtrak's ability to achieve this.'' It said
much of the rail company's future is ``based on critical
assumptions . . . that have yet to be tested in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   All major intercity rail services in the world are subsidized.
Amtrak has received nearly $23 billion since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   If the Acela flies, and rail becomes the accepted way to go _ or
even just a popular alternative _ in the Northeast Corridor, other
regions of the country could follow along rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Two corridors in California and others in the Midwest, Pacific
Northwest, Southeast, and Gulf Coast are in planning stages or
early development.
</P>
<P>
   The Acela will offer two classes of express service between
Boston and Washington, with stops in Providence, New Haven, New
York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   It will also operate slower service to Buffalo and Albany, N.Y.,
and Harrisburg, Pa.; between Springfield, Mass., and New Haven; and
from Washington to Richmond and Newport News, Va.

JOHN PAUL JONES IS STILL YOUNG AT ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's common to hear rock stars retreat into a tame sound as they
grow older, maybe settling for the adult contemporary format or
even making a new-age album because they've mellowed from the
renegade days of their youth.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is John Paul Jones, the former Led Zeppelin
bassist, who releases his first solo album Tuesday (Sept. 14).
Entitled ``Zooma,'' it's a pedal-to-the-metal instrumental disc
that sounds like a bassist's answer to the heaviness of rock-jazz
guitarists Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really like doing is playing loud and fast and
noisily,'' Jones says from his home in London. ``That's the way
this record had to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who brings his first solo tour to the Paradise on Oct.
14, plays flashy, bass-boogie runs on the title track (in which he
sounds like Les Claypool of Primus), adds a rumbling bass line to
the aptly named ``Grind,'' and rocks with a customized 10-string
bass and bass lap steel on ``Goose.'' Elsewhere, he adds organ
(which he also played with Zeppelin), electric mandola, and some
otherworldly effects from his Kyma system _ a computer sound design
system that resynthesizes sound and may induce acid flashbacks for
those who remember such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always going to be an instrumental record,'' Jones
says. ``I knew if I got a singer, it wouldn't be my music. And I'm
not interested in the rock song format that much anymore. I like
when other people do it, but I'm not interested myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's evident that Jones has kept abreast of contemporary
music. He has Paul Leary, guitarist with the Butthole Surfers,
playing on one song. And when you ask him about '90s bands, he
appreciates the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tool, and Morphine, whose
bassist, Mark Sandman, was a rock minimalist with a primal feel.
``It was terribly sad to lose him,'' Jones says of Sandman's death
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The new album follows many years of Jones serving as producer
for such bands as the Butthole Surfers, Diamanda Galas, Mission UK,
Heart, and Elephant Ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``With producing, though, the amount of effort that I'd put in
just didn't seem worth it,'' says Jones. ``By the time the album
would come out, the A &AMP; R (artist and repertoire) guy would be
fired and the record would fall by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones then went into touring again and backed Galas on the road
in 1994. ``I was standing on a small stage and thought, `This is
why I became a musician. Maybe I could do this again _ make my own
album and tour behind it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His new band is a trio including drummer Terl Bryant (who has
been with Bauhaus and Aztec Camera) and Chapman stick player Nick
Beggs. ``He can do the bass parts when I'm doing the steel guitar
parts,'' Jones says. ``And I'm bringing the Kyma system, because
that works in real time and I can use it on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has had an active post-Zep career, but remains
disappointed that Zep bandmates Jimmy Page and Robert Plant didn't
tell him they were going on the road as Page and Plant. ``It was
more a lack of courtesy than anything else,'' says Jones. ``I guess
Plant didn't want it to be like Led Zeppelin, though they're doing
a lot of Zeppelin songs. But, really, once there was no more John
Bonham, there was no more Led Zeppelin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonham was the Zeppelin drummer whose 1980 death broke up the
band. And Jones misses him to this day. ``I was in the best band in
the world _ and it was hard to even think of a drummer after
Bonzo,'' he says, using Bonham's nickname. ``In fact, I wrote the
drum parts on my album and a lot of the ideas came from how we used
to interact. He was a very musical drummer. He could hit hard, but
temper it with a lot of detail.''
</P>
<P>
   For proof, Jones cites the ``BBC Sessions,'' a Zeppelin album of
1969 radio broadcasts released last year. ``Normally, the only time
I heard Bonzo was live on stage or on bad bootlegs. So it was
really nice to hear him recorded well,'' says Jones. ``We were a
really cocky band just oozing attitude back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is still oozing some of that attitude 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to work at all, as you can imagine,'' he says of
the financial success from Zeppelin. ``But, as a musician, I feel
the need to get out there again.'' And, yes, he's planning to do a
couple of Zeppelin songs on the road ``as long as I can do
instrumental versions of them.''

ONE EXAGGERATION, BUT FORTHRIGHTNESS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Justus Reid Weiner's `` `My Beautiful Old House' and
Other Fabrications by Edward Said,'' the lead article in the
September issue of Commentary magazine, has been making news on
four continents.
</P>
<P>
   Said, a Columbia University literature professor, is the leading
spokesman for the Palestinian cause in the United States. The Wall
Street Journal printed a lengthy excerpt from the Weiner article on
its op-ed page. The Daily Telegraph of London ran a Page 1 news
story. Two op-ed columns have appeared in the Globe. A rebuttal
from Said has had a wide circulation in the Arab press.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy concerns how much of the first 12 years of his
life Said spent in Palestine (the region of the Middle East that
comprises what is now Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank) and the
extent to which he may have misrepresented his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Two facts are not in dispute. Said was born in Jerusalem on Nov.
1, 1935, and his family left there late in 1947, several months
before Palestine was partitioned to produce Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner, a specialist in international law who is a scholar in
residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, clearly shows
that Said and his family spent most of his boyhood in Cairo. (An
article in the Jan. 16, 1998, issue of The Jerusalem Post Magazine
made similar allegations.)

   An examination of Said's writings indicates, however, that he
has never concealed his background. Such a statement as ``I was
born in Jerusalem and spent most of my formative years there,''
from a 1998 London Review of Books article, is clearly an
exaggeration. But he details his Cairo upbringing in his
just-published memoir, ``Out of Place,'' as well as in a 1987 House
and Garden article and refers to it in a 1992 interview published
in ``Edward Said: A Critical Reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner also calls into question a number of statements Said has
made concerning his time in Jerusalem, such as having attended St.
George's, an Anglican preparatory school. Haig Boyadjian, who
attended the school at the time Said says he did, confirmed in a
recent telephone interview from his New Jersey home that Said was a
classmate. ``He was the brightest boy in the class, several classes
running,'' said Boyadjian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is libel,'' Said said of the article during a recent
interview at his Columbia office. ``(Weiner) got everything wrong.
Basic things: He didn't know the relationships between various
members of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner, speaking in a telephone interview from Jerusalem,
dismissed Said's rebuttal. ``First, he says all of his childhood,
now it's 50-50 between Jerusalem and Cairo. It reminds me of
Filene's Basement: You go down there and there's a coat you want,
so you wait two weeks and it gets marked down 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Said supporters nor detractors are likely to feel
satisfied by the debate. They can look forward to its continuation.
Weiner said he has three other articles on Said in the works.

PAYNE HAS MADE GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Start with the knickers. They're such a
glaring part of his persona, where else to begin with Payne
Stewart?
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, early in his career, Stewart was on the
practice range when he looked around and saw players all dressed
the way he was. That bothered him, and he wanted a look that would
make him stand out from his colleagues, one that would give him an
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider him easily identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of his mystique,'' says Mark Lye, a former PGA Tour
player who now is part of the television team at The Golf Channel.
``But the funny part is, when he takes them off and puts on jeans
and a hat, no one recognizes him. So they don't piss him off when
he goes out and has dinner. I think he likes that.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as he enjoys dining in peace, Stewart craves
attention on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't want to be noticed, why would he wear the
plus-fours? Why would he want to be on the Ryder Cup team?'' says
Lye. ``You have to want the attention to be in the arena he's in.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight follows those in pursuit of golf championships,
and it intensifies greatly when the events are majors. Very few
players in our time have stood on this stage as frequently as
Stewart, now in its 18th year on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He has succeeded gloriously on a few occasions. He has failed
miserably in many more. That is the harsh reality about pro golf,
though Stewart _ 11 times a winner _ has had to deal with more
scrutiny than most because of the numbers that sit on his resume:
25 times a runner-up, 19 times third, 130 times Top 10. The US
Opens of 1986 (he melted when Ray Floyd fixed the stare), 1993 (he
couldn't overcome Lee Janzen's good fortune), and 1998 (he lost his
swing over the weekend) are the tournaments his critics will point
to quickly, but Stewart has survived and through it all one thing
has stood out about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anyone more honest, I can tell you that about
Payne Stewart,'' says Chuck Cook, Stewart's swing coach. ``He'll
tell you exactly what he's thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   A sports columnist discovered this during a visit to ``Golf Talk
Live'' on The Golf Channel last winter. It seems the columnist had
written a critical piece about Stewart following the 1998 US Open,
and now the golfer had a chance for rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   So Stewart dialed. And he asked, ``Do you know me? Have you ever
met me?''
</P>
<P>
   What followed were a few icy moments, though Stewart never lost
his composure and eventually got the reporter to agree it was a
hastily written column that never should have been filed. Stewart
had made his point, and a short time later the two met face-to-face
and made peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all fine after that,'' says Stewart. ``I just felt he
should have talked to me before writing what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stewart played on Ryder Cup teams in 1987, '89, '91, and '93. He
loved every second of it, embraced the team concept, and would have
waved pompoms if they were in his golf bag.
</P>
<P>
   Then the show went on without him in 1995. And 1997, too. Both
times he felt he could have been a captain's selection, but he was
in front of his TV instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, it wasn't a lot of fun,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not only wasn't he playing, but the team was losing, and a
nation's pride was taking a beating. Stewart is a guy who puts his
hand over his heart and belts out the national anthem, so you could
say he takes this red-white-and-blue stuff seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an honor to play for your country,'' he says. ``It's
a passion with me. It's the most intense golf I've ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Hokey, you say? Stewart doesn't care. He was raised in America's
heartland _ Springfield, Mo. _ and his pursuit of a pro golf career
took him to corners of the globe you probably did not know existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played all over the world and seen awful living
conditions,'' he says. ``I am thankful for what we have in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   What he now has is something he covets _ another spot on the
Ryder Cup team. It's a chance to help the US win for the first time
since 1993, which happens to be the last time he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm a rah-rah person,'' says Stewart. ``If I'm
teamed up in whatever I'm playing in and I have a partner, boy, I'm
going to be in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask me what my record is, I say it's 2-1-1. That's
my record. As a team we've won twice, lost once, tied once.
Individual records don't matter. It's a team effort. Players and
people have to understand that. That's what a veteran like myself
can bring to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   If that indeed is what he's bringing, he's doing so for one
reason _ he earned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't rely on (US captain Ben) Crenshaw to pick me, so
that's been the driving force for me,'' says Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that what probably worked against him in 1995 and 1997
was his reputation for not getting the job done. The '86 and '93
Opens. The double-bogey at the final hole of the 1985 Byron Nelson
that dropped him into a playoff, which he lost to Bob Eastwood.
Shots into the water late in singles losses in the 1989 and 1991
Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning golf is an out-of-body experience,'' says Lye, who has
known Stewart since the early 1980s. ``If you're not able to stay
in the zone, it's hard to hang on. Payne had trouble staying in the
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument, says Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne is a feel player, 100 percent feel,'' says Cook. ``But
he always lacked structure. Dick Coop gave him some structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart began working with Coop, a sports psychologist, in the
late 1980s, and it was Coop who suggested Cook as a swing coach.
They made for a pretty good team as Stewart posted two wins in
1989, including his first major (the PGA), two more in 1990, and
one in 1991 _ the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the critics attacked. Mike Reid blew the PGA, they said,
and Scott Simpson handed Stewart the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   A morsel of truth was in there, perhaps, though the gleam of his
championship hardware was what most people saw. That is, until he
changed equipment and began chasing appearance money all over the
golfing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to the wrong ball and the wrong equipment,'' says
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   After switching from a wound ball to a solid ball, Stewart went
winless in 1992-94 and plummeted to 123d on the money list. Though
Scott Hoch gift-wrapped a victory for Stewart at the 1995 Houston
Open, golf was not fun.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart didn't want to practice, barely wanted to compete, and
couldn't for the life of him figure out what was going on when he
hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Kemper one week, he had 180 yards and a 6-iron,'' says
Cook, ``He hit it 60 yards over the green. 240 yards! Then he goes
to the British Open and has 135 yards to go and he hits 6-iron into
the wind and barely hits 110 yards into the burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a feel player, he had to be asking, `Why?' But the ball
spun too much and the club spun too much.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart's career spiraled downward.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Start with the knickers if you like, but Lye also remembers
Stewart for the needles in the ears. A hypnotist had suggested them
to calm Stewart during pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironic,'' says Lye, ``because you could say his game has been
held together by pins and needles.''
</P>
<P>
   He means this in a flattering way, for Lye admires Stewart for
doing so much in a sport that features more gifted players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A classic overachiever, I think,'' says Lye, who not only
competed against Stewart but shared the stage with him, too. They
and Peter Jacobsen formed ``Jake Trout and the Flounders,'' a
for-fun rock band that cut an album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne played the harmonica,'' says Lye. ``At first he was
reluctant because he didn't want it to interfere with his golf
game. But he liked it. We all did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lye and Stewart were also on the Titleist staff in the early
1980s, along with Hal Sutton and Donnie Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne always said that Hal Sutton was the best player,'' says
Lye, ``but (Titleist's) Joe Turnesa would then tell us that Payne
told him he was going to win the British Open that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he had it in his mind that he would win a major
championship and he conned himself into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times now, thanks to his second US Open triumph, this past
June at Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It was an epic performance for two reasons: It came after his
heartache at The Olympic Club in 1998, when Stewart squandered a
four-shot lead through 54 holes and finished second, and it
culminated his oft-stated goal of returning to the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   At an age (42) when most of his colleagues were content to slide
into a more comfortable lifestyle and avoid the grind, Stewart in
1999 had done the opposite _ he had put himself in the pressure
cooker. He wanted on the Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Pinehurst may have sealed his Top 10 spot, but
two contributing factors paved the way, says Cook:
</P>
<P>
   ``His kids (Chelsea, 13; Aaron, 10) introduced him to religion.
They are raising him religously. And his faith definitely had
something to do with his win.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the dress rehearsal at Pinehurst that Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked the course and marked it (in our minds),'' says
Cook. ``Payne said, `Let's mark it in red,' but I said, `I don't
want to scare you,' so we marked it in blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``And do you know that he hit into that blue area only once all
week _ when he was short right on No. 2 Sunday. Other than that he
never missed it in the wrong place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an Open he was poised to give away. His one-shot
lead to start the round had disappeared and Stewart trailed Phil
Mickelson through 15 holes. Then came arguably the greatest putting
performance under US Open pressure: a 25-footer to save par at 16,
a short birdie putt at 17 to regain the lead, then a gut-wrenching
20-footer to save par at 18 and win the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have practiced that putt 150 times during the week,''
says Cook. ``He said to me, `They're gonna have the pin back there
one of these days.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So he practiced that putt. It looked like it would break left,
but it didn't. Payne knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Payne. The one who had the faith in himself to finish
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the old knickers, of course.

THE POET OF MULTI-TASKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You can't complain that journalists are ignoring the business
world these days.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has published ``The Sun
King,'' a novel about a commodity trader who buys a newspaper quite
a lot like the old Washington Star in order to romance his college
sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lewis next month will lead a trio of writers on Silicon
Valley with his ``The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story,''
about the adventures of entrepreneur Jim Clark. Po Bronson (``The
Nudist on the Late Shift'') and David Kaplan (``The Silicon Boys
and Their Valley of Dreams'') are the others.
</P>
<P>
   Buyout king Bruce Wasserstein, surely the most financially
successful reporter the University of Michigan's Michigan Daily
ever produced, Wednesday in New York will roll out the first
edition of his Daily Deal, with Robert Teitelman, formerly of
Institutional Investor, as editor _ $750 a year unless you're on
the carefully controlled list of those who get it delivered first
thing in the morning for free.
</P>
<P>
   None of these is more interesting, however, than former New York
Times science reporter James Gleick. He shares with Michael Herr
(``Dispatches'') and Tom Wolfe (``Bonfire of the Vanities'') the
distinction of having captured between hard covers, at least for a
time, the pretensions of an age.
</P>
<P>
   Gleick started in the early 1980s with a famous magazine profile
of philosopher Douglas Hofstadter. He wrote (in four months) his
1987 bestseller ``Chaos: Making a New Science,'' about esoteric new
work by a community of physicists and mathematicians, then put the
physicist Richard Feynman on the cultural map in 1993 with an
artful biography, ``Genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleick then cofounded the Manhattan Internet service provider
Pipeline, later sold it for something like $10 million, and built a
fancy house on the Hudson River an hour north of Manhattan. In 1997
the ultralight airplane he was piloting crashed. His 8-year-old son
was killed and Gleick lost a leg.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gleick is back with ``Faster: The Acceleration of Just About
Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   (The book has surged to sixth place on The Boston Globe
bestseller list; Gleick is scheduled to speak at MIT Thursday at 7
p.m. in building 26-100.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster'' is no milky bromide on seeking the Centered life.
Instead, it is a self-conscious paean to multitasking, a meditation
in 38 lapidary chapters on the various forces, mostly
technological, that have led to the compression of time. Much of it
takes the form of reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Gleick visits the Directorate of Time at the Naval Observatory
in Washington, D.C., where the Master Clock is kept _ an atomic
timepiece whose signal governs the synchronization of computers,
satellites, and television transmissions. He recounts the history
of stop-motion photography. He reflects on the significance of
all-night banking _ and on the moment at 7 a.m. on the last Monday
in February when callers throughout the United States bombard the
Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket Steamship Authority
with calls seeking to reserve ferry tickets for their summer
vacation, only to wind up in what he calls a ``telephone lottery.''
He describes the rise of the ``new accelerators'': caffeine in
drinks like Jolt and Surge, not to mention amphetamines known as
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Gleick told one interviewer: ``The dirty little secret of my
book is that I don't think there is any such thing (as hurry
sickness.) Except that we all think there is and that we've got a
terminal case. Some of our fears of hurry sickness show up in the
whole type A idea _ the notion that people who drive in the fast
lane and pound the Close Door button on elevators are heading for
heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't really turn out to be true, or at least no one
has ever proved it. But we do feel that we are more time-driven and
time-obsessed and generally rushed than ever before, and that is
true, and if it's a kind of disease, it's a social disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he says, for the hard drivers among us, time has
become a ``negative status good.''

 NEW YORK: ... fountain pen.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Orientalism'' (1978), his best-known book, has been translated
into 31 languages. Drawing on intellectual history, literary
analysis, and political polemic, it argues that Western scholars
who studied the cultures of ``the Orient'' (Said's focus is on the
Middle East but his argument applies to all of Asia) were a key
part of the process that saw Europe, and later the United States,
dominate, or even subjugate, those cultures.
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades after its publication, ``Orientalism''
still inspires often-heated debate. ``It basically initiated the
cultural theory of post-colonialism,'' says MIT's Khoury. ``That
theory has had enormous influence over two generations of scholars
in a variety of humanistic disciplines working on the Middle East,
South Asia, China, and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Orientalism'' was born on the westernmost edge
of the Orient, in Jerusalem, in 1935. He grew up in a cosmopolitan
milieu that included Palestinian, Egyptian, Lebanese, British, and
American elements.
</P>
<P>
   Said's father owned a highly successful office-supply business
with branches in Jerusalem and Cairo. Thanks to several years spent
in the United States and Army service during World War I, he held
US citizenship. Said's mother was Palestinian and Lebanese. (The
family spent every summer for nearly three decades in Lebanon, and
Said's wife, Mariam, is a Lebanese Quaker.) Making the Saids all
the more exotic was their Episcopalian faith.
</P>
<P>
   After attending several English and American schools in
Jerusalem and Cairo (the late King Hussein of Jordan and the actor
Omar Sharif were among his schoolmates at one of the latter), Said
spent two years at a Massachusetts boarding school, Mount Hermon.
He then went to Princeton and, despite what he describes as its
``poisonous social atmosphere,'' flourished there. (Said says his
alma mater has changed since those days, and both his son and
daughter are Princeton alums.) At Harvard, he wrote his thesis on
Joseph Conrad _ not insignificantly, another literary displaced
person. ``I've always had that sense (of exile),'' Said points out.
``In literary studies and writing, it gives a certain edge to one's
writing. You see things in a new way.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Six Day War, in 1967, that moved Said to political
activism. He had been teaching at Columbia for four years when, for
the first time, he found himself publicly taking up the Palestinian
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never regretted it,'' he says. ``My generation felt, I
think, that our kind of people, the educated, privileged people,
were the ones who deserted Palestine. My parents used to say that
politics was for the other people, the riffraff. I think that's
very wrong. The whole idea of citizenship is very important for me.
I can't imagine things being any different.''
</P>
<P>
   In purely personal terms, the most painful aspect of Said's
political work may be the difficulties it can create with Jewish
acquaintances and colleagues. ``Very awkward,'' Said says. Among
his friends is Daniel Barenboim, the pianist and conductor who is
music director of the Chicago Symphony. Last month, they
collaborated with the cellist Yo-Yo Ma on a workshop in Germany and
Austria for young Israeli and Arab musicians. Barenboim once
conducted a concert on the West Bank and later remarked to Said,
``You know, it feels very funny being the only Jew in an auditorium
full of Arabs.'' Said's reply: ``How do you think I feel in New
York?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anti, but not anti-Jewish
</P>
<P>
   Said is particularly sensitive to charges that being
anti-Israeli is tantamount to being anti-Jewish. ``I've always
argued to Arabs,'' he says, ``and I think I'm the only person who
has done this, in print, on the record, in Arabic, that it's
absolutely necessary for us as people _ Arab and Palestinian _ to
understand the Holocaust. . . . The fact is these people went
through real suffering, and I've used the phrase `communities of
suffering': that we are one and they are one.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends detect an added urgency to Said's political writing in
this decade. He was diagnosed as having a deadly form of cancer in
1991, chronic lymphocytic leukemia. After several years of
unsuccessful chemotherapy and radiation, he began a three-month
experimental treatment last year. ``They were the 12 most difficult
weeks of my life,'' Said says. Constantly ill, he lost 30 pounds
and saw two other participants in the trial die.
</P>
<P>
   That was a little more than a year ago. He looks to be in
excellent health. He swims daily and finds time for an occasional
tennis match. ``The only problem,'' Said notes in a matter-of-fact
tone, ``it's slowly coming back.'' He'll likely require treatment
again next year, and another successful outcome is by no means
certain. ``I must say it gives some anxiety if I think about it _
which is why I don't particularly want to think too much about it.
So I just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Out of Place,'' Said writes that his father's motto was
``Never give up.'' Might that be his also? ``There's a certain kind
of tenacity,'' he replies. ``When I feel I'm going to be pushed
down or overwhelmed I find I have a second wind. I'm very lucky to
have that quality. There were many situations in my life when I
didn't think I was going to make it, and I did.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shelves that line the walls of Edward W. Said's
spacious Columbia University office hold the sorts of books one
would expect to find surrounding a man who is both one of America's
most eminent literary critics and its best-known advocate of the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a work of literature or politics that Said
(pronounced sigh-EED) was searching his shelves for one recent
afternoon to show a visitor. It was a copy of the 1947 annual
directory for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to conflict, Said, 63, finds himself embroiled in
what is surely the oddest controversy of a consistently
controversial career. At issue aren't his present views but past
whereabouts. An article in the September issue of Commentary, a
leading neoconservative journal published by the American Jewish
Committee, charges that Said, a US citizen of Palestinian
extraction, has misrepresented the facts of his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The article cites a range of documents and interviews to argue
that Said spent most of his first 12 years in Cairo rather than
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Said, who counters that he has never concealed his time in Egypt
or claimed to have grown up exclusively in Jerusalem, angrily
dismisses the Commentary article as ``misinformation and
noninformation.'' He cites several factual errors in Justus Reid
Weiner's piece and questions his motives.
</P>
<P>
   The question of where Edward Said was, and was not, during his
formative years might appear peripheral, at best, to such momentous
issues as peace and sovereignty in the Middle East. Yet the very
terms of such a debate _ with the questions they raise about
identity, authenticity, and even something so seemingly
straightforward as physical location _ serve to frame both a region
and a life that have been defined by personal displacement and
geopolitical struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Said has just published a memoir, ``Out of Place.'' The title is
at once matter-of-fact and mournful, referring not just to the
dislocation of the Palestinian diaspora but also a sense of
personal and ideological apartness. That sense has, if anything,
deepened during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Said was a confidant of Yasir Arafat (he helped
write the Palestine Liberation Organization leader's famous speech
before the United Nations in 1974). Two secretaries of state, Cyrus
Vance and George Shultz, have consulted him, and during the Carter
administration he served as a back-channel link between the White
House and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Said out of place within the PLO is his vehement
denunciation of the 1993 Oslo accords and the organization's having
made peace with Israel. Instead, Said supports a one-state solution
whereby Jews and Palestinians would live in a single, nonsectarian
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, I'm very pessimistic because of the weakness
of the Palestinians and, in my opinion, the highly compromised and
stupid impasse into which Arafat and his people have put
themselves. . . . But in the long run there are tremendous changes
coming. . . . Time is against this notion of ethnic separation,
partition, and apartheid. There's no other way than a one-state
solution. . . . Neither side has a military option. Just simple
logic and humanity, I think, will make it work. People (on both
sides) want to protect their interests.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An unjust peace
</P>
<P>
   Said has likened Oslo to ``a Palestinian Versailles,'' a
reference to the harsh treaty Germany signed after its defeat in
World War I, and the PLO to Nazi collaborators in World War II,
calling it ``a Vichy government serving Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   As such words suggest, Said is a master of rhetoric both harsh
and eloquent. It has won him many enemies. They contend he
personifies Third World radical chic: an expensively tailored man
who is equally at home lunching at New York's exclusive Century
Association (of which he is a member) and castigating Israel before
the Palestinian National Council (on which he served from 1977 to
1991). Certainly, Said's striking looks, aristocratic bearing, and
suave manner have helped make him a familiar and charismatic
presence on speaker's platforms and television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hertzberg, one of American Judaism's foremost liberal
voices on the Mideast as well as a onetime Columbia colleague of
Said's, recalls a joint appearance they made during the early '80s.
``When I suggested beforehand that, in this superheated atmosphere,
with the Israelis in Lebanon, we should make the most peaceful
noises, he agreed absolutely. So, for 45 minutes, I gave my most
dovish speech. He then came on the dais and made his most
fire-eating speech. Afterward, he came up to me and said, `Arthur,
now we must continue our conversation at breakfast when we get back
to Columbia.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There you have the two sides of Edward Said: He wants to be
the Palestinians' fire-eater and to have a reputation in Western
intellectual circles for being the most charming and civilized of
the Palestinian nationalists. He wants it both ways _ and he has a
claque around the world to help him to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said does, indeed, cut a global figure. He writes a
twice-monthly column for the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly.
His byline frequently appears in the London Review of Books and, in
1993, he delivered the prestigious Reith Lectures on the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   To his admirers, Said exemplifies the intellectual as activist:
a scholar who has maintained a full-time commitment to both
learning and ideology despite death threats and, on at least one
occasion, the vandalization of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in English, Arabic, and French, Said has reading
knowledge of Italian, German, Spanish, and Latin. He maintains a
full teaching load at Columbia, where he holds a university
professorship, the highest honor the school bestows on its faculty,
and is the current president of the Modern Language Association. He
has been a visiting professor at Harvard, Yale, and Johns Hopkins.
A pianist of nearly concert-hall caliber, he is music critic for
The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Said is about as close as one gets in this day and age to
being a Renaissance man,'' says Philip S. Khoury, dean of
humanities and social science at MIT and a past president of the
Middle East Studies Association. ``His talents and intellectual
range are enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparable figure, not only in the United States
but Europe,'' says Richard Poirier, a friend of Said's who is
emeritus professor of English at Rutgers University and chairman of
the Library of America. ``Of all American (literary) critics, he is
internationally the best known _ certainly the most influential in
anything touching upon the cultural criticism of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Said has published 17 books. He has three more ready for
publication (one on opera and essay collections on literature and
politics) and is deep into the writing of a book on late style in
artists ranging from Sophocles to Beethoven. Befitting such a
Victorian level of productivity, Said does his writing as
Victorians did: in longhand, with a fountain pen.

LOSING A JOB CAN BE VERY LUCRATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In our continuing quest to get rich, we have explored a variety
of schemes.
</P>
<P>
   We've considered going public to take advantage of the hot
market for initial public offerings. We've also toyed with the idea
of selling ourselves to a big technology company _ a Lucent
Technologies or a Cisco Systems _ to get a piece of the billions of
dollars they have spent acquiring small Massachusetts firms.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a new plan: We want to lose our jobs _ just like
Philippe Dauman and Thomas Dooley. The pair were key lieutenants to
Sumner Redstone, the chairman of Viacom. They helped Redstone
negotiate last week's blockbuster merger with CBS. But in the
course of the talks they realized there would be no place for them
in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley told the press he and his partner had no choice but to
depart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was important to the deal,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But don't hang down your head for this Tom Dooley. He and Dauman
aren't going away empty-handed. According to documents filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, each man will get a $29
million lump-sum settlement, a $5 million transaction bonus, a
regular bonus of at least $6.6 million plus existing stock options
worth a minimum of $50 million. By our math that comes to $90
million plus per executive.
</P>
<P>
   Beats working, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Dauman and Dooley are only the latest in a long line of
high-profile executives who've managed to turn losing a job into a
high-paying occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Superagent Michael Ovitz was dumped by Walt Disney Co. several
years ago after only 14 months on the job. He and his boss Michael
Eisner couldn't get along. For his troubles Ovitz got a severance
package estimated at $76 million at the time of his departure; the
value of the deal grew to $187 million as Disney's stock
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   No discussion of executive firing would be complete without
mentioning Frank Biondi, the Michael Jordan of this field. Biondi
has been canned twice in recent years, and each time he walked away
with a major settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He was dismissed first by Viacom and got $15 million to leave.
Two years later he lost his job at Universal Studios and pocketed
$30 million on his way out the door. On top of that he got to keep
an $8 million movie theater Universal built in his home. Do you
think he had to pay for the popcorn?
</P>
<P>
   The sports world has also been known to compensate failed
executives handsomely. When coach John Calipari lost his job as
coach of basketball's New Jersey Nets this year, he still had two
years and $6 million left on his contract. Calipari will get the
money, even though he led the team to a dismal record of 72 wins
and 112 losses as coach _ a curious twist on the notion of pay for
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The departing executives leave under a variety of circumstances.
Dauman and Dooley are credited with building up Viacom and both
remain on good terms with the company. Redstone reportedly
``begged'' the pair to stay. At the other end of the spectrum, J.R.
Bolduc, chief executive of W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., was forced out in 1995
after he was accused of sexual harassment, a charge he denied.
Bolduc got $43 million to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who find this whole practice distasteful. They
object to the fact that ousted executives are paid enormous sums at
a time when many people don't have enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz deal struck many as particularly egregious. Steven
Friedlander, an actor, put it this way in 1996 when the news came
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates extreme division in our country between these
people who get paid unbelievable amounts for producing nothing and
regular people who barely get paid enough to survive,'' he told the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Several institutional investors also objected to the Ovitz
package as a poor use of shareholders money. As a general rule,
however, investors don't pay much attention to this subject. Tens
of millions of dollars may seem like a lot of money, but in the
context of a multibillion-dollar deal, the numbers don't seem so
big.
</P>
<P>
   The standard defense of huge severance packages _ frequently
offered by those receiving them _ goes something like this:
Executive salaries (and severance packages) are determined by the
free market, and if you want to attract top talent you have to pay
the price. Beyond that, by making it easy for unwanted executives
to leave, severance money contributes to smooth transitions and
avoids messy protracted litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Where do we fit into all this?
</P>
<P>
   While it is true we are not exactly high-profile executives, we
do hold the number one and two spots at this column. And like Frank
Biondi, Michael Ovitz, Philppe Dauman, and Tom Dooley, we are in
the media business.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dooley, who worked for Sumner Redstone for 20 years, we are
long-serving loyal employees. We like what we do. But if the powers
that be decide we have to go for the good of the company, we
wouldn't stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Our demands wouldn't be outrageous. We'd take half of what
Dooley and Dauman got _ $45 million each. It may sound like a lot
of money, but remember: It would contribute to a smooth transition
and avoid messy protacted litigation.
</P>
<P>
   With our $45 million in hand, we'd leave, but we wouldn't be
happy about it. And if you believe that, we've got some stock you
can buy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Term life insurance, which is already pretty cheap, is getting
still cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Savings Bank Life Insurance, a Woburn company that provides life
insurance to about 400,000 people in Massachusetts, Monday
announced a rate cut of 10 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SBLI is responding to a rate war in term life that has cut the
price of a typical policy by about 60 percent over the past decade.
Recently the prospect of new rules that might raise rates next year
has touched off a frenzy of rate cutting that SBLI president Robert
Sheridan has likened to a ``two-minute drill.''
</P>
<P>
   Term insurance is a plain vanilla product. Term policies provide
insurance for a set period of time without the investment features
common in other types of life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``SBLI's new rates are excellent,'' says Milton Brown, head of
Insurance Information Inc. in Dennis, Mass., who tracks insurance
prices nationally.

<P>
   As Hollywood continues its romance with the fashion industry, a
marketing alliance of film and fashion is forming that may one day
herald the era of ``designer movies.''
</P>
<P>
   After two decades during which fashion houses and powerhouse
brands from Armani and Tommy Hilfiger to Nike and Levi's shared
screen credit and heady close-ups with America's biggest stars,
product placement has become a key avenue for global exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-budget independent films might rely on the kindness of
emerging designers to provide wardrobing gratis or at cost, while
companies devoted to securing product placement may strike
million-dollar deals with major studios for their notable clients.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, it's all about leveraged
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran marketers say the concept behind product placement may
date back to when men's undershirt sales sagged after Clark Gable
appeared bare-chested in the 1934 movie, ``It Happened One Night.''
This was followed decades later by the rush on Ace pocket combs
immortalized by James Dean in ``Rebel Without a Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '60a and '70a, fashion trends in mainstream movies
proved aspirational. Look at what Audrey Hepburn in ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's'' did for the Little Black Dress; how John Travolta sent
``disco'' shirts flying in ``Saturday Night Fever''; and the
style-setting power of Diane Keaton's whole layered look _ complete
with granny glasses _ in ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the late '70s/early '80s that Seventh Avenue
really started to make a calculated impact on film.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard of this phenomenon was released in 1980:
``American Gigolo.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers took notice of a handsome young hustler played by
Richard Gere who seduced Lauren Hutton in an impeccable wardrobe by
Giorgio Armani.
</P>
<P>
   Gere laid out piles of clothes on his bed with the Armani label
showing prominently.
</P>
<P>
   For about 20 years, Armani has been among a handful of
sought-after designers whose signature collections and individual
pieces have starred in a range of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Armani lent his support to the Paramount film ``Double
Jeopardy'' starring Ashley Judd, which highlights an in-store
Armani boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan's collections have also been integrated into
high-profile films. The company takes a team approach to its
product placement, employing designers, public-relations people,
advertising staff and salespeople to determine which projects are
potential props.
</P>
<P>
   One of Karan's big tie ins was Twentieth Century Fox's remake of
``Great Expectations,'' which premiered in 1997, starring Gwyneth
Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Karan's sporty and sophisticated looks added realism to
Paltrow's complex character.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger is making aggressive strides to target its core
audience by moving forward with wardrobe tie-ins for feature films
and concert tours.
</P>
<P>
   The company blurred marketing lines when it launched an
unprecedented print and TV campaign that tied its jeans directly to
the 1999 teen horror Miramax release, ``The Faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie projects slated to have a Tommy Hilfiger presence include
``Boiler Room,'' a New Line Cinema release starring Ben Affleck and
Nia Long, and ``Keeping the Faith'' (summer 2000), starring Ben
Stiller, Ed Norton and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   Powering its presence among concert-aged consumers, Hilfiger
counts Jewel, Britney Spears, Sheryl Crow and the Rolling Stones
among the artists it will present on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's also broke new ground with its promotional efforts on the
1999 release of ``The Mod Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand collaborated with the film's costume designer, Arianne
Phillips, to both create the authentic look of the movie targeted
to a youth audience and to extend the film's impact with the launch
of Levi's Mod 1 line.
</P>
<P>
   Screened during fashion week for the New York press last March,
``The Mod Squad's'' neo-retro look was noted by many of the
country's hip young editors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film was not a financial success, the Levi's
contemporary ``Mod 1'' look gained tremendous exposure with its
targeted demographic.
</P>
<P>
   For sports companies like Nike and Reebok, product placement has
been a continuous part of the overall marketing strategy. By using
in-house people and outside agencies on retainer, these companies
guarantee a steady stream of placements per year. But both
companies are careful to participate in projects that further an
athletic-driven message.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's consistent placement on Tom Hanks' feet throughout
``Forrest Gump'' (1994) was an example of a marketer's dream.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollywood continues to draw from the best of Seventh Avenue
in stories of action, adventure, comedy and romance, and Madison
Avenue readies a new slate of promotional tie-ins, moviegoers might
soon spend a day at the matinee trend-spotting on the big screen. &QL;

NEW COMMISSIONER GETS HIS FEET WET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK-DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Don Garber has been getting a grass-roots
introduction to soccer. Garber was named commissioner of Major
League Soccer in early August, but he has kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   And he has capitalized on his anonymity to explore the problems
of MLS _ by mingling with fans.
</P>
<P>
   His conclusions? Nothing definite yet, but expect to see the
demise of some American-style gimmicks _ e.g. the shootout, the
clock running backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been kind of undercover,'' Garber said Monday after a
press conference to unveil the trophy for the MLS Cup, to be played
at Foxboro Stadium Nov. 21. ``I think the best way to understand
things is to go out and try to be a fan. I start at the airport
when I'm walking through the gate. I've been sitting and talking
with fans, mostly in New York, where you have passionate fans who
went to see the Cosmos and now go to see the MetroStars.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being a strength of the MLS, the MetroStars have
become one of the league's many problems. MLS used the 1994 World
Cup as a springboard and started strongly two years later, but
attendance has declined and there is skepticism about the quality
of play.
</P>
<P>
   Garber worked for the National Football League for 15 years and
was hand-picked as Doug Logan's successor by Lamar Hunt and the
Kraft family, MLS's NFL contingent. He is expected to reinvigorate
the league's relationship with the media and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Though Garber has no background in the game, he clearly
appreciates some of the traditions of soccer and the value of
``hard-core'' supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the shootout tiebreaker, which certainly damaged the
credibility of the league during the Revolution's game at Miami
Saturday night, Garber said, ``The shootout has been our biggest
controversy. Every meeting we have always comes back to it. We are
going to have to make a decision on it, a difficult decision, based
on bringing the game closer to the hard-core fan.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS rules are determined by a competition committee, composed
mostly of owners and their representatives. The shootout was
developed as a desperate attempt to attract attention by the North
American Soccer League, but it faded away along with the league in
1984, only to be revived by MLS. Shootout advocates claim it
discourages teams from cynically collaborating to produce dull tie
games. But at its worst, the shootout can reduce soccer to farce,
as when Revolution goalkeeper Jeff Causey was ejected Saturday,
leaving the position to striker Joe-Max Moore as the Revolution
lost in Miami. Further confusing the issue is the points system,
which breaks from the worldwide norm of 3 for a victory, 1 for a
draw.
</P>
<P>
   But Garber seems to realize that soccer's most dedicated and
sophisticated fans, along with coaches and players, have become
disgruntled with gimmicks. And, unlike the NASL days, high-level
international soccer is easily accessible via satellite, with
advanced production values, on a regular basis. MLS simply has to
improve its standard, and the standard of its presentation, in a
substantive manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is putting the best possible product on the
field, developing the quality of play within our budget, and being
able to compete globally with a marketing plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber, 41, is two weeks into Spanish lessons and plans to hire
a senior executive to deal with Hispanic affairs. Garber will not
be able to match Logan's Spanish, but this should at least help him
better understand the game's varied constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of work to do,'' Garber said. ``I am encouraged
by the enormous desire of all our constituents, from sponsors to
fans. There is no shortage of interest in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 MLS Cup was played in a torrential downpour at Foxboro
Stadium, witnessed by 34,643 of those dedicated spectators. MLS
will be tempting the weather again this year, but the subsequent
MLS Cup will be held in October 2000, hopefully in a warmer
climate.
</P>
<P>
   The '96 MLS Cup helped lend an identity to the league and to
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought nobody would show up,'' said Revolution midfielder
John Harkes, who helped D.C. United defeat Los Angeles, 3-2, in
overtime that year. ``The biggest thrill for the players was seeing
more than 30,000 people wearing ponchos and cheering us to the end
of the game. The passion overflowed, and when you can feel that on
the field, it's something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first sign for me that soccer was going to make
it in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   About 57,000 tickets will go on sale today (Sept. 14) for this
year's game, according to Revolution general manager Brian
O'Donovan. There have been several 50,000-plus crowds for soccer
games at Foxboro Stadium. But unless the Revolution can recover for
a successful playoff run, and the weather is reasonable, this game
will not likely match the stadium record for a soccer match of
57,407 for a US-Mexico World Cup qualifier/Revolution-Tampa Bay
doubleheader April 20, 1997.

BIG EAST PUTS ITS NAME ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it Statement Week. At least in terms of reputation. The Big
East can make huge strides _ in either direction _ in terms of its
image this week.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Penn State at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Michigan at Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Both are Top 10 opponents. Both are on national television, with
the Syracuse-Michigan game on CBS in prime time Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of the Bowl Championship Series, when polls,
computerized rankings, and perception can affect not only
postseason matchups but also the status of a conference, it is
vital for the Big East to have a strong showing this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 has taken the pounding in the early going, with
Arizona's first-week rout at Penn State and subsequent struggle
against TCU, as well as UCLA's loss to Ohio State (although the
Bruins were shorthanded).
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Big East has taken most of the heat
from the critics, so much in fact that new minimum standards are
being considered for the conference to retain its automatic BCS
slot. The stakes are obvious: two blowouts in these marquee games
and the reputation of the Big East suffers; two wins and the Big
East can strut with any league in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can do nothing but help the conference,'' said Syracuse
coach Paul Pasqualoni, who is hoping his team can repeat last
year's win over the Wolverines. ``Certainly, games like this
receive a lot of attention. We went through the same thing last
year. Did it help? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger in magnitude is the Penn State-Miami game, with the
winner moving into the high-speed lane for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   For Penn State, coming off a tough 20-17 win over Pittsburgh, it
is an obstacle that must be cleared before the rigors of the Big
Ten schedule. But the Lions' reputation as a national power is not
being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   For Miami, this is a Back to the Future type game. The
Hurricanes are again in the top 10, with wins over Ohio State and
Florida A&AMP;M as a prelude. Still ahead is the Big East schedule and
its annual game against No. 1 Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, Miami coach Butch Davis looked at the
nonconference schedule and said that if the Hurricanes could win
two of the three games against Ohio State, Penn State, and Florida
State, they would be back as prime time players.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he relishes such games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players were excited about the chance to play Ohio
State,'' said Davis Monday. ``And they are excited about a game
like this. It's a chance for people around the country to look at
you and find out what your program is about.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naval battle ahead
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston College had the week off, and coach Tom O'Brien said
Monday that his team is ready to resume its season Saturday against
Navy, which happens to be O'Brien's alma mater. Despite beating
Baylor in the opener, O'Brien said his team is hardly cocky,
particularly since the Middies beat the Eagles at Alumni Stadium
last season. ``This is a great game for our mental toughness.''
said O'Brien. ``We have to play 60 minutes against a team who beat
us last year because they were mentally tougher than us.'' . . .
West Virginia coach Don Nehlen didn't give a ringing endorsement to
quarterback Marc Bulger's selection as the Big East Offensive
Player of the Week. ``We know he is the Big East Player of the
Week, but he didn't have a very good game,'' said Nehlen. Bulger
threw for 226 yards and three touchdowns in a 43-27 win over Miami
of Ohio . . . Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said redshirt
freshman quarterback Michael Vick, who missed last week's game
against Alabama-Birmingham with an ankle injury, is ready to begin
full-scale preparation for the Hokies' game against Clemson a week
from Thursday . . . With Miami (8) and Virginia Tech (10), the Big
East has two teams in the top 10 for the first time since Oct. 30,
1994, when Miami (6) and Syracuse (10) made it.

ZAMPESE'S OFFENSE WAS IN STEP FOR OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The running game still isn't in perfect form
(maybe it never will be in New England), but Patriots offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese painted a pretty explosive picture of the
team's offense in a 30-28 victory over the Jets at Giants Stadium
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese will never consider this offense on the level of the
ones he had in San Diego with Hall of Famers Dan Fouts, Charlie
Joiner, and Kellen Winslow but there are reasonable facsimiles in
Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, and Ben Coates _ when all are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese raved about Bledsoe's play, calling it ``beautiful _ he
made great throws all day,'' and credited Glenn with making a key
adjustment on his route running in the second half that allowed him
to make two big catches while he was being double-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe (21 for 30, 340 yards) completed passes to nine
receivers, which is not the way Zampese drew it up at the
chalkboard, but is something that makes the quarterback and the
coaching staff look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get it that way, but you just don't know from
game to game how it comes up,'' said Zampese. ``I hear things like,
you don't throw it to this guy and you don't throw it to that guy.
Well, you're usually trying to get it to your top two guys, but at
times you have to spread it and we have guys you can get it to.
We're just trying to use the personnel we've got and we're trying
to use some formations to get the guys to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an awful lot of double coverage on Terry and it
helped the other side. We even got the ball to Terry within the
double coverage a couple of times. Then at halftime Terry had a
hell of a suggestion and we ended up getting him twice. It was a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese was a tad surprised that he was able to spring big plays
on the Jets _ a 58-yarder to Tony Simmons for a touchdown and a
45-yarder to Glenn, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get the big stuff a lot on them,'' said Zampese.
``We did a pretty good job. Drew completed a lot of balls and they
weren't just the little dink things. We got the ball up the field.
He threw the ball really well. Did he look good. His accuracy is so
good. He made nice decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese isn't abandoning the running game; the Patriots passed
30 times and ran 27 times, as even a run/pass ratio as they've had
in some time. Last season, they had more rushes than passes three
times in 16 regular-season games and won all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good movement,'' said Zampese. ``We had some nice
pushes. I think it's coming along, I really do. I think we're
really going to improve it. I had no idea Terry (Allen) had more
carries (15) than Kevin (Faulk, 10). It just happened where we had
some short-yardage situations, two-tight-end situations, and he
carried it more.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Terry understands is third and 1: get the first
down, and whatever happens after that is gravy. He's back there to
run and he's a fine runner and he'll be better as he gets into game
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese lauded the play of Bruce Armstrong and the offensive
line in general, but he was especially pleased with Damien Woody's
debut at center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played very well, surprisingly well for a kid in his first
game,'' said Zampese. ``He had one breakdown and that was about it.
It looks like he's going to be a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   So the offense in Year 2 of the Zampese regime is off to a good
start. That was the case in Dallas, too, as Troy Aikman began
lighting it up in Zampese's second year as offensive coordinator
after struggling the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you change an offense, you struggle,'' said Zampese.
``Then, once they become comfortable _ if the players are good
enough, and I think we have good players _ you'll see some
improvement. There's quite a bit of ability here. This is the best
group of wide receivers I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see where this is heading. Zampese wants to get the ball
to the fast guys. If Glenn is double-covered, he feels he has
enough in Shawn Jefferson, Troy Brown, and Simmons to get the job
done on the other side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to even off the run/pass ratio, certainly, but what he
wants more than anything is to exploit the big-play capabilities he
feels this team has.

HOW ABOUT AN AUTUMNAL STROLL BY THE SEA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who like to walk have a treat in store. The Boston
Harborwalk is a scenic and nautical self-guided stroll from behind
the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Dorchester to Castle
Island in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to enter the museum (although it's a great
place to visit) and no charge for the walk. You may not want to go
the entire distance, though. The sign says it's 3 1/2 miles each
way, but to my tired feet it felt even longer, perhaps because the
final 40 percent of the walk hasn't been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The first part takes you along the ocean's edge, with several
resting stops and interesting and entertaining information
presented on granite plaques. Here is some of what you learn:
</P>
<P>
   --A Brothers Grimm fairy tale of a talking flounder, a timid
fisherman, and a greedy wife.
</P>
<P>
   --Information about the humble flounder: It is tasty, requires
the simplest kind of tackle, and is called the ``clown of the sea''
because in adulthood it swims flat along the ocean floor with both
eyes facing up.
</P>
<P>
   --The story of the Flying Cloud. Built in East Boston in 1851,
the clipper was the fastest vessel sailing from New York to San
Francisco via Cape Horn. It set a record by traveling that
notorious passage in a mere 89 days.
</P>
<P>
   --The tale of the wreck of the Magnifique in 1782 on a sandbar
near Lovells Island, one of the Boston Harbor Islands, while being
piloted by a Bostonian. The ship was France's finest, a 74-gun
man-of-war on loan to help in the fight for independence. America
felt compelled to replace the Magnifique with a ship that was just
being completed in Portsmouth, N.H. Appropriately enough, that ship
was named America.
</P>
<P>
   --The history of the siege of Dorchester Heights, with the
neighborhood visible across the water during the walk. On March 4,
1776, the continental army, led by George Washington, fired on the
British occupying Boston and Castle Island, forcing them to
evacuate the city and eventually relinquish the island, which then
acquired the name Fort Independence.
</P>
<P>
   (The walk is part of Harborpark Boston, which encompasses 43
miles of walks, some of them guided, and involves various public
and private groups. A shorter seaside stroll takes you from the
start of the University of Massachusetts harbor campus to the JFK
Library. For more information, call the Boston Harbor Association
at 617-482-1722.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: A few weeks ago we asked which US states were named
for women _ and heard from a lot of readers because we omitted
Maryland. Undaunted, we ask this week which states were named for
men. (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``In . . . the fall the whole country goes to glory.'' _
Frances Trollope, writing about America in 1832. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: A drink that's popular in Japan and Korea is called
Pocari Sweat. It's a Gatorade-style beverage, so the ``sweat''
refers to the drinker, not the contents. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Autumnal Web site: Www.4autumn.com offers an overview of autumnal
activities across the nation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In Connecticut, it is illegal to cross a street
while walking on your hands. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sign of the times: On the side of the trash truck in Ketchikan,
Alaska: ``Your satisfaction guaranteed or double your garbage
back.'' (With thanks to Nancy Ovitt of Chelmsford.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Delaware (for Lord De La Warr, a Virginia
governor), Georgia (King George II of England), Louisiana (Louis
XIV of France), New York (the Duke of York and Albany), North and
South Carolina (Charles I), Pennsylvania (William Penn), and
Washington (George). The District of Columbia, meanwhile, was named
for Christopher Columbus. And you could always argue
(unsuccessfully, in our opinion) that since Oklahoma is Choctaw for
``red man,'' the state was also named for a man. (We thank Tom
Tuttle of Newtonville, Mass. for the idea.) &QL;

RACIAL ITEMS ON INTERNET AUCTION SITE RAISE QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ First it was live body parts listed for sale,
then babies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the latest category of disputed items on the on-line
auction service eBay is black memorabilia, seen by some buyers as
collectibles, by others as patently racist.
</P>
<P>
   The memorabilia consist of books, toys, comics and ceramic
figurines from the 19th and 20th centuries that depict blacks in
the stereotypical, often negative ways they were seen by whites.
Examples include ``mammy'' cookie jars, mechanical banks, and
porcelain figurines of black children sitting in outhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Until late last week, eBay shoppers could purchase myriad Nazi
and Ku Klux Klan items, such as KKK knives, belt buckles and a
Christmas ornament of a robed Klan member whose hood, when raised,
reveals a kindly Santa Claus face.
</P>
<P>
   The items are nothing new to collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are offended by the word `slavery,' but it was
reality, and we have to deal with that,'' said Sam Dyke, the owner
of People's Bazaar, an antiques store in Berkeley, Calif., that
sells black memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible scenario, and by no means am I applauding it,
but you have to know your history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people see a difference between viewing such items
in an antiques store and seeing them listed, complete with
offending terminology, on the Internet. In some cases, the
descriptions offered by sellers lack sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Faulkner, a collector of black memorabilia in Berkeley, said
he believed that ``eBay needs to exercise some editorial control on
how things appear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectors' magazines and newsletters do exercise that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One item for sale was described by the seller as a ``black
nigger boy eating watermelon figurine.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Oliver, 40, a part-time antiques dealer in
McMinnville, Tenn., said she listed the figurine using the
offensive word because she thought it would attract more potential
buyers. Some people will search on the word to find related items,
such as books that use it in the title, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with prejudice,'' she said. ``I did
hesitate to do it, but I think it has drawn more attention to the
auction.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay spokeswoman Kristin Seuell said the on-line service
generally relies on its buyers and sellers to follow guidelines and
police themselves. ``It's very much like a neighborhood watch,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company's policy is to allow the use of offensive
words if they are part of a title. But the word is used in an
offensive or vulgar way, ``we will end the auction,'' Seuell said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Ku Klux Klan items, Seuell said such things may be
offensive, but they are legal to sell and therefore would not be
removed from eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The company does stop auctions of items that may not be sold by
law, such as body parts, babies and counterfeit items. EBay pulled
listings earlier this month that featured babies and kidneys from
live donors, saying it believed the listings were hoaxes. It also
restricts sales of firearms, stock and stock certificates,
surveillance equipment, cable-TV descramblers, animals and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dyke said he understands that some of his fellow
African-Americans are offended by artifacts that portray blacks in
a negative light or glorify racism.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he would not restrict sales of memorabilia. ``I
wouldn't trample on their rights to do what they want. They're
entitled to their opinion.''

IMUS BROTHERS HOPE RANCH WILL BRING JOY TO SICK KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIBERA, N.M. _ Jack, an orphan of distinguished heritage, is
``still trying to find himself,'' says his ``psychiatrist.'' ``He
was very lonely and depressed when we brought him here. He didn't
know who he was. He thought he was a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten better. Now Jack thinks he's a donkey.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because he rooms with a couple of them named Gene and
Roy, and maybe donkeys have more fun. At least their hilarious
quotes _ ``Hee-haw!'' in varied tones _ sound as if they do.
Whatever, the living is good in their pen-with-a-view, way out in
the wide open spaces of New Mexico. And there's plenty of food.
This is important for Jack, a shaggy young-and-growing American
buffalo of 1,200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's starting to feel secure here,'' says Fred Imus,
patting Jack on the withers.
</P>
<P>
   Fred, the dumb-animal psychiatrist, rag peddler, and cosmetic
surgeon to auto bodies, also plays dumb as himself on his big
brother's morning radio show. Scraggly as ever in a half-hearted
beard, weary jeans, and T-shirt, plus cowboy boots and tattoos,
Fred may seem worn and brainless on the airwaves. However, it turns
out it's all a front for a very worthy heart.
</P>
<P>
   Currently he is wholeheartedly involved in fleshing out the
brothers Imus's missionary work: namely this 3,100-acre ranch that
is designed to convert painful days of seriously sick kids to a
stretch of fun. Their belief: Put kids amid the beasts such as
buffalo Jack and the quarter horses, in a setting of grassy
prairie, cactus, mountains, mesas, and sagebrushed rangeland of the
reasonably wild wild West and they'll have the time of their lives.
Lives that may be very short.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've heard the other Imus _ Don, the raunchy rancher _
babbling about their $4 million spread (plus undetermined millions
in operating costs)? Located about an hour southeast of Santa Fe,
the ranch has been underwritten largely by the contributions of
listeners. But with Imus, who knew? Possibly it existed only in the
creative minds of McCord, Lou and Bernard, Breen or Rob Bartlett?
</P>
<P>
   But no. What was but a beautiful dream does exist beautifully.
The longhorns are on the way. Those acres, at $5,000 a pop that so
many Imusiacs sprang for, materialize immediately as you enter the
iron gate. None of them are underwater, either. The acre of a
Boston friend, the late Keith Brodkin, is a neat rise covered with
rocky outcroppings and juniper trees. Keith would like it. Anybody
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to be ready for the first kids on a regular basis in
January of 2000,'' says Fred, who gets a nod from the construction
supervisor, Chaz Schleeter. Swarming carpenters are completing two
huge barns and starting the main building, an adobe hacienda to
house the youngsters and staff. Already up are a couple of
guesthouses, Indian tepees, a greenhouse, windmill, a horse corral,
another for the odd trio: Jack and the donkeys Roy and Gene, named
for film cowboys Rogers and Autry.
</P>
<P>
   The pride of Imus territory is also standing: Downtown, the
one-block main street of a 19th-century adobe-and-wood Western
town, a movie lot Dodge City. Great place for kids to play ``High
Noon,'' to push through the saloon's swinging doors and find an ice
cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they'll love it,'' says Fred. ``They'll think they're John
Wayne or Gary Cooper. Maybe Calamity Jane. They'll hear the coyotes
at night, roosters in the morning, and if they feel like it, they
can chase the goats, deer, and jackrabbits. There are cougars and
bears up on that mesa, Rowe Mesa, that runs all the way to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll bring in 10 kids at a time for 10 days. We don't want a
mob scene. They'll get full attention by the staff that will
include medical personnel at the infirmary in Downtown. And they'll
have responsibilities, like with the animals. Over a few years
that'll be quite a few kids. What we want is to see that light in
their eyes. The light of happiness. Just that'll be enough to make
it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same sentiment that propelled ex-tennis champ Andrea
Jaeger to found a similar retreat, Silver Lining Ranch in Aspen,
Colo., for kids with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Striding across the crimson earth toward the corrals, Fred says,
``Don and I grew up on a ranch, and we think it's a great
experience for a kid. I think he'd like to do more of his shows
here. There'll be a studio in Downtown. Maybe he'll retire here. I
wouldn't mind, myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, painter Lynn Wade, says she wouldn't mind, either.
She says it was love at first sound bite when she heard Fred on the
radio. It must be love, all right.
</P>
<P>
   But will Jack, the confused buffalo, find love or only become
the butt of Fred's shaggy buffalo stories?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sort of,'' says Fred. ``Poor orphan, he was raised by a mare
and fed with a bottle by her owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack needs a pedicure to be sexier,'' says Lynn, observing
that Fred also gets along with these donkeys fine.
</P>
<P>
   Fred says, ``You'd have to anesthetize Jack to get it done. Say,
notice the cross marks on the donkeys' backs? The story is that
since Mary rode into Bethlehem on a donkey they have these cross
birthmarks. Looks that way, don't it?'' Curiously, it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we all have our crosses to bear, don't we?'' says Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Fred says, ``The donkeys love Jack. But I'm gonna bring in a
female buffalo named Virginia, from a rancher down the road, for
Jack to pal around with. Then maybe he'll get the idea who he is.''
Astute psychiatry that Dr. Freud would applaud.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he says with a sigh familiar to listeners of his
Imusings, ``Jack was, you know, fixed before we got him. He'll have
to settle for platonic romance.''
</P>

BICYCLISTS'S ESSAYS TEACH LESSONS OF THE BACKROADS

METAL COWBOY 
Tales from the Road Less Pedaled 
By Joe Kurmaskie 
Breakaway Books, $23, 304 pp. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you had to guess where Joe Kurmaskie grew up, you'd probably
pick the heart of the heartland. The actual answer is Pennsylvania
and Florida, but Kurmaskie's down-home, aw-shucks outlook on life
is decidedly Midwestern, or perhaps ``Mayberry, R.F.D.'' His
``Metal Cowboy'' contains 40 essays covering the ups, downs, and
everything-in-between of riding a bicycle all over America, with a
few foreign lands sprinkled in. Mostly, it's an infectious
celebration of life, a sort of two-wheeled version of ``Chicken
Soup for the Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurmaskie does what's called loaded touring, which means
carrying all your gear _ food, clothing, and shelter _ on your
bike. I went on my first loaded-touring trip the same week I
started reading ``Metal Cowboy,'' figuring it would be a fun thing
to read by flashlight beam in my tent. I think I stayed awake for a
few sentences a night, and it wasn't the book's fault. Let's just
say that not only do I admire the author's cheery outlook on life,
I gained a newfound respect for the stamina required for daily
bicycle touring.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was 5 and rode his sister's bicycle, Kurmaskie
fell in love with bikes. ``Just a collection of metal, rubber,
grease and gears to the untrained eye, to me that two-wheeled
contraption has always represented something more. It has to do
with possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I love the wind in my face, the sound of my beating
heart as I work up a hill, but the simple, clean rush of freedom
was what hooked me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 20s, the author took that freedom seriously, going on
numerous cycling adventures around North America and an odyssey
across Australia and New Zealand. It's America that he is most
interested in, and he takes a Charles Kuralt approach to finding
the quirky but very real people that dot the landscape far from any
Wal-Mart. Seldom does he poke fun at them, and often he learns from
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was an old, blind rancher in Idaho who dubbed Kurmaskie
``metal cowboy'' before tapping the back of his bike in a fond
farewell. ``Though I looked more like a surfer, or a guy on a
fool's journey, to him I felt like a metal cowboy, the bike my
horse, and the asphalt my trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other characters he meets up with include a pack of
guard geese, a roving band of Elvis impersonators, and a
78-year-old cyclist he had to struggle to keep up with.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Touched by an Angel'' fashion, the intrepid traveler allows
a retired Italian barber to relive his glory days by cutting
Kurmaskie's hair; accompanies a girl forced to drop out of high
school to her senior prom; and agrees to be the ceremonial
scarecrow _ on bicycle _ in a small-town parade down South.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of this last essay, ``The Next Parade,'' were endearing
and and even hilarious, especially when Kurmaskie is observing such
things as the Lions refusing to follow the Rotarians because of a
feud at last summer's softball tournament. But it also has one of
Kurmaskie's too-frequent treacly endings: ``Handing over the
scarecrow costume, I realized I too was going to be all right in
this world, as long as I remembered to stop every now and then, to
let the good stories just under the surface happen _ and to keep an
eye out for the next parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurmaskie readily and refreshingly admits his foibles and
occasional loss of common sense, and he holds back not a whit when
waxing poetic about his wife, whom he met while cycling. Unlike so
many purveyors of irony and sarcasm, Kurmaskie uncovers what is
sweet and good among people. Truth is, while my eyes sometimes
rolled at the cornball passages, they'd also fill up with tears.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who now lives in Portland, Ore., recently became a
columnist for Bicycling magazine and hosts a busy Web site
(www.metalcowboy.com). Here's hoping he doesn't become a franchise
of the sort he avoided on his many excellent adventures.

`STIGMATA' BEARS THE MARKS OF BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When William Donohue, president of the ultraconservative,
easily-agitated Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights,
issued a statement earlier this month denouncing the new thriller
``Stigmata,'' it wasn't difficult to assume he was just up to his
old attention-grabbing tricks again.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Donohue has found small fame by condemning any
movie or television show presenting a challenging view of
Catholicism or the clergy. He has fired unholy words at such
worthwhile fare as ABC's brave and too-quickly-cancelled ``Nothing
Sacred,'' which starred Kevin Anderson as an inner-city priest, and
the 1994 independent film ``Priest,'' with Linus Roache as a young
cleric struggling with his vows and his homosexuality. Even more
irritating, Donohue often slammed his targets before viewing them
in their entirety, if he even bothered to view them at all.
</P>
<P>
   So when Donohue passed judgment on ``Stigmata'' _ calling it
``outlandishly gory and insidious,'' based only on the film's
three-minute trailer _ it landed on many ears as just the same old
sound bite. The film, which opened last week, stars Patricia
Arquette as a young woman mysteriously inflicted with the wounds of
the crucified Christ, and Gabriel Byrne as a priest sent to
investigate. Then there's Jonathan Pryce as a Roman Catholic Church
biggie willing to employ any means necessary to suppress a lost
gospel, written by Christ, that could undermine the power and
validity of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Well, imagine my slack-jawed amazement now that I find myself
agreeing with Donohue's assessment of this dreadful film as
``insidious.'' And, having sat through the whole bloody mess, let
me add repellent, hateful, loathsome and vile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' is a deplorable anti-Catholic rant trying to pass
itself off as a provocative thriller about the true nature of
faith, and where faith resides within humankind. Though widely
panned by most critics, the film still garnered $19.3 million in
its opening weekend, booting ``The Sixth Sense'' out of the top
spot for the first time in weeks. So much for Donohue's statement
that ``The good news is that there exists a small audience for such
an exploitative film, and all the hype and technical effects in the
world can do nothing to redeem this bomb of a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   My status as a one-time altar girl notwithstanding, I found the
film offensive, but was hardly surprised by this latest hint of
Hollywood's attitude regarding priests. Along with lawyers and
psychologists, priests have become one of the most maligned groups
on the big screen. Reel-for-reel, even serial killers are presented
as more cuddly and charming than anyone wearing a cassock and a
collar.
</P>
<P>
   Things have certainly changed. We're a long way from Pat O'Brien
getting Jimmy Cagney to turn chicken to save the Dead End kids from
a life of crime in ``Angels in Dirty Faces,'' Spencer Tracy's
tough-but-tender Father Flanagan in ``Boys Town,'' Montogomery
Clift's willingness to take a murder rap rather than break the
sancitity of a parishioner's confession in ``I Confess,'' or Bing
Crosby's too-ra-loo-ra-loo-a-ing to save failing St. Dominic's in
``Going My Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, more often than not, we get the tried, tested, and tired
variations of priests who are far more sinners than saints. There's
the bad priest like ``Stigmata's'' Pryce, who obviously has quite a
few melodramatic scowls left over from his villainous turn in the
James Bond flick, ``Tomorrow Never Dies.'' He's a conniving
cardinal willing to break every commandment to preserve the
church's lofty perch as the house of God. Other examples of the bad
priest are Robert De Niro's double-dealing monsignor in ``True
Confessions,'' and Stanley Anderson's corrupt and sexually deviant
archbishop in ``Primal Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sexual deviancy, then there's all those
celluloid clerics who surrender to sins of the flesh. Byrne, as a
priest-scientist who has trouble resisting the oh-so-resistible
Arquette in ``Stigmata,'' joins a long line of picture-show priests
who give new meaning to the term ``hot under the collar.'' The
worst of the lot is Tom Berenger in the abysmal ``Last Rites,'' in
which his hunky holy man actually moves a young woman into his
quarters in St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows there are some priests out there who misuse their
position and status for personal gain. And there is certainly a
place for well-made, thoughtful films _ such as the devastating
``Boys of St. Vincent'' _ which explore the darker sides and
motivations of the clergy. But there has to be something better
than films like ``Stigmata,'' which offer nothing more than cheap
titillation, religious mumbo-jumbo, and all the depth of Madonna in
her crucifixes a-plenty stage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's time for priests to form some kind of
anti-defamation league or association for the advancement of
clerical people. To borrow a line from the eels's ``Novocaine for
the Soul,'' ``Jesus and his lawyer are coming back'' _ and not a
moment too soon.

SOMETIMES A MISTAKE IS JUST A MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For readers who care deeply about language, every dumb usage
error that shows up in print can be a sign of declining literacy,
proof that today's journalists, like their less hurried colleagues
in other branches of the writing trade, are more careless and less
well educated than previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to sympathize, sometimes, with the pessimists.
When beg the question and comprise are used incorrectly _ by
traditional standards _ nine times out of 10, the original meanings
are probably doomed, and the long battle to save them can make even
a dispassionate usagist suspect that instruction may be futile.
</P>
<P>
   But some mistakes are just mistakes, not early warning signs of
trends, welcome or otherwise. Take tenderhooks, for instance _ a
misspelling that horrified Richard Morris of Wellesley when he
found it in The Wall Street Journal last month. Tenderhooks _ it
sounds like the equipment a seductress would have used, back when
there were seductresses _ ought to have been tenterhooks, the
spikes or nails that hold fabric stretched on a frame, or tenter,
to dry. Tentering (from the Latin for ``to stretch'') is associated
mostly with cloth weaving, but, says Morris, ``When I was a
youngster, my mother used a tenter to dry window curtains.'' He
blames sloppiness and ``a not surprising ignorance'' of tenterhooks
for the rising tide of tenders.
</P>
<P>
   But are the waves really lapping at our ankles? In fact, The
Wall Street Journal, which quickly printed a letter correcting its
error, has printed tenderhooks only one other time in 17 years. In
the Globe, tenderhooks appears only twice in the 20 years spanned
by our computer records. The entire Lexis/Nexis news archive coughs
up only about 80 examples of the accidental tenderhooks _ and less
than a third of those are in US publications. London, Glasgow,
Toronto, Singapore _ anywhere English is printed, tenderhooks
appears sooner or later. It doesn't appear to be gaining ground,
though, probably because it's relatively rare even in its correct
form; the people who spell it right are more than a match for those
who spell it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So let's cross that off the list of worries and turn to
sticks-in-the-mud, which set off alarm bells for Mary Anne
McQuillan, of Freetown, when she spotted it in the Globe last
month. ``Shouldn't it be stick-in-the-muds?'' she asks. ``My image
of that was always of a person mired in a mudhole . . . not of a
twig stuck in mud.'' Exactly so: A stick-in-the-mud is neither a
kind of stick nor a kind of mud, but a person stuck in the mud, set
in his ways, resistant to change. So the word is a unit, and like
will-o'-the-wisps, jack-in-the-pulpits, and Scotch and sodas, it
has the regular, s-at-the-end plural form.
</P>
<P>
   But again, is it a problem? The Globe's files show six
sticks-in-the-mud to seven stick-in-the-muds _ hardly a comfortable
margin for the good guys. A closer look, though, offers some
grounds for optimism: The wrong plural has appeared only twice in
the '90s, while the right one has made five appearances in this
decade. Stick-in-the-muds bears watching, but for the moment, the
proper plural is gaining on the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Another sneaky mistake may be more of a threat, if only because
it seems to be flying below the radar, including mine. A few months
ago, David Tuggy e-mailed from Mexico to ask if I'd really meant to
write that there might be ``a trend underfoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a blooper I've recorded repeatedly,'' he wrote. ``To
me it is still a rather funny blend of afoot with underway . . .
with perhaps resonances of secrecy and illegitimacy from
underhanded, underground . . . and so forth.'' But Tuggy,
generously doing the research for me, found that half the people he
asked ``think it's perfectly straightforward English; the other
half think it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I look at it, I think it's funny, too. As Tuggy
suggests, using underfoot in that way gives it a sense of the
sinister, even of the ground shifting under our feet; afoot doesn't
necessarily have that connotation, despite Shakespeare's
``Mischief, thou art afoot.'' But underfoot has useful meanings
already _ ``How can I work with these children underfoot?'' _ and
if I'd noticed my nonstandard usage, I would have chosen a
different word.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuggy is the only reader who challenged underfoot, which
suggests that its new meaning may well be afoot _ if not underway,
under way, or under weigh. So if you don't like it, get out your
binoculars; it's not an easy invader to spot.

HILLARY'S PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEVITTOWN, N.Y. _ The steep hill that Hillary Rodham Clinton
faces in her almost-adopted state is not theoretical; nor is it the
product of extrapolated polling numbers.It's very real and very
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Gail Lacks, a bookkeeper at a company in the Long Island
town of Syosset. She's an Independent who follows politics and
tends to vote in Democratic primaries. She's for Al Gore for
president, but her second choice is George Bush, and Elizabeth Dole
is her third.
</P>
<P>
   More important, she was solid for President Clinton's reelection
three years ago; and most important, she has a visceral dislike for
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any really strong feelings against her until she
put out this stuff that she had a Jewish relative,'' said Lacks,
herself Jewish and 53. ``I just deeply resented that, because it
wasn't a matter of truth; she was just using it as a ploy. That did
it. I just don't like Hillary; I really don't want her to be a
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. So let's try another Clinton '96 female voter _
Trudy Strober, 55 and retired. She considers herself Independent,
not that political, and tends toward Republican primaries. She's
for Elizabeth Dole right now, with Bill Bradley the only Democrat
she could imagine being for later.
</P>
<P>
   To Strober, Mrs. Clinton's sin is that she comes across to this
Long Islander as pure pol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all this double-talk all the time,'' she said the other
evening. ``No matter what it is, I get the impressing that all
she's doing is playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the impression she has of New York City's loudmouth
mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent. To her,
Giuliana represents that precious commodity in these exasperating
times _ authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rudy says it's Thursday, it's Thursday all day,'' Strober
said. ``There's never any hidden agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Lacks and Trudy Strober were among 14 female voters who sat
down for a structured discussion in this congested suburban town.
Under the aegis of a national housing and community investment
organization, Republican pollster Frank Luntz led them through
their political paces. They were narrowly for Clinton, and narrowly
for loser Al D'Amato in last year's Senate war _ about what you'd
expect from a middle-class, largely white slice of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   The group was also solidly for Mayor Giuliani, but what was
interesting about their division was the source of Giuliani's
advantage, women who had picked the president over Bob Dole. There
was nothing in the group discussion that precluded a Hillary
Clinton victory eventually, as a moderate Democrat in a heavily
Democratic state. But the length of the journey she clearly must
still make is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   There was not, for what it's worth, much talk about her
out-of-state life, and none at all about recent Clinton headlines
like the family's decision to buy a home in Westchester County and
the string of communication goofs that added fuel to the fire of
Bill Clinton's decision to offer conditional clemency to more than
a dozen Puerto Rican nationalists convicted of serious weapons and
conspiracy charges in the 1970s and '80s. Instead the talk was
mostly about the kinds of would-be leaders they tend to trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's reaching,'' said Laurie Sheridan, another Bill Clinton
voter, and a part-time teacher and Independent with Democratic
leanings who's for Bradley. ``More than that, she's an
opportunist.''
</P>
<P>
   The outnumbered supporters were not shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a strong woman,'' said a 25-year-old English teacher,
Roseanne Merell, hinting at the Clintons' private lives. ``I mean
what about Jackie Kennedy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's much the better candidate,'' insisted Gloria Klayman, 58
and retired. ``Giuliani is arrogant, and that means he just can't
work with others, which is what you have to do as a senator.
Hillary is just brilliant, and she'll stand up for kids and women.
All this reminds me of what it was life all those years ago when
Robert Kennedy ran here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joanne Lewis, 37 and a homemaker, countered with the
pro-Giuliani side of that case, that ``a good politician will stick
to his guns and go along his line and persuade others to go along
with them.'' And she voted for the president three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Generalizations are always dangerous in these settings, but the
loss (at least for now) of voters who helped create the Clinton
landlside here three years ago is what makes Clinton-Giuliani a
horse race today. In addition, there is more to all this than just
polarized opinion about Mrs. Clinton; suburban support for Giuliani
is also personal and goes deeper than mere relief at the Big
Apple's lower crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   But down the road, the way the two divide on issues that matter
to people here will be critical. Giuliani, the Republican, against
Clinton, the Democrat, is the campaign that favors the first lady,
which is probably why so much of the GOP babble about her has been
so personal. As I could tell out here last week, the voters are
still seeing this in personal terms as well.

MALL MANIA SLOWLY TURNS TO MALAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HADLEY, Mass. _ There was a time when men worked together to
give this mall the look of an alpine village, but that time is 30
years past.
</P>
<P>
   The water wheel has been dismantled and the banks of
spathiphyllum left to die. At the end of an echoing, concrete-lined
hallway a Batman Forever video game asks, over and over, if you
have a thing for bats.
</P>
<P>
   And you get the feeling it's been a long time since the mall's
hopeful, original name, ``Mountain Farms,'' crossed anyone's lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what they call it? They call it the Dead Mall,'' said
Bill Cooley, who works in a computer store that is one of the
mall's few tenants. ``Go into town, ask anyone about the Dead Mall,
and they'll know exactly what you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, in the retail-saturated Connecticut Valley, Mountain
Farms is being dismantled to make way for a Wal-Mart. Fairfield
Mall, in Chicopee, has stocked emptying storefronts with
religious-themed holograms and scented candles. Eastfield Mall, in
Springfield, has added a multiplex to stave off its decline.
</P>
<P>
   Every neighborhood has its own sad example, but the problem is
not local. Across the country, enclosed malls are spending their
third decades in a slow slide toward obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same urbanists who rallied to protect dying downtowns
are working on solutions to a new crisis: What do you do with a
dying mall?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known about dying cities for a long time,'' said Shelley
Peticha, director of the San Francisco-based Congress for the New
Urbanism, an urban planning think tank that focuses on combating
suburban sprawl. ``But now we're starting to hit this wave where
this whole inventory of '60s and '70s malls basically don't work
anymore. . . . This is on the radar of so many communities right
now it's just something you can't ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only yesterday that social critics were bemoaning
the mall's success in colonizing America; no one foresaw the
problem of mall failure. Yet PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted
recently that 15 to 20 percent of existing malls are likely to fail
over the next decade, and the Congress for the New Urbanism puts
the number of malls standing empty now at 3,800 _ about 2 billion
square feet of empty space, radiating their air of stagnation into
the neighborhoods around them.
</P>
<P>
   The mall life cycle is a personal issue to Al St. Denis, whose
bookstore has a five-year lease at the ailing Fairfield Mall in
Chicopee. Next to his cash register hangs a 1989 ``Manager of the
Year'' plaque that he says reminds him of better days, before the
Gap and Caldor's left, and before Friendly's gave way to businesses
on short-term leases selling Pokemon cards and workout tapes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the mall's clients are mostly elderly, and St. Denis
does much of his business in scratch tickets; as he speaks, a
woman's walker scrapes across the floor. St. Denis gives a
prominent display spot to a book called ``Alzheimer's Disease:
Accepting the Loss with Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't see an end to it any time soon. ``I'll tell you, it
takes forever to close a mall,'' St. Denis said. ``I've been to
malls in Florida that only have one or two tenants left, but they
stay open.''
</P>
<P>
   The simplest explanation for the regional mall's predicament is
market saturation. The amount of retail space per person in this
country has increased by 30 percent since the mid-1980s, with each
new, glossy mall drawing customers from the form that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, new enclosed malls continue to go up at a rate of
almost 10 per year, according to the International Council of
Shopping Centers _ below the 19 that were built in 1990, but up
from the average of four a year in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone in the Connecticut Valley malls that have been
competing for business for 20 years and they'll tell you the market
is already crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time there are enough malls there may be too many
malls,'' said Jerry Rosenswaike, 53, who runs a Beanie Baby kiosk
at Auburn Mall, which has covered a vacant anchor spot with posters
announcing $5 million in free prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Others draw a broader conclusion, saying Americans have actually
lost their taste for the mall experience. The length of the average
mall visit has been dwindling since the 1980s, according to
statistics from the International Council of Shopping Centers, as
time-starved working women cut down on all-day browsing. It's also
an aesthetic choice, some say, pointing out that the great asset
that malls had to offer in the 1960s and 1970s was a completely
artificial environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we try to manufacture these false environments,
they're sort of thin,'' said Mark Falcone, a Colorado developer
whose father developed malls, and who has now turned his attention
to recycling malls. ``People got the sense that this is costumery,
and you get sick of a costume much quicker than the real thing.
People are thirsting for more real, substantive kinds of places.''
</P>
<P>
   Some _ especially those who hated malls in the first place _ say
it's not too early to render a verdict on the entire mall era.
That's a point of view that has caught on in Western Europe, where
Norway this year put a five-year ban on construction of new malls,
and Britain's top environmental official issued an edict in 1995
strongly discouraging suburban mall construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mall was a kind of experiment that doesn't work,'' Peticha
said. ``It's failed.''
</P>
<P>
   But spending at malls rose 13 percent between 1995 and 1997,
according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.And the
question of why some malls have failed is less urgent than the
question of what to do with their carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Peticha recalled, ``We realized, `Oh my God,
this is happening all over the country,' '' and the Council for the
New Urbanism teamed up with the International Council of Shopping
Centers on a study of how a failing mall drags down the community.
</P>
<P>
   One planning commentator proposed that corporations who put up
big box stores pledge to finance their demolition once they outlive
their usefulness. In a study for the Council for the New Urbanism,
Falcone recommends that the government forgive outstanding
mortgages for the owners of doomed regional malls, who could, in
turn, release tenants from their leases and turn slow decline into
speedy redevelopment for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the country, you're talking about literally
hundreds of thousands of acres that could be put back into public
use,'' said Falcone, whose firm, Continuum Partners, is working on
mixed-use renovation of struggling shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Empty malls have been successfully transformed into office
buildings, schools, and churches, and one Virginia developer has
looked into reusing malls as jails. More commonly, though, malls
are being reworked as a more modern retail space by removing the
structure's roof and creating a pedestrian walkway. Mashpee
Commons, on Cape Cod, comes up frequently as a model for the
revised mall style.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, consistently, is to make the space less mall-like _ a
considerable challenge in the asphalt-flanked suburban expanses
that appealed to mall developers 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to adaptively reuse an older building in a
downtown that has other things going on around it, as opposed to a
free-standing structure in a cornfield,'' said Constance Beaumont,
who has researched the problem of abandoned big box stores for the
National Trust for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, America's malls continue to guard against the voodoo
that makes an atmosphere go bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an intangible,'' Beaumont said. ``They
probably reach a tipping point at some point, where you go to a
mall and there are just too many empty storefronts.''

<P>
   What you want, when you hold a pendant fashioned 35,000 years
ago by a Neanderthal _ a fox's tooth with a tiny hole for a leather
string _ is something only the movies can give. A close-up, in the
lab's neon light, on the mottled canine between your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The picture fades, and next you see the same tooth in different
hands _ the hands of the craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes are human eyes, alive with memories of other seasons at
this place, with intelligence and hope.
</P>
<P>
   No, hold it: Maybe those Neanderthal eyes are blank as a cat's,
all surface, with nothing behind them but dumb instinct and a bit
of animal cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Back to spring 1999 and the lab, at a modern campus of the
University of Paris. An archaeologist named Dominique Baffier holds
the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few days newspapers the world over have been
reporting the discovery in Portugal of the skeleton of a 4-year-old
child, dead for 25,000 years. The discoverers, led by Portuguese
archaeologist Joao Zilhao, are making a ground-breaking claim: that
the skeleton shows traces of both Neanderthal and modern human
ancestry, evidence that modern humans did not simply extinguish the
Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the two kinds of human were so alike that in Portugal,
at least, they intermingled _ and made love _ for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
   The claim is controversial. So, too, and for similar reasons, is
the fox tooth Baffier is holding. A collection of such ornaments is
arrayed on the table in front of her, along with delicate bone
tools.
</P>
<P>
   All these artifacts were dug from the mouth of a limestone cave
four decades ago at Arcy-sur-Cure, 100 miles southeast of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past year, though, the Arcy artifacts have become
the subject of heated debate. Zilhao, Baffier and several French
colleagues claim the artifacts show that Neanderthals were not
inferior to our ancestors, the Cro-Magnons. Independently, they
underwent the same leap into modernity.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Joao Zilhao, director of the Portuguese Institute of Archeology,
got the call from his wife and fellow archaeologist, Cristina
Araujo, while he was at a conference in Japan. She had heard from
Joao Mauricio and Pedro Souto, co-workers at a Neanderthal cave
site.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard from a student named Pedro Ferreira, who had
found rock art in the Lapedo Valley, about 90 miles north of
Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Last Nov. 28, Mauricio and Souto went to the Lapedo Valley _
which is really a small, steep ravine, a bit over a mile long and a
stone's-throw wide.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira showed Mauricio and Souto his rock art, and they
confirmed that it looked manmade and old (Copper Age, it turned
out).
</P>
<P>
   Then they looked across the ravine to the south side. Above the
treetops they could see a limestone wall leaning out over the
canyon. Prehistoric humans liked to take shelter under overhanging
rocks like that. Mauricio and Souto decided to have a look.
</P>
<P>
   In a fissure in the wall, Mauricio and Souto saw sediments laced
with stone tools and lots of animal bones. Mauricio also saw a
rabbit burrow disappearing under a nearby rock. He reached his hand
in and pulled out a radius and an ulna _ the bones of a human
forearm, though he wasn't sure of that at the time.
</P>
<P>
   When the news reached Zilhao, he called Cidalia Duarte, a
physical anthropologist at the Portuguese Institute of
Architectural Heritage. They and Araujo went up to Lapedo the next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While Zilhao examined the stone tools embedded in the cliff face
seven feet up, Mauricio took the bone lady to the bones in the
burrow.
</P>
<P>
   At first Zilhao and Duarte guessed they had excavated a boy. The
arms and legs looked robust. But then Erik Trinkaus, a
paleoanthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis, had a
look at them. He decided the Kid was robust not because he was
male, but because he had Neanderthal blood.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkhaus measured all the bones he could, especially the limbs
_ his specialty. In 1981, Trinkaus published a paper on limb
evolution that is still cited. In it he documented a geographic
pattern in people today: They get shorter the farther they are from
the tropics and the closer they are to the poles. More precisely,
their extremities get shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Inuits and Lapps have shorter forearms relative to their upper
arms and shorter shinbones relative to their thighbones than do the
Masai of East Africa. There is a simple explanation: Shorter,
stockier bodies fare better in cold climates because they have less
surface area to radiate heat.
</P>
<P>
   By measuring fossil limbs, Trinkaus showed that Neanderthals,
denizens of Ice Age Europe, were hyperarctic _ they had an even
smaller shinbone-thighbone ratio than do Lapps. Early moderns from
the Near East and Europe, on the other hand, were decidedly
tropical in their legginess, like Africans today.
</P>
<P>
   This was some of the earliest evidence for a theory of human
origins that had not even been formulated then, but has since
become orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-Africa theory holds that humans today are descended
from a small population of (long-legged) early moderns that walked
out of Africa around 100,000 years ago. As they spread all over the
world, they replaced whatever archaic humans they met, which in
Europe were the Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, Neanderthals are a distinct population and maybe
even a distinct species that went extinct at the hands of our
ancestors, leaving no legacy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus has long favored a sort of watered-down out of Africa,
in which the gene pool of modern humans migrating into Europe was
seasoned by interbreeding with Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   Cro-Magnons reached northern Spain nearly 40,000 years ago, but
for some reason they didn't spread south for another 10,000 years.
Farther south they encountered Neanderthals. It is from this clash
of cultures and anatomies, Trinkaus argues, that the Kid was born.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp point of the Kid's chin screamed Cro-Magnon. So did
the relatively small front teeth: Neanderthal front teeth were
large compared with their molars. And so did the radiocarbon date:
At 24,500 years old, it was much younger than the last signs of
Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   But when Trinkaus measured the angle between the horizontal
tooth line and the vertical line from the frontmost tooth down to
the chin, the symphyseal angle, he got a clue that this was a
strange Cro-Magnon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of jutting forward of the teeth, the chin retreated a
shade behind them. Cro-Magnon chins didn't do that, Trinkaus says,
but Neanderthal chins did.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant, he thinks, are the limb proportions.
Trinkaus measured the shinbone and the thighbone and found that the
ratio fell way over at the Neanderthal end of the curve. He
compared the circumference of the bones with their length, and
found that the child had leg bones strong enough to support a
stocky Neanderthal body. The limb proportions along with the
receding chin are enough, Trinkaus says, to prove the child had
Neanderthal ancestors as well as Cro-Magnon ones.
</P>
<P>
   If Trinkaus and Zilhao can prove that modern humans and
Neanderthals mixed extensively in Portugal, it would surely affect
our view of Neanderthals _ by giving us an inkling of the view our
ancestors held.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two populations of hunter-gatherers that are
totally different species, that are doing things in very different
ways, have different capabilities _ they're not going to blend
together,'' Trinkaus says. ``They're going to remain separate. So
the implication from Portugal is that when these people met, they
viewed each other as people. One group may have looked a little
funny to the other one _ but beyond that they saw each other as
human beings. And treated each other as such.''

   What you want, when you hold a pendant fashioned 35,000 years
ago by a Neanderthal _ a fox's tooth with a tiny hole for a leather
string _ is something only the movies can give. A close-up, in the
lab's neon light, on the mottled canine between your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The picture fades, and next you see the same tooth in different
hands _ the hands of the craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes are human eyes, alive with memories of other seasons at
this place, with intelligence and hope.
</P>
<P>
   No, hold it: Maybe those Neanderthal eyes are blank as a cat's,
all surface, with nothing behind them but dumb instinct and a bit
of animal cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Back to spring 1999 and the lab, at a modern campus of the
University of Paris. An archaeologist named Dominique Baffier holds
the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few days newspapers the world over have been
reporting the discovery in Portugal of the skeleton of a 4-year-old
child, dead for 25,000 years. The discoverers, led by Portuguese
archaeologist Joao Zilhao, are making a ground-breaking claim: that
the skeleton shows traces of both Neanderthal and modern human
ancestry, evidence that modern humans did not simply extinguish the
Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the two kinds of human were so alike that in Portugal,
at least, they intermingled _ and made love _ for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
   The claim is controversial. So, too, and for similar reasons, is
the fox tooth Baffier is holding. A collection of such ornaments is
arrayed on the table in front of her, along with delicate bone
tools.
</P>
<P>
   All these artifacts were dug from the mouth of a limestone cave
four decades ago at Arcy-sur-Cure, 100 miles southeast of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past year, though, the Arcy artifacts have become
the subject of heated debate. Zilhao, Baffier and several French
colleagues claim the artifacts show that Neanderthals were not
inferior to our ancestors, the Cro-Magnons. Independently, they
underwent the same leap into modernity.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Joao Zilhao, director of the Portuguese Institute of Archeology,
got the call from his wife and fellow archaeologist, Cristina
Araujo, while he was at a conference in Japan. She had heard from
Joao Mauricio and Pedro Souto, co-workers at a Neanderthal cave
site.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard from a student named Pedro Ferreira, who had
found rock art in the Lapedo Valley, about 90 miles north of
Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Last Nov. 28, Mauricio and Souto went to the Lapedo Valley _
which is really a small, steep ravine, a bit over a mile long and a
stone's-throw wide.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira showed Mauricio and Souto his rock art, and they
confirmed that it looked manmade and old (Copper Age, it turned
out).
</P>
<P>
   Then they looked across the ravine to the south side. Above the
treetops they could see a limestone wall leaning out over the
canyon. Prehistoric humans liked to take shelter under overhanging
rocks like that. Mauricio and Souto decided to have a look.
</P>
<P>
   In a fissure in the wall, Mauricio and Souto saw sediments laced
with stone tools and lots of animal bones. Mauricio also saw a
rabbit burrow disappearing under a nearby rock. He reached his hand
in and pulled out a radius and an ulna _ the bones of a human
forearm, though he wasn't sure of that at the time.
</P>
<P>
   When the news reached Zilhao, he called Cidalia Duarte, a
physical anthropologist at the Portuguese Institute of
Architectural Heritage. They and Araujo went up to Lapedo the next
weekend.

   You probably write with a particular hand, kick with a
particular foot, peer through a telescope with a particular eye and
raise the telephone receiver to a particular ear.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these habits says more about your brain than it does
about your body parts, because handedness, footedness, eyedness and
earedness (actual neurological terms) are different manifestations
of what brain researchers call hemispheric lateralization.
</P>
<P>
   Hemispheric refers to the division of the brain into left and
right halves, and lateralization describes the brain's tendency to
make the two halves specialize in controlling different functions.
</P>
<P>
   Most people favor their right hands and feet, for example,
because the left halves of their brains, which control the right
sides of their bodies, are better suited for fine movements.
</P>
<P>
   The left hemisphere also supports speech in the vast majority of
people, and there is growing evidence that the left brain is
superior when it comes to analyzing fine details in vision,
audition and touch.
</P>
<P>
   The right cerebral hemisphere, by contrast, does a better job
than the left in reading facial expressions, decoding tone of voice
in speech and comprehending the big picture in visual, auditory and
tactile stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Lateralization is a hot area of research because cognitive and
behavioral differences between the hemispheres can be correlated
with corresponding differences in size, weight, cell density,
neurochemistry and physiology to help understand how the brain
encodes information and performs tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Although neuroscientists use sophisticated measures (for
example, carefully isolating different kinds of stimuli in the left
and right visual fields) to tease out subtle hemispheric
differences, you can perform a couple of simple experiments to
discover how your own brain has organized itself.
</P>
<P>
   EXPERIMENT 1: With both eyes open, hold up our right thumb at
arm's length under an object across the room directly ahead of you.
Now alternately close your left and right eyes, and see if your
thumb appears to jump to the right or left with respect to the
distant object.
</P>
<P>
   If you are right-eyed like 54 percent of the population, your
thumb will jump to the right when you close your right eye but stay
put when you close your left eye.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite will occur if you are left-eyed like 5 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   If you see little or no jumping, you are among the 41 percent of
the population who are neither strongly left-eyed or right-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   EXPERIMENT 2: Memorize the first paragraph of this article, then
go find a broom, a clock with a second hand, a pencil and a pad of
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Time how long you can balance the end of the broom on the tip of
your right index finger while standing on your right foot, then on
your left index finger while standing on your left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat the test while reciting the paragraph you have memorized.
Speech will be localized on the side of your brain opposite the
hand that is most affected by recital of the paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   By closely observing how people use the different halves of
their bodies, you can see the power of brain specialization at work
_ string musicians finger notes with their left hands, field goal
kickers usually score with their right feet, and it's a good bet
that about 35 percent of eavesdroppers consistently listen through
walls with their right ears.
</P>
<P>
   Look for smaller details too, like which eye your friend uses to
thread a needle.
</P>
<P>
   Nature doesn't shout these secrets, it whispers them.

   I have nothing against kids going outside the box. I've been out
there, and it's pretty scary, but why not let the young and brave
do some exploring?
</P>
<P>
   I only have a problem when they come back into my box, inside my
walls, with a superiority complex. I really don't need someone who
goes to bed before the news comes on telling me how to live my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they persist in bringing me the latest news flashes from
the outside world. Now, I'm getting lectures on social
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, we have to start doing a better job of recycling,'' my
son informed me a few days ago. ``I know your generation didn't do
a lot of recycling, but if we want to save the ozone and the rain
forest, we have to consume less and preserve more.''
</P>
<P>
   I just stared at him over the rim of my coffee cup. I have
trouble forming sentences before I have my coffee, so he picked a
great time for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, Mom, we can't put everything in one paper bag like we've
been doing. We need to separate the plastic from the newspaper. We
should also have a container for the aluminum. We can even recycle
the foil because it can be melted down and made into something
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and waited for me to respond with awe and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   I just stared at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, are you listening? Have you gone to that Mommy place in
your mind again where women get pedicures and eat chocolate all
day?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, son,'' I said. ``I was just thinking about how much you
remind me of your great-grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she recycle, too? I didn't think they knew about recycling
back in the olden days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, my grandmother invented recycling. The only things she
ever threw out were bones for the dogs, and she made soup with
those before they got to them. She had the skinniest dogs I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   I put my empty coffee cup on the table and leaned back in my
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you must remember that your great-grandmother lived
through the Depression and three or four wars, so she knew how to
make it through hard times. Grandma could stretch a dollar so far
that even George Washington would tell a fib just to get out of her
tight fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I remember one family reunion when I had to carry the
same cup around for three days because Grandma wouldn't give us
another one. It was a plastic cup, for goodness' sake! To Grandma,
plastic didn't mean disposable; it just meant that we wouldn't
break it when we washed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every blue moon she would buy that wonderful Blackburn's Syrup
from the manufacturing plant right there in Jefferson, Texas, where
she lived. Once the syrup was gone, and it took awhile because she
poured it for us, she would use the thick glass jars that the syrup
came in to store her fruit preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we ate the preserved fruit and vegetables in the winter,
we used those same jars to drink water drawn from her well in the
summer. Of course, once she discovered plastic, she saved the good
jars for company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma didn't waste a thing. She read the paper from cover to
cover, then she used it to wrap our Christmas presents or to start
the fire in her wood-burning stove. And forget melting the
aluminum; we had to wash that, too! Grandma reused a piece of foil
until it tarnished and turned into paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that woman was resourceful. The most amazing thing she
ever did was to save the cotton balls from all of her aspirin
bottles and knit me a sweater before I went off to college.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, my son looked a little skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, did she really knit you a sweater from cotton balls?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I made that part up, but the rest of the story is true.
See, there's this old saying about necessity being the mother of
invention. Well, your grandmother didn't start recycling to save
the planet; she did it so that her large family could survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd sort of forgotten all those wonderful lessons she
taught me about not wasting anything and being content with what
you have. Thanks for reminding me, son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Mom, no problem. But we need to talk about the computer,
too. You haven't been shutting it down properly and ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, son. Let's talk about that tomorrow. I can absorb only one
lecture a day. I come from those olden days, you know. We're kind
of slow.''

TOURIST PARK COULD ENRICH AMARILLO AREA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us who live in Texas don't think of Amarillo as the
tourist center of the state. Actually, we don't think of Amarillo
as the center of anything. It has to do with geography.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extremity, to be frank. It is the part of the state
that map makers cut off. You can get El Paso, or you can get
Amarillo; but generally you can't get both.
</P>
<P>
   What we forget is that Amarillo is all some visitors see of
Texas. Traveling from the Northeast or the Midwest, millions of
motorists take Interstate 40 across Oklahoma, and through the Texas
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   They like to stop in Amarillo. They have to stop in Amarillo. It
breaks the monotony of wheat fields and windmills. It offers
several entertaining opportunities. It has bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the year, visitors can drop down to the Palo Duro
Canyon for the musical pageant Texas, where flag-carrying horsemen
ride to the rim of the canyon while lightning flashes overhead and
thunder rolls through the valley.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the American Quarter Horse Association Museum and
Headquarters, the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, and
a cowboy breakfast on the canyon rim every morning.
</P>
<P>
   But those are things to see and do while passing through, and,
as good as they might be, they aren't what people in the travel
industry call ``destination sites.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, travelers see Amarillo on the way to somewhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Hess wants to change that. He envisions a cultural heritage
center in the Palo Duro Canyon that will be both a resort and an
entertainment center. A place where visitors will come and stay for
days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have produced Texas for 34 years,'' said Hess, director of
the musical drama. ``We are the official play of Texas, and we have
people from all over the world come to see it. They often say,
`This is a magnificent place, what else is there to do?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Hess said, there have been no answers for them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, armed with optimistic feasibility studies, Hess and other
Amarillo promoters are ready to build a giant tourist park on the
edge of Palo Duro Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe strongly in cultural tourism,'' he explains. ``We
want to unite the area history, culture and natural wonders. We
want to bring them together in a concept that will be appealing to
visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Hess and his group want to showcase the authentic
cowboy, Native American and Spanish-Mexican cultures that are a
part of the Texas Panhandle heritage.
</P>
<P>
   It will be done primarily through the performing arts, he said.
It will be something of a theme resort, but without rides.
</P>
<P>
   All Hess needs now is funding. He said it would take about $25
million to get the first phase up and running. If he had the money
now, it would take 18 months to get started.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hefty price tag, but Hess isn't worried. He thinks the
project is worth the worry, the effort, the years of planning. He
is looking for investors now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't chart a course into the future without understanding
where we came from,'' he said. ``It is important to our young
people.''

 &HT;    SPECIAL INTERESTS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO SALVAGE TAX CUTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American public, which greeted the $792 billion
Republican tax cut with a yawn, may hardly notice when the bill is
sent to President Clinton for his promised veto later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Republican rallies and town hall meetings, constituents
have not caught the tax-cutting fever. In fact, some lawmakers
found more enthusiasm for using future surplus funds for paying off
the still growing federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   But for dozens of special interests and their lobbyists, the big
10-year tax cut bill is still the opportunity of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 percent of the tax breaks are custom-built for
businesses of all sizes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Defense contractors, and multinational insurance companies and
oil companies won breaks for overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicken farmers in the Mid-Atlantic states won credits for
burning poultry waste to produce electricity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boat captains in Alaska would be allowed $7,500 deductions for
taking Eskimos out for their ritual whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   _ A manufacturer in Illinois convinced Congress to drop an
excise tax on fishing tackle-boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tax cuts can be traced to political clout.
</P>
<P>
   In the case Plano Molding Company, said to be the largest
tackle-box maker in the country, it didn't hurt that it was located
in Plano, Ill., in the home district of the Republican House
Speaker Dennis J. Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Money was a key indicator, according to a study made by Common
Cause, a private group that criticizes the role of money in
politics. The study noted that nine industry groups that scooped up
$60 billion in tax cuts also had contributed $180 million in
unregulated ``soft'' money to the two parties over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that won tax breaks also tended to spend heavily on
lobbying. The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan
research group calculated that last year insurance companies spent
$77 million on lobbying, the oil and gas industry spent $58
million, the computer industry $39 million and the defense industry
$28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the expected failure of the initial tax bill, these
groups could have a stronger hand as they plot their salvage
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared to wait till next year,'' said Lonnie
Taylor, chief lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who is
pushing forward for business tax cuts, even if the final compromise
bill is less than half the size of the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a tough job, but we've met tough challenges
before,'' Taylor said. His organization has already sent out an
``urgent action call'' for members around the country to contact
their lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the breaks are considered a shoo-in, even if the final
tax cut bill is scaled down to a bare minimum.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``must pass'' provisions include research and
development tax credits, which expired last June. These credits are
a top priority for pharmaceutical and high tech companies, that are
also a major source of funding for the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Finding room for brand-new provisions on a slimmed down tax bill
of no more than $300 billion could be more difficult, but not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lockheed Martin led a coalition of defense
contractors in obtaining tax credits for overseas arms sales,
similar to those given other types of manufacturers for their
exports. For defense industries, the long-sought credits would save
$1.1 billion over the projected 10-year life of the proposed tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in limbo, waiting to see what happens,'' said Alexis
Allen, spokeswoman for the Aerospace Industries Association that is
lobbying for the tax credits. If this effort fails, she said, there
will be other tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, winning approval is often much easier after a tax break
has been around the track once.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an item is included in a tax bill that passes the Congress,
it's easier for the proponent to go back to Capitol Hill,'' said
Evan Liddiard, a former aide for the Senate Finance Committee, who
is now a partner at KPMG accounting firm. ``It puts it higher on
the priority list.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled lobbyists coming to him to urge a provision by
saying, ``If it was a good idea then, why isn't it a good idea
now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very powerful argument,'' Liddiard said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the explosion of special interest items on the current
tax bill has dampened support, even among some of the staunchest
proponents of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more special about these than any of the
dozens of other (special tax breaks),'' said Pete Sepp, spokesman
for the National Taxpayers Union. ``They're the direct result of
applying the right pressure in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayers Union, which never saw a tax cut it didn't like,
supports the bill ``warts and all,'' Sepp said. ``But we would hope
that Congress would pass cuts that are across the board for
everyone.''

SERIAL KILLER WAS SUBJECT OF 1986 TV MOVIE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What's the name of the movie about the serial killer
Christopher Wilder? Also, are there any books about him?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.M., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Wilder was the subject of ``Easy Prey,'' a 1986 made-for-TV
movie starring Gerald McRaney as the serial killer. Shawnee Smith
portrayed Tina Marie Risico, a 16-year-old whom Wilder kidnapped
and forced to participate in another abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gibney wrote about Wilder in ``The Beauty Queen Killer,''
a book that was reissued in 1990. You may be able to special order
it from bookstores using ISBN 1-5581-7345-5.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, a millionaire businessman and race car driver, raped and
killed eight women from February to April 1994 and abducted three
others who escaped. He shot himself in a struggle with New
Hampshire state troopers in a town near the Canadian border.

   HURRICANE FLOYD
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-MAIN _ From Florida to North Carolina, nearly 2 million
people were urged to get out of the way of Hurricane Floyd as one
of the most powerful storms of the century threatened to tear up
the Southeast ``like a weed-eater going up the coast.'' Floyd's eye
was expected to pass within 90 miles of southern Florida on
Tuesday, and perhaps within 50 miles of north Florida by Wednesday
morning, before striking land somewhere farther north. Main news

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ This oil-rich country was once known as the
``Saudi Arabia of South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Flush with revenues from the largest petroleum reserves outside
the Middle East, Venezuela rocketed to prosperity in the 1970s, its
per-capita income rising to the highest levels in all of Latin
America. Caracas boomed with towering skyscrapers, efficient new
highways and a subway system that shames New York City's.
</P>
<P>
   The country's growing middle class sent their children to
college at home and abroad, while hopping weekend flights to Miami
for shopping and entertainment sprees.
</P>
<P>
   But just as quickly as the oil bonanza appeared, the bubble
burst. Declining oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s have cast a pall
over a country that earns 80 percent of its export revenues from
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment crept up, while an inflation surge in recent years
stifled purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The situation reached a crisis in recent months as gross
domestic product, or GDP, contracted by nearly 10 percent for the
second consecutive quarter and unemployment jumped to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Venezuelans don't blame the vagaries of the market for their
problems: instead they place the fault squarely at the feet of the
country's politicians, saying they have squandered the prosperity
this nation tasted only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so angry with these politicians they want to kill
them,'' said Johnny Mendez, a Caracas taxi driver. ``The hate we
have here is so big. Eighty percent or our people are poor, but
they know Venezuela is a very rich country. The politicians have
stolen it from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such anger is widespread, and fueled the rise of President Hugo
Chavez. Jailed after a failed coup attempt in 1992, Chavez
sidestepped the two major parties in a campaign last year that
swept him into office in a landslide. He promised a ``peaceful
revolution'' that would chase the corrupt and inept out of
government, while rebuilding the nation's institutions with a new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried international observers with his inflammatory
rhetoric, his friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro and his duels
with the Venezuelan Congress. Some fear he is headed toward a
familiar role: the South American strong man, or ``caudillo,''
usually a military man who steps in and runs an ailing country with
a strong hand but little regard for the niceties of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to Venezuelans in the street and they'll tell you they
want just such a leader _ a man with a ``mano dura,'' a ``firm
hand.'' Americans just don't understand, they say, because they've
never seen the levels of corruption and mismanagement familiar in
too many Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans think a dictator is like Fidel Castro,'' Mendez
said. ``But that's not what we mean. We want a dictator like Marcos
Perez Jiminez ,'' a Venezuelan caudillo in the 1940s who is
credited with setting the country on the path to modern prosperity.
``Democracy as we've had it has done no good. It's been a license
for the elite to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a tumultuous first six months in office, Chavez
still draws enthusiastic crowds wherever he goes, and seems to
relish his populist image. A baseball player as a youth, he has
tossed pitches to visiting major-leaguers. He donates his salary to
a scholarship fund, visits poor neighborhoods and has done away
with a $100 school registration fee that prompted an enrollment
jump of 600,000 students in Venezuela's schools.
</P>
<P>
   He started a program that has put the nation's army to work
helping build schools and make other social improvements, and has
proposed a new agency that would make easy credit available to
mom-and-pop businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if such efforts are a drop in the bucket compared to the
nation's labyrinth of problems, their symbolism isn't wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings us great hope,'' said Alexis Martinez, a Caracas
resident. ``He's tossing out the immorality and corruption of the
past 40 years, and he's helping the people who have been
marginalized for all those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's story is typical in recession-stricken Venezuela. For
seven years, he had a good job as a security guard, earning the
equivalent of about $500 a month. But his company cut back and laid
him off, so he has scrambled to start a new business sewing
clothes, learning the skill from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez will give us loans,'' he said. ``He's a man of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosana Sojo has also had employment problems. After graduating
last year from secretarial school, she could find no work in the
worsening economic climate. Now she sells lottery tickets on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Chavez because he doesn't waste time,'' she said. ``He
doesn't fall for anything. But now he must fulfill what he has
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   That caveat is clearly Chavez's biggest challenge. Having risen
to power by promising a radical break from the politics of the
past, he must also manage to turn around the nation's battered
economy. He has been helped by a recent jump in oil prices, which
has cut the nation's budget deficit, but he has also spooked
badly-needed foreign investment with inflammatory speeches about
turning back the clock on free markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has gained the status of God,'' Chavez told
reporters on a recent visit to Brazil. ``We, the leaders, are going
from summit to summit, and our people are going from abyss to
abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chavez fails, if the economy fails to turn around,
Venezuelans say they won't regret giving the outspoken leader a
try. Things were so bad, they say, that any kind of change is an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you tear down the house, there is dust and dirt,''
Martinez said. ``But if we tried to build a new Venezuela on a
rotten foundation, it would only fall.''

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ One week he's touring a poor neighborhood
where soldiers he has ordered out of the barracks are helping build
a new school for impoverished children. The next he's shuffling top
management at one of the hemisphere's major oil companies, sending
ripples through world markets.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he's unveiling a plan to jumpstart the faltering
small-business sector with a new credit agency. Then he's back to
sparring with the country's Congress, asserting the authority of an
assembly that aims to tear up the constitution and rebuild the
nation's political institutions from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary social reformer or would-be dictator: both labels have
flown around Venezuela's breathless new president, Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation reeling from its worst recession in memory, in a
region rumbling with turmoil Chavez has shaken things up. After
leading a failed coup attempt in 1992, his landslide election
victory last fall and break-neck first six months in office have
captured the imagination of millions of Latin Americans while
unsettling business interests and stirring a buzz in diplomatic
circles from Washington to Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is almost a mythical figure,'' said Carlos Sabino, a
sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela and longtime
observer of the country's politics. ``He is not cultured, but he is
very sharp. He proudly calls himself 'pata en el suelo,' which
means barefoot peasant, but he wears a red beret and some people
call him the Rambo of Venezuela. He is strong but humble. He is an
intuitive political animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Chavez takes his country of 23 million residents is a
matter of keen interest for Latin America-watchers. After a wave of
oil-fueled economic progress in the 1980s that was accompanied by a
shift toward free elections and away from oppressive dictatorships,
the region has plunged back into uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experiment-in-the-making that's very important for all
of Latin America,'' said Jennifer McCoy, a Georgia State University
political scientist and director of the Carter Center's Latin
American programs. ``I think Chavez sincerely wants to help the
people and to create a democracy that is more responsive and
participatory. The risk is that if you rely too heavily on a large
mandate and popularity, you can lose sight of the checks and
balances that ensure power is shared among the different levels and
branches of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Several top Venezuelan officials were scheduled to meet with
Carter Center officials Sept. 17(CQ) in Atlanta to discuss their
effort to draw up a new constitution. Earlier in the week, the
delegation also was to meet with officials from the United Nations,
the U.S. Congress and Chase Manhattan Bank in an effort to counter
what they feel has been a wave of critical media reports about the
situation in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to provide them with the effective reality of what
is happening here and not the distorted (reality) that has been
published in some cases,'' Luis Miquilena, head of the National
Constitutional Assembly, told reporters here in Caracas before
departing for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have expressed concern over the country's
political instability, with a State Department spokesman urging the
preservation of democracy in Venezuela ``in substance as well as in
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns peaked earlier this month when members of the Assembly
_ a body elected in July and salted heavily with Chavez supporters
_ clashed with the nation's Congress. After a series of Assembly
decrees left the Congress nearly powerless, tensions flared as
frustrated members of the Congress scaled the fence to get back
into the building from which they had been barred.
</P>
<P>
   An uneasy truce emerged on Sept. 10 when the two bodies reached
an agreement brokered by the Catholic Church. The Congress will be
allowed to reconvene in October, while the Assembly will
concentrate on writing the new constitution, which could go to
voters for approval as early as December. Elections for a new
Congress would presumably be held shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the upheaval, Chavez has maintained his stunning
popularity, with opinion polls showing a consistent 70 percent
approval rating. Observers say his message of cleaning up a
notoriously corrupt political system and sharing the nation's
abundant oil wealth with the people has struck a profound chord
with a populace frustrated by a near 30-year decline in prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But things have gotten worse since Chavez took office. In recent
months, unemployment has skyrocketed to 20 percent, with some
estimating it may soar to 50 percent by the end of the year.
Economic output has shrunk dramatically, declining nearly 10
percent in the first half of 1999, while foreign investment has
dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state is very rich, but our government in the past has
behaved as if it were the owners of these riches, not the
administrators,'' said Vicente Britos, head of Fedecamaras, the
national association of Venezuelan Chambers of Commerce. ``The
government has an obligation to guarantee that a considerable
amount of these riches are transferred to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, has built his political career on a promise to do
just that. Raised in Venezuela's interior, a rugged region of
cattle farms, he came from a family of poor schoolteachers. He made
his career in the military, rising to the rank of colonel in a
paratroop division.
</P>
<P>
   His coup attempt in 1992 ended in failure and he was jailed for
two years. After his release, he quietly began barnstorming the
countryside, hammering away about the need to toss out the corrupt
system built by the two political parties that have dominated
Venezuelan politics since the first free elections in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The message proved wildly popular. Venezuelans, who elected
Chavez in a landslide last November, are outraged that their
resource-rich country now suffers widespread poverty, with some
estimates showing as much as 80 percent of the population below the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, has become bloated with more than a
million employees, with rampant corruption at all levels. Many
agencies reportedly have no record of where their appropriations
go, while bureaucratic red-tape strangles attempts to start new
industries. There is a widespread belief that crooked politicians
have frittered away the nation's wealth. ``People want a savior, a
magical solution, and that's what Chavez offers,'' said Sabino.
``But that's where the contradictions lie. Chavez is a populist, a
leftist, but he understands he must have a strong economy and
foreign investment, and he can't get these without the facade of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who took office in February, adamantly insists he has no
designs to set himself up as a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one here can say they are persecuted _ absolutely no one _
by the government,'' he told reporters recently.

<P>
   Many observers have compared Chavez to Peru's President Alberto
Fujimori, who swept to power in a crisis-wracked country in the
early 1990s, tossing out the existing government with army backing.
But some draw distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that Chavez, after failing to take power
illegally by a coup, has come back legally through elections,''
McCoy said. ``I think he is a new model. He has an elected
constitutional assembly that is asserting its powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear the assembly is little more than a rubber-stamp,
and that Chavez is moving toward an authoritarian regime. He has
proposed expanding the president's term to six years and allowing a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern over some of his rhetoric and friendships:
Chavez appears to have close ties to Cuba's Fidel Castro, and has
invited Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Ghaddafi to an
oil summit in Venezuela next year. He even penned a friendly letter
to an infamous Venezuelan-born terrorist, ``Carlos the Jackal,''
who is serving a life term in a French prison.
</P>
<P>
   But any missteps perceived abroad are lost on Venezuelan voters,
many of whom seem captivated by Chavez's whirlwind pace working for
what he calls a ``peaceful revolution.'' He has cut government
spending, put the army to work on social programs, and solidified
his populist image with moves like getting rid of the presidential
limousine and turning over his $1,200-a-month salary to a
scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to raise the flag of tyranny,'' he has told
reporters. ``Our intention is to rebuild institutions, to
strengthen democracy. We respect our adversaries and their ideas.
We respect liberties. We persecute no one.''
</P>
<P>
   But just how long Chavez's popularity will hold up in the face
of the economic crisis remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have hopes, high hopes, and they will give him a chance
for a time,'' said Sabino, the sociologist. ``But how much longer
people can bear the situation I don't know. I think we will know
when the new constitution is in place. By the spring we will know
which way Chavez really will take us.''

</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-RESTAURANT (Roses, Spain) _ Some say it is the best
restaurant in Europe, possibly the world. No one mentioned that it
is so remote. A friend and I sped around hairpin curves on a
pitted, single lane mountain road, with nothing above us and the
Mediterranean a sharp descent below. The road snaked around the
mountain and eventually delivered us at the base of a sunny, narrow
cove. There was an empty beach, a rundown shack and a small villa
wedged into the hillside. This was El Bulli. This was the Michelin
three-star restaurant everyone was talking about. The one that six
top American chefs _ Charlie Trotter, Todd English, Norman Van
Aken, Roberto Donna, Jean Louis Palladin and Douglas Rodriguez _
would all flock to this same week and the next, not for an event
but on a pilgrimage. The one where the chef, Ferran Adria, is
rarely referred to as a chef, but as a mad scientist, a genius, a
Dali of the kitchen. By Amanda Hesser.

   NY-CORNED-BEEF (New York) _ When I first came to New York, at
17, I pestered the school friend I was visiting until he took me to
Lindy's for corned beef and cheesecake. I figured that that was the
closest an Ohio kid was likely to get to the fragrant, seductively
shady world of Damon Runyon and Walter Winchell. Now newcomers to
New York _ not 17-year-olds, I guess, but 21- and 22-year-olds _
angle for tables at Balthazar or Nobu. Pals initiate them to Krug
instead of cream soda. Corned beef is alive and well, of course. It
shows up around the world, in one guise or another. But in New
York, where once it was king, good kosher-style corned beef is as
rare as nightingales' tongues. By R.W. Apple Jr.

CLUB PLANS MUSICAL CELEBRATION FOR HANK WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The idea of a Hank Williams karaoke may find
some people shaking their heads, but others can't wait to get on
stage and break into ``Jambalaya'' or ``Settin' the Woods on Fire''
or ``I Can't Help It If I'm Still in Love With You.'' For those
folks, the Elbo Room in San Francisco is hosting a sing-along
Wednesday night in honor of Hank Williams' 76th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a sign-up sheet for singers who can take the stage
one by one to launch into their favorites, with the Rounders band
rushing to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have songbooks people can go through, sheets of
lyrics,'' said Rick Quisol, drummer for the Rounders. ``When they
come up on stage we'll figure out what key they want to sing in, on
the spot, and away we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Quisol has been the guiding spirit behind the Williams birthday
party, going into its ninth year, as it has moved from club to club
in San Francisco. The party was held last year at Marco's 23 Club,
and before that it was hosted by Cafe du Nord, the Ace Cafe, Bottom
of the Hill, Club Paradise and the Hi-Ball Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   A Williams memory from the Hi-Ball night is one of his best,
said Quisol: ``Someone came up from Japan, could barely speak
English, and he wanted to do a Hank Williams classic, `Lovesick
Blues.' We didn't know what to expect ... kind of prepared for the
worst ... but this guy hit the microphone and nailed it. He just
nailed it, yodeling and everything. He had it completely down.
Everybody in the band, their jaws just dropped, and the people in
the club were yelling and applauding ...''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who died of a drug overdose in the back of a Cadillac
on New Year's Eve 1952, would have been 76 years old on Sept. 17.
From almost the day he turned to music, Quisol has made it a point
of marking Williams' birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized a lot of songs I kept hearing in my childhood _
Rosemary Clooney doing `Cold, Cold Heart,' other pop songs _
belonged to Hank Williams,'' Quisol said. ``To me, his music speaks
to everyone, from all different walks of life, and that's who comes
to these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got so many people who know Hank Williams songs,
without really realizing it. It's not just for people who are
country music fans. ... So many different kinds of people come to
this, you don't know what to expect. The spirit of celebration is
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Nowicki, steel guitar player for the Rounders, said people
can't get enough of a Williams song, even if it is played over and
over. ``You'll play the same song two, three times in a row and it
won't matter to the next person,'' he said. ``It's their favorite
Williams tune, too, so you just change the key and go at it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission to Williams night, which starts at 9:30 p.m., is $5.
For more information, call the Elbo Room, 647 Valencia St. in San
Francisco, at 415-552-7788, or 415-468-4454.

 By DAVID GRANN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    One Sunday afternoon in Austin, Tex. _ not far from the
Governor's Mansion _ Marvin Olasky, the man widely regarded as the
godfather of ``compassionate conservatism,'' is working on his most
recent disciple.
 &HT;    As we drive through the city after services at the Redeemer
Presbyterian Church, Olasky keeps looking in his rearview mirror at
Fred Cantu, a tattooed ex-con who is sitting in the backseat, as if
trying to discern something he can't quite make out.
 &HT;    Cantu has just been released from prison for the third time, and
Olasky, an ordained elder, is trying to help him _ not through the
state's traditional welfare services but through his own
faith-based program, New Start, a model of the philosophy on which
George W. Bush is staking his Presidential campaign.
 &HT;    ``Fred just needs to show he can stick to a job,'' Olasky says
to me as he eyes Cantu. ``Then he can take some writing classes at
the community college, and then who knows?''
 &HT;    Cantu blinks, as if trying to imagine it. ``I hardly write
nobody,'' he says. ``I was writing my mother, but I stopped doing
that because I don't want to upset her.''
 &HT;    Olasky is still wearing his church clothes _ khakis, a blazer
and tie _ and tightly grips the steering wheel as the car rumbles
through the Texas hills.
 &HT;    A delicate man with little round glasses and a neatly cropped
beard, this former Communist seems like an unlikely figure to have
emerged as one of the stars in Bush's constellation of policy
wonks.
 &HT;    Yet Olasky, once a relatively obscure author of a dozen books,
has hit the conservative movement, in the words of The Weekly
Standard's editor, Bill Kristol, like ``a thunderbolt.''
 &HT;    In July, Bush vowed, in his first major policy speech as a
candidate, to ``rally the armies of compassion in our communities
to fight a very different war against poverty'' _ one based on
religious and community groups like New Start _ and afterward he
paused to thank Olasky.
 &HT;    ``He has really been one of the people who has been most
helpful,'' Bush told me, in shaping these ideas. Indeed, when I ask
one of Bush's top aides to explain what a compassionate
conservative administration might look like, he says simply, ``Talk
to Marvin.''
 &HT;    Now, in the car, Olasky describes all the things that Cantu will
have to do when he enrolls in New Start _ everything from attending
Bible study and meeting with a church mentor _ that are central to
what Olasky and Bush have called ``the transforming power of
faith.''
 &HT;    But whether faith or even private charities are really a viable
or appropriate alternative to government assistance is open to
debate.
 &HT;    ``To expect small-scale fragmented groups to bear the brunt of
the most pressing concerns of society is foolish,'' says Thomas
Sugrue, a professor of history and sociology at the University of
Pennsylvania.
 &HT;    Liberals and even some conservatives observe that the welfare
state arose precisely because in the first part of this century,
private charities failed to adequately address the needs of the
poor. And so far, Olasky's own personal test with Cantu does not
appear to be going well.
 &HT;    The subject, who has just served a three-year stint for
burglary, seems to be only partially listening.
 &HT;    ``Can I borrow your truck?'' he asks suddenly. Olasky squints in
the mirror. ``We'd have to work out an arrangement,'' he says. ``We
would know the mileage.''
 &HT;    ``Obligations are O.K.,'' Cantu interjects. ``I need that
discipline.''
 &HT;    By the time Olasky pulls into the bus station, Cantu has
seemingly undergone a miraculous transformation.
 &HT;    ``I'm enthusiastic about God,'' he says. ``I'm on fire to serve
Jesus Christ!''
 &HT;    He then slams the door, leaving behind the faint smell of
tobacco. As we drive back through the valley, I ask Olasky if he
thinks Cantu will make it this time out.
 &HT;    ``The question is,'' he says, ``has this been a genuine
conversion?''
 &HT;    Olasky has always had the conviction of a convert, of someone
who is not only embracing one set of beliefs but is also actively
repudiating another.
 &HT;    He was born in Massachusetts in 1950 to second-generation
Russian Jewish immigrants, and early on began his search for a
unifying theory of the universe, his own private Big Bang.
 &HT;    Initially, he found it where all the Olaskys had _ in the Torah.
But as a teen-ager, he grew increasingly skeptical of religion,
until, under the spell of his older brother and the writings of H.
G. Wells, he disputed God's existence altogether.
 &HT;    ``I was bar mitzvahed at 13,'' he says, ``and an atheist by
14.'' It wasn't until college, however, that he truly renounced his
roots.
 &HT;    In 1968, as Bush was finishing his four years at Yale, Olasky
was enrolling as a shy and awkward freshman. Both men _ in what
would be essential to their eventual spiritual and intellectual
convergence _ were equally adrift.
 &HT;    But while Bush drank to excess and purportedly participated in
branding rituals with his fraternity brothers, Olasky grew his
sideburns long and read Marx and Lenin.
 &HT;    Even in his activism, his classmates say, he was oddly
``puritanical'' and ``monkish,'' once going on a five-day hunger
strike to improve the conditions of university workers.
 &HT;    After graduating in only three years, he married his high-school
sweetheart and settled in Oregon, where, consumed with visions of
revolution, he became almost an ascetic. Thin and drawn, he grew a
beard down to his chest like Fidel Castro's and did something
almost unheard of at that late date: he joined the Communist Party.
 &HT;    For Olasky, Communism represented what he had always been
looking for _ a codified worldview, a theory with neat rules and
by-laws. He wasn't an idle member.
 &HT;    ``Lenin had said it would be necessary to 'crawl on one's belly,
like a snake,' for the good of the revolution,'' he once wrote,
``and I was ready to slither.''
 &HT;    As his marriage crumbled, he hopped a Russian freighter and
toured the Soviet Union. Upon his return, he propagated his beliefs
as a graduate student at the University of Michigan, often bullying
his fellow students in class.
 &HT;    But while researching his dissertation, he underwent his
ultimate conversion.
 &HT;    ``God changed my worldview not through thunder or a whirlwind,''
he later wrote, ``but by . . . a repeated, resounding question in
my brain: What if Lenin is wrong? What if there is a God?''
 &HT;    During this time, he met Susan Northway, who would become his
second wife. By 1973, he had resigned from the Communist Party and,
once again, turned against everything he had earlier believed.
 &HT;    ``We asked ourselves which denomination represented the extreme
opposite of the hard left,'' Susan recalls. ``Then we looked in the
phone book and found the Conservative Baptist Church. By the end of
that summer of '76, we had come to Christ.''
 &HT;    When he finally handed in his dissertation _ hailing
anti-Communists instead of denouncing them _ his teachers were
stunned.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't accept it,'' says Cecil Eby, his professor at the
time. ``I felt like he had gone from being extremely partisan on
one side to being extremely partisan on the other. It was
baffling.''
 &HT;    Jew, atheist, Communist, evangelical Christian _ Olasky has been
on quite a journey. Despite alienating his former comrades and
family, Olasky pursued his new faith with the same zeal he had
pursued his old ones.
 &HT;    In 1989, while on leave from a teaching job at the University of
Texas and researching a new book on charities, he stumbled upon
what would become the cornerstone of his and, to a large extent,
Bush's political philosophy.
 &HT;    In the stacks of the library of congress, Olasky found dusty
texts on 19th-century philanthropists, men and women like Charles
Brace, a writer and missionary who worked with abandoned children
in New York.
 &HT;    Rather than merely distributing handouts, they imposed demands
and discipline on the poor, and in contrast to the current welfare
state, in Olasky's view, provided the spiritual as well as material
sustenance that shapes character.
 &HT;    To test his theories, Olasky dressed up as a beggar _ complete
with stocking cap and plastic bag _ and visited several shelters in
Washington, D.C. For two days, as he wandered from kitchen to
kitchen, he received plenty of soup and bread. But no one, he says,
ever asked him why he was there or helped him to help himself. Nor
did anyone, even in the church-run charities, offer him the one
thing he says he kept asking for: a Bible.
 &HT;    ``Most of these places,'' he says, outchurching the churches,
``have forgotten that people have souls.''
 &HT;    In 1992, Olasky finally published his findings in ``The Tragedy
of American Compassion.'' Initially the book went almost unnoticed,
and those few who reviewed it decried it as ``romantic,''
``shallow'' and ``bizarre'' _ the work of a ``utopian'' crank.
 &HT;    But although most academics dismissed the book, a small coterie
of Beltway conservatives began to circulate it privately.
 &HT;    Former Secretary of Education William Bennett hailed it as the
``most important book on welfare and social policy in a decade''
and handed a copy to the new Republican Speaker, Newt Gingrich.
Gingrich read it from cover to cover and liked it so much, he had
it distributed to all the incoming freshmen.
 &HT;    In his first address to the nation, Gingrich declared: ``Our
models are Alexis de Tocqueville and Marvin Olasky. We are going to
redefine compassion and take it back.''
 &HT;    Overnight, Olasky, the perennial convert, had seemingly
converted an entire party. A small band of policy wonks and
legislators _ many of whom would go on to work for Bush _ began
calling themselves ``compassionate conservatives.''
 &HT;    This little-known professor was suddenly a fixture on the
television talk shows and in the back corridors of Congress. While
slashing the welfare state, Olasky's disciples sought to unleash an
outpouring of charitable works through Federal grants, tax credits
and partnerships between church and state.
 &HT;    These measures represented only the first step in what Olasky
regarded as a revolution _ turning the Government's responsibility
to the poor over to private charities.
 &HT;    Yet despite all the lip service paid to compassionate
conservative ideas, even these modest initiatives never
materialized. Almost all of the proposals were killed before they
even reached the floor _ largely at the hands of the same
Republicans who had wrapped themselves only months earlier in
Olasky's language of compassion.
 &HT;    Far from helping the poor, his critics charged, Olasky had
provided a smokescreen for guiltlessly cutting back the welfare
state. Even Olasky compares what some Republicans did to the poor
to pulling the knife out of the back of a person who had been
mugged and then leaving him on the street to bleed.
 &HT;    ``You can't just say, You're fine _ get up,'' he says. ``You
have to spend a lot of time patching the guy up.''
 &HT;    But to his critics, Olasky's outrage only seemed like evidence
of his naivete.
 &HT;    Dejected and dispirited, Olasky returned to Austin, where he,
like Charles Brace in the 1800's, waged his solitary crusade.
Through his church, he collaborated on the founding of the New
Start program. He helped ease people off welfare, and with his
wife, he ran a crisis center for pregnant women.
 &HT;    In 1993, Olasky got a phone message from George W. Bush asking
to meet. By this time, Bush, who was running for Governor of Texas,
had also ``recommitted his life to Christ.''
 &HT;    Both men prayed daily and had a visceral sense of their own
sins. While Bush had drunk too heavily in the 1980's, Olasky had
divorced his first wife _ an act that contrasted markedly with his
later Christian writings about family values.
 &HT;    Both also concealed the details of their transgressions: while
Bush has dodged the drug question, Olasky had _ until a family
member accidentally mentioned it to me _ carefully hidden his
divorce from the press.
 &HT;    After an hourlong meeting with Bush, Olasky was sure he had
found a new messenger for his ideas. But Bush didn't call again for
two years.
 &HT;    Then in 1995 _ six months after Bush was swept into office _
state employees of Texas threatened to close down a drug program
centered on religious conversion, ostensibly because it had
violated safety codes.
 &HT;    Some 300 supporters of the organization staged a small rally at
the Alamo, the Lone Star symbol of defiance. In the dual role of
advocate and journalist, Olasky showed up with pen in hand.
 &HT;    ``It was real hot, and we were both sweating,'' recalls the Rev.
James Heurich, executive director of Teen Challenge of South Texas.
``He was just smiling and grinning at me, and I had the sense that
this was fun for him. But I didn't think anything was going to come
of it. Next thing I know, we're in The Wall Street Journal.''
 &HT;    Governor Bush, caught in one of the first crises of his
administration, tried to turn the confrontation into a political
opportunity. Seeking out Olasky for guidance, he quickly set up a
task force, which recommended unraveling the state's regulatory
grip over faith-based groups.
 &HT;    Despite charges that he was violating the separation between
church and state, Bush enacted a spate of legislation that promoted
religious drug_treatment centers, prison ministries and church-run
day-care centers.
 &HT;    The legislation didn't allocate more money for the poor so much
as redirect it to faith-based programs by removing regulations that
stood in their way _ allowing Bush to win accolades with the
religious right and at the same time to avoid spending more money
on social services.
 &HT;    Olasky, the congenital true believer, became a Bush convert. ``I
don't think this is just rhetoric,'' he says.
 &HT;    The conversion seems to be mutual. By this summer, Bush had not
only made Olasky the head of his policy subcommittee on religion,
but also embraced broad strokes of Olasky's vision.
 &HT;    The most difficult and delicate issue for Bush's campaign now is
how to promote Olasky's battalions of faith-based healers _ the
so-called zealots _ without allowing them to proselytize their
faith.
 &HT;    Bush insists that under compassionate conservative policies, no
one will be forced into a faith-based program. There will always be
options _ and many charities will have no faith component at all.
 &HT;    But if religion is the most provocative element of Bush's
vision, critics say its bigger challenge is more worldly: there
simply aren't enough Marvin Olaskys out there to replace Uncle Sam.
 &HT;    Even Bush acknowledges on the stump that Government cannot be
completely replaced by charitable ``armies of compassion'' and his
aides say his administration would conduct only a kind of grand
experiment _ a four-year trial period to see which programs
actually work best: the state's, the private sector's or a
combination of the two.
 &HT;    But many fear that any experiment at all that depends on the
altruism of local individuals will mean, as Dianne Stewart of the
Center for Public Policy Priorities in Texas puts it, a ``step back
even further from a safety net for the poor.''
 &HT;    Modern American life doesn't leave much time for sainthood.
Colin Powell's volunteer summit has not produced the philanthropic
outpouring that many expected. According to Investment Sector, the
percentage of American adults who volunteer has actually declined
since the late 1980's. And despite the robust economy, corporate
giving is down.
 &HT;    ``If everyone was like Olasky,'' says Representative Mark
Souder, the Indiana Republican, ``he would be right: we wouldn't
need government.''
 &HT;    But if everyone isn't, who will man Bush's armies of compassion?

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    One Sunday afternoon in Austin, Tex. _ not far from the
Governor's Mansion _ Marvin Olasky, the man widely regarded as the
godfather of ``compassionate conservatism,'' is working on his most
recent disciple.
 &HT;    As we drive through the city after services at the Redeemer
Presbyterian Church, Olasky keeps looking in his rearview mirror at
Fred Cantu, a tattooed ex-con who is sitting in the backseat, as if
trying to discern something he can't quite make out.
 &HT;    Cantu has just been released from prison for the third time, and
Olasky, an ordained elder, is trying to help him _ not through the
state's traditional welfare services but through his own
faith-based program, New Start, a model of the philosophy on which
George W. Bush is staking his Presidential campaign.
 &HT;    ``Fred just needs to show he can stick to a job,'' Olasky says
to me as he eyes Cantu. ``Then he can take some writing classes at
the community college, and then who knows?''
 &HT;    Cantu blinks, as if trying to imagine it. ``I hardly write
nobody,'' he says. ``I was writing my mother, but I stopped doing
that because I don't want to upset her.''
 &HT;    Olasky is still wearing his church clothes _ khakis, a blazer
and tie _ and tightly grips the steering wheel as the car rumbles
through the Texas hills.
 &HT;    A delicate man with little round glasses and a neatly cropped
beard, this former Communist seems like an unlikely figure to have
emerged as one of the stars in Bush's constellation of policy
wonks.
 &HT;    Yet Olasky, once a relatively obscure author of a dozen books,
has hit the conservative movement, in the words of The Weekly
Standard's editor, Bill Kristol, like ``a thunderbolt.''
 &HT;    In July, Bush vowed, in his first major policy speech as a
candidate, to ``rally the armies of compassion in our communities
to fight a very different war against poverty'' _ one based on
religious and community groups like New Start _ and afterward he
paused to thank Olasky.
 &HT;    ``He has really been one of the people who has been most
helpful,'' Bush told me, in shaping these ideas. Indeed, when I ask
one of Bush's top aides to explain what a compassionate
conservative administration might look like, he says simply, ``Talk
to Marvin.''
 &HT;    Now, in the car, Olasky describes all the things that Cantu will
have to do when he enrolls in New Start _ everything from attending
Bible study and meeting with a church mentor _ that are central to
what Olasky and Bush have called ``the transforming power of
faith.''
 &HT;    But whether faith or even private charities are really a viable
or appropriate alternative to government assistance is open to
debate.
 &HT;    ``To expect small-scale fragmented groups to bear the brunt of
the most pressing concerns of society is foolish,'' says Thomas

 &HT;    Liberals and even some conservatives observe that the welfare

private charities failed to adequately address the needs of the

seemingly undergone a miraculous transformation.

like Charles Brace in the 1800's, waged his solitary crusade.
Through his church, he collaborated on the founding of the New
Start program. He helped ease people off welfare, and with his
wife, he ran a crisis center for pregnant women.
 &HT;    In 1993, Olasky got a phone message from George W. Bush asking
to meet. By this time, Bush, who was running for Governor of Texas,
had also ``recommitted his life to Christ.''
 &HT;    Both men prayed daily and had a visceral sense of their own
sins. While Bush had drunk too heavily in the 1980's, Olasky had
divorced his first wife _ an act that contrasted markedly with his
later Christian writings about family values.
 &HT;    Both also concealed the details of their transgressions: while
Bush has dodged the drug question, Olasky had _ until a family
member accidentally mentioned it to me _ carefully hidden his
divorce from the press.
 &HT;    After an hourlong meeting with Bush, Olasky was sure he had
found a new messenger for his ideas. But Bush didn't call again for
two years.
 &HT;    Then in 1995 _ six months after Bush was swept into office _
state employees of Texas threatened to close down a drug program
centered on religious conversion, ostensibly because it had
violated safety codes.
 &HT;    Some 300 supporters of the organization staged a small rally at
the Alamo, the Lone Star symbol of defiance. In the dual role of
advocate and journalist, Olasky showed up with pen in hand.
 &HT;    ``It was real hot, and we were both sweating,'' recalls the Rev.
James Heurich, executive director of Teen Challenge of South Texas.
``He was just smiling and grinning at me, and I had the sense that
this was fun for him. But I didn't think anything was going to come
of it. Next thing I know, we're in The Wall Street Journal.''
 &HT;    Governor Bush, caught in one of the first crises of his
administration, tried to turn the confrontation into a political
opportunity. Seeking out Olasky for guidance, he quickly set up a
task force, which recommended unraveling the state's regulatory
grip over faith-based groups.
 &HT;    Despite charges that he was violating the separation between
church and state, Bush enacted a spate of legislation that promoted
religious drug_treatment centers, prison ministries and church-run
day-care centers.
 &HT;    The legislation didn't allocate more money for the poor so much
as redirect it to faith-based programs by removing regulations that
stood in their way _ allowing Bush to win accolades with the
religious right and at the same time to avoid spending more money
on social services.
 &HT;    Olasky, the congenital true believer, became a Bush convert. ``I
don't think this is just rhetoric,'' he says.
 &HT;    The conversion seems to be mutual. By this summer, Bush had not
only made Olasky the head of his policy subcommittee on religion,
but also embraced broad strokes of Olasky's vision.
 &HT;    The most difficult and delicate issue for Bush's campaign now is
how to promote Olasky's battalions of faith-based healers _ the
so-called zealots _ without allowing them to proselytize their
faith.
 &HT;    Bush insists that under compassionate conservative policies, no
one will be forced into a faith-based program. There will always be
options _ and many charities will have no faith component at all.
 &HT;    But if religion is the most provocative element of Bush's
vision, critics say its bigger challenge is more worldly: there
simply aren't enough Marvin Olaskys out there to replace Uncle Sam.
 &HT;    Even Bush acknowledges on the stump that Government cannot be
completely replaced by charitable ``armies of compassion'' and his
aides say his administration would conduct only a kind of grand
experiment _ a four-year trial period to see which programs
actually work best: the state's, the private sector's or a
combination of the two.
 &HT;    But many fear that any experiment at all that depends on the
altruism of local individuals will mean, as Dianne Stewart of the
Center for Public Policy Priorities in Texas puts it, a ``step back
even further from a safety net for the poor.''
 &HT;    Modern American life doesn't leave much time for sainthood.
Colin Powell's volunteer summit has not produced the philanthropic
outpouring that many expected. According to Investment Sector, the
percentage of American adults who volunteer has actually declined
since the late 1980's. And despite the robust economy, corporate
giving is down.
 &HT;    ``If everyone was like Olasky,'' says Representative Mark
Souder, the Indiana Republican, ``he would be right: we wouldn't
need government.''
 &HT;    But if everyone isn't, who will man Bush's armies of compassion?

 ALMODOVAR and HIS WOMEN

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-996-0075;
fax, 310-996-0089.  By JONATHAN VAN METER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When Pedro Almodovar learned that the Hollywood Madam, Heidi
Fleiss, once employed a prostitute who went by the name of Norma
Jean Almodovar, he was tickled no end. ``This is really
something,'' he says, in his amusing, broken English. ``And she was
police before she decided to become prostitute. This is very
interesting and very honest.''
 &HT;    Only in Almodovar's strangely ordered universe would a
cop-turned-whore seem honest. Almodovar's 13th film, ''All About My
Mother,'' which opens the New York Film Festival on Sept. 24,
features Sister Rosa, a nun who contracts AIDS from a drag queen _
who, as it happens, is also the father of Rosa's baby.
 &HT;    Nearly all of Almodovar's films since his 1980 feature debut are
populated with transsexuals, porn stars, drag queens,
sadomasochists and drug addicts.
 &HT;    But simply to list these character types is to give the wrong
impression.
 &HT;    ``Never has sex looked more appealing,'' says John Waters, the
Baltimore director who is often grouped with Almodovar.
 &HT;    His films are ``gay and straight and all sexualities put
together in the best possible way,'' Waters adds. ``Even the
strangest sexuality in his films is always joyous and funny.''
 &HT;    Oddly enough, it's the unconventional subject matter _ freaky
characters, sex, drugs _ that has helped insure the success of his
movies in the United States.
 &HT;    ``One of the glories of his work,'' says Richard Pena, the
programming director of the New York Film Festival, ``has been the
fact that all of these issues can be handled, not only in comedy,
but with a kind of subtlety and generosity. These are relationships
that people have: you deal with the transvestite who used to be
your boyfriend.''
 &HT;    But, to borrow the phrase that his most successful film made
clichi, Almodovar seems to be on the verge of something different.
His two most recent films, ``The Flower of My Secret'' and ``Live
Flesh,'' showed signs of maturation and newfound writing skill that
are even more evident in ``All About My Mother,'' which caused a
sensation at Cannes earlier this year.
 &HT;    The film tells the story of Manuela, whose teen-age son is
killed by a car; she goes in search of her son's father, who is now
named Lola.
 &HT;    While the so-called freaks and junkies are firmly in place,
``All About My Mother'' is really a film about women _ mothers,
nuns, actresses and, yes, transsexuals and drag queens.
 &HT;    The film draws from a variety of legendary femalecentric sources
_ ``All About Eve,'' ``A Steetcar Named Desire,'' John Cassavetes's
``Opening Night'' and Truman Capote's ``Music for Chameleons,'' to
name a few.
 &HT;    However, this is not, as Almodovar says, ``passive tribute,''
but rather, wholesale sampling. It's as if all of his influences
and ideas about women have finally jelled into something profound.
 &HT;    Indeed, professionally, Almodovar seems pleased and relieved to
have arrived at a more mature vision. Personally, though, he is
having a much tougher time.
 &HT;    Almodovar talks endlessly and with great intensity _ in both
Spanish and English _ sometimes switching language midsentence. In
conversation, he displays a spectacular confidence that
occasionally veers toward arrogance. Utterances like, ``The decade
of the 80's, absolutely I'm the owner of that decade,'' roll
effortlessly off his tongue.
 &HT;    It's not hard to imagine that he might be difficult to work
with. He himself admits to having ``burned up'' relationships with
longtime friends; of the actresses that he's famous for working
with _ and famous for falling out with _ he says: ``I have problems
with all of them. My relations with them are so intense, sometimes
it's very similar to the worst part of love and sex
relationships.''
 &HT;    Cecilia Roth, who appeared in Almodovar's first four films and
returns after 14 years in ``All About My Mother,'' says: ``He is
like a lover! He asks everything about you! He needs everything!
He's curious and intense and possessive, like a boy.''
 &HT;    Seeming younger than his actual age is clearly something that he
works at: he sometimes dresses like a teen-ager, dyes his hair dark
brown, wears trendy long sideburns and lies about his age (which
falls somewhere between 48 and 52).
 &HT;    Once notorious for his late-night club crawling, Almodovar
insists that he no longer goes out.
 &HT;    ``In the last two years,'' he says, ``I've isolated myself a
lot. I can't continue to lead the same life I led 20 years ago in
Madrid. Aside from the fact that I would die, I would be very
bored.''
 &HT;    Almodovar says he ``did a lot of cocaine in the 80's,'' and just
four years ago stopped ``experimenting'' with drugs.
 &HT;    ``In my 40's, something changed,'' he says. ``You can't be out
the whole night and pretend to have a clear brain to write
wonderful lines. No wonderful lines at all. It's a pity, because,
at 40-something, I've got the same needs as when I was 20.''
 &HT;    One of the most popular foreign-language directors in America
(all of his films since 1980 have been released here and all have
made a profit), Almodovar is something of a national hero in Spain.
 &HT;    ``People on the street go up and embrace him as if he were a
member of their family,'' says Marisa Paredes, who has starred in
several of his films.
 &HT;    Says Henny Garfunkel, a New York photographer and friend of
Almodovar's, ``He's the Andy Warhol of Spain.''
 &HT;    Like Warhol, and like John Waters, Almodovar is known for
putting hard-to-believe characters, especially women, in his films.
 &HT;    ``All the freaks look up to me,'' he says. ``I remember in Rome,
the most incredible fat girls that you can imagine came to my
hotel. I've become sort of like the Saint of the Freaks.''
 &HT;    Waters recalls being at a film festival with Almodovar in Italy:
``We were constantly fleeing drag queens, running up those little
streets trying to escape. Pedro and I have laughed about that,
because who else are they gonna go to?''
 &HT;    But Almodovar says he has come to hate the attention. ``I feel
more alone all the time,'' he says. ``I've never really had the
vanity to enjoy those sorts of things.''
 &HT;    Worse yet, he has become sick of himself and the very style that
he has created: ``Before making 'The Flower of My Secret,' I felt,
like, saturated to be Almodovar. Many times I hate my name. I
became commonplace. They made me an adjective: This is
Almodovarian. Which is the worst that can happen to you. I'm sure
that Fellini felt very bad about it.''
 &HT;    In ``All about My Mother,'' Antonia San Juan, a transsexual who
plays a transsexual named La Agrado, delivers an anti-drag-queen
manifesto.
 &HT;    ``It cost me a lot to be authentic,'' she says, proud of the
commitment to sex change. ``But we must not be cheap in regard to
the way we look. Because a woman is more authentic the more she
looks like what she has dreamed for herself.''
 &HT;    It's an idea that Almodovar has been exploring for some time,
that the very definition of ``woman'' is up for grabs. The major
conceit of the film is that all women are actors _ that the state
of being female is a state of constant performance. Therefore, men
who pass for women, who engage in the drama and costume of the
feminine, are on the same plane as women.
 &HT;    While Almodovar is widely _ and duly _ admired for his
portrayals of strong female characters, he is not entirely free
from the taint of misogyny.
 &HT;    ``Federico Garcia Lorca said 60 years ago that Spain was a
country of actresses,'' Almodovar says. ``Not a country of actors.
And he was right. Even now. I think there's something about the
Mediterranean male that makes him less interesting than the
Mediterranean female. Particularly coming from a machista culture.
Men there seem to be made of almost one piece, or two at the most.
 &HT;    ``And yet women seem to be made of many more pieces. They have a
greater capacity to surprise. Their suffering is more spectacular
than that of a man. Their reactions are usually more active, more
interesting and better to narrate.
 &HT;    ``And I think 'All About My Mother' deals with that _ with this
great capacity that women have to act or to fake. Which is not
exactly to lie. Because I think to lie is more in the kingdom of
men.''
 &HT;    A decade ago, with the success of ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown'' _ which was in many ways also about women as
actors _ Hollywood beat a path to Almodovar's door; at the time, he
was in no hurry to go to America.
 &HT;    ``When I discover the story I want to tell in English,'' he told
Time magazine then, ``I will do so.''
 &HT;    Now he has finally found his story: ``The Paper Boy,'' based on
the 1992 novel by Pete Dexter. As Almodovar describes his version,
it will be a dark and offbeat boy-comes-of-age story set in the
swamps near Jacksonville, Fla.
 &HT;    Michel Ruben _ Almodovar's associate producer and translator _
told me that Hollywood executives are a bit mystified as to why
Almodovar chose ``The Paper Boy,'' a story that's about as far as
you could possibly get from the demimonde of Madrid.
 &HT;    Says Ruben, ``There's nothing in it that screams 'Almodovar.''
 &HT;    But, of course, that's precisely what Almodovar wants: to get
away from his adjectival self.
 &HT;    ``Madrid is the cradle where I've been raised,'' he says. ``But
I need to make a change _ like the language, like the culture that
I belong to.''
 &HT;    And in the end, Almodovar isn't really coming to America _ he's
coming to Florida. And Florida, with its baroque characters and
exaggerated colors, is, in the end, very Almodovarian.

   COCOA BEACH, Fla. _ It's the little things that drive you nuts.
</P>
<P>
   A massive, killer hurricane is bearing down on our fair
community, the Weather Channel guys are showing grim faces, the
Governor's trying to sound upbeat _ and I'm burning up my fingers
on a three-inch sheet metal screw I unwisely tried to drive through
our stucco wall and into a wooden stud.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this French door doesn't need a sheet of plywood over it
after all.
</P>
<P>
   As much as you plan, as much as you think you know what to do
because you're a journalist and have been covering hurricanes and
their aftermath for years, it's all a different story when the
storm is bearing down on your own home.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuation is a flat-out stress monster. You make a list and
lose it. You grab the insurance papers, put them on the kitchen
counter to toss in with the other items you absolutely have to
take. Then, they get chewed up by the cat and lost under a pile of
canned food.
</P>
<P>
   Michele, my wife, put up the hurricane shutters Monday while I
was frantically trying to get home from an assignment in South
America, but there are still a million little things to do.
</P>
<P>
   You walk around trying to think of that one little thing that if
you leave undone will allow Floyd a tiny fingerhold into the
fortress you're trying to make your home into.
</P>
<P>
   Is the garage door secure? Jeff across the street is bracing his
with two-by-fours from inside, and his doesn't even face the ocean.
Ours faces due east _ about 300 feet away is the Atlantic, and in a
few hours Floyd could be smacking it dead-on with 125 to 150 mph
winds.
</P>
<P>
   After my experience covering Hurricane Andrew, we spent more
than a thousand bucks buying a heavy-duty, hurricane-rated garage
door complete with thick metal braces and extra-heavy hardware.
</P>
<P>
   I was a little embarrassed when we had it installed.
Embarrassed, too, when I sweated for days the first August we moved
in here, putting up the hardware that holds the hurricane shutters
in place. Neighbors stopped by and nodded as I worked. Their
non-committal comments left me thinking I was a paranoid
preparation-junky.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a half-dozen people stopped as Michele bolted the
shutters into place, telling her, ``Man, I wish we had those for
our house.''
</P>
<P>
   But I'm still worried about the garage door. For all its
impressive bulk, sometimes when I'm in the driveway at night I see
a sliver of light coming from the inside near a seam at the top
right corner. Will Floyd get in there, pry open that tiny sliver
and then rip off our roof?
</P>
<P>
   Will we spend the next six months sweating in a tent in the
yard, slapping mosquitoes and kicking ourselves for not adding a
brace here, an extra stud there?
</P>
<P>
   Too late now. Nothing I can do.
</P>
<P>
   But even losing our house pales when we think about loved ones
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Michele's sister is married to a Bahamian. They live on Great
Abaco in a tiny village called Cherokee. All day Monday Michele
gently tried to convince her sister Maria to leave with their three
children.
</P>
<P>
   But Bahamians are tough, maybe even a little stubborn.
Traditionally, they have not been able to flee because they didn't
have the means or early enough warning. Maria and her family are
staying, boarding up their home, which is on a small rise about 300
yards from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to get a little wild,'' she said when she called
about 6:30 a.m. (EDT) Tuesday. ``We just boarded up the door. We'll
try to call you later.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we have no children to worry about, but another of
Michele's sisters who lives nearby in Merritt Island has three
little ones under the age of five. Michele spent all day Monday
trying to figure out the best direction to run. She could've headed
south toward West Palm Beach, where much of her family lives, but
that didn't look too safe. She has a sister in Tallahassee, but
that seemed too far away.
</P>
<P>
   She finally settled on a cut-rate motel in downtown Orlando,
picking it from a list she compiled off the Internet of motels that
allow pets.
</P>
<P>
   Another big evacuation problem: we have two dogs and two cats,
and most evacuation shelters don't allow pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should board them at an approved kennel,'' one hoarse
radio announcer droned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. The only kennels around here are likely to be
underwater, and who could bear the thought of a beloved pet left in
such a place on a night of such terror?
</P>
<P>
   It's the cheap motel. We'll run from there to a shelter if we
have to, and just take the animals and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Michele pulled out at mid-morning (Tuesday). We have been
ordered off this barrier island by 4 p.m. (EDT). I'm finishing up
the last touches on trying to save the house, trying to do a little
reporting, and getting more nervous by the minute as the
neighborhood gets more ghostly and empty.
</P>
<P>
   Michele just called on her cell-phone. She's in bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the Bee-line Expressway, which is normally a
traffic-free breeze of one hour's drive to Orlando. Michele thinks
it may take three hours or more to drive the 60 miles to the motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of the cats just pooped ,'' she said. ``He pooped in
the little carrier I put him in, and I don't have anything to clean
it up with. It really stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, hurricanes and all the fun little things they bring.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd may level our house, but he's going to put us through
plenty of misery before delivering the final coup-de-grace.
</P>
<P>
   And where do they get these names? I hear Floyd and I think of
the smiling avuncular barber on the Andy Griffith Show.
</P>
<P>
   I probably won't think that way after tomorrow.

take. Then, they get chewed up by the cat and lost under a pile of
canned food.
</P>
<P>
   Michele, my wife, put up the hurricane shutters Monday while I
was frantically trying to get home from an assignment in South
America, but there are still a million little things to do.
</P>
<P>
   You walk around trying to think of that one little thing that if
you leave undone will allow Floyd a tiny fingerhold into the
fortress you're trying to make your home into.
</P>
<P>
   Is the garage door secure? Jeff across the street is bracing his
with two-by-fours from inside, and his doesn't even face the ocean.
Ours faces due east _ about 300 feet away is the Atlantic, and in a
few hours Floyd could be smacking it dead-on with 125 to 150 mph
winds.
</P>
<P>
   After my experience covering Hurricane Andrew, we spent more
than a thousand bucks buying a heavy-duty, hurricane-rated garage
door complete with thick metal braces and extra-heavy hardware.
</P>
<P>
   I was a little embarrassed when we had it installed.
Embarrassed, too, when I sweated for days the first August we moved
in here, putting up the hardware that holds the hurricane shutters
in place. Neighbors stopped by and nodded as I worked. Their
non-committal comments left me thinking I was a paranoid
preparation-junky.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a half-dozen people stopped as Michele bolted the
shutters into place, telling her, ``Man, I wish we had those for
our house.''
</P>
<P>
   But I'm still worried about the garage door. For all its
impressive bulk, sometimes when I'm in the driveway at night I see
a sliver of light coming from the inside near a seam at the top
right corner. Will Floyd get in there, pry open that tiny sliver
and then rip off our roof?
</P>
<P>
   Will we spend the next six months sweating in a tent in the
yard, slapping mosquitoes and kicking ourselves for not adding a
brace here, an extra stud there?
</P>
<P>
   Too late now. Nothing I can do.
</P>
<P>
   But even losing our house pales when we think about loved ones
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Michele's sister is married to a Bahamian. They live on Great
Abaco in a tiny village called Cherokee. All day Monday Michele
gently tried to convince her sister Maria to leave with their three
children.
</P>
<P>
   But Bahamians are tough, maybe even a little stubborn.
Traditionally, they have not been able to flee because they didn't
have the means or early enough warning. Maria and her family are
staying, boarding up their home, which is on a small rise about 300
yards from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to get a little wild,'' she said when she called
about 6:30 a.m. (EDT) Tuesday. ``We just boarded up the door. We'll
try to call you later.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we have no children to worry about, but another of
Michele's sisters who lives nearby in Merritt Island has three
little ones under the age of five. Michele spent all day Monday
trying to figure out the best direction to run. She could've headed
south toward West Palm Beach, where much of her family lives, but
that didn't look too safe. She has a sister in Tallahassee, but
that seemed too far away.
</P>
<P>
   She finally settled on a cut-rate motel in downtown Orlando,
picking it from a list she compiled off the Internet of motels that
allow pets.
</P>
<P>
   Another big evacuation problem: we have two dogs and two cats,
and most evacuation shelters don't allow pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should board them at an approved kennel,'' one hoarse
radio announcer droned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. The only kennels around here are likely to be
underwater, and who could bear the thought of a beloved pet left in
such a place on a night of such terror?
</P>
<P>
   It's the cheap motel. We'll run from there to a shelter if we
have to, and just take the animals and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Michele pulled out at mid-morning (Tuesday). We have been
ordered off this barrier island by 4 p.m. (EDT). I'm finishing up
the last touches on trying to save the house, trying to do a little
reporting, and getting more nervous by the minute as the
neighborhood gets more ghostly and empty.
</P>
<P>
   Michele just called on her cell-phone. She's in bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the Bee-line Expressway, which is normally a
traffic-free breeze of one hour's drive to Orlando. Michele thinks
it may take three hours or more to drive the 60 miles to the motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of the cats just pooped ,'' she said. ``He pooped in
the little carrier I put him in, and I don't have anything to clean
it up with. It really stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, hurricanes and all the fun little things they bring.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd may level our house, but he's going to put us through
plenty of misery before delivering the final coup-de-grace.
</P>
<P>
   And where do they get these names? I hear Floyd and I think of
the smiling avuncular barber on the Andy Griffith Show.
</P>
<P>
   I probably won't think that way after tomorrow.

AN OVERTIME LOOK AT A WACKY SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The National Football League got a liftoff like
never before. Four games decided in the final 15 seconds on Opening
Day, another forced into overtime. That's a record, an all-timer
for the league. But let's not confuse it with a crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Buffalo last year? The Bills were 0-3 before the San
Francisco 49ers pulled into town. By the end, they were high on
Doug Flutie's pixie dust and bound for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the New York Jets' opener against the Niners in 1998?
They could have had visions of Garrison Hearst dancing on their
heads for the rest of the season. They went to the AFC title game
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the New Orleans Saints last year? They were undefeated
when the Niners showed up in early October, for Steve Young's 37th
birthday. He left the Superdome feeling like a teen-ager. The
Saints left feeling like a Pop Warner team.
</P>
<P>
   But without measuring long-term implications, or seeking major
historical themes, we can pluck a lot of lessons from Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson threw the best tantrum of his career. Upset
over Vinny Testaverde's season-ending injury in the Jets' loss to
New England, Johnson stormed off the press-conference podium, near
tears. For the author of ``Give Me the Damn Ball,'' this was a
revelation. The young receiver showed how desperately he wants to
win, and that he knows he can't do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   If Rick Mirer, a three-time castoff, flourishes with the Jets in
Testaverde's absence, Johnson and coach Bill Parcells will build
newer, higher pedestals for themselves. And rightly so.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five former Niners coordinators now in charge elsewhere,
three lost and two won. The three losers all have Super Bowl rings
as head coaches _ George Seifert, Mike Holmgren and Mike Shanahan.
The winners, Ray Rhodes and Pete Carroll, have never reached a
conference championship as head coaches. Both work under immense
shadows, Rhodes as Holmgren's replacement in Green Bay, Carroll as
the man who can never escape Parcells' legacy at the New England
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's Pats beat Parcells' Jets on a last-second field goal,
but they almost lost to a team that was using a punter at
quarterback. If Tom Tupa had won that game, Carroll would have been
ripped apart in Boston. As it is, the Pats slew Tupa and the Tuna,
while the Red Sox finished sweeping another nasty bunch of New
Yawkers. That should keep the bloodhounds at bay for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as good as the NFL openers: The five-set,
double-tiebreaker final at the U.S. Open between Andre Agassi and
Todd Martin. The score from that match looked like an international
phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in the waiting room for the Green Bay Packers' relatives at
Lambeau field: A large-screen television tuned to a late game. But
the family members weren't watching their NFC Central rivals, the
Minnesota Vikings, taking on the Atlanta Falcons in a rematch of
the conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   They were checking out the Seattle Seahawks vs. the Detroit
Lions. Was it because the Packers play the Lions next week, or
because Holmgren, Green Bay's coaching expatriate, was taking a
beating from a Lions team without Barry Sanders?
</P>
<P>
   Who are these guys? Bill Schroeder, Corey Bradford, Jeff
Thomason? They caught Brett Favre's last three passes in the
comeback win over the Raiders. Schroeder and Bradford each played
only one year of college football. They are converted track stars.
Thomason is a third-string tight end who had caught a total of 28
NFL passes in six seasons before Sunday. In other words, they are
the football equivalent of the San Antonio Spurs' backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks on the horizon: McNair, McNown and McNabb. Or, on a
first-name basis, the all-Harlequin Romance QB squad: Donovan,
Cade, Peyton, Duante, Kerry, Ryan, Brett, Trent and Trent. If you
like this trend, root for Heath Shuler to make it someday. If you
don't, pull for Gus (Frerotte) and Charlie (Batch).
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin's end-zone pose should have put him in traction.
Richie Cunningham's PAT at the end of regulation could have put
half of Texas in traction. It hit the left upright as it went
through for the tie and a victorious trip into overtime for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre and Jake Plummer both had bum thumbs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They both led their teams to stunning comebacks. Next, they'll
try a patch over one eye and itching powder in their helmets.
They're just evening things out for Kurt Warner and Shane Matthews.

PIZZA WITH A `PUSH BUTTON' CRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: This is the first of eight columns by Amy Scherber, the
owner of Amy's Bread in Manhattan. These columns are being written

(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As much as I like pizza, I have never been able to
serve it at my two bakeries. We just don't have enough space, time
or people to get the pizza out for lunch, and pizza doesn't keep.
</P>
<P>
   But I bake pizza for our monthly staff birthday parties and
often make it at home, where I get professional results in an
ordinary oven.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is straightforward, just like the others I'll be
sharing over the next eight weeks, some from the bakeries, others
from my home files. They use no difficult techniques, but there are
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   With this pizza, the tricks are in stretching the dough and
intensifying the flavor of the tomatoes. Otherwise, the recipe does
not call for anything esoteric. You can get everything needed, from
the equipment to the ingredients, in a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   This pizza, topped with garlic, basil, ricotta and the last of
the season's corn and tomatoes, is made in a jellyroll pan and can
be turned out by a first-timer. And it delivers what I think every
good pizza must: a thin, crisp-bottomed crust that's tender to the
tooth but strong enough to support its topping; a topping full of
flavor, but not too heavy or too thick, too juicy or too dry, and a
mix of ingredients that keep their tastes and textures under fire.
</P>
<P>
   The crust, made from what I call a push-button dough, takes 60
seconds to make in a food processor, and 60 minutes to rise.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as easy to shape. There's no tossing in the air or
rolling it out. It's just pressed into the pan.
</P>
<P>
   To get a perfect crust, dip your fingertips in olive oil, and
then press, prod, push and poke the dough along the bottom of the
pan.
</P>
<P>
   If the dough gets springy, as yeast doughs will, you just let it
alone for a few minutes, then press on. Patience is the key here _
the thinner the crust, the crispier.
</P>
<P>
   While the crust is rising, I roast tomatoes for the topping to
concentrate their flavor, a small step that makes a big difference.
All kinds of tomatoes, from cherry to plum to beefsteak or
heirloom, work here.
</P>
<P>
   Just roast them until they are slightly softened, a little
wrinkly, a bit less juicy and very flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   As for the corn, after you slice the kernels off the cob, run
the back of the knife against the cob to press out the sweet milk.
You won't get much, just enough to coat the kernels, but it will
bring additional sweetness to the topping and keep the corn from
drying out in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   With the key components prepared, construction goes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Strew the crust with garlic and basil, season it with salt and
pepper, lay down a layer of tomatoes and corn, then spoon on some
ricotta. A drizzle of good olive oil and it's oven-ready.
</P>
<P>
   When tomatoes and corn are gone for the year, I keep the crust
but change the topping to black olives and roasted red peppers or
sauteed scallions and diced potatoes, or just broccoli, Parmesan
and ricotta.
</P>
<P>
   LATE-SUMMER PIZZA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour rising time
</P>
<P>
   Extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   } cup plus 1 tablespoon warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons coarse cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1\ pounds large tomatoes or cherry tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 ears bicolor or white sweet corn, husked
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   15 large basil leaves, cut into thin strands
</P>
<P>
   } cup ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   Pitted imported olives, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Lightly coat a mixing bowl with olive oil, and set aside. In
bowl of a food processor, combine water, 2 teaspoons olive oil and
yeast. Process to combine. Add flour, 2 tablespoons cornmeal and 2{
teaspoons salt. Process until dough forms a ball, about 10 seconds.
Process 5 seconds more, then transfer dough to a lightly floured
counter. Knead for 30 seconds, and shape into a ball. Place dough
in oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. While dough is rising, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Core
large tomatoes, and slice them \ inch thick, or cut cherry tomatoes
in half. Arrange on a 12-by-17-inch nonstick or parchment-lined
jellyroll pan. Season well with salt and pepper. Roast tomatoes
until slightly softened, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer pan to a
cooling rack, and increase oven temperature to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using a sharp knife and working over a large bowl, cut
kernels off corn cobs. With back of knife, scrape milk from cobs
into bowl. Season with salt to taste.
</P>
<P>
   4. Brush a 12-by-17-inch nonstick or parchment-lined jellyroll
pan with a little olive oil, and dust with remaining 3 tablespoons
cornmeal. Lift dough from bowl, stretch it slightly and place it in
center of pan. Dip your fingers in olive oil, and begin to press
dough out from middle of pan to edges. f dough springs back, let it
rest for 5 minutes. Continue to pat it out until dough is thin and
covers entire surface of pan. Cover with oiled plastic wrap, oiled
side down, and allow to rest for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sprinkle garlic and basil evenly over dough. Top with roasted
tomatoes, and scatter with corn kernels. Drop teaspoons of ricotta
about two inches apart in rows over the pizza. Drizzle with a
little olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Top with pitted
olives, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bake until crust is golden and top is bubbling, 20 to 30
minutes. Cool for 3 minutes, then cut into squares.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings (8 servings as a snack).

VIETNAMESE-STYLE PORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was sitting in a Vietnamese restaurant a couple of years ago,
when a beguiling aroma wafted by. The source was a plate of pork
chops, which I immediately ordered. Some of the smells and flavors
were fairly easy to identify: garlic, lots of it, and lime and nuoc
mam, the Vietnamese fish sauce known more commonly by its Thai
name, nam pla.
</P>
<P>
   But it tasted more complex and challenging than that, and I was
determined to decipher it and then translate it into an easy dish
at home. The pork had a burned sweetness that seemed like
caramelized sugar. It also had another kind of mild acidity in
addition to the lime and an uncommon heat, not fiery but familiar
and piercing.
</P>
<P>
   Only after visiting Vietnam a few months later did I learn that
caramelized sugar is a fairly common ingredient in the cooking,
that the milder acidity was from the lemongrass used there as often
as garlic and that black pepper was added in quantities most
Americans would consider huge.
</P>
<P>
   Once the puzzle was solved, recreating the dish was not
difficult: I caramelized sugar with lime, added the other
ingredients, marinated the pork and then grilled it.
</P>
<P>
   Making caramel, however, would prevent this from being a simple
preparation, so I substituted honey. This might come at the cost of
complexity, because caramel is bitter as well as sweet, but the
intense heat of the grill caramelizes the honey to create that
effect. And that shortcut means the marinade can be assembled in 10
minutes. With the grill preheated in another 10 and the pork
grilled in 10 more, this is a great, intensely flavored, 30-minute
dish.
</P>
<P>
   You can use pork chops, but country-style ribs _ actually the
shoulder end of the pork loin _ remain moister during grilling. And
if you can find these so-called ribs with the bone out, so much the
better; you'll essentially have a one-inch-thick pork loin steak
that grills beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   As for lemongrass, this is the time of year to cook with it.
Peel it like a scallion, and virtually the entire inner core will
be tender enough to mince. (In the winter, when the stalks have
been in storage, you have to peel off layer after layer to find the
edible center.) Figure a yield of about a tablespoon of minced
lemongrass a stalk.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAMESE-STYLE PORK
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced lemongrass
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon nam pla, or to taste, or soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds boneless pork chops or country-style ribs
</P>
<P>
   1 lime, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Chopped Thai basil or cilantro for garnish (optional). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Whisk lemongrass, garlic, honey and nam pla in large bowl.
Add lime juice and pepper. Place pork in the bowl, turning to coat;
let stand while you preheat grill or broiler.
</P>
<P>
   2. Grill or broil pork, spooning marinade over as it cooks,
until nicely done, about 10 minutes. Turn only once so that each
side browns nicely. Serve with remaining lime and, if you like, the
herb garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

A GOLDEN AGE FOR WHOM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did I miss something? Weren't we all supposed to be drinking
better wine than we did a decade or so ago? That is what the
American wine industry promised us after thousands of acres of
vines were replanted in the late 1980s and early '90s, after having
been devastated by phylloxera, a microscopic bug that eats vine
roots. The new vines would be stronger, the wine better, and wine
lovers of all income groups would benefit, winemakers said.
</P>
<P>
   They were right, up to a point. Top-of-the-line wines from
recent vintages have been astonishingly good, and are commanding
astonishing prices _ $100 a bottle for some California cabernet
sauvignons.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone with money to burn can buy a big-ticket wine. It
takes knowledge and a good palate to find good wines that are also
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the challenge for wine lovers whose pockets don't
run deep. Perhaps I'm being impatient, and the predicted golden age
of good wine for everyone is just around the corner. But in my
experience American wines in the moderate price range, which I
define as under $20, have not only failed to improve since the
replanting, but have actually declined in quality.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true of wines bearing the California
appellation, which means that the grapes can come from anywhere in
the state. The Central Valley is great for growing lettuce, but not
necessarily for grapes. The demand for top-quality grapes is so
high that their prices have reached unparalleled levels.
Consequently, winemakers appear to be relying on lesser quality
fruit for their lower-priced wines.
</P>
<P>
   So, should a cabernet lover who does do not want to pay $100 for
one bottle give up? No. After all, fad wines come and go but
cabernet sauvignon is the benchmark by which quality wine is
judged. Here are a few American cabernets at about $20 or less that
display the character and finesse that once were commonplace in
this price range but are now the exception.
</P>
<P>
   If any producer is committed to offering quality wines at truly
reasonable prices, it is the E.&AMP; J. Gallo Winery, through its
immense holdings in Sonoma County. While I sometimes get the sense
that Gallo's wines are designed by a committee, there is no denying
the fact that this company makes good wines. Its 1994 Sonoma
Cabernet from the Barelli Creek Vineyard is a good example. For an
introduction to the Gallo style, try the 1995 Sonoma Cabernet
Sauvignon at around $9.
</P>
<P>
   The Benziger family, who practically invented the ``fighting
varietal'' category a decade ago with their Glen Ellen line, have
in recent years concentrated _ successfully _ on higher quality
wines. To experience what they have accomplished, try their 1996
cabernet, a luscious full wine, at about $16.
</P>
<P>
   Beringer Estates is one of the most respected names in
California wine. The top Beringer cabernets are in the $70 to $100
a bottle category, but the winery has never neglected the lower end
of the market. Beringer's Founder's line offers some remarkable
buys, one of which is a 1997 cabernet at under $10.
</P>
<P>
   Beringer is also parent to the much-praised Napa Ridge line of
wines. Feathers have been ruffled over the use of ``Napa'' for
wines that do not hail from there, but set controversy aside for
the moment and try the Napa Ridge 1996 cabernet at about $10. It is
quite an achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Carmenet, a winery in the Chalone Group, has always specialized
in cabernet sauvignon. Its 1997 Dynamite cabernet is a
medium-bodied Sonoma wine with lots of flavor and a nice finish. It
is $15.
</P>
<P>
   Some wineries have always given great value for money. Two among
them are Estancia, a division of Franciscan Vineyards whose
excellent 1996 cabernet is a bargain at $14, and Fetzer Vineyards,
from Mendocino, whose Barrel Select cabernet has been consistently
good for many years. It sells for about $15.

   Two Napa Valley landmarks famous for their more expensive wines,
Niebaum-Coppola and Newton, both offer delicious cabernet blends
called clarets. The 1997 from Newton is about $18, the 1996 from
Niebaum-Coppola about $15.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the older Italian family wineries that combine the most
modern techniques with a touch of rusticity in their cabernets are
Foppiano Vineyards, whose 1995 Russian River Valley cabernet is
about $13, and Pedroncelli Three Vineyards, whose 1997 cabernet
from the Dry Creek Valley is about $16.
</P>
<P>
   I still find drinkers of California wines who are reluctant to
familiarize themselves with Washington State wines. What a mistake.
The best Washington cabernets have a focus, an intensity, a
leanness that their more fleshy California cousins rarely display.
And there are some terrific Washington cabernets at good prices.
Try the 1996 Columbia Crest at about $10, or the Hogue Cellars
Barrel Select at about $13. Food brings out their best qualities
and they return the favor by enhancing the meal.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the East Coast. There is an intriguing
cabernet from Lenz Vineyards on the North Fork of Long Island.
Lenz's Vineyard Selection, at $16, compares most favorably, and
more accurately, with a good wine from St.-Emilion than anything
from California.
</P>
<P>
   An intrepid wine lover could find other good, reasonably priced
cabernets. And if the wine industry ever fulfills its promise,
perhaps we can look forward to even more.  &QL;

   Champagne Montaudon Brut, nonvintage, Rheims, France. About $30.
</P>
<P>
   You are going to be seeing some unfamiliar Champagne labels over
the next few months. In anticipation of millennium-driven demand,
some Champagne makers have widened their distribution in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Champagne Montaudon, a house that's been around
since 1891, first in Epernay, now in Rheims. If the other newcomers
here are as good as this one, we can all relax and go back to
worrying about the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   This is a medium-bodied wine, half pinot noir and half
chardonnay, with plenty of flavor, good acidity and the
unmistakable nutlike aroma of a classy Champagne. There is a
vintage version (1995), and also a blanc de blanc and a rose.

   There is a single problem inherent in smoking food: the smoke.
As much as one may like imbuing salmon or sausages with a deep
wood-smoke aroma, the amount of smoke created to achieve that
effect is enormous. Smoking outdoors is not generally a problem _
both you and the food will have a smoke aroma, the rest will
dissipate. But if you have a stove-top smoker, you can expect your
house to smell of smoke for a good week after using it.
</P>
<P>
   A solution is upon us. Hope Smoke, a company in Finland, has
developed a smoker bag for smoking food in the oven. The product,
called Savu (pronounced SAH-voo) _ which means ``smoke'' in Finnish
_ is a clever invention. You take fish fillets, chicken or steaks,
and lay them in a shallow baking dish. Slide the dish into the
aluminum smoker bag, fold the bag to seal, place it on a baking
sheet, and put it in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   When the food is done cooking, you let the package rest on a
counter for about 10 minutes, and then pierce the bag and peel it
back. The food is nicely smoked, as your nose will tell you _ you
do not see any smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Even a good inspection of the slim, 11-by-20-inch bag fails to
reveal the mysterious smoking process; there are no wood chips
rattling around inside it. The design is actually quite simple. A
mixture of powdered alder wood, beet sugar and wood resin is sealed
within the bag, out of contact with the food. As it bakes, the
alder, which is indigenous to Finland, quickly burns and fills the
sealed bag with a mild-flavored smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The packages, which come in light, medium and strong smoke
strengths, are sturdy and easy to use but are not without flaw. I
found the cooking times provided in the instruction pamphlet far
too long. The cooking chart instructs you to cook a pound of chops
for 40 minutes at 475 degrees using a strong bag. Suspicious, I
baked a pound of pork chops for 35 minutes. They were overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   For fish fillets, the pamphlet suggests 50 minutes. The salmon
fillet I had bought was thin, so I baked it for just 20 minutes.
Again, it was overcooked and dry. I had also used a strong smoke
bag; next time, with salmon, I would use a weaker-strength bag.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company's Web site suggests using a medium bag for
fish; a strong bag for meats like lamb, beef and pork, and a light
bag for chicken or vegetables. But it also says that if you want a
stronger smoke flavor for fish, to use a strong bag. It's an
inexact science.
</P>
<P>
   But these matters are worth tinkering with. The flavor you get
is that of real wood chips, not chemicals. And it beats messing
with a stove-top smoker that is big, clunky and, well, smokey.
</P>
<P>
   Savu Original Food Smoker Bags are on the Web for $2.99 plus
shipping, at www.cystern.com/smokehouse.

ISRAEL LURES MANY WHO WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE PLACE `WHERE IT ALL
BEGAN' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Nothing quite prepares first-time visitors for this
bustling country of contrasts and its ancient yet modern capital
city.
</P>
<P>
   From the bright beaches of Tel Aviv to the dismal poverty of
Palestinian communities on the West Bank, the Holy Land beguiles
and perplexes, defying definition.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all Israeli citizens are either immigrants or descended
from them. With them came bits of Poland, France, Russia, Italy,
Romania and other nations. Many cultures and customs wove into the
Middle Eastern world of late-1940s Palestine, as the region was
known before Israel became a nation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Today, native-born Israelis are called ``sabra.'' They live in a
country still troubled by political and religious tensions. But
despite violent stumbles in the process toward lasting peace,
Israel is progressing. Visitors are in some ways safer in Israel
than in the United States, Israelis insist. People stroll streets
at night. Government security at airports and roadside checkpoints
is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Travel to Israel right now promises a wealth of memories _ and
perhaps a number of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel a tug toward this ancient land as the new millennium
dawns. Some come as pilgrims, remembering the words of the prophet
Isaiah: ``O, Jerusalem, the holy city.'' Nobel Peace Prize winner
Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, calls Jerusalem ``the city which
miraculously transforms man into pilgrim; no one can enter it and
remain unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Others come thousands of miles for less lofty reasons. Perhaps
they realize Jerusalem was a zenith for the ancient world; it
remains a touchstone for the modern one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically this is where it all began,'' said Pini Shani, new
head of the Israeli Ministry of Tourism's southern U.S. office in
Dallas. ``Going to Israel is kind of a circle, going back to the
beginning. I believe it would be more unusual than having a
(millennium) party anywhere else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Many tour groups will visit late this year and early in 2000. An
estimated 4 million to 6 million visitors, double the usual number,
are expected. About 1.5 million will be pilgrims. Church groups,
especially evangelical congregations, want to visit the land where
they believe Jesus Christ lived, died and rose from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they believe Jesus wasn't actually born 2,000 years ago
(scholars say the dating is off by several years), many Christian
pilgrims view 2000 as the year to visit the land of their savior's
birth. The date holds no special significance for Jews or Muslims,
but Jerusalem and Israel are sacred to each of the world's three
great monotheistic faiths and significant to other religions as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's capital, situated in the Judean hills, has been a
national center for the Jewish people since their charismatic
poet-warrior, King David, ordained the city his kingdom's capital
3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was from here that Muslims believe Muhammad ascended to
heaven. Herod ruled here, at the behest of Rome, during the time of
the birth of Jesus. Here Christian Crusaders fought to recover
control of a city they held holy, massacring Jerusalem's entire
Jewish population in 1099.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic forces recaptured the city in 1187, after 88 years of
Crusader rule. About 400 years later, the Ottoman Turks conquered
Jerusalem. The city went to the British at the close of World War
I. Thirty years of British rule ended with the establishment of
Israel, though the bloodshed has continued between Jews and Arabs.
Just this month, Israel seemed closer to peacefully settling its
long-standing differences with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing months of this century, Israel is doing all it
can to promote itself as a travel destination.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the holy city of David, of Jesus and of Sultan
Saladin can add a guest spot at the Magic Kingdom to its rapidly
growing list of international credits.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sept. 30, Israel will be showcased at the new Disney
Millennium Village at Epcot in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts at the Israel Pavilion will include a King David character
charged with greeting visitors before they tread a path made from
Jerusalem stone through the village. There will be a replica of the
Tower of David in Jerusalem, even an electronic Western Wall. (Both
the tower and the wall are landmarks in Jerusalem.)
</P>
<P>
   During the Disney Millennium Village's 15 months of life, 33
Israelis will run the pavilion. Its existence is yet another
example of Israel's determination to put its best foot forward
during a pivotal period for building international goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been preparing for an increase in visitors for
several years, though government officials and tourism insiders,
from guides to hotel executives, differ on how crowded a country
tourists should expect.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it has spent $90 million to restore the
country's infrastructure. Last spring, parking lots, hotels,
bridges, even centuries-old biblical sites were under construction
or renovation. Israel spent $5 million on a U.S. advertising
campaign that used direct mail and ads in local newspapers to
attract Christians to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first year of the millennium draws to a close,
millions are expected to respond, determined to ``walk where Jesus
walked.''
</P>
<P>
   There is Bethlehem, the city of Jesus' birth, with the Church of
the Nativity, the oldest church in the country. For the millennium,
the Bethlehem 2000 project _ largely a Palestinian Christian
enterprise _ is working to restore related sites and to improve
services for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   There is Nazareth, where Jesus grew up. Visitors should make
their way to Casa Nova Street and the Basilica of the Annunciation,
built on the spot where Christian tradition holds that the Angel
Gabriel appeared to tell Mary she would bear the Christ child.
</P>
<P>
   The present church, completed in 1966, was built over earlier
ones. Its modern design includes murals in the nave created by
artists from around the world. The more archaeologically oriented
should take the time to visit Nazareth Village, a restoration of a
village believed to be much like the one where Jesus grew up. The
interdenominational project is occurring on a grassy knoll in the
shadow of Nazareth Hospital, with financing coming from the Miracle
of Nazareth Foundation, which has a number of American donors.
</P>
<P>
   Because Israel is small (about the size of New Jersey),
travelers can see many of the country's landmarks during a 10-day
journey. Christian pilgrims should make time for Galilee, Jericho
and Caesarea, among other significant biblical sites. Travelers
also likely will want to spend time in Tel Aviv and make stops at
the Dead Sea and in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Jerusalem, which is really two cities _ the walled
city that dates back 3,000 years and the modern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Because of crowds and reconstruction, the experience of
Jerusalem comes with a little dust, a lot of noise and a feeling
that the traveler is part of history in the making.
</P>
<P>
   For it is impossible to visit Israel without thinking about its
past. And, especially in Jerusalem, that means understanding that
the ancient and modern live side by side.
</P>
<P>
   On one corner you may find a traditionally dressed Bedouin
sitting and waiting patiently for a tourist to cough up a few
dollars for a camel ride. In the next block, you may have to step
aside for an Israeli on a cell phone (something of a national
obsession) striding rapidly on his way to work.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of the Old City are a mesmerizing blend. No visit is
complete without seeing its markets and Jewish Quarter, the Western
Wall, the Temple Mount and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Walk
the Via Dolorosa, the journey Jesus took on the way to his death.
To understand modern Israel, be certain to visit the Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial and the Children's Holocaust Memorial. Arts
events _ from museums to music, theater and dance _ are popular as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will find an alluring blend of clothing, handmade
silver serving pieces and jewelry, pottery and an assortment of
souvenirs. Evenings call for a stroll down Ben-Yehuda Street to
watch and be watched. Pause for a cup of strong coffee or a glass
of cool juice or a drink at an outdoor cafe.
</P>
<P>
   At the millennium, there are tours led by Catholic priests,
tours led by politicians, tours planned by local and regional
church groups. Many pilgrims made their plans months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But one Catholic tour guide based in Jerusalem is so worried
about water shortages and crowds at the city's holiest shrines _
such as the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, traditionally considered
the site of Jesus Christ's burial _ that he urges people to stay
home. Savvy Israeli hoteliers say that's ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is a great location for a vacation,'' said Leanne
Ziderman, room-division manager for the Laromme Hotel in central
Jerusalem. ``The great weather, interesting sights and hotel
accommodations are suitable for families and singles.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicted an increase of 10 percent to 15 percent in
room-occupancy rates during millennium celebrations. While many
hotels expect to be fully booked in December and January, rooms are
available at other times, she said.

A DAY WITH A MAKER OF FAMOUS DILL PICKLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By DULCIE LEIMBACH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilfred Kean is famous for his dill pickles, but on one
particular day last fall, he couldn't make them by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Wilfred, 85, is my neighbor at our weekend place in Equinunk,
Pa., a fleck of a town overlooking the Delaware River in the
northeastern corner of the state. He had called me over, so I
followed him into his comfortable kitchen, with its flowered
linoleum floor, sparkling white stove and porcelain sink, all of
which his wife, Grace, keeps immaculate.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is also mindful of her pantry, stocking it with so many
sugary items that my 5-year-old daughter always manages a visit,
even though Wilfred's gravelly voice and teasing manner scare the
daylights out of her.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Wilfred stood stooped at the sink, his arthritic
hands as gnarled as ginger root, his body not cooperating, leaving
him unable to stand for too long. ``Hold them like this, Delsey,''
he instructed, mispronouncing my name, as usual, as he showed me
how to scrub the small black warts off one of his Kirby cucumbers,
of which, I noticed, there were a bucketful.
</P>
<P>
   Inwardly I sighed, aware that the many tasks on my own to-do
list were about to be slighted in this venture. Still, I was drawn
to the job. I had rinsed many cucumbers, but never scrubbed. I was
curious, too, about the makings of these pickles.
</P>
<P>
   He handed me a small plastic brush, and I picked up the first
cucumber and whisked away, removing every black knob. Then I looked
down at the bucket and realized I had to pace myself better if I
were to last at the sink, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wilfred sat down at the kitchen table and mumbled
through a monologue about how no one helped him pick the cucumbers
in his garden but how everyone wanted his pickles, about the bald
eagles he'd seen nesting on the Delaware last winter and about the
virtues of sweet pickles, which he makes occasionally. ``Can't
write the recipe down, a recipe ain't worth the woof,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although I was swamped with cukes, Wilfred's dill pickles were
worth it: crunchy on the outside, firm on the inside and snappy
with garlic, they lived far beyond the pale of any other pickles I
had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   With the cucumbers washed and Wilfred pleased with my efforts,
we prepared the brine: water, cider vinegar, sugar and canning
salt, all boiled in a big pot. I looked at the recipe written in
Grace's girlish cursive on note paper, thinking I would be able to
recall it by memory when I got back to the city, but it drifted out
of my head, just as my grandmother's recipe for lemon cake with
lemon icing had died with her 25 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The brine heating up, we started to pack two gallon-size jars.
At the bottom Wilfred dropped a handful of dill, and then threw in
a bunch of chopped white onions as I sliced a garlic pod on top.
Next came the cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with the smallest ones,'' Wilfred said. ``Then put the
ones that look pregnant in the next layer. You can slice the ones
that are too big, just put them face down. Put the curve side
against the jar. Don't leave any gaps. Fill the middle with the
tiny ones. There you go.''
</P>
<P>
   The jar was now two-thirds full _ time to insert more dill,
onions and garlic. It was hard for Wilfred to stick his hand in the
jar, so I put the dill in for him, though he managed the onions,
dropping some on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As time ticked away, I fleetingly wondered what was happening
across the lawn in my own house. It had been ages since I had
lingered in any kitchen, and though this had felt self-indulgent at
first, it now felt totally right.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't I old enough to dawdle? How long did I have to wait? My
80s? The last time I had spent so many hours in a kitchen was
probably in the summer of 1963, when as a young girl I stayed with
my grandmother in her bungalow in New Jersey. Day after day, I'd
watch her as she stirred her cake batters, popped the pans in the
oven and sat down to a good, hot cup of tea despite an indoor
temperature of 90.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get any more cucumbers in here,'' I complained to
Wilfred, slightly annoyed that he expected me to find space where
there was none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come on, there's plenty of room,'' he grumbled, as I
searched for possible victims. ``Pack them in. You don't want a jar
of floating cucumbers, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   The brine had been boiling a few minutes. I asked Wilfred again
how he made sweet pickles. ``By guess and by God,'' he said, waving
his hand but elaborating. ``You use four times as much sugar than
in dill pickles. You got to go with your taste. The brine must be
sweet but still quite sour.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Who gave you these recipes?'' I prodded some more. I knew
Wilfred had grown up on a farm, had even worked his own a few years
before he switched to construction and ended up on a state road
crew. ``Delsey, you know these recipes are from a hundred years
ago.'' Wilfred chastised, putting an end to my query.
</P>
<P>
   We put the packed jars in a plastic basin and ladled the hot
brine in, sure to fill every cranny. We then threw in a teaspoon of
mustard seed _ to keep the pickles fresh longer _ and let the
pickles set before topping them off with more brine. The pickles
would need to stay refrigerated over the months it took to eat
them.
</P>
<P>
   The last steps _ leaving the jars out until they cooled down
before refrigerating them _ I left to Wilfred. The afternoon had
nearly vanished, and I could see my husband approaching Wilfred's
house, a weary look in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   We made the pickles with Wilfred again this year. Grace helped
this time, and my husband prepared the brine. ``He was afraid you
wouldn't do it right,'' Wilfred joked, trying to catch me off
guard. As we took a noontime break, my daughter and I sat with
Wilfred under his carport, as he hand-fed a chipmunk.
</P>
<P>
   He told a story about the white swans that swam in the Delaware
within view of our houses, how a mother had laid her tail down flat
and her babies walked right up it onto her back and they all
floated away. Incredible, I mused, much like a day producing
pickles.
</P>
<P>
   DILL PICKLES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Wilfred Kean &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus 24 hours' marinating and refrigerating
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup noniodized salt or canning salt
</P>
<P>
   { cup (packed) fresh dill
</P>
<P>
   3 white onions, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3{ to 4 pounds small Kirby cucumbers, well scrubbed (to fill
1-gallon jar)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon mustard or celery seed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Sterilize 1-gallon glass jar and lid by immersing in boiling
water for 10 minutes. Remove from water, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In large enameled, glass or other nonreactive saucepan,
combine 6 cups water, the cider vinegar, sugar and salt. Bring to
boil, reduce heat to low, and then simmer mixture while proceeding
with recipe.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place a third of the dill in bottom of jar. Top with a third
each of the onion and garlic. Starting with smallest cucumbers,
pack 1 layer horizontally over garlic. Place another layer
crosswise over the first. Continue in this fashion until jar is
two-thirds full, packing jar tightly and filling in gaps with
cucumbers halved lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add another third of the dill in a layer over the cucumbers,
followed by another third each of the onion and garlic. Top with
cucumbers, again packing them tightly. Top with remaining dill,
onion and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place jar in large plastic basin, and carefully pour hot
vinegar mixture (brine) into jar to fill it completely. Using long
wooden skewer, gently nudge the pickles deep in the jar to dislodge
any air bubbles. Add more brine, if necessary, and allow mixture to
sit for 5 minutes. Add more brine to fill jar to brim, and top with
mustard seed. If using glass lid, place lid directly on jar. If
using metal lid, to prevent corrosion place large piece of wax
paper over top of jar before fastening lid.
</P>
<P>
   6. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature. Remove jar from
basin, and wipe clean with damp sponge. Refrigerate jar for at
least 24 hours before eating. The pickles may be stored,
refrigerated, for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 20 to 25 pickles.

CONNECTICUT MAN `TOO SMART' FOR POLICE WORK ASKED TO APPLY IN SAN
FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A man who was judged too intelligent to be an
officer for the police in New London, Conn., has been invited to
apply for a job in San Francisco, where Police Chief Fred Lau said
smart applicants should be welcomed, not discouraged from joining
the force.
</P>
<P>
   Lau extended the invitation Monday to Robert Jordan, 48, after a
U.S. District Court recently ruled that New London officials were
justified in rejecting Jordan based on the results of an
intelligence screening test. He scored a 33 out of 50 points, well
above the 20 to 27-point range that is recommended for potential
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this story is true of rejecting someone for their
intelligence, that just baffles me,'' Lau said. ``We should be
encouraging anyone that is intelligent, enthusiastic or caring to
submit an application with the San Francisco Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau said turning down police applicants because they may be too
smart only perpetuates an image of dim-witted, keystone cops in an
era when police work is increasingly more complex and demanding. He
said the Police Department, which numbers more than 2,000 sworn
officers, includes at least 10 officers with law degrees and a
handful of others with doctorates.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are expected to be better versed in the
intricacies of the law and are called upon to work closely with
residents to solve problems, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to need people who could physically break up a
fight,'' he said. ``Now, we need people who can talk you out of a
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau said he is not guaranteeing a job to Jordan or anyone else
who applies with similar qualifications. But Lau said the
department, which is poised to hire another 200 officers in the
coming months, could do well with people like Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a former insurance salesman who lives in Waterford,
Conn., applied for the job on the New London police force three
years ago. As part of the process, he took a 12-minute test
produced by Wonderlic Inc., an Illinois- based testing company.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderlic has been publishing screening tests for 62 years and
has helped close to 50,000 companies screen more than 120 million
applicants. Several months after taking the test, Jordan found out
that his scores were deemed too high and in 1997 he sued the
department.
</P>
<P>
   New London Police Chief Bruce Rinehart said that applicants who
score above the average may later become bored with the job or
frustrated by their inability to quickly advance in the department.

 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a gardener's joke from the 1950s about Russian
geneticists trying to develop a cross between cabbages and turnips
to double their harvest. They ended with a new vegetable that had
the roots of a cabbage and the top of a turnip.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, as any East European could have told you then, the
perfect double-crop vegetable already existed: kohlrabi.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlrabi is, in fact, a tuber related to both cabbage and
turnips, all three being members of the Brassica family. The dual
character of the vegetable is reflected even further in the fact
that crunchy, sweet, tangy kohlrabi is the same vegetable as the
woody, stringy, bitter variety that so often turns people off
kohlrabi. The difference lies in the freshness of the bulb.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to assure freshness is to harvest the sputniklike
bulbs young, and just before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But you can avoid disappointment even with store-bought kohlrabi
simply by choosing small to medium bulbs, less than 2.5 inches in
diameter, that have no soft spots or signs of cracking and no
yellowing of the leaves, even at the tips. The bulbs can be green
or purple but will taste much the same: nothing like cabbage or
turnip.
</P>
<P>
   One reason kohlrabi has not developed the following it deserves
in this country is that the bulbs are too often overcooked and
served with a lumpy cream sauce. Properly cooked, kohlrabi makes a
truly tasty side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Sauteed kohlrabi, for instance, using the root grated and teamed
with butter, garlic, parsley and lemon juice, makes for a quick,
flavorful skillet dish. Another great way to serve it is baked,
with thinly sliced roots interlayered between the leaves and topped
with a cheese mixture of fontina and something sharper like asiago.
</P>
<P>
   But when it is raw, served as a slaw or other salad, this sweet,
radish-flavor vegetable really shines. Even our son, Revell, who
would ordinarily prefer never to have his fork touch a salad,
actually enjoys this one, liberally doused with a honey-ginger
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves, which are reminiscent of collard greens and kale in
flavor, are excellent prepared any way that spinach is prepared.
Torn off the stems and tossed in at the last minute, they are also
a fine addition to soups.
</P>
<P>
   In the garden, kohlrabi that is both ornamental and edible is an
easy-to-grow, low-maintenance crop. Get seeds of both the green and
the violet kind for visual variety; they produce a checkerboard of
color.
</P>
<P>
   The soil for kohlrabi needs to be a rich one, into which you've
worked manure, compost or other organic matter. Sow the seeds
directly into the soil about half an inch deep. Don't let them dry
out, and they will germinate in 10 days or so. The plants need to
be thinned to four inches apart as they grow, and they thrive
surrounded by mulch in cool, moist soil. Hence, the traditional two
crops, spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've grown kohlrabi, you'll do so every year. Just be
sure to rotate the area used on a three-year cycle. Harvest when
you see that the tubers, which grow just above ground, are 2 to 2.5
inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   And if you need further encouragement to grow this vegetable,
this year's dry summer has provided it. The commercially available
crop now in stores suffered from the season, while most home
growers who had the chance to water their plants are heaping their
plates high. &QL;

<P>
   KOHLRABI SALAD WITH HONEY GINGER DRESSING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 kohlrabi bulbs (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 medium to large carrot
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the dressing, whisk honey and mustard together until
well blended. Add vinegar, and stir until smooth. Gently stir in
the grated ginger. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Trim and peel the kohlrabi bulbs, making sure to remove
enough of the skin to take off the woody layer just beneath it as
well. Quarter the bulbs from root to top. Slice the quarters
thinly, and divide among four plates.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shred carrot, and place a mound on top of the kohlrabi on
each plate.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sprinkle the chopped cilantro over each carrot mound, and
drizzle with the dressing just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can use a food processor to prepare both the kohlrabi
and the carrot, but a sharp knife or a mandoline for the kohlrabi
and an old-fashioned box grater for the carrot work just as fast.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I first came to New York, at 17, I pestered the
school friend I was visiting until he took me to Lindy's for corned
beef and cheesecake. I figured that that was the closest an Ohio
kid was likely to get to the fragrant, seductively shady world of
Damon Runyon and Walter Winchell _ ``boxers, bookmakers, actors,
agents, ticket brokers, radio guys, song writers, orchestra
leaders, newspapermen and cops,'' as Runyon described them, ``still
sleep-groggy'' as they gathered for breakfast at 1 p.m., ``but
shaved and talcumed and lacking only their java to make them ready
for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindy's has long since vanished from Broadway, along with Leo
Lindemann, its creator, and Sky Masterson, Nathan Detroit and the
other urban wayfarers in Runyon's cast of semimythic characters.
Gone, too, are Phil Gluckstern's and Arnold Reuben's and Lou G.
Siegel's, where serious fressers (overeaters) could count on
finding corned beef with taam, the indispensable Jewish taste.
They're all part of the Oh-So-Long-Ago, as Winchell called it, like
Jack Dempsey and Jack Benny.
</P>
<P>
   Now newcomers to New York angle for tables at Balthazar or Nobu.
Pals initiate them to Krug instead of cream soda.
</P>
<P>
   Corned beef is alive and well, of course. It shows up around the
world, in one guise or another. But in New York, where once it was
king, good kosher-style corned beef is as rare as nightingales'
tongues.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   You find plenty of corned beef in Dublin, as the centerpiece of
corned beef and cabbage, the reliably nourishing standby of the
frugal housewife, and in Boston, as an essential component of a New
England boiled dinner. You find it in corned beef hash, which has
been a staple on American restaurant and club menus for decades.
</P>
<P>
   My stepdaughter, Catherine Brown, found it in a jungle clearing
on an Indonesian island _ Brazilian corned beef, straight from a
can with a cow on the label, heated over a kerosene stove, served
with sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All the other varieties, to tell the truth, pale in comparison
to the moist, garlicky stuff Jewish immigrants brought with them to
New York from central and eastern Europe. Yet today you can spend
yourself halfway to the poorhouse and give yourself heartburn (not
to mention heartache) looking for the kind of corned beef sandwich
that defined eating in Manhattan the way onion soup defined eating
in Paris: steamed, thinly sliced meat stacked high on rye bread,
slathered with spicy mustard, a half-sour pickle on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen gave Manhattan corned beef one last (or
next-to-last) hurrah in ``Broadway Danny Rose,'' his 1984 film
about a small-time Broadway agent, which included scenes shot in
the Carnegie Delicatessen. But Jerry Seinfeld and his buddies, the
quintessential pop-culture New Yorkers of the 1990s, hung out not
in a deli but in a diner or outside a gussied-up soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Carnegie and the Stage, today's Broadway is
mostly a glorified food court, packed with franchised joints of
every description, serving hamburgers and bagels and pizzas and the
like, many of them owned by a family of real-estate operators,
Murray, Dennis and Irving Riese.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Riese-owned restaurant called Lindy's on
Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets, but any resemblance to the
original is purely coincidental. The only authentically New York
aspect of the place is the surliness of the service.
</P>
<P>
   So where do you find the good stuff? Apprehensive about possible
doubts concerning the corned beef credentials of a man of
Midwestern Lutheran origins, even if said Midwestern Lutheran has
been dribbling deli mustard down his ever-expanding front for many
decades, I sought the help of Tim Zagat, the guidebook publisher. A
New Yorker in both palate and pedigree, he claims to have eaten
corned beef regularly since puberty.
</P>
<P>
   Zagat's 1999 guide to New York restaurants reflects the
declining role of the delicatessen, and hence corned beef, in New
York gastronomy. Not one of the 50 establishments top-rated for
food is a deli, although two are pizza parlors and one is a soup
kitchen. Zagat's amateur critics ate in delis a lot (the Carnegie
was the seventh-most-visited spot in the survey), but they must
have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing caution to the winds, Zagat and I decided to taste for
ourselves. As a concession to age _ neither of us is young anymore
_ we asked the countermen to give us thinner sandwiches than usual.
Though obviously offended, they complied.
</P>
<P>
   The sign outside the Stage Delicatessen (834 Seventh Ave.,
between 53rd and 54th Streets), meant to take a poke at the
Carnegie, betrays a certain defensiveness. ``Why wait on line,'' it
asks, ``when you could be eating now?'' In the heyday of Max Asnas,
the founder, the Stage bragged about the quality of its food, not
how quickly it could find you a table.
</P>
<P>
   But the place still smells right (a little greasy, a little
garlicky), waiters and customers still abuse each other in a
good-natured way and the sandwiches are still named for celebrities
(though it's a stretch to think of Fran Drescher and Richard
Simmons, both creatures of television, as Broadway types). It still
deals gently with Iowans who don't know which is the bagel and
which the lox.
</P>
<P>
   As for the corned beef, it's a comedown from the 1960s, when the
Stage was listed in a book called ``Great Restaurants of America.''
The meat is too dry, too pink, too wan in flavor. If there is
really a ``secret recipe,'' as claimed, they must have forgotten to
let the cook in on the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Another big disappointment came at Katz's (205 E. Houston St. at
Ludlow Street), a 112-year-old institution that figured in ``When
Harry Met Sally.'' There's nothing not to like about the
terrazzo-and-Formica ambiance, with a cafeteria counter along one
side and signs instructing you, as of yore, to ``Send a salami to
your boy in the Army.'' You have to love the fact that they still
use meal tickets (does anyone else?) and cut the corned beef by
hand, with venerable knives sharpened down almost to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Katz's hot dogs, crisped on the grill, and its garlic-laden
knoblewurst are both vaut le voyage downtown. But the corned beef
sandwich is only OK _ moist meat with a rough texture, but with a
slightly musty flavor instead of the bright, pungent taste that you
look for. The bread is rather bland as well _ a lot like
supermarket rye, though I wince to say so.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Second Avenue Deli (156 Second Ave., at 10th Street) has the
least authentic decor _ a recent redesign by Adam Tihany, no less _
but the most authentic everything else. This was the domain of Abe
Lebewohl, a true Manhattan treasure, part social worker, part
delicatessen genius, who was gunned down in 1995 by an unknown
villain who remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Here everything is kosher; even the cheesecake is made with
tofu, to avoid transgressing the boundary between meat and dairy.
Many other delis serve ``kosher-style'' food, which means that it
looks and (they say) tastes the same, but is not prepared in strict
compliance with Jewish dietary laws.
</P>
<P>
   And here the corned beef, prepared in the basement, is the
genuine article. ``Juicier, richer, more zaftig,'' as my
grease-spotted notes say. ``A real knockout.'' Real kosher corned
beef isn't unobtanium after all.
</P>
<P>
   I think the question always asked by Abe Lebewohl's brother Jack
or one of the other servers has something to do with it. ``Lean or
juicy?'' they ask, before anyone has a chance to say ``extra
lean.'' Confronted with that choice, most people opt for juicy,
which means they get enough fat, Jack Lebewohl says, to boost the
flavor and make sure the sandwich doesn't get dry.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing: People from Sweden walk in, sure, as three did
just a few days before our recent visit, but this is still
primarily a neighborhood spot. Some customers come in six or seven
times a week, and on Friday, the locals pack the place. They know
their corned beef; they make sure that Jack keeps things up to
snuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie (854 Seventh Ave. at 55th Street) is only a
half-step behind, if that, despite the agonizingly corny names it
gives to some of its sandwiches (e.g., ``The Mouth That Roared,''
which is roast beef and Bermuda onion). And despite a less
demanding clientele (big groups from Kansas City and Utah, on my
last visit, but some from the Bronx, too). Sometimes the country
boys exhibit unacceptable table manners; when he was running for
the vice presidency, former Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas tried in
vain to eat his bulging sandwich with a knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, the Carnegie corns 15,000 pounds of beef at a plant
in Carlstadt, N.J., starting with well-marbled 8- to 12-pound
briskets cut from the breast of the steer. Injected first with a
saline-and-garlic solution enriched with allspice, thyme and
mustard and coriander seed, the beef is then pickled for about a
week in barrels filled with the same solution.
</P>
<P>
   Some is sold to other restaurants, but about 10,000 pounds a
week are cooked as needed in the Carnegie's damp, dungeon-like
basement. The meat is boiled for two to two-and-a-half hours in
35-gallon pots, then carried upstairs, where it is steamed and
sliced to order, across the grain, of course, on razor-sharp rotary
cutting machines. The blades are replaced once a month; the
machines themselves, exhausted by constant use, are sent back for
rebuilding every three months, said Sanford Levine, one of the
Carnegie's co-owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiches are built on thin, seeded rye bread delivered four
times a day from the Certified Bakery in Union City, N.J. More than
a dozen ultrathin slices of beef go into the average sandwich, a
few lean, a few fat. That's the way Leo Steiner, who first put the
Carnegie on the map, liked it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should melt in your mouth,'' he confided to a reporter
almost a decade ago. ``I don't like to chew. Thinner, the flavor
comes through.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   Broadway and environs still have plenty of delicatessens, of a
sort. There's the All-American Gourmet Deli, the Celebrity Deli,
Roxy's (named after a defunct theater), the Crown Deli (``featuring
Colombo yogurt'') and the 55th Street Deli, a
produce-stand-cum-convenience-food-shop. Downtown, I spotted delis
touting waffles or salad bars. These are the kinds of places that
would happily sell a passing innocent a corned beef and Swiss on
toasted seven-grain.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that none of them, or their yuppified
counterparts elsewhere, are authentic, thumb-in-your-soup,
garlic-scented, damn-the-cholesterol delis. That kind of place has
mostly vanished from midtown and the Lower East Side as the
Broadway crowd has thinned and the Jewish population has scattered
to New Jersey and Queens and Long Island, losing touch with its
roots in the process. We're talking heavy social anthropology here,
but we're also talking gastronomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were all on the Lower East Side, every mom-and-pop
store cured its own,'' said Rabbi Arthur Herzberg, a professor of
humanities at New York University and a kosher food maven of
considerable standing. ``That was one thing. Now you get
two-week-old corned beef, supermarket corned beef and corned beef
and cheese _ utter desecrations of Jewish soul food.''
</P>
<P>
   The genuine article is even harder to find elsewhere in the
country. Some film people swear by Nate 'n Al's in Los Angeles, but
in my experience, kosher corned beef starts to fade once it wanders
beyond commuting range of Manhattan. (Zingerman's in Ann Arbor,
Mich., is an honorable exception.)
</P>
<P>
   Branches of New York nosheries have failed in Beverly Hills, New
Jersey, Boston and the Washington suburbs in recent years, and
several decades before that, my friend Stanley Karnow, the
Brooklyn-born journalist and historian, lost his shirt, or at least
a sleeve or two, struggling to teach the long-suffering Hong Kong
Chinese the finer points of Jewish gastronomy.
</P>
<P>
   Without a maven or two a day among its customers, any deli will
sooner or later lose the touch, exactly like a Thai restaurant in
Afghanistan. And without real delis, there can be no real New York
corned beef _ rich and warm and tender, slightly salty but also
slightly sweet, with just enough fat clinging to the meat to keep
it moist. Ordering the stuff extra lean, the way some people do, is
about as pointless as drinking 3.2 beer.

`THE BLACK ROOM AT LONGWOOD': NAPOLEON COMPLEX: THE SCENT OF
EXILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All exiles are the same,'' Jean-Paul Kauffmann writes in this
sensitive and elegant reflection on the exile of Napoleon Bonaparte
to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic. Having made that
observation, Kauffmann alludes to visits he has made to famous
places of exile, including St. Helena itself, where he spent nine
days visiting the mildewed rooms where Napoleon was held captive in
the years after his defeat at Waterloo. He talks, for example,
about ``the lonely Champagne countryside'' where Charles de Gaulle
spent his years of political exile after World War II ``playing
patience and talking at length.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from palaces and the bright show of power, the retreats of
the great seem eternally dark, bitter, uncomfortable places,''
Kauffmann says. And later: ``I hear the voice forever weeping.
Prisoners are the only ones who can hear that lament. It's the pain
of endlessly going over everything again and again that rises in
whispers from small, barred windows and cries behind the iron doors
of prison cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about Napoleon and the six years he spent in
exile on St. Helena, which lasted until his death in 1821. Not
everybody knows Kauffmann, but almost every French person does. He
used to be the Middle East correspondent for a French magazine and
has for years been a well-known journalist. He acquired unwanted
fame when he was seized by extremists in Beirut in 1985 and held
hostage for three years, often blindfolded in a cellar.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't even allude to that experience in ``The Black Room at
Longwood,'' but it clearly and profoundly affects much of what he
says about Napoleon. Certainly Kauffmann's ability to project
Napoleon's experience onto the screen of his own informed
imagination is what gives this book its elegiac quality, its
special edge of insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can smell melancholy at the Exiles' Club,'' Kauffmann
writes early on, when he looks into a little bar on St. Helena,
which is a British possession. ``It's something damp and languid,
the heady odor of mildew, the acrid taste of dust, which indicate a
fixation with the past, the monotony of memories, neglect,
idleness. And death.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann's book is set up as a kind of travelogue, a report on
the nine days he spent in St. Helena several years ago: the places
he saw, the encounters he had there, the thoughts that came to his
mind. But the travel form is a device, a way into Kauffmann's
purpose, which is ... what?
</P>
<P>
   That is not an easy question to answer. Certainly one purpose is
to reincarnate the loneliness and the sorrow of Napoleon's last
years, and in pursuit of that goal Kauffmann has written a
learnedly impressionistic history of Napoleon's slow fall from
power. He concentrates in this sense on two major episodes, the
beginning and end of Napoleon's fall. One is the costly and
indecisive 1807 Battle of Eylau in eastern Prussia; the other, his
slow disintegration at Longwood, the residence he was assigned on
St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   But Kauffmann seems to have a deeper purpose as well. And while
this purpose is never fully elaborated in his book, it has to do
with his interest in recapturing time, hauling it out of the deep
recess into which it has fallen, to make it real. In Proustian
fashion he even brings with him a bottle of the eau de cologne that
Napoleon, who was very sensitive to smell, wore in exile, hoping
that it will help him to inject himself sensually into the
Emperor's last years. He acknowledges that attempt to be a mawkish
failure, but even as a failure it illustrates Kauffmann's
fascination with the theme of fallen greatness, an absorption that
brought him to more places than St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The love of what is irretrievably lost has led me to St.
Helena, as it did to Eylau,'' Kauffmann writes. He continues later
about Eylau, one of several Napoleanic battlefields that he has
visited: ``Places like Eylau are divided between absence and
excess, barrenness and retrospective illusion. The past is a gray
light we all must color in our own way, and the past had just
dazzled me like lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kauffmann's days proceed, he unravels the thread of
Napoleon's final years and attempts to invest them with
psychological meaning. At first the man who proclaimed that he had
once ``carried the world on my shoulders'' believed that he would
eventually return to Europe, and he spent his days dictating his
memoirs to the members of the small entourage that accompanied him
to the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman's understanding here is keen and absorbing. He unfolds
Napoleon's experience, dissects it, lays it out as a struggle to
impose meaning on what had become a meaningless existence, a
struggle against boredom, a confrontation with a kind of trackless
time. Many books have been written about this period in Napoleon's
life, including the volumes of memoirs by those who stayed with him
at Longwood for months or years. But Kauffmann's elucidation of
what might be called the spiritual stages of exile represents a
superb and memorable piece of writing.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Kauffmann not refer explicitly to his personal history
of exile? Perhaps it is because his name became so well known in
France when he was held hostage in Lebanon that it would seem
gratuitous to mention his own suffering. There is a modesty, a
discretion involved in the reluctance of this author to make
himself even a part of the story, even to hint at a connection
between himself and the man whose life story is a French national
monument. Whatever Kauffmann's reasons, his time in exile left
behind a distillate of sensibility that has enabled him to write a
penetrating and poignant book.

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS URGED TO STRENGTHEN NURSING HOME REGULATIONS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Vulnerable nursing home patients are frequently the
victims of abuse and neglect that can lead to injury or death, an
organization that advocates tougher nursing home monitoring said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition to Protect America's Elders, a Tallahassee-based
organization, urged federal and state lawmakers to strengthen
regulations and adopt stricter enforcement of existing policies to
protect nursing home residents.
</P>
<P>
   Among the policies the coalition would like to see enacted
nationwide would be permission for families to use video
surveillance cameras to monitor the treatment given to their loved
ones during non-visiting hours.

for-profit nursing homes, accused the coalition of being a front
for Tallahassee trial attorney Jim Wilkes. The association quoted a
recent Wall Street Journal article which noted that the coalition
receives most of its money from Wilkes, whose practice involves
suing nursing homes. The association also noted that the St.
Petersburg Times had referred to Wilkes as ``the suing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Keegan, the association's vice president, said federal law
does not prohibit nursing home residents from installing cameras in
their rooms, but suggested that ``24-hour video surveillance will
not help seniors and families feel secure. In fact, it's hard to
imagine a greater invasion of privacy or dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan argued that rather than protecting residents, the cameras
would be used to gather evidence for potential lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition issued an 18-page report highlighting instances of
abuse and neglect. Among its findings were that one-fourth of
nursing homes in America continue to operate despite violations of
federal, state or local regulations. It also said spot checks found
that one-fifth of nursing home workers who have direct contact with
patients may have a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Severe injuries, infections, amputations and even death are
the shameful and direct results of corporate greed, uncaring
employees, lax regulation and weak enforcement,'' said Barbara
Hengstebeck, the coalition's executive director, at a news
conference here. ``It's time to put nursing homes on notice:
America's taxpayers demand zero-tolerance for abuse, neglect and
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew D. Weinberg, associate professor of medicine at Emory
University School of Medicine, said that while there are good
nursing homes and dedicated staffers, one problem is that quality
care is not given on every shift every day.
</P>
<P>
   Often, abuse and neglect happen on late-night shifts which may
not have as many top supervisors on duty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems led Gale Sweeney to hide a video camera to capture
the mistreatment given to her mother, Katheryn Baker, in a Houston,
Texas, nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said her mother repeatedly was ignored when she needed
assistance, and sometimes her mother's call bell was moved out of
reach. When her mother yelled for help, Sweeney said the elderly
woman was warned that she would be left outside in a wheelchair in
the rain if she didn't stop calling.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal and state agencies routinely threaten nursing
homes for violations, coalition members said stiff penalties are
rarely enforced and the pattern of abuse quickly returns after an
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition concluded that ``lax regulators err on the side of
protecting nursing homes instead of the helpless elder residents.''

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Bouley has always been a man with a plan. Too
many plans, it sometimes seems. When he closed the four-star Bouley
in 1996, he spoke of imperial ambitions that verged on the
Napoleonic, right down to the wholesale conquest of Russia and
Austria-Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   In partnership with Warner LeRoy, he planned to resuscitate the
Russian Tea Room. He also envisioned a restaurant devoted to the
cuisine of the Hapsburg Empire, a cooking school and other
ventures. And, oh yes, while these schemes unfolded, he would keep
busy with a little place called Bouley Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership with LeRoy blew up. The Austron-Hungarian
restaurant opens next week. The school lies a couple of years down
the road. But a funny thing happened to Bouley Bakery. The little
cafe with the bakery attached, intended as a place holder, became
the anchor of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after an expansion and a slick renovation, it has
quietly re-emerged as a resplendent, reinvented, finer version of
its former self. The restaurant crackles with a new energy, and
Bouley, as though responding to his new jewel box of a theater, is
turning out food that is nothing less than inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bouley Bakery still occupies one of the ugliest
buildings in lower Manhattan, a squat rectangle with two grossly
disproportional windows shaped like half-moons. But the interior
has undergone a makeover that has solved several problems. The
walls and vaulted ceilings have been treated with a rose-salmon
glaze that warms up the room, for one thing, and there is now more
space.
</P>
<P>
   The bicycle shop that was next door has been turned into a twin
of the former dining room, allowing for 15 tables to be added to
the 12 of the original room. The redesign has relieved the sense of
claustrophobia while retaining the old intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the bakery is now sealed off from the
restaurant, removing an annoying distraction and eliminating those
sad little tables near the bakery counter where hapless couples
would attempt to eat while arriving diners milled around them,
occasionally dragging a raincoat across the appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that distracts from the food at Bouley Bakery should be
considered a capital offense. It is stunningly good, and
consistently ascends to the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   As a chef, Bouley has it all _ elegance, finesse and flair. His
flavors are extraordinarily clear and exquisitely balanced; his use
of seasoning is so deft as to be insidious. Even his most complex
creations have a classical simplicity to them.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley cooks the way Racine wrote and Descartes thought. At the
same time, although French to his fingertips, he has also been
traveling, thinking and assimilating foreign influences. In the
most considered way, he has become a more daring chef, and a more
exciting one.
</P>
<P>
   A zap of citrus and a touch of saffron transform a deep,
intensely flavored seafood stock bobbing with littleneck clams and
trumpet-shape Canadian chanterelles. A lump of Japanese yellowtail,
braised to the point of melting tenderness, comes with a simple
accompaniment of shiitake mushrooms and glazed scallions, but an
ethereal, perfumed ginger sauce, barely touched with orange and
lemon, lifts the dish right off the table.
</P>
<P>
   When Bouley works foreign influences into his dishes, he does so
with impeccable taste and a light Gallic touch. A gently applied
dose of Thai curry, for example, permeates a meaty, full-flavored
lobster with citric spice, redoubling the richness of the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   For professional musicians, the real test is maintaining tonal
purity and expressive power at the softest volumes. The analogy
holds in cooking. Bouley thrives on bold flavors. His rack of lamb
with glazed salsify and chanterelles is potent, with an
intoxicating overlay of sage, but he can communicate in the merest
whisper. His cod with broccoli puree seems almost like a bad bet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone hold an audience with ingredients this simple and
sparely presented? The answer is yes, and yes again. For textural
interest, he sprinkles the dish with minuscule cubes of roasted
potato and crunchy grains of gray Breton salt.
</P>
<P>
   Even roast chicken, a boring blur on most menus, takes flight in
Bouley's hands. It comes with an opulent Madeira sauce that enfolds
nicoise olives and organic tomatoes like a silken cloak.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley has found his match in Bill Yosses, the pastry chef,
whose creations are unfailingly elegant, restrained and
imaginative. The calorie-shy will pounce on pineapple carpaccio,
with its cool, eye-catching overlay of frostlike crystallized
coriander and lime sorbet, but Yosses can cater to the unleashed id
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Diners who demand the full monty when it comes to desserts will
not be disappointed by ``sweet pleasures,'' a multilayer affair of
thin milk-chocolate leaves separating layers of milk-chocolate
ganache and chantilly cream, all of it sitting on a toasted
hazelnut dacquoise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its expansion and the fireworks in the kitchen, Bouley
Bakery retains the feel of a small neighborhood restaurant. Diners
feel comfortable showing up in shirtsleeves, and the staff shrewdly
maintains a delicate balance between informality and the more
disciplined level of service implicit in the food and decor.
</P>
<P>
   The key that winds this mechanism is Dominique Simon, the maitre
d'hotel, who may be as important as Bouley to the dining
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, recognizable by his slightly hunched shoulders and bow
tie, paces the restaurant like an NBA coach whose team is ahead by
20 points but cannot stop himself. When new diners enter, he is
there to greet them. If a waiter somehow neglects to remove an
empty wine glass from a table, Simon appears and snatches it away.
When reading a customer from across the room, he seems to know the
differences among frowns of concentration, confusion and distress.
</P>
<P>
   There is an intensity to the service at Bouley Bakery that is
remarkable in New York. The waiters seem passionate about the food
and deeply concerned that diners enjoy it to the full.
</P>
<P>
   This goes right down the chain of command to the bread waiter,
Zahangir Khan, who plies his trade with gentle zeal. Rare is the
diner who does not subscribe to at least three or four of the
half-dozen breads on offer. And really, there is no point in saying
no to anything at Bouley Bakery. Wiser heads have arranged matters
so that the only possible answer to any question is yes.

 &HT;    GORE, ENDORSED BY LATINOS, WARNS GOP WOULD WIPE OUT HISPANIC
GAINS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, accepting endorsements from
hundreds of Latino leaders, warned Tuesday that
Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the GOP's opposition to census
sampling and Texas Gov. George Bush's education proposals could
wipe out economic gains made by Hispanics under administration
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's warnings came as his presidential campaign launched
``Ganamos con Gore'' (''We win with Gore''), a nationwide effort to
build on the political organizations of the nearly 600 Hispanic
elected officials and community leaders who endorsed the vice
president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said federal tax credit payments to the poor have been the
``single most beneficial economic change'' for Hispanics and other
working poor families over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that House Republicans are considering plans to
delay billions of dollars in those tax credit payments in order to
pay for other federal spending and to help finance a tax cut that
Gore described as ``risky'' to the current economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said GOP-sponsored tax cuts could lead
to reductions in federal aid to education. And while he did not
mention Bush by name, he noted that ``some Republican candidates
stand and pretend to support public education while at the same
time supporting this risky tax scheme that would devastate public
education in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the kind of education policy recently
outlined by Bush, in which federal dollars would be diverted from
failing public schools to private schools that are not required to
admit all students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the strangest education I've ever seen because they are
claiming they can add by subtracting and dividing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also questioned how any GOP presidential candidate could
stand by the efforts of House Republicans to stop the Census Bureau
from using statistical sampling in order to avoid the kind of
undercounting of minorities that has occurred in the last two
census counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone look at the extra problems and challenges
facing the Latino community and come to the conclusion that ...
they cannot support a fair and accurate census,'' Gore said. ``I
don't think anyone can claim to be a friend of the Latino community
while simultaneously supporting an approach to the census which is
designed to intentionally undercount Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic community, which is expected to become the largest
ethnic minority in the country by 2005, is keenly interested in the
2000 census. The population count is used in the funding formulas
of nearly every federal program.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic endorsements of Gore may have taken some of the
sting out of the decision by Friends of the Earth, an influential
environmental group, to back former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Gore's sole competitor for the 2000 Democratic presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., a senior member of the Democratic
leadership in Congress, called Bradley, his fellow New Jerseyite, a
``great guy'' as he introduced Gore to the Hispanic leaders who
crowded into a Capitol Hill hotel room for the ``Ganamos con Gore''
event.
</P>
<P>
   But in reminding the crowd that Gore has stood against
Republican initiatives that were widely viewed as anti-immigrant in
the Hispanic community since the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994,
Menendez asked, ``Where were those who want our votes now who
should have been at our side defending us then?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996, briefly mulled an
independent run for president, then spent time lecturing at
Stanford University in California before deciding to challenge Gore
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez also lashed out at Bush, the overwhelming favorite to
win the 2000 GOP presidential nomination, suggesting that the
Texan's campaign signature of ``compassionate conservatism''
insults Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community doesn't need compassion _ even talking to us in
that way treats us as a stepchild,'' he said. ``We don't need
compassion, we need educational opportunity ... health care
security (and) access to capital.''
</P>
<P>
   California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a longtime Gore booster,
used Bush to whip up the enthusiasm of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it. What's all this talk about George Bush and the
Latino community? They talk about this guy like he's Ricky Martin
or something. Anybody who thinks that George W. Bush is good for
Latinos _ they are living la vie da loca.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think he's just a little bit more sizzle than he
is steak.''

DARK-FLESHED FISH: A TASTE WORTH ACQUIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eating certain foods can be a gustatory badge of courage. Liver,
for example, or sweetbreads or even some bitter Asian greens cause
many diners to just say, ``Yuck!''
</P>
<P>
   High on this list are the so-called oily fish, like mackerel,
bluefish, pompano and sardines. These dark-fleshed fish are
routinely passed over in favor of their milder white-fleshed
cousins. But for anyone who appreciates real flavor, this is a
serious error, because these fish have what those ubiquitous white
fish do not: rich, distinctive taste.
</P>
<P>
   So why does it take courage to face these fish? Perhaps the dark
color is a bit daunting to neophytes. But mostly the same high oil
content that makes these fish so flavorful also makes them very
perishable. Many an unsuspecting diner has bought or been served a
less-than-fresh version and was left to believe that that was the
way the fish was supposed to taste. End of experiment.
</P>
<P>
   This problem should be a thing of the past. With improved
methods of bringing fish to market, it is not that difficult to
find very fresh bluefish, mackerel, sardines, pompano or their
highly popular colleagues in this group, tuna and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Once a food has a tarnished reputation, though, it can be hard
to rehabilitate it. So perhaps a bit of attitude adjustment is in
order. Instead of thinking of these fish as oily, consider them
rich-fleshed, and health-enhancing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Making this mental change-over can bring great rewards. Stronger
flavors are intrinsically more interesting to the adventurous
palate and can also hold their own with aggressive ingredients like
hot chilies, tangy citrus and briny olives. This allows the cook a
much wider latitude in creating bold dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Rich-fleshed fish also have an advantage when it comes to
cooking methods. Because their high oil content keeps them moist
and helps prevent their sticking to cooking surfaces, they lend
themselves well to grilling or broiling. For the same reason, they
are ideally suited to smoking, a technique that imparts deep, rich
flavors to seafood.
</P>
<P>
   And in a deliciously paradoxical twist, the health benefits of
these fish come from that bad boy of nutritional policy, fat.
Called omega-3 fatty acids, the fats in these fish are thought to
have many benefits, the best-established being the prevention of
heart problems. Omega-3's have been repeatedly shown to help
prevent heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, including researchers at the Jonsson Comprehensive
Cancer Center at the University of California at Los Angeles,
believe that these fats may also help reduce the risk of breast
cancer. In some patients, omega-3's have also been able to reduce
the painful symptoms of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest _ and most surprising _ word on omega-3's is that
they may help make people not only healthier but happier. This is
the opinion of Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, the chief of the outpatient
clinic at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,
part of the National Institutes of Health.

<P>
   After correlating immense amounts of data on diets and the
incidence of clinical depression in various countries, Hibbeln
found that the more fish people eat, the less they seem to suffer
from depression.
</P>
<P>
   This theory was bolstered earlier this year when scientists in
England found that individuals suffering from clinical depression
had significantly lower levels of docosahexaenoic acid, a primary
component of omega-3's, in their blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are many fish to choose from if you want to
get the flavor and health advantages of omega-3's. While very
dark-fleshed fish like mackerel, sardines and herring are the
highest in oil content, rainbow trout, lake trout and the
ever-popular salmon are also prime examples.
</P>
<P>
   A single serving of Atlantic salmon, for instance, contains 18
times as much omega-3 as the same-size piece of cod or mahi-mahi.
Whichever of these fish you choose, buy only the very freshest.
They are almost always sold as whole fish, which you can then ask
to be filleted.
</P>
<P>
   Apply the usual visual tests: the eyes of the fish should look
bright rather than dull, and its surface should be bright and
glistening, with a clear, almost translucent quality. The flesh
should be firm and unbruised.
</P>
<P>
   But the surest test is to sniff the specimen you are considering
buying. It should smell like fresh sea water, not ``fishy'' or
tinged with ammonia. If in doubt, go to the next fish.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find fresh mackerel, bluefish or sardines for the
recipes here, you can always substitute salmon, which is available
in good quality year-round because it is so widely farmed. And
fortunately, there seems to be little difference in omega-3 content
between farmed and wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   If you give these rich-fleshed fish a try, you may discover to
your delight that there was nothing to be afraid of in the first
place.

   FBN-INJURIES _ Some of the most high-profile players in the NFL
were injured on the opening weekend, and most of the injuries are
being viewed as artificial turf related. Each year when the NFL
does its survey of players, artificial turf is the No. 1 complaint.

stadiums _ the Superdome in preseason _ are experimenting with
playing on grass indoors. (Schlabach, Atlanta

his now-5-year-old car doesn't have much of a chance to win the
second Petit Le Mans. More perplexing, his Doyle-Risi team still
hasn't heard any news of an upgrade from Ferrari, yet he's
surprisingly upbeat because of the success of the American Le Mans
Series. (Mitchell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    75-year-old fiddles as Floyd churns
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Monday morning, as most of South Florida
rose and clicked on the Weather Channel and then shuffled around,
aimlessly, and made some lists and continued that tired debate with
the better-half: ``Are putting up plywood or not?,'' 75-year-old
Alyce Wilcinski got up and fixed herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.
</P>
<P>
   Then she had her coffee and her toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I have to be afraid of?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   As you and I got the kids out of bed and tried to explain all
about the big storm and how its name is Floyd and how it's huge,
really huge, and how there could be some horrid, horrid weather
coming our way. As we explained _ calmly, of course _ how we might
lose the big mango tree in the back and the tree house and maybe
even the back porch that daddy and grandpa built, Alyce Wilcinski
threw in a load of laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, actually I did two,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She changed the sheets on the bed and watched a little
television. Her sister called, all nervous and aflutter, and Alyce
tried to calm her down. Alyce had some leftover meatloaf for lunch
and then she talked to the neighbor across the street. Is that
woman 86 or 87? She can never remember. And Alyce tried to persuade
her to take cover with her if the big storm remains as big as
everyone thinks it will and if it continues to come right this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just never occurred to me to be afraid,'' Alyce said.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of South Florida ran about in one rude,
anxiety-fueled madcap of a rush, battling long lines at the lumber
yard and making panicky decisions right there on the spot:
``Half-inch plywood or five/eighths?'' While we answered telephone
calls from our nervous relatives to the north and argued with
husbands, or wives, that we should have spent the money for the
$3,000 metal hurricane shutters that bolt right into place, Alyce
Wilcinski stayed tucked in her tidy little house all day long.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't have to go to the store. Not once.
</P>
<P>
   She has enough canned goods and candles and batteries and cat
food. She has a hurricane lantern and shutters that fasten down.
``They're more for looks than protection,'' she says about the Key
West-looking shutters that she put down herself. She has gas in the
car and cash in her pocketbook and, well, she's just not the kind
of person to . . .
</P>
<P>
   How should she put this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go ape,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   If her husband was still alive, God rest his soul, things might
be different. If he were still alive, she might be more afraid
about how he would make it through the storm. What would she do if
he needed help right as the middle of Floyd was blowing through?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think that most people, when they worry, they worry
about others?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just her, Alyce Wilcinski. She's lived here since 1928,
so she's seen some hurricanes. And she's not going to be dumb about
things, but she's not going to . . . Well, she's not going to go
ape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't die but once,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So while the rest of us were racing around feeling sick at the
sight of that huge willowy storm to our east, while we were calling
our mothers and trading fears with our neighbors, while we were
trying to get our work done so we could go home and obsess, Alyce
Wilcinski fixed herself a little dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she'll probably have leftovers for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get scared,'' she said, smiling, ``come on over.''
</P>

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: PUZZLING THEN, POIGNANT NOW: A BECKETTIAN
FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Wherever one turns at the Barbican Center, there is
Samuel Beckett's eaglelike image: in posters, programs and in an
exhibition of John Haynes' striking photographs of the writer and
actors in memorable past productions of his plays. In the two
theaters at the Barbican, the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company
in season, all 19 of Beckett's stage plays are being performed,
offering theatergoers the equivalent of a retrospective of a
painter's body of work.
</P>
<P>
   The Beckett Festival, which Dublin's Gate Theater brought to
Lincoln Center in 1996, has arrived in London in an expanded
version. In addition to the plays (the long and the short ones),
there are screenings of films by and about Beckett, broadcasts of
his radio plays and talks and panel discussions by a diverse range
of scholars, critics and biographers as well as the playwright's
nephew and literary executor, Edward Beckett. The festival, which
is being presented by Michael Colgan, the director of the Gate,
continues through Sept. 18. It is as much about Beckett the icon as
Beckett the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Beckett was greeted with skepticism and, in
some cases, negativism. Now he is generally accepted as the
playwright who altered the course of 20th century theater. One sign
of the security of his stature was the welcoming speech of Mary
McAleese, the president of Ireland, who expressed in dramatic terms
her commitment to the arts.
</P>
<P>
   While extolling Ireland's Nobel laureates in literature _ Yeats,
Shaw, Seamus Heaney and Beckett _ she acknowledged that Beckett
``like the other great Irish writer of this century, James Joyce,
consciously rejected the cultural environment of the Ireland of his
era, that proud yet sometimes narrow and burdensome legacy, and
chose to live and work on the Continent.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Beckett's work ``confronts us with the stark moral
and spiritual dilemmas of our age, sometimes with savage humor,
sometimes, it seems, with bleak despair, but never without a deep
humanity and concern for the human condition.'' As ``heir to a
glorious intellectual and literary tradition in the English
language,'' Beckett strove to reduce and distill that language to
the essential. She commented that because of such contradictions he
was ``at once the most Irish of writers and the most international
of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof of that point was offered in performance, as Irish actors
(Barry McGovern, Niall Buggy, Rosaleen Linehan and others) gave an
Irish tinge to the plays while allowing the work to be approached
as generic. One change from the Gate ensemble that visited New York
was the casting of John Hurt in ``Krapp's Last Tape.'' With his
hair cropped short and a look of grave intensity, he resembled the
playwright. In this melancholic memory play, his sepulchral voice
seemed as appropriate as his shoes, which squeaked loudly and
humorously as he paced the stage and roamed through his life.
</P>
<P>
   Krapp is as close as Beckett came to writing an autobiographical
character, with his remembrance of having an epiphany standing
alone on the jetty at Dun Laoghaire and of sharing a rare romantic
interlude in a small boat. Krapp also stands in for his author when
he confronts his early, troubled days as a writer: ``Seventeen
copies sold, of which 11 at trade price to free circulating
libraries beyond the seas,'' followed by those two poignant words,
``Getting known.''
</P>
<P>
   During the festival, discussions deal with Beckett's life and
his legacy. I gave a talk on ``Beckett and His Critics'' and was
the moderator of a panel discussion in which Tom Stoppard, Edward
Albee and Jim Sheridan (the film director and writer) spoke about
``Beckett the Playwright.'' Each panelist comes from a different
country and theatrical tradition, but all bear the influence of
Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his first encounter with Beckett, Albee looked back
to 1959 when his play, ``The Zoo Story,'' had its world premiere in
Berlin on a double bill with ``Krapp's Last Tape.'' It was the
first time he had seen either play onstage and, he said, ``both
impressed me greatly.'' He added that he was puzzled that initially
theatergoers had been confused by Beckett. It was his belief that
the plays were straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard said that he saw ``Waiting for Godot'' in the late
1950s in Bristol in a production starring Peter O'Toole. He was
transfixed, but, he said, he did not find the writing
straightforward and he still did not understand all of Lucky's
monologue. In contrast, Sheridan said that after he saw his first
Beckett, he ran home and wrote a Beckett play. It may be, he said,
``how I learned not to write a play.''
</P>
<P>
   From Stoppard's perspective, Beckett's genius was in
``redefining the minima of what theater could be.'' He said that
Beckett was so explicit in his stage directions as to lock the
actors into a performance that would conform to the playwright's
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   When Albee countered with the fact that Beckett continually
revised his plays, Stoppard suggested that the actors were then
locked into the new stage directions. He added that, compared with
the later plays, ``Waiting for Godot'' has relatively few
directorial notes from the author in the text, simply occasional
words like ``shouting'' and ``winsomely.'' Or, as Albee said,
``shouting winsomely.''
</P>
<P>
   This American playwright compared Beckett's plays to musical
compositions. They are, he said, like string quartets, which can be
played differently by different instrumentalists but remain
essentially the same. In answer to those who would say that Beckett
repeated himself, Sheridan said: ``After all, in his first two
plays, he wrote about the end of God and the end of the world. It's
hard to get past that.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that he might be sounding like a devil's advocate in
matters Beckettian, Stoppard made it clear that he was ``our writer
for our times,'' an assessment that seemed very much in keeping
with the celebratory nature of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Coincident with the Barbican series, a new Irish play, Marie
Jones' ``Stones in His Pockets,'' opened at the Tricycle Theater in
London (after being presented at the Edinburgh Festival). In this
vibrant comedy about the shooting of a movie in a small Irish
village, two actors, Conleth Hill and Sean Campion, play extras and
everyone else, including the director, leading lady and a man proud
of his status as the last surviving extra from ``The Quiet Man.''
</P>
<P>
   What begins as a sharply satiric spoof about filmmaking on
location evolves into a full portrait of the people in this one
colorful corner of Ireland. The actors will soon work together in
``Waiting for Godot'' at the Lyric Theater in Belfast, a natural
next step for these kinsmen of Beckett.

`AMERICAN BEAUTY': DAD'S DEAD, AND HE'S STILL A FUNNY GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lester Burnham, played with heavenly finesse by Kevin Spacey in
his wittiest and most agile screen performance yet, is a
buttoned-down 42-year-old who desperately needs to stop and smell
the roses. But he won't get much joy from the ones in his suburban
yard.
</P>
<P>
   These fussed-over specimens are the handiwork of Lester's wife,
Carolyn (Annette Bening), whom Lester introduces at the start of
``American Beauty'' with the same devilish acuity that keeps the
rest of this satire so scalding. ``See the way the handle on those
pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's (italics)not(end
italics) an accident,'' Lester remarks.
</P>
<P>
   That Lester happens to be dead when he says this contributes
significantly to the film's darker side. ``American Beauty,''
directed with terrific visual flair by the English stage director
Sam Mendes (``Cabaret'') and replete with the kinds of delicate,
eroticized power-playing vignettes found in his production of ``The
Blue Room,'' strikes an unusually successful balance between the
mordant and bright.
</P>
<P>
   Its vision of curdled suburbia, where Lester's marriage is ``a
commercial for how normal we are when we're anything but,'' is also
somehow embraced with unlikely affection. And it manages to end on
a note of acceptance, even in the wake of its forced yet
brilliantly staged, devastating climax.
</P>
<P>
   As written crisply by Alan Ball (who, like Mendes, makes a most
attention-getting film debut), ``American Beauty'' takes aim at
targets that are none too fresh. His Lester is not the first
super-bland suburban paragon to drop out with a vengeance, nor does
Carolyn amount to a new take on the ambitious, frigid wife.
</P>
<P>
   But as in bourgeoisie-barbecuing movies from ``The Graduate'' to
``Election,'' it's the little things that turn the stereotype into
something memorable, from the sugary sound of ``Bali H'ai'' at an
otherwise glum Burnham family dinner to the father-daughter
give-and-take between Lester and teen-age Jane (Thora Birch, in a
veritable Christina Ricci role). ``So Janie, how was school?'' he
asks, to which the sarcastic reply is: ``It was
(italics)spectacular,(end italics) Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in motion when Lester, also none too originally,
goes ape for a nubile blond cheerleader (Mena Suvari, lately seen
in ``American Pie''). That she happens to be Jane's friend doesn't
stop Lester from imagining red rose petals floating out of her open
sweater. (Mendes' rueful, cleanly minimalist camera style often
gives way to such eloquent flights of fancy.) She is stimulus
enough for him to wake up out of a marriage-long coma and start
considering life's livelier possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red 1970 Firebird, the car I always wanted and now I have
it,'' says Lester of his new vehicle, the one that suits his new
career at a fast food restaurant. ``I (italics)rule!''(end italics)
Spacey's way of wringing every bit of nasty hilarity out of a line
like that is itself worth the price of admission. (His enunciation
of ``Don't interrupt me, honey'' is on an evil par with Jack
Nicholson ``Heeere's Johnny!'')
</P>
<P>
   But ``American Beauty'' is also loaded with equally colorful
supporting characters who seem to drift casually through the film
until all their fates converge.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age voyeur next door is Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley),
whose mother (Allison Janney) is as wordlessly miserable as Carolyn
is pert. (Ms. Bening is scathingly funny, and also quite graceful,
as a walking monument to despicable values.) Meanwhile, Ricky's
ramrod father (Chris Cooper, doing a wonderful deadpan) is a
military man notably out of touch with everyone around him.
</P>
<P>
   When two neighbors who cohabit and are both named Jim describe
themselves as partners, Ricky's father wants to know what business
they're in. (Tax attorney and anesthesiologist.)
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' hammers heavily on the notion that
nonconformity is needed here. That thought is repeated frequently
and never carries a whit of surprise. But scene by scene, the film
is full of its own brand of corrosive novelty, from the way Lester
transforms himself in hopes of attracting the cheerleader to the
revitalizing effects of Carolyn's acrobatic affair with a fellow
real estate agent (a very smooth Peter Gallagher).
</P>
<P>
   As these characters struggle viciously _ and hilariously _ to
escape the middle-class doldrums, the film also evinces a real and
ever more stirring compassion. As it detects increasingly vital
signs of life behind the absurd surfaces that Mendes presents so
beautifully, the film takes on a gravity to match its evil zest.
</P>
<P>
   There's a haunting power to Lester's last narrative note to the
viewer: that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what
really matters, someday you will.
</P>
<P>

COURT REVIVES CALIFORNIA MARIJUANA LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB and EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal appeals court has ruled that seriously
ill patients may have the right to use marijuana for medicinal
purposes despite federal narcotics laws.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco told a
federal judge on Monday to review his 1998 order that closed the
Cannabis Cultivators Club in San Francisco, the Oakland Cannabis
Buyers' Cooperative and other Northern California clubs, and to
consider an exemption for patients who face immediate harm without
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Though it will not immediately open the doors of marijuana
clubs, the ruling constitutes a victory for patients who say
marijuana is the only drug that will ease their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Dennis Peron, founder of the Cannabis
Cultivators Club and author of the 1996 ballot initiative,
Proposition 215, that legalized medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal government may be moving toward the
realization that availability of medical cannabis is a
life-and-death issue for some users.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reviews U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's decision
last year to shut down the Cannabis Cultivators Club in San
Francisco and several other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``has yet to identify any interest it may have in
blocking the distribution of marijuana to those with medical
needs,'' and ``has offered no evidence to rebut (a marijuana
club's) evidence that cannabis is the only effective treatment for
a large group of seriously ill individuals,'' the court said in a
3-0 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision, the judges appear to recognize the ``medical
necessity'' defense for federal marijuana prosecutions, which says
a person can violate the law when it is the only way to prevent a
greater harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we have a clear ruling that the federal
Controlled Substances Act is not an absolute bar to the
distribution of medical cannabis,'' said Gerald Uelmen, a Santa
Clara University law professor and lawyer for the Oakland Cannabis
Buyers' Cooperative, which was the appellant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has maintained that no claim of necessity
can justify the use of a drug that is classified by Congress to be
among the most dangerous substances, with no approved medical
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Avram Goldstein, professor emeritus of pharmacology at Stanford
University, said the issue of marijuana for medical purposes should
be left for science, not the courts, to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think judges ought to get into the medical
business,'' Goldstein said. ``They don't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 215, approved by California voters in 1996, allowed
patients to legally possess and grow marijuana for a variety of
medical conditions, including the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and cancer, if recommended by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But the initiative clashed with federal laws against
distributing the drug, and the Justice Department sued six Northern
California clubs. Breyer issued an injunction in May 1998 barring
the clubs from distributing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Club lawyers presented their ``necessity'' defense to Breyer a
few days after that ruling, but he rejected the argument, and the
clubs appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling sends the defense back to Breyer, asking him to
reconsider.

   NEW YORK _ With the unveiling of its new Times Square studio,
and with as much promotion as ABC could put behind it, ``Good
Morning America'' did stir up some reaction in its first edition
from that studio on Monday morning. The program's ratings were up
about 15 percent from the usual level, a solid indication that the
network got the extra attention it was hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest stir, or at least the most noticeable,
probably came from the time period's big shot, NBC's ``Today,''
which staged a little stunt of its own in Times Square on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The moment the new ``Good Morning America'' came on the air,
NBC, which owns the rights to the large video screen on 1 Times
Square down the street, switched from its usual morning format of
NBC promotions and paid advertisements and displayed the live
picture from the ``Today'' program. That meant that NBC's morning
stars, Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, were being displayed right
outside ABC's big new picture window.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said they did not even notice what NBC was doing
because their main view looks north, and the giant video screen is
just to the south. But it certainly did mean that any of the fans
of ``Good Morning America'' who were enticed to line up outside the
new studio were treated to big pictures of ``Today'' to remind them
who is still No. 1 in the morning. And it will continue to mean
that, because NBC will display ``Today'' every morning on that big
screen indefinitely, said Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of
``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he made the decision to requisition the Times Square
video screen from CNBC, the business-news cable channel owned by
NBC, and the network's promotion department. He said it involved
``no revenue loss at all'' to the network.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Zucker did it: ``It was totally for fun,'' he said
Tuesday. ``What can I say? I get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' has been No. 1 in the morning for five years. The
ratings boost for ``Good Morning America'' on Monday, at least,
looks to be no threat to that dominance. The ratings for ``Today''
were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   CBS will unveil its revamped morning program in November, with
Bryant Gumbel and the newcomer Jane Clayson as hosts. It will have
a Manhattan street view, too, in the plaza overlooking the entrance
to Central Park at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker did not say if he had any plans for that premiere, like
displaying ``Today'' on televisions in the windows of the Plaza
Hotel across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people saying it's a war in the morning,'' Zucker
said. ``It's not a war. It's television. This was just a little
tweak.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Whose Time Is It?
</P>
<P>
   When one of the season's new shows gets yanked off the air
before the television season even starts, it usually means that the
network thought the show was so awful it engaged in a mercy
killing.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC executives swear that is not the case with ``Then Came
You,'' a new comedy that had been scheduled for Thursday nights at
8:30, starting on Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has pulled it off the air, but more to protect the show than
the viewers, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which is about a woman in her mid-30s living in a
hotel and having a romance with a room-service waiter in his 20s,
was promising, an ABC executive said, but the network schedulers
had rethought Thursdays, having seen how well back-to-back episodes
of the improvisational sketch series ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
were doing on that night this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Line,'' which stars Drew Carey, is apparently able to
produce as many episodes as ABC wants, and at a price far lower
than that of a sitcom, which requires sets and writers. So ABC
decided to stick with double runs of ``Whose Line'' on Thursdays,
shelving ``Then Came You'' until mid-season.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive close to the production of the sitcom said ABC
was also concerned about the comedies, like ``Oh Grow Up'' and
``It's Like You Know,'' that it has scheduled between hit shows on
Tuesday and Wednesday. The network may need a comedy to go into one
of those spots, the executive said.
</P>

<P>
   First-Person Plural
</P>
<P>
   All four nights of ABC's news magazine ``20/20'' will look
different this fall, but the biggest change will be seen on
Thursdays. On that night, dominated in recent years by NBC's
``ER''-anchored lineup, the program will be called ``20/20
Downtown'' and will feature correspondents roving far afield to
tell first-person stories. To conjure up an imaginary example: John
Miller, well known for reports on organized crime, might take
viewers to the scenes of some of his reporting and recount how he
learned what he did.
</P>
<P>
   An example has to be imagined because Victor Neufeld, the
executive producer, is not yet ready to say what sorts of reports
or even what locations are being pursued, except that they will be
outside the studio and often outside New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `downtown' element is more a state of mind,'' he said
Tuesday, ``a getting away from the traditional places. It's based
on a desire to try something a little different, a little more
distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   The other editions of ``20/20'' will still originate in the
studio, but all the anchor assignments have changed. Jack Ford,
newly hired from NBC, will join Connie Chung on Mondays. Charles
Gibson (who had been paired with Ms. Chung) will take over Sam
Donaldson's chair on Wednesdays with Diane Sawyer. And now that
Hugh Downs has retired, Barbara Walters will go it alone on
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   What of Donaldson? He will remain a correspondent and substitute
anchor for ``20/20,'' will keep his co-host role with Cokie Roberts
on the Sunday morning interview program ``This Week'' and will be
ABC News' chief national correspondent (no longer chief White House
correspondent).
</P>
<P>
   He is also adding a new role: three days a week he will
broadcast a live 15-minute news report on the Internet
(SamDonaldson(AT)abcnews.com), at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. It will be available as streamed
video, for those whose computers have that option, as well as audio
and text.

</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, the former U.S. education secretary who has
become a self-appointed pollution monitor for the nation's movie,
music and television industries, and Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., held a news conference in Washington Tuesday to express
their outrage over two new Fox series, ``Action'' and ``Get Real.''
They gave their third Silver Sewer Award, a laurel they invented to
dishonor people whom Bennett and Lieberman perceive as purveyors of
cultural filth, to Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., which
owns Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Already the most talked-about new show of the fall season for
its sexual subject matter and bleep-mouthed dialogue, ``Action''
has its premiere Thursday night at 9:30. A cynic would have to
surmise that the cast, producers, studio and network were privately
delighted about the timing of Bennett and Lieberman. What better
way to whip up curiosity about a show _ especially among the young
adult viewers Fox desires _ than to proclaim the show vulgar,
shocking and bordering on indecent?

   Odyssey Channel has only 29 million subscribers, but one of its

Kermit the Frog. Concerned that parents do not know how to use the
V-chip blocking devices now being added as required equipment on
all new televisions, Henson and Odyssey have made Kermit the
national spokes-frog for a V-chip awareness campaign of public
service announcements, which Odyssey will permit all cable system
operators to use.

 &HT;    Buchwald goes public about depression
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist Art Buchwald endured
two major depressions, in 1963 and 1987. Both times, he was
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, he recovered to go on being funny.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald, 73, now speaks publicly about his past depression, to
encourage others going through mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   As the featured speaker of the Rosalynn Carter Distinguished
Lecture in Mental Health Journalism, Buchwald will discuss his
ordeal tonight (WEDNESDAY) at the Carter Center in Atlanta. The
lecture is open to the public, but seats are no longer available.
For more information, call 404-614-3765.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Lillian Lee Kim spoke
earlier this week with Buchwald.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why did you decide to talk publicly about your depression, a
subject many people consider taboo?
</P>
<P>
   A:I went on the Larry King show and talked about depression,
along with Mike Wallace. It was the most successful reaction
Larry's ever had to a show. It turns out so many people have had
depression, and were so happy to hear about it from someone who
isn't a doctor. They're grateful I've talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Carters asked me to do (the lecture) and I'm big
admirers of theirs, so I agreed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   People are worried about the stigma involved with depression.
Let's say someone's up for promotion, and it comes up that they had
a depression.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Have you ever personally encountered that stigma?
</P>
<P>
   A:I haven't, because I managed to turn whatever was going on
with me into humor. And I've never been up for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Did you ever seriously consider suicide?
</P>
<P>
   A:Oh, sure. I didn't do it because I was afraid I wouldn't get
in The New York Times obituaries. With my luck, General de Gaulle
would die that day.
</P>
<P>
   See, there's humor in everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What advice would you give those now battling depression?
</P>
<P>
   A:My message is that you do get over it. You get over it, and
you're a better person. You go through an awful lot very fast. It
would take you 10 years, if you didn't have a depression, to go
through all the skeletons in your closet.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fight it alone. There now are many, many organizations
where you can get help. You have to get help. Because you can't
make it alone, I don't think.
</P>
<P>
   You can't be afraid to admit to people that you have depression.
This is the part that is tough on people. We've come a long way
with that. We're not there yet, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Are you worried your depression might return someday?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. I think I'm prepared for it. I sure as hell don't want to
go there again.

 &HT;    Artists find gallery in new children's garden
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 16.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You expect a children's garden to be overrun with
neon-colored displays and wacky sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at the Atlanta Botanical Garden's new two-acre
kiddie attraction reveals some sophisticated artwork, crafted by
area artisans using forged steel, stainless steel and limestone.
The $3 million Children's Heathcare of Atlanta Children's Garden,
which opens to the public Friday, features sculptural pieces by
three artists:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Andrew Crawford, entry gates:
</P>
<P>
   Here's one artist who knows how to sell his work.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Crawford designed a steel gate containing images
of gardening tools and was later asked to show it at the
Southeastern Flower Show. The piece caught the eye of botanical
garden staff members, who asked him to suggest a piece for the
garden's entry. ``I came back with an 8-foot drawing,'' Crawford
said. ``The presentation cost me a bunch of money, but I felt it
was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crawford, 29, the forged-steel gates, 27 feet wide by 12
feet tall, would become his most important project to date. It took
the artist more than four months to craft the 6-ton piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought a lot about how I wanted the gates to be seen now as
well as down the road,'' he said. ``What I didn't want was for my
first public installation to be fashionable. I wanted it to be
ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   He came up with a design influenced by forms in nature but
without being specific to flowers, leaves and other trendy garden
elements. ``I feel it hit the nail on the head,'' said the native
Atlantan, who studied sculpture at the Rhode Island School of
Design.
</P>
<P>
   For Crawford, a professional artist for seven years, the project
became more than just another commission, especially the day he
installed it. ``To be honest, at that moment I felt I would have
done those gates for free,'' he said. ``There was so much
involvement from the community. I'm out there sweating and tired,
having been up all night the night before worrying about it, and
the people got me so fired up. Everybody seemed really proud.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  David Landis, Butterfly Pavilion:
</P>
<P>
   Who says butterflies are dainty little creatures? Atlanta
sculptor David Landis, 34, turned to stainless steel when he was
selected to design a butterfly pavilion for the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, a steel pergola with a stainless steel butterfly
sculpture perched on its roof and comparable butterflies for gates,
is part of an exhibit on the life cycle of the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The project took Landis 10 months to complete. ``The butterfly
is all fabricated, as opposed to being cast and all stainless,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Its 10-foot wingspan changes color depending on the light
reflecting on the stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   The award-winning artist, who teaches sculpture at Georgia State
University, had done large pieces for the 1996 Summer Olympics but
never for a public garden.

<P>
   ``For years, I had this naive notion that the botanical garden
was one of those places you just kind of go out and see,'' Landis
said. ``Now to see it expanding into a garden that children can
actually experience, it's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Christopher Condon, the Green Man:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Condon knows how to make an entrance. The artist, known
for his whimsical pieces, was commissioned to design a wall
sculpture from Indiana limestone of the Green Man, the mythological
guardian of gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of creating a realistic depiction of the legendary
figure, Condon _ remembering his audience _ crafted a playful face
that beckons children across the bridge and into the garden.
</P>
<P>
   And, with water spewing from its face, this Green Man draws a
crowd. The face contains not only leaves but also a bird and bird's
nest perched on its head.
</P>
<P>
   Condon, who moved to Atlanta from Massachusetts four years ago,
earned a degree in sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design
and studied in Rome for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved down (Atlanta) here because I knew the garden industry
was bigger here because of the climate,'' said Condon, 26.
</P>
<P>
   The children's garden provided him with further evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The children's garden grand opening is 9 a.m.-7 p.m. today for
members, Friday-Sunday for the public. Free with regular garden
admission: $7 adults; $5 seniors; $4 children 3 and older. Parking:
Only at Ansley Mall for shuttles. 404-876-5859.

 &HT;    Buchwald goes public about depression
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist Art Buchwald endured
two major depressions, in 1963 and 1987. Both times, he was
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, he recovered to go on being funny.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald, 73, now speaks publicly about his past depression, to
encourage others going through mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   As the featured speaker of the Rosalynn Carter Distinguished
Lecture in Mental Health Journalism, Buchwald will discuss his
ordeal tonight (WEDNESDAY) at the Carter Center in Atlanta. The
lecture is open to the public, but seats are no longer available.
For more information, call 404-614-3765.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Lillian Lee Kim spoke
earlier this week with Buchwald.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why did you decide to talk publicly about your depression, a
subject many people consider taboo?
</P>
<P>
   A:I went on the Larry King show and talked about depression,
along with Mike Wallace. It was the most successful reaction
Larry's ever had to a show. It turns out so many people have had
depression, and were so happy to hear about it from someone who
isn't a doctor. They're grateful I've talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Carters asked me to do (the lecture) and I'm big
admirers of theirs, so I agreed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   People are worried about the stigma involved with depression.
Let's say someone's up for promotion, and it comes up that they had
a depression.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Have you ever personally encountered that stigma?
</P>
<P>
   A:I haven't, because I managed to turn whatever was going on
with me into humor. And I've never been up for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Did you ever seriously consider suicide?
</P>
<P>
   A:Oh, sure. I didn't do it because I was afraid I wouldn't get
in The New York Times obituaries. With my luck, General de Gaulle
would die that day.
</P>
<P>
   See, there's humor in everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What advice would you give those now battling depression?
</P>
<P>
   A:My message is that you do get over it. You get over it, and
you're a better person. You go through an awful lot very fast. It
would take you 10 years, if you didn't have a depression, to go
through all the skeletons in your closet.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fight it alone. There now are many, many organizations
where you can get help. You have to get help. Because you can't
make it alone, I don't think.
</P>
<P>
   You can't be afraid to admit to people that you have depression.
This is the part that is tough on people. We've come a long way
with that. We're not there yet, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Are you worried your depression might return someday?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. I think I'm prepared for it. I sure as hell don't want to
go there again.

 &HT;    Cocooning consumers zoom in on home theaters at action-packed
pace
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 16.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As if Jim Carrey's mouth weren't big enough, imagine
it as a 3-foot expanse plastered across a wall in your home. A
curling tongue that grabs you with a reach farther than Ally
McBeal's. Music so jarring you'd think a boombox was planted
beneath your feet.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, if you want to get naked, go for it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you're having a film experience within the privacy of
your own home _ and without having to fork out seven bucks for a
ticket and even more for popcorn, Goobers and Raisinettes.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters, once limited to mansions of the well-to-do, are now
appearing in homes near you _ those of middle-class consumers
spending anywhere from $2,000 for a simple 27-inch TV, VCR and
recliner to $300,000 for a state-of-the-art system with 9-foot
screen, Dolby sound, DVD player and theater-style seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a home theater is whatever makes you feel involved and
engrossed in a film,'' said Randy Massey of Electronic Home
Consultants, an Atlanta home theater designer.
</P>
<P>
   One in five households has a home theater system, according to
the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, at an average
cost of $3,500. A survey of home buyers by Builder magazine found
that, given a choice of a theater, study or extra bedroom, the
majority would opt for a theater.
</P>
<P>
   That's because as demand has grown, the cost of electronics has
come down in recent years. The $10 billion home theater and home
automation industry is growing so fast that deliveries for
custom-order amenities such as theater seating can take six months.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more baby boomers are staying at home _
especially as technology advances, yielding sound systems that
surpass the quality in commercial theaters and high-definition TVs
that provide filmlike images.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the holiday retail season heats up, who are these
cinematic groupies willing to plunk down as much money for a
theater as some do for a house?
</P>
<P>
   Most are high-end consumers for whom theaters, like pools and
home gyms, have become a status symbol. Some are die-hard movie
buffs, while others prefer to entertain friends with beer and
popcorn rather than champagne and canapes. Still others are parents
who have discovered a convenient means for keeping teens at home _
or in Jim and Susan Anderson's case, for luring them back.
</P>
<P>
   The two were struck by one thought last year while watching
Massey demonstrate equipment they would end up buying: ``He put on
a DVD of 'Twister,' and it was so spectacular I said if I were to
do anything like this in our home, the boys would move back home,''
Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   He was partially right. Their son, Blake Morley, is back at
home, enjoying the theater Mom and Dad built in the basement of
their Brookhaven home. The 16-by-20 room is the center of an
entertainment level that begins with a wet bar and pair of wine
cellars designed in an European feel. Visitors enter a small lobby
through 150-year-old doors salvaged from an Indonesian temple
before settling into the 12-seat theater.
</P>
<P>
   Not all theaters are so elaborate. The typical job for Music
Masters is a 32-inch TV, receiver system and speakers, totaling
$3,000 to $5,000. ``Popcorn machines, seating and lighting are a
whole other budget,'' owner Chris Keeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best results come from a room dedicated for a theater, not
anything else,'' he said. ``Often, people will set up a sound
system in a room where the fireplace is the focal point, and they
try to hide all the electronics. We call that 'technological
denial.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the costs. So what are the basic components of the
typical home theater? A large-screen TV or movie screen, a video
projector system, a surround-sound system with multiple speakers
and, as digital video discs, touting high-quality sound, become
mass marketed, a DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   For a quality entry-level system, expect to spend at least
$10,000, said Massey, whose business specializes in high-end screen
theaters. Construction costs also weigh in. Acoustical panels,
necessary for delivering quality sound insulated from the rest of
the house, average $8,000. And, by the time they've spent that
much, most consumers want to be pampered by the right atmosphere.
The big ticket among decorating costs is seating, which can range
from $350 to $1,000 per seat for custom-built loungers, Massey
said. (That doesn't include cocktail tables, rope floor lighting,
carpeting, microwaves, small refrigerators and other amenities.)
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, then, for a 10-12-seat theater can easily reach
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Robin Cutshaw, who spent three years researching and
planning for electronics before renovating his basement, installing
a theater is much like building a home; the costs nearly always
exceed budget. His advice: ``Double your budget. You'll constantly
hear, 'For $3,000 more, you can get this or that,''' the
Morningside resident said.
</P>
<P>
   But if that budget is limited, get the best electronics you can
for your money, said Terry Massey, Randy's wife and business
partner. ``It doesn't work to put so much of your money into the
decor until there's not enough left for the electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding bells, whistles. The costs for retrofitting a house for
a theater aren't much more than for new construction, depending on
how complicated it is to wire an older home,Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   For Doug Candler and Craig Dick, the renovations to their
basement proved a little more extensive. ``It was quite a
transformation,'' Candler said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a theater required raising the basement ceiling and
building a platform for elevating seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is we can't use the theater during parties
because the living room is directly overhead,'' said Candler, a
videographer. ``When someone walks across the floor, the projector
jiggles.''
</P>
<P>
   But one advantage to the location were closets, which proved
ideal for storing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-by-24 room is ideal dimensionally. The rule of thumb,
Keeler said, is that theaters should be rectangular with a length
at least 1 1/2 times the width.
</P>
<P>
   Screen width should be four to seven times the number of feet
between it and the seats. Massey's most popular size is 110 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Because of sound, most theaters are placed in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   On the terrace level of their new home, Sandy Hartman and Suzi
Berliner blended a theater with an entire entertainment area,
complete with sectional sofa, wet bar and nostalgic pieces such as
a 1940s candy machine and old drive-in speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners, in creating the total film experience, have
taken theaters so far as to include built-in ticket booths and
popcorn machines. Yet, most are simply concerned with what's on the
screen, designers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people are pretty happy with just a couple of
comfy chairs,'' Keeler said. ``You can always do microwave
popcorn.''

 &HT;    Gardens plot their future with children
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some childhood experiences you don't forget _ catching
fireflies and putting them in a jar, popping a muscadine in your
mouth and sucking the pulp from its skin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the closest many children come to experiencing nature is
what they read in their science textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing, though, as public gardens around the country
develop programs that not only expose future generations to the
joys of plants but, on a more practical level, to generate more
income from admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If children have no appreciation for nature, public gardens
won't be around one day,'' said Jane Taylor, former curator of
Michigan State University's 4-H Children's Garden, the first of its
kind when it opened in East Lansing in 1992. ``Gardens are finally
realizing they need to cater to a broader audience. Until now,
children have been bored with what they see there because there's
been nothing to relate the plants to their everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting kids interested in nature takes more than showing them
how to plant seeds, so gardens are turning to fun, interactive
themed exhibits. At the Atlanta Botanical Garden, which opens its
$3 million children's garden this week, the message is wellness, or
how humans depend on plants for improving their mind, body and
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's gardening is no longer just activities. There's a
lot of art involved and obviously a lot of science, as well as
music, meteorology, bird watching, literature,'' said Sharon
Lovejoy, a nationally acclaimed children's gardening author and
consultant. ``Atlanta is definitely cutting edge in doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Children's Garden also
is unique in its genesis. The former Egleston Scottish Rite Health
Care System was seeking a means to take its wellness message to the
community. At the same time, the Atlanta Botanical Garden was
searching for new sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a match meant to be,'' said Tracey Atwater, special
projects director for Children's Healthcare's fund-raising
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Tough rows to hoe
</P>
<P>
   The children's hospital initially was concerned that a
fund-raising campaign for a garden might dilute community support.
``But we had an amazing response,'' Atwater said. ``Eight
individuals literally funded the entire garden.''
</P>
<P>
   And that support couldn't have come at a better time for the
botanical garden, as it launched a five-year $15 million expansion.
A children's garden topped its list of priorities because of the
potential to increase the nonprofit organization's membership _ its
bread and butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is designed to help get entire families into the garden
because you're hitting a larger audience with teachers,
grandparents _ not just children,'' said Cindy Tyler of
Environmental Planning and Design, the Pittsburgh landscape
architecture firm that designed the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The garden's wellness theme, believed the only one of its kind
in the country, proved a real challenge. ``We had to think
carefully how children would get that message in a way that's fun
and makes them want to come back repeatedly,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a time line of how plants, from the prehistoric age to the
present, contribute to good health, designers created a series of
exhibits that teach pre-schoolers to children age 11, how plants
help them ``live, laugh and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The pathway to the garden wasn't without its obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The first was safety. The 2-acre site, fronting Piedmont Road,
was separated from the main garden by the entry road. Architect Jim
Winer of Menefee &AMP; Winer came up with an arbored ``Flower Bridge,''
lined with planters spilling with annuals, as a smooth transition
between the two gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another challenge was keeping the botanical garden open during
construction,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction delays postponed the garden's spring planting until
June and July, when the weather is hot. ``It was tough planting at
that time of year,'' said grounds supervisor Tom Harvey, who
suffered heat stroke during the project. ``But having a wet June
really saved our lives,'' given that a drought followed.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a tree dilemma. A large treehouse was planned for
a pair of 130-year-old red oaks, but some feared construction would
harm the trees. So the Woodland Treehouse was reduced to a
free-standing structure in the shadow of the stately oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the next challenge could be maintenance. Garden
horticulturist Mildred Pinnell said the staff chose ``tough
plants'' that not only feature brightly colored flowers, ideal for
attracting butterflies, but also hold up well to the rigors of
little feet prone to wander.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know which direction kids will take,'' Harvey said.
``But we can't be as strict as we are in the (main) garden about
staying on the pathways and picking flowers. This needs to be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a lucrative niche. Fun is what a children's garden is
all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key ingredients are that it be interactive and small
scale,'' said Cindy Reittinger, the garden's education director.
</P>
<P>
   Once hooked, children are more eager to learn about nature.
``People across the country are really concerned how out of touch
kids are with the earth. They're saying we've got to do something
to fuel their interest,'' said Lovejoy, who, in her latest book,
``Roots, Shoots, Buckets and Boots'' (Workman Publishing, $13.95),
advocates gardening as an experience to be shared by parents,
grandparents and children.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, parents say, Atlanta is short on outdoor sites
for family outings. ``There's a huge need for small-scale
activities that younger kids and parents can share,'' said Jennifer
Spring, touring the garden with 2-year-old Anna during last month's
member preview.
</P>
<P>
   Public gardens are responding by zeroing in on a lucrative niche
that not only boosts attendance but memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Just one year after opening its Discovery Garden in 1995, the
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Pittsburgh increased
its attendance some 150 percent, Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, it's up an average 3 percent weekly, which it
attributes to posting staff in the garden to answer visitors'
questions. ``We found that the more interactive things we did, the
more people came,'' education director Robert Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Docents and some staff will be on hand at Atlanta children's
garden, said Julie Herron Carson, marketing director for the
botanical garden. There, attendance has held steady the past three
years at about 200,000, So has membership, at 10,000, ``but we're
really expecting that to jump with the opening of the children's
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the garden recently raised its
admission prices for both children and adults by $1. Supporters
contend the increase, the first in eight years, is a small price to
pay for giving children a foundation for an appreciating nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get them drawn in here, we can tell them why we're so
concerned about the environment,'' said Reittinger, pausing by the
Soggy Bog, an exhibit that emphasizes conservation. ``So many kids
learn about the rain forest in school, but they don't even realize
there are endangered plants right here in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing is believing.

   HURRICANE-FLOYD (Orlando, Fla.) _ Authorities urged nearly 2
million people to evacuate coastal areas stretching from Florida to
North Carolina on Tuesday as Hurricane Floyd, one of the most
powerful storms to ever threaten the United States, roared through

an examination of police misconduct files that the Public Advocate,

 &HT;    Y2K TRAVEL COULD BE ROUGH IN RUSSIA, CHINA, INDIA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Americans travelling to dozens of foreign
countries in late December and early January could be faced with
potential power outages, water shortages, transportation shutdowns
or other problems because of Y2K computer disruptions, the U.S.
State Department said Tuesday in an unprecedented advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Among major nations, the most potentially dangerous places
include Russia, China and India, according to the department's
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than warn Americans not to travel to certain
countries, the State Department assessed each of 196 countries to
determine whether they are fixing the so-called Y2K computer bug.
The evaluations, alphabetically listed on the Internet at
www.travel.state.gov, ``will help Americans make their own
decisions,'' said Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
   The department's refusal to rank countries according to the
severity of computer problems reflected the diplomatic delicacy of
task. Many countries would have reacted negatively if they had been
condemned to a sort of ``top ten losers'' list, which might have
discouraged tourism and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to resist finger-pointing prompted a rebuke from
Sen. Robert Bennett, (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate special
committee on Y2K, who issued a statement saying ``the State
Department report barely scratches the surface of serious Y2K
problems facing many countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett warned that ``if the State Department...is withholding
information from the public for fear of creating panic, the
information vacuum this helps create may result in the very panic
they are striving to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the State Department did not issue grades or rankings,
it did hand out some critical assessments. For Russia, the
department predicted that ``Y2K disruptions are likely to occur in
key sectors of electrical power, heat, telecommunications,
transportation, and financial and emergency services.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, operators of power plants and ocean ports ``have been
slow to address the Y2K issue,'' the report said. In China, ``there
may be a risk of potential disruption in the key sectors of banking
and finance, telecommunications, medical services and in electrical
power and infrastructure systems outside of the coastal cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which has been cited by many Y2K experts as being
particularly sluggish in its software repairs, was treated
gingerly. The country, which has expressed concern about being
named as a Y2K laggard, is expecting a surge in tourism in December
as Catholics come to celebrate their church's 2000th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. assessment said ``Italy will lower the risks of
potential Y2K disruptions with greater progress in remediation and
contingency planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any country will lower its risks if it makes greater
progress against the Y2K bug, a programming flaw which can cause
older computers to misunderstand dates after Jan. 1, 2000,
triggering malfunctions in the equipment used to generate power,
control air traffic, deliver water and much more.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream experts on Y2K now expect no catastrophic system
failures in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and most other
technologically advanced countries. But some poorer countries are
in bad shape. For example, Bosnia has ``a high risk of potential
disruption in key sectors, including telecommunications, banking
and finance,'' the State Department said, and Ukraine is so
``unprepared'' for Y2K that it faces possible disruptions in all
key sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Y2K assessments are limited to a paragraph or
two on each of the ``information sheets'' routinely issued for 196
countries. Travel agents and tourists use these ``sheets'' as
primary sources of information to evaluate risks to health and
safety overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for many travelers, the Y2K advisories have been
added long after many New Year's Eve trips were booked. Dina Long,
spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Agents, said the
trade group would urge its members to contact travelers now to
share the Y2K information. ``We give a lot of credence to their
(the State Department's) reports,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many travelers will ignore the warnings, predicted Maria
Ufret, a travel agent with 206 Tours in Smithtown, N.Y., a firm
specializing in trips to Rome and Vatican City. ``We always pass
along any advisory from the State Department,'' she said. But this
particular news may have little impact because so many Americans
believe Y2K threats are overblown, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making more of the issue than they should,'' Ufret
said of Y2K experts. So far, her customers have expressed ``no
concern whatsoever'' about disruptions on Jan. 1.

SENATOR TIES FATE OF PUERTO RICO NAVY BASE TO REOPENING VIEQUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The struggle over a U.S. military target range in
Puerto Rico turned into political hardball Tuesday when a member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee threatened to eliminate a $300
million-a-year Navy base in Puerto Rico unless local authorities
allow resumption of target practice on the nearby island of
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee's panel on military readiness, said would push
to shift duties from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto
Rico to military bases on the U.S. mainland unless Puerto Rico's
political leaders permit the Navy and the Marine Corps to resume
combat training on a 58-year-old training range on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt Roads base is a cherished ``crown jewel'' in the
Puerto Rican economy and is widely supported by local political
leaders, Inhofe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they don't want to lose that,'' Inhofe said. ``But
we're looking at a package deal: If the Navy loses the target range
on Vieques, Puerto Rico would lose Roosevelt Roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe said other locations in the United States would be glad
to take on functions currently handled at Roosevelt Roads, adding:
``We're working to break down the functions carried out at
Roosevelt Roads and finding logical homes for those functions back
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe has scheduled a hearing of his Senate subcommittee for
next Wednesday to explore his proposal. Rep. Herbert Bateman,
R-Va., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's panel on
military readiness, has also scheduled a hearing on the military
impact of suspended combat training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings will be the first full-blown congressional
inquiries into a politically charged dispute over the island of
Vieques that involves the White House, Congress, the Pentagon and
the political fortunes of candidates courting Hispanic political
support, including First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in her
exploratory U.S. Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Roads, a sprawling 8,600-acre installation with nine
piers and an 11,000-foot runway, devotes 85 percent of its annual
workload to supporting Navy and Marine Corps training operations on
Vieques and in adjacent waters.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.2 billion base employs almost 5,000 personnel, including
2,500 civilians. Roberto C. Nelson, a base spokesman, said the
installation pumps $300 million a year into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   But operations at Roosevelt Roads have been reduced since the
Navy suspended combat-style training on Vieques in April after a
Marine Corps' pilot mistakenly dropped two 500-pound bombs more
than a mile off target at the Vieques range, killing a Puerto Rican
security guard and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
   With Puerto Rican public opinion strongly opposed to continued
U.S. use of the Vieques target range, President Clinton has ordered
a high-level Pentagon search for options that would address Puerto
Rican opposition to live-fire training and, at the same time,
enable the Navy and Marines to continue to have an Atlantic-coast
site to carry out land, sea and air combat training.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Cdr. Herman Phillips, a spokesman at Navy headquarters
at the Pentagon, said the Navy has not determined the impact on
operations at Roosevelt Roads if Clinton orders a permanent halt to
target practice at Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Before training was suspended in April, the military used a
899-acre bombing range, an 11,000-acre maneuver range and an 8,000
acre ammunition depot on the island. Some 9,300 civilians live on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still hopeful for a mutually agreeable resolution to
the situation,'' Phillips said. If the president permanently ends
military training on Vieques, the Navy would then review operations
at Roosevelt Roads, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in Puerto Rico, led by Gov. Pedro Rossello,
and allies in Congress led by Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., are
demanding a permanent end to military training on Vieques and the
phased Navy withdrawal from the island.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe said he has discussed his plan with key Republican
lawmakers whose congressional districts already host major Navy and
Marine Corps installations.
</P>
<P>
   Those consulted include Bateman, whose congressional district
includes the Atlantic Fleet headquarters at Norfolk, Va; Rep. Randy
Cunningham, R-Calif., whose district includes the Miramar Naval Air
Station; and Rep. Tilly Fowler, R-Fla., whose district includes
constituents at the Naval Air Station at Jacksonville, Fla., and
the Navy port at Mayport, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're excited about the possibility of their bases taking on
more responsibilities,'' Inhofe said.

reason for being at Roosevelt Roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Bateman said he would await congressional hearings and a
Pentagon decision before endorsing the closure of Roosevelt Roads.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the other lawmakers contacted by Inhofe said the
members of Congress were receptive.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Pope, a spokeswoman for Cunningham, said that while
``dismantling Roosevelt Roads would not be our first choice, if the
people of Puerto Rico indicate hostility to the Navy, we need to
look at all the options and that certainly includes taking a look
at dismantling Roosevelt Roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Klein, who serves as Fowler's legislative director, said
the congresswoman would support efforts to move some of Roosevelt
Roads' functions to installations in the United States, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roosevelt Roads is a staging and support facility for training
on Vieques,'' Klein said. ``If Roosevelt Roads doesn't have a
reason to exist, I'm sure the congresswoman would sign up 100
percent to move those assets back here where they would be
appreciated.''

 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE COMPLETE STORIES OF EVELYN WAUGH'' &QL; 
(Little, Brown, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His style,'' said Edmund Wilson, ``has the desperate
jauntiness of an orchestra fiddling away for dear life on a sinking
ship.'' Evelyn Waugh was wicked and funny, and his fellow writers
were happy to apply the same tactics to him. Here are his works of
short fiction, 39 stories collected for the first time in hardcover
for American readers (the book was adapted from a scholarly edition
published last year in Great Britain). They include ``By Special
Request,'' in which Waugh suggests an alternative ending to his
novel, ``A Handful of Dust,'' and ``Charles Ryder's Schooldays,'' a
chapter in the life of the hero of ``Brideshead Revisited,''
published 16 years after Waugh's death. To coincide with this
volume, Back Bay Books has reissued ``Brideshead Revisited,''
``Decline and Fall,'' ``Vile Bodies,'' ``A Handful of Dust'' and
``Scoop'' in paperback. The books are like Waugh himself _
handsome, with viciously funny stories inside. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME'' &QL; 
By Pam Houston (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is a LOT more about her, and it is dumbfoundingly
interesting. Houston does nothing, really, except talk about
herself in these essays, yet unlike her filmed recitations for
television's ``Sunday Morning,'' these monologues pull you in, and
before you know it, you've stayed for the duration. Maybe it's the
swagger in what she has to say, the stockpile of experience, the
competence at things that are foreign to many women, and many men,
for that matter. If you've read her short-story collections
(``Cowboys Are My Weakness,'' ``Waltzing the Cat''), you know that
Houston is on intimate terms with adventure, with wilderness, with
danger, and with difficult men who thrive on all three. She has
been a hunting guide in the mountains of Alaska, and she has run so
many white-water rivers in so many countries that she can't
remember them all. She was addicted to risk for a long time, but
she's getting over it. She has a ranch now, and is learning to call
it her own. Finally, she has good friends and, it seems, a
boyfriend who goes against type. In one of these essays she takes
him winter camping and he admits that he has never slept on the
ground before. What's amazing is that she doesn't hold it against
him. Her essays are about mountains, rivers, horses, dogs, hunters
and _ we sure didn't see this one coming _ her lifelong obsession
with her weight. ``Even to this day,'' she writes, ``call me stupid
and I'll laugh in your face; call me a bad writer and I'll discuss
art with you all day long; but call me fat and you'll send me
sobbing to the bathroom, and I'll wear tent dresses for the next
six days.'' It might be the most ordinary thing we've ever heard
about Pam Houston. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BEST SHOTS: THE GREATEST NFL PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(DK, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at Barry Sanders on Page 70,'' writes Joe Namath
in his foreword. ``Just look at his feet, his legs, his body
movement, his motion _ how his body weight is leaning so hard to
one side. Look at that right foot of his! And he's still going at
full speed, you know, he's not falling down. I mean, he's exploding
somewhere.'' It's true, you'll be impressed. Sanders, photographed
in 1995 by Allen Kee, is cutting so hard that his body is hanging
out over thin air and the twist of his pivot foot has distorted the
leather of his shoe _ AND HE'S NOT FALLING DOWN. Or look at Lynn
Swann on Page 84, making, in 1976, one of the most spectacular
catches in Super Bowl history. Or at Terry Glenn, turning to draw
in a Drew Bledsoe pass that has just emerged from a dense fog that
hides anything more than a few feet above the field. Or at
linebacker Chuck Bednarik celebrating over the prostrate form of
Frank Gifford, who looks like road kill in a helmet. There's lots
of drama here, but our favorite is a quiet photograph that puts the
others to shame. It shows, quite simply, Walter Payton running a
path created for him by his Chicago Bears teammates. It's an
understated moment that reveals football at its best _ the
precision teamwork, the finesse, the choreography of the game.
(That's the Giants' Mark Ingram on the book jacket, celebrating in
the end zone.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LISTEN TO THIS!'' &QL; 
By Alan Reder and John Baxter (Hyperion, $16.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reder and Baxter spent four years interviewing popular musicians
about their favorite artists and recordings. The result is this
volume, which offers educated and honest opinions (Dave Matthews
says he listens to Keith Jarrett's album, ``The Koln Concert,''
because ``it calms me down, like watching windshield wipers'')
about today's music from some of the people who know it best. The
Beatles are mentioned more than any other group or artist. Other
favorites include James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams, Muddy
Waters, the Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Otis Redding, Elvis
Presley, Charlie Parker, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Jimi Hendrix,
Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, Lightnin' Hopkins, Ray Charles and
Bob Dylan. But not all of the names are famous, so it's possible to
discover new territory for your own listening pleasure. The authors
note, for example, that Dave Matthews, Ani DiFranco and Victoria
Williams all list among their favorites ``an obscure but very
special album'' by Mary Margaret O'Hara called ``Miss America.''
The book includes a master list of artists, and its index will
inspire you, too. Among the musicians polled are Pat Metheny,
Waylon Jennings, Joan Armatrading, Vassar Clements, Michael Doucet,
Pete Seeger, Sonny Rollins, Willie Nelson, Branford Marsalis, Bobby
McFerrin, Herbie Hancock and Dr. John. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shot with a 70-millimeter camera and chockablock with
spectacular adventure and nature scenes, the giant-screen movie has
become a hugely popular fixture at 300 specially equipped theaters
worldwide, but it is experiencing an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Should the films be devoted only to outsize visual effects or
should they also be built around story lines?
</P>
<P>
   Can the entertainment values of the commercially shown giant
films be retained in educational films shown in museums and other
institutions?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the issues being discussed this week at one of
the more sedate movie conventions of the year, one held by the
international Giant Screen Theater Association around Manhattan and
at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, a major site for
showing large-format movies. The convention, which ends Wednesday,
has attracted 1,000 delegates, conservatively dressed, eminently
civil and concerned about the future of a medium that has recently
taken off commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``Everest,'' which has earned $91 million, an
unprecedented amount for a giant-screen film, have put a Hollywood
spin on a field that has always enjoyed a rather documentary-like
gentility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great growth in the commercial area and also in the
institutional, though that's a bit slower,'' said Jim Marchbank,
the association's president and chief executive of Science North, a
science center in Sudbury, Ontario. ``Many more films are being
made for both segments, and more films will cross over.''
</P>
<P>
   Giant-screen movies, like those shown at the Sony Imax theater
in Manhattan, have been around for about 30 years. Traditionally
they have been designed for either commercial or institutional
audiences, although the occasional film appeals to both. Each year
about 20 films are released, all running 40 to 45 minutes for fast
audience turnover.
</P>
<P>
   The large screen, which can be six stories high, lends itself to
spectacle, which in turn calls for dazzling clarity and stupendous
sound. Many films have nature motifs: ``Africa: The Serengeti,''
``The Living Sea,'' ``Island of the Sharks.'' Others are about
adventure and sports: ``Everest,'' ``Olympic Glory,'' ``Extreme''
(about extreme sports). But filmmakers are wondering if they should
be delivering more narrative with the grand sights.
</P>
<P>
   The conference has attracted producers, distributors and
representatives of museums, science centers and theater chains.
While they are a far cry from their hard-partying, rabidly
self-promoting counterparts at standard festivals, their goals are
similar. They have come to discuss and pitch projects, attend
screenings of a dozen films, take part in workshops, and schmooze
about the complications of making movies, sometimes in 3-D, for
soaring vertical or domed screens in auditoriums so steeply pitched
that viewers can get vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of such movies earn much less from box office revenues
than do conventional filmmakers. Institutions use the films as
fund-raisers and keep much of the proceeds. And while directors are
not working with stars like Tom Cruise, costs are high. ``Prints
are about $100,000 U.S. a minute,'' said Marchbank.
</P>
<P>
   Being in the field with a 70-millimeter camera is not a relaxing
experience. ``I'm daunted by the difficulties,'' said Tim
Liversedge, whose production company is close to the Okavango
swamps in Maun, Botswana. He has made standard wildlife films for
the BBC and National Geographic, and now, attracted by the growing
audience for giant-screen movies, he is trying the 70-millimeter
format. In keeping with the trend, he would like to stir some
dramatic narrative into the action. ``I want to tell the story of
the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem faced by filmmakers like Liversedge is the camera,
which weighs almost 90 pounds and is not exactly geared for quick
strikes in the bush. Also, there is only one camera, not three as
there are on many wildlife shoots. A film cartridge lasts only
three minutes, making it tricky to reload at a crucial moment. On
top of this, the camera sounds like a small motor, thereby
announcing itself to wary beasts. Finally, filming doesn't begin
until eight seconds after the camera has been rolling, by which
time the animal could be in the next game park.
</P>
<P>
   Working with conventional equipment, Liversedge said, it takes
years to complete a nature film, mainly because of uncooperative
animals. He hesitated to guess how long it would take with a
70-millimeter camera.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they took a camera up Mount Everest, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest doesn't move,'' Liversedge said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Large-screen movies experience their identity crisis most when
visual spectacle meets story line. As productions grow more
ambitious, they run the risk of overstepping themselves. Dramatic
scenarios often are not effective with audiences conditioned to
seeing roller-coaster rides, bounding lions, 40-foot waves and
crashing avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary aspect has to be entertainment,'' said Greg
MacGillivray of MacGillivray Freeman Films, which made ``Everest''
and other films. ``The audience pays a lot of money for their
tickets and for a short amount of time they want a unique
entertainment they can't get elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment factor is important to museums, as well. The
institutions charge a healthy admission fee for giant-screen
movies, deriving important revenue from them and raising money that
often helps finance new films. ``It's possible for films to have
high educational and entertainment value,'' said Marchbank of
Science North. ``If people aren't having fun, they aren't
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   In museums, a film must both entertain and educate. For example,
Science North was the co-producer of ``Gold Fever,'' which
chronicles the Klondike gold rush and examines the cultural and
economic significance of gold. A film like that is not likely to
show in a commercial theater. But often the distinction is not so
clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these films are neither fish nor foul. They don't
fulfill either market,'' said Truett Latimer, president of the
Houston Museum of Natural Science.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Museum produced ``Alaska: The Spirit of the Wild,''
which was nominated for an Academy Award in 1998. Latimer is a keen
appraiser of the emerging scene in giant movies. ``You see the
Hollywood types drawn by the grosses `Everest' makes, not realizing
what the economics are,'' he said. Or that lions don't like
multiple takes.

 RESENDING TO ADD TIPS BOX  AT TOP OF STORY:  
 
TIPS 
Suggestions for dealing 
with `toxic' elders 
_ First, understand that there is such a thing as an emotionally
``toxic'' elder, and that you may be dealing with one. Just
acknowledging that can be liberating and useful, said Gloria
Davenport, author of ``Working with Toxic Older Adults: A Guide to
Coping with Difficult Elders'' (1999, Springer Publishing). &HT;    _ The key to recognizing if a relationship is ``toxic'' is if
the caregiver feels completely drained and angry after trying to
help.
 &HT;    _ Insulate yourself from some of the calls and demands. Make it
clear that you are not always available.
 &HT;    _ Answer unreasonable demands with a tough but loving ``no.''
They need to hear it often, before they change their adaptive
strategies. It may take three months to make a difference in the
attitude and behavior of a demanding elder. _ Establishing new
rules and conditions for helping may require the help of
professional caregivers or psychologists.
 &HT;    _ Breaking the toxic cycle in a family is essential, Davenport
said, because the syndrome feeds on damaging everyone's
self-esteem. That can transfer from generation to generation if it
is not interrupted. Caregivers can themselves become isolated and
depressed as other family members keep their distance.
 &HT;    _ Psychologists Pam Willson and Gary Martin also recommend that
a medical evaluation be done if there is a personality change.
Chronic pain, illness, mild confusion, isolation or anxiety could
be triggering the frustration and neediness.
 &HT;    _ Don't take it personally. Complaints, demands and accusations
will be aimed at anyone available who gives time and responds.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One woman called 911 and demanded that someone come make her
coffee when her family didn't show up fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Others call their adult children 40 or 50 times a day, asking
for everything from a back rub to help changing a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   In nursing homes, they hit the call button every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Call them difficult, crotchety or just plain cranky _ they are
the highly vocal minority of elderly people formally described as
``high maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, they rode the porch rocker and yelled at passing
kids, or tormented long-suffering daughters-in-law in the privacy
of the family home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, social-service workers say, difficult older people are
growing in number, living longer and are increasingly separated
from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The result: They now rely on public caregivers, who seem no more
capable of pleasing them than were their daughters-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bigger population of older people, including older
people with long-term disabilities, those who have had
mood-altering strokes and serious personality disorders that
intensify as they grow older,'' said Dr. Pam Willson, a Phoenix
area neuropsychologist.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, geropsychologist Gary Martin, say most of
their elderly patients are well-adjusted and easy to work with. A
quarter or a third of them, however, are ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Willson and Martin say they may account for less than 1 percent
of elders. Other caregivers say there are more, though their
``degree of difficulty'' varies.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Davenport of Orange County, Calif., has even published a
new book on them. In`` Working with Toxic Older Adults,'' Davenport
estimates that 3 percent to 5 percent of those in their 80s or
older may be ``toxic'' _ not only to themselves but also to those
who try to help.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who can be helped by medications, she said.
Some may have always had character disorders, but they were fine
when they lived on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now they need help, and no one can please them.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to deal with overly demanding elders is uncharted
territory for some in the social services profession, Davenport
said. However, with the aging of 76 million baby boomers _ already
with a reputation for being somewhat demanding _ the territory is
likely to become well-traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lacey of the Maricopa County Area Agency on Aging said
extremely difficult elders may only make up 5 percent of the agency
ombudsmen's clientele _ but could easily take up 20 percent of
their time.
</P>
<P>
   The most irascible of this group call firefighters, police or
other community agencies every day, Dawn Savattone of the county
aging agency said. They are well known in emergency rooms and on
the ``do not service'' lists of home health care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the social workers in the city got together and we
started comparing names, I guarantee you that we would all know
them,'' Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They burn out every social service agency in town,'' said Bob
Peck, program manager for Adult Protective Services. Of the 300
calls APS gets each month, only about 10 fall into this category,
Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said, ``I don't think that there has been any organized
recognition of these folks and their problems. They are growing
enough in numbers that we have to deal with them in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, ``high maintenance'' elders see the friction as someone
else's fault. They commonly register four or five complaints at a
time, and often threaten to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first call on them, you are a saint,'' Savattone
said. ``But eventually you fall off the pedestal and become another
of the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult elders say all they want is to be left alone in
their own home, Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as all the arrangements are made, they sabotage
them. They may fire home health aides, cancel meal deliveries and
not take their medications,'' she said. ``So they end up exactly
where they were _ surrounded by people trying to meet their needs.
I think they self-sabotage things because being left alone is their
worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Most social service workers also caution that crankiness is not
an automatic part of old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of any age who are forced by circumstances to become
more dependent on others or on `the system,' can feel frustrated or
frightened,'' Willson said. ``If their coping ability was poor
beforehand, you can see real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport makes a clear distinction between ``toxic elders'' and
older people who simply need a lot of care. She said people serving
the former feel emotionally drained after being around them. Some
family members are driven to depression and sometimes nearly to
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said her research found that many of the most
difficult people had been teachers, preachers, psychologists,
business owners, executives or others who had held positions of
power and control.
</P>
<P>
   When that erodes with age, she said, they may turn up the volume
of their demands, ``fearfully lashing out like children to maintain
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all complaints are without merit, caregivers
quickly note. There is much to complain about as social service
budgets continue to shrink in Arizona. Sometimes, all a person can
do is fight for the services they need, and sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the demands become counterproductive,
leading to abandonment or shuffling by the social-service
community.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McCormick, 75, is developing a reputation that would
make her difficult to place in a nursing home - which is fine with
her.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Difficult and demanding' _ those are words I hear over and
over again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she gets a bad rap. She says that paid caregivers
sent to her have already been told that she is demanding, so that's
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick and another senior, James Berryman, were good-natured
enough to be interviewed and photographed for this article to
defend older people they say are unfairly called ``difficult and
demanding.'' According to Berryman, they are simply trying to
better their lives and those of others.
</P>
<P>
   By her own estimate, McCormick has had more than 300 caregivers
in her 27 years as a disabled arthritic. She has been fighting
Maricopa County Managed Care to stay in her home since 1994. Being
difficult _ if it is a strategy _ is so far working to keep her on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   She vows to die in her own home, with hospice at her bedside
when she is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCormick said she really doesn't understand all the
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very polite,'' she said, ``and I expect the people who
are paid to take care of me to do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A former counselor for the blind, McCormick said the underlying
problem is that there are no comprehensive care programs for
disabled elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who should be my advocates are my adversaries,''
she said. ``When you are helpless, they move in on you like a pack
of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical advances and the availability of home services have made
it possible for people like McCormick to live at home, despite
severe problems like diabetes, emphysema or coronary disease,
according to Willson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they may not have survived some strokes. Now they
survive, but may not be the same person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said she recently told one daughter that she would
probably never make her mother happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make your mom relatively comfortable, that's the
best you can do,'' Willson recalls telling her.
</P>
<P>
   James Berryman is not too comfortable, even though he's bounced
around to dozens of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known everywhere,'' said Berryman, 61, who says he has
been in nearly every nursing home in Phoenix during the past 27
years, following a construction accident in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He has filed complaints about nursing home care to the
Department of Health Services, the Attorney General's Office and
the Maricopa County Ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
   He sees himself as a nursing home whistle-blower, and figures
his reputation among nursing home administrators is: `` `He will
call the state on you in a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he said, he was bounced from a nursing home for speaking
ill of an administrator, not knowing she was within hearing
distance. Another time he got caught at a Christian nursing home
with a wine cooler in his pillowcase.
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult seniors call fire stations. Each Phoenix fire
station reports about two regular callers, often elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it overburdening the system? Not right now,'' Division
Chief Bob Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are just looking for company _ they are so glad to see
you,'' Khan said. ``Others might call just because they are having
a bad day. When you got there, however, they might tell you that
it's none of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   One former regular _ a Romeo of the Westward Ho _ would have
asthma attacks in front of his paramours. Then, when he was asked
if he needed help, he would say ``she will take care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 to 25 percent of the 20 calls the Fire Department makes
each month to Westward Ho in downtown Phoenix are from people who
are lonely or aren't able to articulate exactly what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Khan calls them ``social calls.'' The same percentage would hold
true of other visits to seniors' homes or complexes, he said.
</P>

MORE `CROCHETY' ELDERS THAN EVER

 &HT;     THIS INTERESTING STORY ABOUT ``TOXIC'' ELDERLY WAS SENT EARLIER
IN THE
 WEEK IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY. ``TIPS'' BOX AT TOP OF STORY:  
 
TIPS 
Suggestions for dealing 
with `toxic' elders 
_ First, understand that there is such a thing as an emotionally
``toxic'' elder, and that you may be dealing with one. Just
acknowledging that can be liberating and useful, said Gloria
Davenport, author of ``Working with Toxic Older Adults: A Guide to
Coping with Difficult Elders'' (1999, Springer Publishing). &HT;    _ The key to recognizing if a relationship is ``toxic'' is if
the caregiver feels completely drained and angry after trying to
help.
 &HT;    _ Insulate yourself from some of the calls and demands. Make it
clear that you are not always available.
 &HT;    _ Answer unreasonable demands with a tough but loving ``no.''
They need to hear it often, before they change their adaptive
strategies. It may take three months to make a difference in the
attitude and behavior of a demanding elder. _ Establishing new
rules and conditions for helping may require the help of
professional caregivers or psychologists.
 &HT;    _ Breaking the toxic cycle in a family is essential, Davenport
said, because the syndrome feeds on damaging everyone's
self-esteem. That can transfer from generation to generation if it
is not interrupted. Caregivers can themselves become isolated and
depressed as other family members keep their distance.
 &HT;    _ Psychologists Pam Willson and Gary Martin also recommend that
a medical evaluation be done if there is a personality change.
Chronic pain, illness, mild confusion, isolation or anxiety could
be triggering the frustration and neediness.
 &HT;    _ Don't take it personally. Complaints, demands and accusations
will be aimed at anyone available who gives time and responds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One woman called 911 and demanded that someone come make her
coffee when her family didn't show up fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Others call their adult children 40 or 50 times a day, asking
for everything from a back rub to help changing a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   In nursing homes, they hit the call button every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Call them difficult, crotchety or just plain cranky _ they are
the highly vocal minority of elderly people formally described as
``high maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, they rode the porch rocker and yelled at passing
kids, or tormented long-suffering daughters-in-law in the privacy
of the family home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, social-service workers say, difficult older people are
growing in number, living longer and are increasingly separated
from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The result: They now rely on public caregivers, who seem no more
capable of pleasing them than were their daughters-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bigger population of older people, including older
people with long-term disabilities, those who have had
mood-altering strokes and serious personality disorders that
intensify as they grow older,'' said Dr. Pam Willson, a Phoenix
area neuropsychologist.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, geropsychologist Gary Martin, say most of
their elderly patients are well-adjusted and easy to work with. A
quarter or a third of them, however, are ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Willson and Martin say they may account for less than 1 percent
of elders. Other caregivers say there are more, though their
``degree of difficulty'' varies.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Davenport of Orange County, Calif., has even published a
new book on them. In`` Working with Toxic Older Adults,'' Davenport
estimates that 3 percent to 5 percent of those in their 80s or
older may be ``toxic'' _ not only to themselves but also to those
who try to help.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who can be helped by medications, she said.
Some may have always had character disorders, but they were fine
when they lived on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now they need help, and no one can please them.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to deal with overly demanding elders is uncharted
territory for some in the social services profession, Davenport
said. However, with the aging of 76 million baby boomers _ already
with a reputation for being somewhat demanding _ the territory is
likely to become well-traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lacey of the Maricopa County Area Agency on Aging said
extremely difficult elders may only make up 5 percent of the agency
ombudsmen's clientele _ but could easily take up 20 percent of
their time.
</P>
<P>
   The most irascible of this group call firefighters, police or
other community agencies every day, Dawn Savattone of the county
aging agency said. They are well known in emergency rooms and on
the ``do not service'' lists of home health care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the social workers in the city got together and we
started comparing names, I guarantee you that we would all know
them,'' Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They burn out every social service agency in town,'' said Bob
Peck, program manager for Adult Protective Services. Of the 300
calls APS gets each month, only about 10 fall into this category,
Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said, ``I don't think that there has been any organized
recognition of these folks and their problems. They are growing
enough in numbers that we have to deal with them in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, ``high maintenance'' elders see the friction as someone
else's fault. They commonly register four or five complaints at a
time, and often threaten to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first call on them, you are a saint,'' Savattone
said. ``But eventually you fall off the pedestal and become another
of the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult elders say all they want is to be left alone in
their own home, Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as all the arrangements are made, they sabotage
them. They may fire home health aides, cancel meal deliveries and
not take their medications,'' she said. ``So they end up exactly
where they were _ surrounded by people trying to meet their needs.
I think they self-sabotage things because being left alone is their
worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Most social service workers also caution that crankiness is not
an automatic part of old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of any age who are forced by circumstances to become
more dependent on others or on `the system,' can feel frustrated or
frightened,'' Willson said. ``If their coping ability was poor
beforehand, you can see real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport makes a clear distinction between ``toxic elders'' and
older people who simply need a lot of care. She said people serving
the former feel emotionally drained after being around them. Some
family members are driven to depression and sometimes nearly to
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said her research found that many of the most
difficult people had been teachers, preachers, psychologists,
business owners, executives or others who had held positions of
power and control.
</P>
<P>
   When that erodes with age, she said, they may turn up the volume
of their demands, ``fearfully lashing out like children to maintain
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all complaints are without merit, caregivers
quickly note. There is much to complain about as social service
budgets continue to shrink in Arizona. Sometimes, all a person can
do is fight for the services they need, and sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the demands become counterproductive,
leading to abandonment or shuffling by the social-service
community.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McCormick, 75, is developing a reputation that would
make her difficult to place in a nursing home - which is fine with
her.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Difficult and demanding' _ those are words I hear over and
over again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she gets a bad rap. She says that paid caregivers
sent to her have already been told that she is demanding, so that's
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick and another senior, James Berryman, were good-natured
enough to be interviewed and photographed for this article to
defend older people they say are unfairly called ``difficult and
demanding.'' According to Berryman, they are simply trying to
better their lives and those of others.
</P>
<P>
   By her own estimate, McCormick has had more than 300 caregivers
in her 27 years as a disabled arthritic. She has been fighting
Maricopa County Managed Care to stay in her home since 1994. Being
difficult _ if it is a strategy _ is so far working to keep her on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   She vows to die in her own home, with hospice at her bedside
when she is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCormick said she really doesn't understand all the
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very polite,'' she said, ``and I expect the people who
are paid to take care of me to do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A former counselor for the blind, McCormick said the underlying
problem is that there are no comprehensive care programs for
disabled elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who should be my advocates are my adversaries,''
she said. ``When you are helpless, they move in on you like a pack
of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical advances and the availability of home services have made
it possible for people like McCormick to live at home, despite
severe problems like diabetes, emphysema or coronary disease,
according to Willson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they may not have survived some strokes. Now they
survive, but may not be the same person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said she recently told one daughter that she would
probably never make her mother happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make your mom relatively comfortable, that's the
best you can do,'' Willson recalls telling her.
</P>
<P>
   James Berryman is not too comfortable, even though he's bounced
around to dozens of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known everywhere,'' said Berryman, 61, who says he has
been in nearly every nursing home in Phoenix during the past 27
years, following a construction accident in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He has filed complaints about nursing home care to the
Department of Health Services, the Attorney General's Office and
the Maricopa County Ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
   He sees himself as a nursing home whistle-blower, and figures
his reputation among nursing home administrators is: `` `He will
call the state on you in a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he said, he was bounced from a nursing home for speaking
ill of an administrator, not knowing she was within hearing
distance. Another time he got caught at a Christian nursing home
with a wine cooler in his pillowcase.
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult seniors call fire stations. Each Phoenix fire
station reports about two regular callers, often elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it overburdening the system? Not right now,'' Division
Chief Bob Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are just looking for company _ they are so glad to see
you,'' Khan said. ``Others might call just because they are having
a bad day. When you got there, however, they might tell you that
it's none of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   One former regular _ a Romeo of the Westward Ho _ would have
asthma attacks in front of his paramours. Then, when he was asked
if he needed help, he would say ``she will take care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 to 25 percent of the 20 calls the Fire Department makes
each month to Westward Ho in downtown Phoenix are from people who
are lonely or aren't able to articulate exactly what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Khan calls them ``social calls.'' The same percentage would hold
true of other visits to seniors' homes or complexes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never be able to `fix it.''' he said. ``But we need to
adapt to make changes in the system so they have someone to call
besides 911.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Smithsonian Institution announced this
month that a trove of Chinese art amassed over nearly 60 years by
an American collector, Dr. Paul Singer (1904-1997), had been given
to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery here, the details were rather
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   It amounts to more than 5,000 objects, with a value estimated at
$60 million, though, in fact, an item-by-item assessment of the
material is only just beginning. The gift more than doubles the
existing collection of the Sackler Gallery, which was established
in 1987 and constitutes, with the neighboring Freer Gallery, the
national museum of Asian art in the United States. And in a stroke
it transforms the Freer and the Sackler into the largest repository
for Chinese archaeological material in North America.
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like these, one might expect to find items of
unusual heft and grandeur in the Singer hoard. On the whole,
though, that is not the case. The collection certainly has its
share of show stoppers, among them a superb 3,000-year-old bronze
bell over two feet high and an exquisite third- or second-century
B.C. carved wooden horse, its lacquer-painted harness still intact.
But most of the work is low-key in appearance and small, even
diminutive, in size.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the entire collection was housed in Singer's modest
two-bedroom apartment in Summit, N.J. At the Sackler, it occupies
drawers and cabinets, not rooms. And a distinctive portion of the
material consists of ancient miniatures, many of them versions of
full-size objects and probably made to be placed in children's
tombs.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is a replica, dating from around the second century
B.C., of a classic type of ritual bronze food vessel, which can be
massive. Here it has been cast with painstaking precision, but at
less than two inches high, it looks as if it had been plucked from
a Victorian doll house. (An example of an ``adult'' version of the
vessel can be found in the Sackler collection.)
</P>
<P>
   Singer, who was a practicing psychiatrist, was well known in New
York's Asian art circles for making eccentric, seemingly whimsical
selections that turned out to be treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made collecting fun,'' said Jenny So, the curator of
Chinese art at the Freer and the Sackler, who will oversee the
process of examining and cataloguing the Singer objects. Some of
Singer's offbeat choices were determined by finances; he never had
substantial personal wealth. Others reflect the impulses of an
inquiring, chance-taking temperament.
</P>
<P>
   He was attracted, for example, to art that was understudied and
undervalued, including regional work of a kind that has only fairly
recently been awarded full scholarly attention. ``The joint Freer
and Sackler collection was very focused on art from elite and
metropolitan cultures,'' Ms. So said. ``But Singer collected art
from the provinces, with strong local characteristics. Now we can
show these cultures together.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer was especially taken with the art of the southern state
of Chu, which flourished between the eighth and third centuries
B.C. No one in the West knew quite what to make of this
exotic-looking material when he was first buying it. Today,
however, it one of the hottest topics in the field of Chinese art
history. And, thanks to Singer, the Sackler has overnight become
the epicenter of Chu research outside China.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, perhaps because he was trained in investigating
behavior and emotions, Singer seems to have been attracted to art
less for its virtuosic dazzle than for the stories it tells. A
lacquerware cosmetics case brought out from a Chu tomb, for
example, is battered and crushed. But its contents _ combs, silk
ribbons, a hairpiece _ survive intact and bring an everyday world
of human activity vividly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's life began in Europe. He was born in Hungary and grew
up in Vienna, where he studied medicine. In 1938, along with many
other Jews, he left for the United States. And although he had been
acquiring art in Europe since his teens, most of what is now at the
Sackler dates from after his arrival in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was a classic example of the self-taught connoisseur, a
species often lamented today as a vanishing breed. He neither read
nor spoke Chinese, and visited China for the first time when he was
in his late 70s. He learned about the art close to home, tirelessly
seeking it out, looking at it, handling it, living with it.
</P>
<P>
   His art reconnaissance missions from New Jersey to Manhattan
were so regular and frequent that the staff at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art parking lot reserved a space for him at specific
times, knowing he would fill it. He was a ubiquitous presence in
museums, auction houses and galleries, and regularly spoke with art
professionals, though he had a reputation for being highly
opinionated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the crusty type, set in his ideas,'' said Thomas
Lawton, director emeritus of the Freer and the Sackler, and a
friend of Singer. ``But if you were firm, he would accept what you
said.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 he met Dr. Arthur Sackler (1903-1987), whose collection
would later form the basis of the museum in Washington. The men,
both psychiatrists and devotees of Asian culture, became close
friends, but they acquired art in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Sackler had money, and he often bought entire collections at a
shot. Singer tended to buy a few pieces at a time, often selling
previous acquisitions to finance new ones. Because his tastes were
idiosyncratic, he could get top-notch works, often at bargain
prices, that had been dismissed by other collectors for being of
doubtful authenticity or just plain weird.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton remembers that a New York dealer once offered Singer a
small Cubistic-looking marble bear for $150, insisting it was
nothing more than a charming modern fake. Singer knew otherwise,
but said he would buy it at a knockdown price of $125 for use as a
paperweight. The sculpture, from the late Shang dynasty, is now in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sackler quickly came to value Singer's expertise, and though he
was, like most serious collectors, intensely territorial, he saw
that Singer's interests complemented rather than duplicated his
own. Soon after they met, he began to give Singer, who had little
cash to work with, lump sums of money on a quarterly basis to buy
art.
</P>
<P>
   The funds came with no stipulation as to what kind of art it
should be used for, and there is little question that the Singer
collection as it exists is very much a product of its creator's
eye. But Milo Beach, director of the Freer and the Sackler
galleries, said that the financial arrangement did require that
when Singer (who had no children) died, his art would go to either
to a Sackler-named museum or to the Arthur M. Sackler foundation.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement explains the somewhat complicated credit line
that will accompany all the Singer items in the Sackler Gallery
collection, and it leaves Singer's connoisseurial role understated:
``Joint gift by the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation; Paul Singer; the
AMS Foundation for Arts, Sciences and Humanities; and the children
of Arthur M. Sackler.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sackler curators are sorting through the Singer material to
determine which of the thousands of pieces will be officially
brought into the gallery's collection. (Not everything necessarily
will.) But 18 works have already been put on public view in the
museum's entrance pavilion, and they give some sense of the breadth
of the holdings.)
</P>
<P>
   They include a small bronze bell of extreme rarity (it is among
the earliest known in the West) and a gorgeous jade ritual disk
with striated patterns that almost exactly match those of a disk
that has long been at the Freer. (It is possible that they may even
have been cut from the same block.) Also on hand are the marble
bear ``paperweight'' and a cluster of ceramic jars with
naturalistic motifs that span centuries but together form a winsome
community of turrets, temples and granaries.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Singer material, however, remains in storage
and, apart from small rotating displays, probably always will.
Although a full-scale exhibition and catalog are in the planning
stages, the Sackler does not have the space to put more than a
fraction of the objects on view at a time.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of them are probably best off left in their
drawers, either because of fragility, because they are closer to
being artifacts than showpieces, or because their once-startling
uniqueness has been superseded by the flood of archaeological
material that has emerged from China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the briefest glance at the collection, which is
chronologically comprehensive but has areas of exceptional depth,
is enough to suggest the contributions it might make to the
rethinking of Chinese art history that is now under way. One
intriguing item, for example, is a woven-gold necklace dating from
the fourth or third century B.C. and adorned with two carved jade
spools and two plump amber beads.
</P>
<P>
   The jadework is Chinese. But gold was imported from western Asia
(it is not indigenous to China), and the most common source of
amber was the Baltic region. So it is possible to read in this one
object the picture of a multicultural China, very different from
the monolithic and hermetic model long in place.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece, far less glamorous, tells no less absorbing a
tale. It is a lacquered wood stick with a dove, perky but homely,
carved on the top of the handle. The cane, which appears to have
been much handled, is of a type once traditionally awarded in China
to octogenarians as a sign of their well-earned status as elders in
the community. This example, from around the first century B.C.,
accompanied its owner to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of work isn't collected often,'' Ms. So said. ``It's
a document, not a thing of beauty. But objects like these humanize
a culture. Through them we can picture people's lives.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd tore a destructive path through the western
Bahamas on Tuesday, packing 140 mph winds and 25 foot seas. By
Tuesday afternoon, it became increasingly clear that the storm was
heading on a more northerly track, alleviating the threat to
southern Florida, and putting areas farther north at greater risk
for landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Floyd will take aim on the Southeast Coast, possibly
making landfall very late in the day. As a result, heavy rain will
batter the Georgia and Carolina coasts, with locally more than 5
inches of rain possible. In addition, heavy surf will cause
extensive beach erosion and flooding, especially toward evening.
While the precise path of Floyd is unknown, it is probable that
parts of the Carolina coastline will endure winds over 100 miles an
hour before Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will form well to the north of Floyd near the Northeast
Coast as humid air is drawn inland from the Atlantic. Farther west,
the interior Northeast and Middle Atlantic states will remain
partly sunny and dry. Expansive high pressure building south from
central Canada will promote ample sunshine and cool conditions from
the Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers will accompany a jet stream disturbance
crossing the Southwest. A few of these showers will extend into
western Texas and the southeast Plains toward evening. The
remainder of the West will be mainly sunny and tranquil with
morning low clouds shrouding parts of the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Night Blindness
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Floyd menaces the East Coast this week,
meteorologists will be blinded each night when, for two hours, the
satellite that serves North America loses power. During that time,
from the point of view of the satellite, there is a solar eclipse.
The solar-powered satellite is in a geostationary orbit 22,500
miles over the eastern Pacific. Each year around the spring and
autumn equinoxes, the Earth passes between the satellite and the
Sun. This limited data loss is not a major problem, since aircraft,
radar and other ground-based weather observations help fill the
void.

KENNEDY CENTER LAUDS 5 IN THE PERFORMING ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
announced the names of the recipients of its annual honors Tuesday.
One, Victor Borge, received the official word while rehearsing for
a performance with the Houston Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like it, but I'm speechless,'' said Borge,
the comical pianist and serious comedian, who admits to having
slowed down just a bit due to his age, which he said was 90, but
only 58 in American years. ``It is tough to do a phone interview
when you're speechless,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The other recipients are the actor Sean Connery, the dancer and
choreographer Judith Jamison, the actor Jason Robards and the
singer and songwriter Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   After rehearsing with the Houston musicians (``Some music from
`La Boheme' and parts of the Concertos No. 1 and No. 2 by
Rachmaninoff, and then I talk in between, and, yes, they will
laugh,'' he said), Borge told why his age was sometimes at variance
with the indisputable fact that he was born 90 years ago in
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   He had fled from the Nazis, who occupied Denmark during World
War II and, he added: ``In America I am not that old because I came
here when I was 31, and I took a couple of years to learn English,
so I am only about 58 years old. But I don't look it.''
</P>
<P>
   Borge is one of two foreign-born recipients of this year's
honors. The other is Connery, the urbane Scot known for the James
Bond movies as well as such films as ``The Untouchables'' (1987),
for which he won the Academy Award for best supporting actor, and
``The Russia House'' (1990).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jamison, 56, who was born in Philadelphia, danced with the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and took over the company in
1989 upon the death of Ailey, who won a Kennedy Center honor in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   She said in a statement from Brazil: ``When I realized that I
was going to receive the Kennedy Center honors, I was in tears
looking at Alvin's picture. I think he would have been extremely
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Stevie Wonder is relatively young to be receiving the
award, but he has been singing ballads and pop songs since he was
7. Wonder was born in Saginaw, Mich. His songs have included both
straight pop, like ``You Are the Sunshine of My Life,'' and those
associated with his social activism, like the plea to fight world
hunger in ``We Are the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Robards, 77, who was born in Chicago, has acted in movies and on
television but is best known for his stage work. He is the nation's
pre-eminent interpreter of the plays of Eugene O'Neill, and he said
that he was pleased by the recent renewal of interest in those
works, although ``O'Neill really has never ceased being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Southport, Conn., Robards was asked
whether he might return to Broadway, where he has performed in
virtually every theater, to play in an O'Neill work again. ``I'd
love to, but I'm getting so long in the tooth now,'' he said.
``It's too late. It brings back all the old memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his O'Neill collaborators, like the director Jose
Quintero and his frequent co-star Colleen Dewhurst, are dead. He
said he fondly remembers touring with them for years at a time in
such O'Neill plays as ``The Iceman Cometh,'' ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten'' and ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, he said, there is an O'Neill play he could
perform: ```Desire Under the Elms' I could probably do. There's an
old man in that that I could do, a very good part. But I'm not
contemplating that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center Honors are the center's principal
fund-raising event. The recipients are to receive their awards from
President Clinton at the White House on Dec. 5 and then be honored
at a performance at the center.
</P>
<P>
   The performance will be broadcast on CBS television later in
December.

 &HT;    Turner's Burke tapped for Time Warner's online endeavors
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ William Burke, 33, will take on the prodigious job of
building Time Warner Inc.'s news and information Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently president of TBS Superstation and Turner South,
but Tuesday was named president and CEO of news and information for
Time Warner Digitial Media.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's job will be to develop a strategic plan to integrate the
various Time Warner news and information properties into a viable
Web site at which consumers will want to spend time and make
purchases, said Richard Bressler, president and CEO of Time Warner
Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has a reputation as a programming strategist and hopes to
transfer those skills into his new role.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've asked Bill to do is develop a business strategy for
all our news and information assets for all of the Time Warner,
Time Inc. or Turner'' entities, said Bressler. Bressler said the
goal is ``to build the number one online experience for consumers
with news and information.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke has been one of Turner Broadcasting's Young Turks. He
named president of TBS in 1995 at the age of 29. His mission, which
the company considers fulfilled, was to raise the brand recognition
of the channel. Burke did so by adding lots of contemporary reruns
from network television. He also added some new shows, such as one
starring chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   Burke is a marketer by training. In his career, he has
successfully marketed everything from Mattel's He-Man dolls to
Disney characters.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's online plans call for several specialized online
information sites including sports and business sites, in addition
to the news and information sites that represent such heavy hitters
as CNN and Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   However, Time Warner Digital Media has its work cut out. The new
Web strategy will replace Time Warner's Pathfinder.com, the once
pioneering Web site that placed all of Time Warner's legendary
magazine titles including Time, Life, Sports Illustrated, Money and
People under the Pathfinder banner _ and nearly out of sight of the
average Web surfer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bressler and Burke stress that the new Time Warner Web
sites won't be anything like Pathfinder. They'll be better
designed, developed and promoted.
</P>
<P>
   It's a daunting task, even for the most sophisticated media
company. The CondeNast magazine group, for example continues to
struggle for a way to cluster its famous magazine brands including
Vogue, Mademoiselle and CondeNast Traveller into a compelling
combination of online properties.
</P>
<P>
   Burke will assume his new responsibilities October 4, after the
launch of the new Turner South channel.
</P>
<P>
   He's not ready to discuss details yet. ``We have a lot of
ideas,'' he says. ``The question isn't what should we do about the
Internet, but how big is it going to be. News and information is
the key thing people use on the Web, and we have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke says his job will be to devise a strategy, not direct
editorial coverage. ``I will not be taking over editorial
responsibilities,'' he says. ``I'll be focusing on managing all the
content. That's what we do at Turner on the cable programming side.
We look at the best ways to aggregate content and figure out how to
maximize it. That's what I want to do in this new area.''

IN SPAIN, A CHEF TO RIVAL DALI 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: recipe in 3rd take) 
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSAS, Spain _ Some say it is the best restaurant in Europe,
possibly the world. No one mentioned that it is also so remote. A
friend and I sped around hairpin curves on a pitted, single-lane
mountain road northeast of Barcelona, with nothing above us and the
Mediterranean a sharp descent below.
</P>
<P>
   The road snaked around the mountain and eventually delivered us
at the base of a sunny, narrow cove. There was an empty beach, a
rundown shack and a small villa wedged into the hillside. This was
El Bulli.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Michelin three-star restaurant everyone was talking
about. The one that six top American chefs _ Charlie Trotter, Todd
English, Norman Van Aken, Roberto Donna, Jean-Louis Palladin and
Douglas Rodriguez _ would all flock to this same week and the next,
not for an event but on a pilgrimage. The one where the chef,
Ferran Adria, is rarely referred to as a chef, but as a mad
scientist, a genius, a Dali of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   When we entered, he sat hunched over the reservation desk, head
in his hands, like a schoolboy struggling with a math problem. A
stocky man with curly black hair and a Mediterranean tan, he smiled
widely and shook my hand vigorously. He wore no toque, no expensive
shoes, no airs of a god in his temple. He pointed us to our table
where we were meeting some friends.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to get down to business.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter set down a plate of lollipops. They were flat,
caramel-colored translucent wafers on a stick. I placed one in my
mouth. A salted peanut-honey brittle melted on my tongue like a
rice cracker. A flurry of tapas arrived, including Adria's version
of a tomato-and-bread salad _ a crisp, hollow sphere of bread
concealed a burst of olive oil. It rested on top of a cool puff of
white foam _ an intense froth of tomato water in disguise. The
stream of surprises never let up.
</P>
<P>
   El Bulli got its third star in 1997. ``It was the quietest
three-star ever,'' said Michael Ginor, an owner of Hudson Valley
Foie Gras on New York's Long Island. But then again, it was in
Spain, and three-star restaurants outside France simply do not
attract the same volume of attention. But among chefs and insiders,
it was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Robuchon, the former chef of the three-star Robuchon in
Paris, visited a few years ago and went back to France telling
everyone that Adria was the best chef in the world. That's a bit
like Picasso coming to see your paintings, then declaring that
you're the best artist in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Attention reached an apex this year, when the standing of El
Bulli changed from professional touting to required eating.
American chefs and foodies flooded it this summer for Adria's
parade of tiny courses, his clever riffs on tapas and his
outrageous pairings like bone marrow and caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs have sought time in Adria's kitchen. Jeffrey
Cerciello, the chef at Thomas Keller's Bouchon, in the Napa Valley,
interned there for a year. Jose Andres, the chef at Cafe Atlantico
and Jaleo, in Washington, worked for Adria for a few years and has
returned numerous times since. Many of Andres' dishes, like his
mango anchovy ravioli foam, echo Adria's style: _ they experiment
not just with new tastes but with temperatures, textures, aromas
and appearance as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Andres, are clear disciples. But Adria is also
influencing American cooking in more subtle ways. So many chefs are
visiting El Bulli, and Adria is clearly inspiring them as he
strikes out in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   Adria gained most of his fame, though, for a specific technique
he developed. A few years ago, he received a gift from friends in
Madrid. It was a nitrous oxide canister meant to be used for making
whipped cream. Most people would accept such an odd gift and
promptly deposit it in the closet, but Adria put it to work. He
filled it with various liquids, and his ethereal ``foams,'' as they
are called, were born. Soon, he was making tomato foams, shellfish
foams and potato foams, and chefs from around the world were coming
to taste _ and copy _ them.
</P>
<P>
   It is just this kind of creativity and risk taking that defines
Adria's style. He takes classic dishes and deconstructs them,
disregarding familiar contexts in an effort to form new ones. A
tortilla de patata, which in every other Spanish restaurant is a
potato and onion omelet, is served at El Bulli in a martini glass
and is liquid and foam. You are handed a spoon and told to dip it
all the way to the bottom with each bite. You plunge through a
white potato foam into a soft pudding of egg and caramelized onion.
In his chicken curry, the curry is the solid, the chicken is
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   His cooking follows no patterns. It has been described as
everything from surrealist to techno. It is not especially French
and not especially Spanish. Global, perhaps. The only element you
can depend on finding is seafood, which is spectacular and
abundant, not surprisingly, given the location of the restaurant.
(A former pupil of his said fishermen would drive boats up to the
shore and deliver mussels and sea urchins in their dive suits.) His
curve balls are easily missed. Some diners, for instance, will have
a 12-course meal without noticing that just two courses were hot.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures can even change through the course of a single
dish. After the tapas, the waiters returned with shot glasses
filled with a grass-green liquid. We waited for our instructions.
``Pea and mint soup _ drink all at once,'' the waiter said.
Diligently, we all lifted the glasses to our mouths and tilted our
heads back. It was a tasty, slightly coarse pea and mint soup. It
began hot, but as you drank it, a stream of cold soup slid under
the layer of hot soup on your tongue. It ended completely cold.
</P>
<P>
   Adria's latest breakthrough is finding a way to serve gelatins
hot. His tagliatelle carbonara is witty and brilliant. There is
tagliatelle, but it is not pasta. It is a chicken consomme jelled
with agar-agar and cut into long, brown translucent ribbons. A
tangle of them lie in a sauce of egg, cream, Parmesan cheese and
diced ham. The warm jelled tagliatelle feel like pasta in the mouth
and dissolve slightly to meld with the rich, eggy sauce. It's as
good as it is perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   And just as you are moved by such creativity, he stops you with
a dish of baby shrimp sauteed in their juices and nothing else _ no
jell, no foam, no garnish.
</P>
<P>
   These innovations are what American chefs visiting El Bulli come
looking for. Kenneth Oringer, the chef at Clio in Boston, spent
three days in the kitchen last year. ``His approach left a mark on
me,'' Oringer said. And on his menu. Dishes like a black truffle
fondue served in a coffee cup, covered with a celery root foam,
shavings of black truffle and a dusting of bitter cocoa powder, are
clearly influenced by Adria.
</P>
<P>
   English, the chef at Olives and Figs in Boston, was inspired by
Adria's creative freedom. ``It made me think, `Why are you
stopping?''' he said, ``That was the inspiration I got: Don't hold
back.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Adria, 37, has had no formal training. Most of his career, in
fact, has been spent at El Bulli. He began working in a small
restaurant in Barcelona when he was 17, washing dishes to earn
money to go on vacation. ``I started washing dishes the same way I
could have been a car mechanic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Being there in the kitchen, he became interested in cooking.
Soon, he made the leap. After four years there, he got a job at El
Bulli, where he has been for 17 years. The restaurant, now 45 years
old, has always had a reputation for good cooking. When Adria was
hired as a cook at El Bulli _ named ``the bulldog'' by the first
owner, who was fond of French bulldogs _ the restaurant had two
stars. He became the chef after two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he went to a class given by Jacques Maximum, then the
chef of the two-star Chantecler at the Hotel Negresco in Nice.
Someone in the audience asked what it meant to create. ``Not to
copy,'' responded Maximum. That moment, that simple definition,
Adria said, was transcendent. It has informed his cooking ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   El Bulli is open just six months of the year, from April 1 to
Oct. 1. During the season, the restaurant serves about 45 people at
each meal. A team of 35 to 40 cooks turns out menus that range from
about 12 courses to as many as 35.
</P>
<P>
   Adria spends the other six months in Barcelona, working with his
brother, Alberto, developing recipes. Alberto had been the pastry
chef but has recently turned his attention to the direction of the
restaurant's cooking. They call the Barcelona kitchen their
laboratory and run it very much like one, using controls and
experimenting with countless variables until they get a combination
like potato and coffee to work.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, they managed to. And they serve it as if it were
a jewel. At lunch, a troupe of waiters passed around large spoons.
``Eat in one bite,'' one said. The soft cylinder of potato perched
on the end of the spoon was filled with an intense, viscous coffee
sauce. It was rich, earthy, strangely delicious.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference, Adria said, between having to create food
because you have a restaurant and needing to have a restaurant
because you create food. Because he experiments with food, he said,
he needs the restaurant to show it. It is his gallery.
</P>
<P>
   As with any exhibition of challenging artwork, not all diners
leave El Bulli feeling sure that they love it. But they know that
they are astonished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I wasn't dining or eating,'' English said, ``I
felt I was being experimented with. I never felt satisfied with
every dish that I ate. It wasn't like I ate something. It was like
`Wow, that was wild.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clara Maria G. de Amezua, a food historian and lecturer in
Madrid, said Adria was widely respected in Spain but not always
adored. ``When they say they don't like,'' Ms. de Amezua said, ``I
think, They don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remains controversial,'' said Victor de la Serna, a
restaurant critic and a deputy editor of El Mundo, the Madrid
daily, ``because in his constant search for new things, new
textures, new combinations, sometimes he misses the mark, which is
the risk. I've never had a meal cooked by him that didn't have
something that didn't miss the mark. But I've never had a meal
cooked by him where there weren't several things that were
sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, a dish of frozen polenta illustrated just how his
experiments, his risk taking, sometimes fall short. It was salty,
grainy, cold and simply unpleasant to eat. Another dish featuring
duck seemed like nothing other than a mediocre version of egg foo
yung. But after so many extraordinary dishes it was difficult to
see it as much of a flaw. Who cannot applaud a chef with such
bravery?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maybe more of a chefs' restaurant,'' said Trotter, the
chef at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago. ``It's certainly more of an
eager enthusiastic gourmand's restaurant than an enthusiastic
diner's restaurant. You appreciate it more if you have more
experience at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest surprise supporter of all has been the historically
stuffy Michelin guide. For years, chefs have complained that
Michelin's judgment of china, artwork and service in addition to
the food has forced them into bankruptcy and corrupted the
definition of dining. Michelin maintains that the food is the only
criterion for stars, and that inspectors in Spain are Spanish, not
French. Alain Arnaud, the director of communications for the
Michelin guide in Paris, said: ``It is difficult to say you can eat
the meal of your life on a paper plate. You need a minimum of
decor.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what you get at El Bulli. There are cobwebs in the
bathroom, dust on the copper pots hanging from the walls, and _ mon
dieu! _ unfluffed seat cushions. There is no expensive artwork
(though you couldn't put a price on the ocean view). And for a
restaurant that, according to Michelin, is ``worth the detour,'' a
detour it certainly is.
</P>
<P>
   Even Adria seems mystified by the inspectors' decision to give
him three stars. They made a bet on the future of restaurants and
food, he said, because they based it on creativity.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meal, the plate of petit fours, which he calls
``pequenas locuras,'' or ``little crazies,'' seemed to bring it all
together. Lollipops appeared once more, only this time they were
lemonade and as they melted in your mouth, they fizzed. From the
solid substance, bubbles formed, lifting off the tongue like
champagne. His chocolate mint is a fresh mint leaf framed in flat
chip of chocolate. The chocolate was lean and bittersweet, the mint
tasted of the outdoors. His thin flat tuiles, all fanned out on a
modern silver rack, had mottled surfaces that were cream, yellow
and pink and tasted of coconut, pistachio and beet. There were
chocolate caramel tuiles seasoned with pink peppercorn and, for
anyone who was beginning to take this all too seriously,
chocolate-covered salted corn nuts.
</P>
<P>
   By the end we were laughing, slouching in our chairs as the sun
descended toward the horizon. We visited the kitchen, a high-tech
lab compared with the homey dining room. Adria did not rush us
along. He chatted, one eye on us, one eye on the young men wrapping
plump coral mussels in a clear sea-water jelly _ the production
line for post-modern food. &QL;

<P>
   PARMESAN ICE CREAM SANDWICH
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from El Bulli, Roses, Spain
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus 6 hours freezing time  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the ice cream:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   { pound finely grated Parmesan cheese For the marmalade:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 lemons
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar For the cookie:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   { pound finely grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick cooking spray.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare the ice cream: Place a fine strainer over a medium
bowl, and set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring
cream to a simmer. While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually
add Parmesan. Stir constantly until mixture is smooth, about 10
minutes. Pour mixture into strainer, and press on any solids to
extract as much liquid as possible. Allow to cool to room
temperature. Pour mixture into a 9-by-12-inch baking dish, and
cover with plastic wrap. Freeze until solid, about 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. To prepare the marmalade: Using a sharp knife, cut all peel
(including white pith) from lemons. Dice lemons into {-inch cubes,
and transfer to a small saucepan. Add sugar, and bring to a simmer
over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is
thick, about 1 hour. (While marmalade is simmering, prepare
Parmesan cookies.) Remove from heat, and let cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. To prepare the Parmesan cookies: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a mixing bowl, combine egg whites and grated cheese. Spray two
10-by-15-inch nonstick baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray.
Spread half of mixture in center of each sheet. Top with a sheet of
wax paper, and use a rolling pin to press mixture evenly across
each pan. Remove and discard wax paper. Bake mixture until lightly
browned, about 7 minutes. Remove pans from oven, and trim dark
edges. Cut remaining mixture in in each pan into 12 3-inch squares
to make a total of 24. Using a spatula, turn the squares over, and
return pan to oven. Bake an additional 5 minutes, and remove pan
from heat.
</P>
<P>
   4. To assemble: Remove pan of ice cream from freezer, and place
on top of a warm damp cloth for about 5 minutes. Using a knife
dipped in hot water, cut ice cream into 12 3-inch squares. Place a
square of ice cream on a Parmesan cookie, top with a spoonful of
marmalade, and top with another Parmesan cookie. Serve immediately,
or place in freezer until serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 12 ice cream sandwiches.

PRESIDENT FACES TRIALS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wife, Senator Clinton, recently bought
a $1.7 million house in Chappaqua, N.Y., but it's what happens next
that has me worried.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely heeding the financial advice I gave them in an earlier
column, the Clintons, who are reportedly $5.5 million in debt,
bought a house that was way more than they could afford. This will
give Bill and Hillary something to fight about every month when the
mortgage payment comes due, reminding them of the good old days in
the White House when they were fighting all the time.
</P>
<P>
   I can only assume that the Clintons heeded my other advice and
checked to make sure none of their neighbors were stock-car
enthusiasts who liked to fire up their engines late at night or
early on Sunday mornings, and that they also checked for rats in
their orange trees, assuming there are any orange trees in
Chappaqua, N.Y., which I doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What has me worried now is how Bill plans to maintain his new
home, which was built in 1889. The Clintons, after all, have spent
most of the past 20 years living as guests in executive mansions in
Little Rock, Ark., and Washington, D.C., where they have not had to
wrestle with the endless chores that make the average suburban
homeowner old, or dead, before his time.
</P>
<P>
   From what I've read in the paper, Bill Clinton is even more of a
home-repair boob than I am, which is extremely alarming given that
I am the kind of person who has been known to have trouble
operating a shower curtain.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting a school in Norfolk, Va., the other day, Clinton
drove a screw with a cordless electric drill, a tool he said he had
never seen before. I don't know if Clinton poked his eye out with
the unfamiliar tool or somehow managed to burn the school down, but
I assume he didn't or we probably would have heard about it by now.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of bipartisanship, I should point out that some
of our previous presidents were also deeply out of touch. President
Bush, for example, had never seen an electronic grocery scanner
before. The difference, however, is that you're a lot less likely
to ruin a wall with an electronic grocery scanner than you are with
a cordless drill.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how Clinton got roped into buying a 110-year-old
house. Maybe Hillary bullied him into it or maybe it was a slick
real-estate agent who used the sales pitch, ``They don't make 'em
like this anymore,'' which Bill will find to be irrefutably true
every time he tries to find a part at the hardware or
building-supply store.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton will quickly find that, in an old house, even the
simplest tasks are recipes for disaster. Take hanging a picture,
for instance. He will start by gently tapping a nail into the
smooth, plaster wall. (Let us give the man credit and assume he
uses a hammer for this job, not the butt-end of his new cordless
drill.) It doesn't look bad at first, but as soon as he hangs the
picture, the nail falls out. The picture drops on the original
hardwood floor, sending shards of glass everywhere. Worse, when the
nail came out it gouges a huge hole in the plaster.
</P>
<P>
   So what does America's most famous new homeowner do now? Find a
bigger nail, I'm guessing. This allows him to destroy another
picture frame, create an even bigger hole and, if he's especially
lucky, maybe hit an electrical conduit and short out the house.
</P>
<P>
   But even a man with the energy and perseverance of Bill Clinton
will eventually grow tired of shocking himself while at the same
time creating holes in the living-room wall big enough for Socks
the cat to jump through and will turn his attention to bathroom
repairs. This will be a great opportunity for the president because
he will get to acquaint himself with a bunch of unfamiliar tools,
such as a screwdriver, wrench and bucket. In the end, every
homeowner has to learn how to do things the hard way, by trial and
error and, of course, by writing large checks to professionals to
come in and clean up your mess.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll just leave Clinton alone to sort things out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's an intelligent man and I'm sure he wouldn't
begin any bathroom-repair project without turning the water off
first.

NOWADAYS, PEOPLE ARE CURSING LOUDLY AND PROUDLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BEN STEELMAN   
 The Morning Star, Wilmington, N.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ When Lenny Bruce wrote ``How to Talk Dirty
and Influence People'' in 1963, the standup comic was in
near-constant hot water with police for his profanity-laced
monologues.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years later, dozens of comedians have made a living,
and occasionally a fortune, using almost the same language that he
did.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, comedian George Carlin performed a sketch called
``Seven Dirty Words,'' based on _ and using as often as possible _
the seven words specifically banned from broadcast in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica Radio of San Francisco ran afoul of the Federal
Communications Commission for playing ``Seven Dirty Words'' over
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The case made it to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978. Justices
upheld the ban while adding, in the majority opinion, ``We have not
decided that an occasional expletive...would justify any sanction
or, indeed, that this broadcast would justify a criminal
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference 20 years make.
</P>
<P>
   While the Seven Dirties are still banned, network TV situation
comedies routinely slip in references to ``boobs'' when the
characters are not talking about idiotic guys, or the technical
term for a female dog as applied to naughty ladies.
</P>
<P>
   The language gets even raunchier on cable, where the little boys
of South Park get away with remarks once used in public only by
drill sergeants and sailors. On radio, Howard Stern still boldly
goes where no disc jockey ever talked before.
</P>
<P>
   And if you still haven't had an earful, buy a ticket at the
local movie house. This was the summer when South Park went to the
Big Screen, when Cartman, Kyle and Stan got to use even more foul
language.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Witch Project, one of 1999's ``sleeper'' movie hits, drew
less controversy for its horror plot and improvised acting than for
its stars' frequent use of words beginning with ``f'' and ``s.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders responded that the Blair Witch kids simply talked like
most ordinary college students.
</P>
<P>
   They may have a point. Based on field studies of language use,
women and children are swearing more often in public, according to
Timothy Jay, a psychologist and author of the book ``Cursing in
America.'' In a 1992 poll by Teenage Research Unlimited, 52 percent
of the 2,000 teens questioned said they thought cursing is cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's one more example of the decline of civility,''
said Connie Eble, a professor of English at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, who researches contemporary slang and
young people's speech patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it sometimes seemed (to paraphrase an innocent heroine
of another summer movie, Dick) that everyone was talking
``potty-mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The age of euphemism is over,'' said sociologist John Shelton
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination, drew flak from some other
Republicans for using profanity in an interview with Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And Timothy Boomer gained notoriety last summer when he fell out
of a canoe in a river near Standish, Mich. A policeman ticketed the
25-year-old under an 1897 Michigan law that forbids ``indecent,
immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language'' where women or
children might hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a state District Court judge in Standish sentenced
Boomer to four days of community service and a $75 fine. The
American Civil Liberties Union has announced that it will help him
appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   All societies have language taboos, said Eble, but in America,
those taboos have shifted in recent years. Taboos against racial
epithets have grown stronger, to the point that some people feel
pressured by ``political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet taboos against other words for sexuality and body functions
_ once used only among close friends or outside the earshot of
members of the opposite sex _have eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame it on the '60s,'' said Reed, a professor of sociology
at UNC-Chapel Hill and a social conservative who was appointed by
President Reagan to the board of the National Endowment for the
Humanities. ``But then, I blame everything on the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay said that exposure to swear words in movies, on TV and in
music expands the use of profanity. School-age youngsters pick up
the habit from their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Steinberg, executive director of the Penn National
Commission of Society, Culture and Community at the University of
Pennsylvania, also cited increased personal anonymity in society,
especially with the Internet. People are more likely to ``flame''
faceless strangers on the Web, with language they'd never use
against a neighbor in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the taboos have eroded. Eble said that, personally, she
is still extremely bothered by the use of the names of God and
Jesus Christ as epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, regard the issue as hopeless but not serious.
``I think there are worse things than language to worry about,''
Reed said.

MAKING EYE CONTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, Sept. 21)  
(lh) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the list of Two Kinds of People, there are those who make eye
contact and listen up and those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   For example, each individual has to decide his or her personal
response policy regarding the wait persons at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you could rationalize that you walk in, in a definite
pork chop mood and don't want to be dissuaded. But the recitation
of daily specials has been part of the dining experience for some
time now. What does it take to listen to what's in tonight's
special calzone?
</P>
<P>
   My foodie friend Alison and I got to talking about this at lunch
after I noted how attentive she was to the waitress. Not only did
she halt in mid-conversation when the woman approached our table &UR; , &LR; 
but she said ``Hi'' in a truly friendly manner and murmured
encouragingly over each special, cocking an eyebrow as if she had
never thought to team mussels with baby corn. I think she even
asked about the type of lettuce it would be bedded on.
</P>
<P>
   I gave her high marks for going way beyond the smile and a
``thank you'' I consider appropriate, and she said that she had
just been in New York at a restaurant where the entire table not
only avoided eye contact with the waiter but continued talking over
his greeting, the part where he shares his name and the entire list
of very tricky specials.
</P>
<P>
   She felt as if she had to hurry back to California and make up
for their abuse.
</P>
<P>
   I know the type. I've dined with people so dismissive of servers
that I feel compelled to order the special couscous just so they
will know that someone was listening.
</P>
<P>
   We asked our waitress that day about customers' listening
manners, and she said that most people at least pretend to pay
attention but there are those who act as if she's invisible or an
annoyance, which would be like forever being the mother of
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that we are just overloaded with information and
strangers yapping in our ear and simply need to select out. But is
this the place to take a stand?
</P>
<P>
   What about flight attendants? Does anybody listen to their
takeoff rundown anymore? I looked around a flight and hardly anyone
even glanced toward the front of the plane. They were talking and
flipping through magazines as if they had been through this a
million times and knew exactly where the exits were. But I think a
lot of fliers just want to look cool and world-weary. To pay
attention might have people wondering how they got so old and never
flew before.
</P>
<P>
   But this could be risky. Snub the wrong flight attendant, and
she may someday be standing over you saying, ``What did I tell you
about your flotation cushion?''
</P>
<P>
   No one likes to be ignored, although there are some people who
probably get used to it. Telephone solicitors must endure daily
abuse from people shouting that they don't want more credit cards
or they want to eat their dinner. And yet, someone must engage with
them, or they wouldn't keep calling back.
</P>
<P>
   How about toll takers? Do you say hello when you pay your money
to cross the bridge? OK, some toll takers act as if they don't want
to be bothered either, but have you ever tried forcing them to at
least grunt?
</P>
<P>
   Drive-through parking lot attendants are generally amiable and
certainly deserve more than asking for a receipt. Same with airport
shuttle drivers. Someone has to laugh at their banter.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling violinists? People selling roses at your table? You
can't keep looking into your soup.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, we were in an Italian restaurant, and without
warning the waiters started passing out song sheets. There was no
time to look to the beautiful people and figure out the coolness
rule.
</P>
<P>
   I chose to sing, because how often do you get to sing ``When the
moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie'' with two guys who look
like Al Pacino? You can always be cool tomorrow.

   WOMEN-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ During ``Not Lookin,''' a new duet
with her former beau, the urban love man K-Ci Hailey, Mary J. Blige
demonstrates how to stop a man cold. The song, from Ms. Blige's new
album, ``Mary,'' pits a woman seeking true affection against a man
out for pure pleasure. Throughout the 1990s, most discussions of
women's increased power in pop have focused on alternative-rock
transgressors like Tori Amos and Courtney Love or the songbirds of
Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair. Rhythm-and-blues artists sold albums
but were rarely viewed as culture shapers. Now, though, with
mainstream rock again becoming a male bastion, it is clear whose
music matters within the continuing emergence of women as equal
players in contemporary music. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY-NIGHT-LIVE (Undated) _ Nothing in popular culture can
be hip for 25 years. The culture turns over far too many times.
Icons become relics; objects of obsession become objects of
nostalgia. So what are we to make of ``Saturday Night Live''? The
one-time groundbreaking, precedent-setting, establishment-tweaking
comedy sketch show begins a decidedly well-established 25th season
on NBC next week, to be celebrated by a two-and-a-half-hour
prime-time special next Sunday night. Longevity is certainly not in
itself a claim on pop cultural relevance. Other shows have been on
longer but are in no danger of being labeled hip (e.g., ``The Price
Is Right''). But, apparently in defiance of both time and show
business convention, ``S.N.L.'' begins a 25th year still the most
pervasive influence on the art of comedy in contemporary culture.

   CALIGULA-FILM (Undated) _ This month, the re-release of a movie
that became infamous in 1980 for going too far will go even further
_ about 12 minutes further, according to its producer, Bob Guccione
of Penthouse magazine. ``Caligula,'' called by Newsweek ``a
two-and-one-half hour cavalcade of depravity,'' will now run nearly
two-and-three-quarters hours. The movie opened Friday in New York.

<P>
   JAKOB-THE-LIAR-FILM (Paris) _ ``Jakob the Liar,'' directed by
Peter Kassovitz and starring Robin Williams as the reluctant hero
Jakob Heym, opens in New York on Friday. The film, based on a 1969
novel by Jurek Becker, tells of a Jewish cafe owner who uses lies
to bring hope to a Polish wartime ghetto. By Alan Riding.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHABBY-BLACK-DANCE (New York) _ ``I'm supposed to look like a
disheveled, disgruntled old geisha,'' Beverly Blossom said
cheerfully, dressed in a long golden kimono and top hat and
sprawled in a convenient folding chair in a midtown rehearsal
studio. Next she swept across the floor in a bargain-basement black
satin Balenciaga cloak and thrift-shop gold dress, a toy monkey
drooping from her hand. Then, with the donning of another, slightly
shredded costume, she became both an aging beauty and a
bottom-patting old gigolo drawn together in a bittersweet tango.
``Who (italics)is(end italics) she?'' a visitor to the studio
whispered, eyes wide, as Ms. Blossom glided through the dizzying
array of characters she will portray in ``Dances in Shabby Black,''

   NINE-INCH-NAILS-ALBUM (New York) _ Trent Reznor can smile now.
``Everyone has this impression of me that I'm morose,'' he
complained. An interviewer pointed out that the albums he had made
as Nine Inch Nails were saturated in despair. ``Point taken,'' he
said. Reznor was caffeinated and voluble as he sat in a midtown
hotel room where he was doing interviews, sipping what was clearly
not his first cup of coffee and explaining how five years went by

``The Fragile.'' By Jon Pareles.

you don't like it now, just stick around for a while. Eventually,
something likable is bound to turn up. It's a pleasure to report,
for example, that the Museum of Modern Art's architecture and
design department is back on track after several lackluster
seasons. ``The Un-Private House,'' a current show has been a

 &HT;    Bradley slams Gore's environment record
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harshly criticizing Vice President Gore's record on
the environment, Friends of the Earth on Tuesday endorsed Bill
Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental group praised Bradley's leadership on the
environment when he was a senator from New Jersey and called Gore's
record, both in Congress and in the White House, disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore did an enormous service by raising issues such as ozone
depletion and global warming,'' said Mark Whiteis-Helm, spokesman
for Friends of the Earth political action committee. ``The fact
that he has done little to follow up on that is very disappointing.
We are not happy about having to inform the American public that Al
Gore is not as strong an environmentalist as the public
perception.''
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is mainly a symbolic victory for Bradley. With
about 20,000 members, Friends of the Earth is one of the smaller
environmental groups. The 30-year-old organization tends to
concentrate on international issues more than other environmental
groups do.
</P>
<P>
   The two largest environmental organizations, the League of
Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, both called the Friends of
the Earth endorsement of Bradley ``premature,'' and said they may
or may not offer endorsements of their own. LCV is the political
arm of the entire environmental movement, representing some 9
million people. The Sierra Club has about 500,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of information to hear from these
candidates,'' said LCV president Deb Callahan. ``Al Gore and Bill
Bradley have both been friends of the environmental community.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Weiss, the Sierra Club's political director and a former
activist in Democratic politics, said the Friends of the Earth
endorsement wouldn't change how people feel about Gore because
``there are many people across the country, environmentalists,
working on the Gore campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is as if the mayor of a small town in New Jersey
endorsed Gore,'' said Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the endorsement demonstrates that Gore, who has built
much of his reputation around his concern for the environment,
can't take the votes of the environmental community for granted.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore has been the administration's point
person on the environment and he represented the United States in
signing the global warming treaty in Kyoto, Japan. The treaty
hasn't yet been presented to the Senate for ratification because of
stiff opposition from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Earth based its endorsement of Bradley partly on
Gore's failure to seek more aggressive ozone protections in the
Kyoto treaty. The group also noted that Gore's voting record on the
environment in Congress, as compiled by LCV, was some 20 points
lower than Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of protecting the ozone layer to prevent global
warming, the central purpose of the Kyoto treaty, Friends of the
Earth grades the Clinton/Gore administration a ``D.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's been anointed the point person on the environment for
this administration,'' said Whiteis-Helm. ``If you want to paint
yourself as the enviro-man then you have a responsibility to live
up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Earth praised Bradley for his role in reforming
California water management in 1992, ending some government
subsidies and improving the ecology of California waterways. The
group noted that Bradley also led a 1996 filibuster against a plan
to open 20,000 acres of Utah wilderness for coal mining and oil
drilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help remind people that Bradley not only had a good
environmental record, but that he was focused on it over a long
period of time,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, Gore's spokeswoman, said Gore would continue to
fight for a ``balanced approach'' to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is going to fight to make sure there's a
clean and healthy environment,'' Moore said.

CEO OF DAIMLERCHRYLSYER'S SMART CAR UNT WILL RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Lars Brorsen, the chief executive of
DaimlerChrysler AG's struggling Smart car business, will resign at
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise resignation, which Daimler executives disclosed
here Tuesday at the Frankfurt international automobile show, came
just as sales of the quirky two-seater ``city car'' finally
appeared to be picking up.
</P>
<P>
   The Smart, a snub-nosed car with plastic body parts, began as a
joint venture between Daimler and the founder of Swatch watches.
But it had a horrendous start after it went on the market in the
fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Though Daimler built a factory able to turn out 200,000 cars a
year and projected first-year sales of 150,000, only 70,000 have
been sold so far, and sales were almost nonexistent in the first
three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the results improved in recent months after the company
reduced prices and added safety features. The company said it sold
9,500 Smart cars in June, 10,000 in July and 7,500 in August, a
month when many Europeans go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why Brorsen quit. Daimler executives said
Brorsen cited ``differences'' over business strategy after a recent
board meeting. The company has not named a successor, which
suggests that the resignation was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   News of Brorsen's resignation overshadowed the introduction of
two new Smart models in Europe: a diesel-powered version that gets
90 miles to the gallon and a sporty convertible that will cost
about $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company also introduced a racy ``concept car'' that looks
like a cross between a sports car and a dune buggy but uses much of
the same basic components as the standard Smart.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Hubbert, a DaimlerChrysler board member who substituted
for Brorsen at the car show Tuesday, acknowledged that initial
sales had fallen far below expectations. But he said Smart had
``achieved a turnover that is quite unique'' and praised the Smart
management team for ``an exceptional job under difficult
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand has polarized'' people ever since its inception,
Hubbert added, generating both vehement criticism and praise
because of its wildly unusual design.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler executives now predict sales of 80,000 Smart cars this
year and more than 100,000 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Smart, DaimlerChrysler's automotive lines are all
growing at good rates. Robert Eaton, co-chairman of the company,
said it would roll out 64 new car and truck models by 2004 and
invest $47 billion in development over the next three years.

ANOTHER BIG DEAL IN BRITAIN'S VOLATILE PUB INDUSTRY

<P>
   LONDON _ Seized by the ferment in Britain's pub industry,
Scottish &AMP; Newcastle PLC, the country's dominant brewer, said
Tuesday that it had agreed to buy 868 pubs, restaurants and budget
hotels from the ailing Greenalls Group PLC for $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came just days after Allied Domecq PLC completed a $4.4
billion sale of 3,500 pubs to the privately held Punch Taverns
Group Ltd. That deal left Punch Taverns and Nomura International
PLC as Britain's biggest bar owners. Smaller rivals like Bass PLC,
Whitbread PLC and Scottish &AMP; Newcastle must expand to compete more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement brought an immediate rise in the value of
Scottish &AMP; Newcastle's shares, which finished the day up 3.2
percent at 612 pence ($9.88) on the London Stock Exchange.
Greenalls stock fell nearly 2 percent, to 361 pence ($5.83).
Scottish &AMP; Newcastle said it would finance the purchase through
increased debt.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish &AMP; Newcastle, Britain's biggest brewer by market share,
has beer brands including Courage and Newcastle Brown Ale, and it
specializes in branded, managed pubs with names like the Rat and
Parrot.
</P>
<P>
   Like other brewers, it faces legal restriction under the
so-called Beer Orders _ a set of government rules implemented a
decade ago _ on the number of pubs and licensed premises it may
own. Scottish &AMP; Newcastle's limit is 2,937 outlets; the acquisition
would put it over that limit.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would therefore dispose of some of the 664
pubs it leases to independent managers and move toward a goal of
having most of its outlets under its own management. According to
the company, managed outlets yield more than 20 percent return on
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal provides a strong platform for us to outperform the
growth sectors on which we are now focused,'' said chief executive
Brian Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition includes 531 managed pubs, 234 pub-restaurants,
61 budget hotels and 42 other pubs. Scottish &AMP; Newcastle, based in
Edinburgh, said it would rename some of the pubs and restaurants
with its own brand names and use them as outlets for beers it brews
under license, including Foster's and Kronenbourg. Scottish &AMP;
Newcastle finance director Derek Wilkinson said the deal would
bring annual savings of $40 million by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Greenalls issued a profit warning in July because of what it
called ``challenging conditions'' for its pubs, restaurants and
drinks-wholesaling businesses. The company has said that it wants
to focus on health and fitness clubs and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's announcement, Greenalls said it would use the
proceeds from the deal to return $688 million to shareholders and
reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   Recent sales in the pubs business have set the stage for what
analysts expect to be consolidation in the spirits industry as
smaller players maneuver to compete with the giant Diageo PLC, the
world's leading maker of alcoholic beverages.

TALKS ON HOW TO AID COLOMBIA REVEAL DEEP FISSURES IN U.S. POLICY

<TEXT>
<P>
   With Colombia's government buckling under guerrilla attacks, a
thriving drug trade and the worst economy in decades, the Clinton
administration is putting together a major new effort to prop up
the country's democracy that will include hundreds of millions of
dollars in economic and military aid.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package, which is expected to be completed soon, will
have large amounts of new military equipment, including arms and
helicopters, as well as more intelligence support and training for
Colombia's army and police units, senior administration and defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also planning new moves that officials
hope will ease Colombia's economic crisis, strengthen the
criminal-justice system and help local governments in the country's
large, sparsely populated interior.
</P>
<P>
   But even before it has been completed, the plan is generating
strong reservations among some within the administration who fear
the United States is being drawn more deeply into a convoluted
civil conflict that has left tens of thousands dead over nearly
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a very dangerous mess,'' said a senior
official who has worked on Colombia. ``And we are going to be in
the middle of that mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Central American civil wars of the 1980s has the
United States been so tempted to come to the aid of a Latin
American ally threatened by an insurgency. Pushed by a small group
of Republican leaders in the Congress, the administration is
already giving Colombia $309 million this year, making it the
fourth-largest recipient of American aid after Israel, Egypt and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's new effort will mark a significant shift in
American policy toward Colombia after nearly two decades in which
it has focused almost entirely on combating the cocaine trade and
those who dominate it. While fighting drugs will remain a central
goal, the United States is about to make a broader commitment to
support Colombia's embattled government than it has in years.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had used months of
wide-ranging discussions about the aid to reconsider American
objectives and to press the government of President Andres Pastrana
to come up with a comprehensive strategy to address the country's
problems. Pastrana is expected to outline that strategy next week
in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly and in meetings with
officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has not yet decided how large its package of
aid will be, but the officials said that in their internal
discussions it ranged from $1 billion to $1.5 billion over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   They said the size of the package was not likely to be settled
until the White House and Congress resolve their increasingly
contentious fight over balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussions have also been complicated by deep divisions
within the administration itself over how and how deeply to get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Some more hawkish officials, led by the White House's
drug-policy adviser, former Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, are pressing
for a large increase in assistance to Colombia's armed forces.
Citing ``a drug-related emergency,'' McCaffrey has called for at
least $1 billion aid concentrated on the military and police.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, however, there are reservations about how
deeply to get involved with Colombia, a country with two leftist
guerrilla armies fighting the government, right-wing paramilitary
forces fighting the guerrillas, and civilians ever in the
crossfire. The perils of a stronger American role came into clearer
relief in July when a U.S. spy plane crashed into a mountainside
during a counterdrug mission, killing five American soldiers and
two Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department and the National Security
Council, in particular, have pressed to broaden Washington's agenda
in Colombia while trying to limit its involvement in the war. These
officials have played down the immediate threat to Pastrana's
government, arguing that a modest rise in military aid should be
balanced by support for social-development projects, the economy
and a negotiated settlement to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they have made it clear to the
Colombians that increased American support will come with pressure
for changes within Colombia, including greater efforts to clean up
human-rights abuses by the military, and a new, probably tougher
government approach to the peace talks with the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton administration officials say that they will
not dictate policies to Pastrana, some Colombian officials involved
in the aid negotiations already appear uncomfortable with the
growing American role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strategy,'' a senior Colombian official said curtly,
suggesting that the administration's elaborate search for a new
approach was little more than packaging for a new financing pitch
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aid to Colombia fell sharply after the Bush administration,
which had targeted the Andean countries in an attempt to stem the
flow of cocaine at its source. But American aid to the Colombian
military and police has risen steadily since 1996, and the
Colombian army has also bought new loads of American arms.
</P>
<P>
   The new engagement of the Clinton administration is partly a
consequence of its close ties to Pastrana, who came to office a
year ago. In the previous four years Washington had essentially
boycotted the government of his predecessor, Ernesto Samper, after
evidence emerged that his political campaign had taken huge
contributions from cocaine traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their early hopes for Pastrana, however, U.S. officials
generally describe his efforts to negotiate with the guerrillas as
a failure that has left the insurgents stronger and more defiant.
Nor do these officials hide their view that Colombia's multiple
crises may be beyond Pastrana's capacity to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's cocaine industry, which has long depended on coca
leaf from Peru and Bolivia, is becoming more self-sufficient as it
grows more of its own coca and a new, more potent strain of the
plant is introduced, intelligence analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the CIA estimated that Colombia could have produced
about 165 metric tons of cocaine from its own crop, up from 65
metric tons in 1993 and 80 metric tons in 1995. This year,
according to an internal government document, analysts expect
Colombian traffickers to produce as much as 250 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The increase comes despite a jump of nearly 50 percent in
American drug-eradication efforts last year, and it is concentrated
largely in fields that are guarded or taxed by leftist guerrillas
or right-wing paramilitary groups, the document indicates. Many
American officials believe the guerrillas _ particularly those of
the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia _ have reaped a
windfall from the coca boom that has turned them into a far more
serious military threat.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to build trust with the FARC, as the rebel group is
known, Pastrana withdrew army troops from a large swath of the
rebel-dominated countryside last November. The move drew open
dissent from his officer corps, however, and the guerrillas have
shown little sign of compromise since. In July, the talks were
suspended after the insurgents refused to accept observers in the
demilitarized zone, and the rebels launched one of their biggest
offensives in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana seems to have bent all the way over in a Gumby-like
way,'' an American military official said. ``He's about used up
what he's got to offer, and it is not working.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are less critical of Pastrana's
economic management, but his political standing has also been hurt
by economic troubles that were long in the making: the worst
recession in decades, a growing debt burden and an unemployment
rate that has reached nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The worsening situation began to command the attention of the
White House this summer, officials said, when an interagency
meeting presided over by President Clinton's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, turned from a discussion of Caribbean radar
installations to the turmoil in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a third-order issue that is going to become a
first-order issue,'' two officials quoted Berger saying.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Berger asked those present to consider what
additional aid Colombia needed. The initial result, however, was a
deluge of different and sometimes contradictory proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, McCaffrey struck preemptively, writing Cabinet
members to warn of an ``explosion of coca cultivation'' in
Colombia. His letter, which was quickly and widely leaked to the
news media, outlined $1 billion in new spending, most of it for
Colombia, including $360 million to help the army expand its reach
in southern Colombia and $120 million to increase the interdiction
of drug flights.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon and the State Department drew up their
own lists, and different priorities emerged. Law-enforcement
officials argued for more support for Colombian police anti-drug
operations and the country's judicial system. State Department
officials pushed proposals ranging from trade benefits to temporary
refuge for Colombian immigrants to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are getting policy by proposal rather than by planning,''
said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt. ``Everybody seems to agree, `Hey,
let's send some money down there.' But I have heard relatively
little discussion or debate about what the U.S. interests are.''
</P>
<P>
   White House and State Department officials said they had been
struggling to define those interests more clearly in a series of
meetings over the course of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these officials take pains to sound less
alarmed than McCaffrey and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have
grown increasingly critical of Clinton's policies. After visiting
Bogota last month, the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, said he was ``sobered but certainly
not panicked'' by Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some military analysts believe the Colombian army has
been doing better against the guerrillas in recent months.
Additionally, a secret assessment by American intelligence recently
estimated that the rebels' profits from the drug trade ranged from
perhaps $30 million to $100 million a year _ far less than the
amounts cited publicly by some officials, including McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's more deliberate approach also owes
much to battles being fought far from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the administration was caught off guard by an
emergency spending plan drafted by Republicans in Congress that
added $287 million in antidrug and military aid to Colombia almost
overnight. This year, officials said they are determined not to be
outflanked again, although prominent conservatives in the House
have drafted their own wish lists, including one by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., that calls for $930 million in new aid.
</P>
<P>
   So the administration has devised an early plan of its own. In
an effort to inject energy into the peace talks, the United States
will press both sides to heed the experience in countries like El
Salvador and Nicaragua and accept international mediation.
</P>
<P>
   And to shore up Colombia's economy, administration officials
said they are backing talks with the International Monetary Fund
for as much as $3 billion in financing, in addition to cash support
from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the bulk of American aid will go to military and
antidrug operations. The officials said it would probably include a
squadron of new helicopters for the Colombian army, a package of
excess equipment from the Pentagon and considerable training for
Colombian soldiers and police.
</P>
<P>
   American soldiers and advisers have already begun training a new
antidrug battalion of 950 soldiers and 200 police officers, which
is to finish its training in December. The officials said the
administration would most likely approve training for two more
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To deal with the drug problem,'' a senior administration
official said, ``you have to deal with the guerrillas intimately
involved in the drug problem.''

BUCHANAN, AGAIN. SIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patrick Buchanan, the obnoxious right-wing media
motormouth, is happy. Hardly anybody else is.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Buchanan is getting what he craves _ public attention
for his narrow-minded, white-male-supremacist, backward-looking,
isolationist political ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Voter interest has been in short supply during his campaign for
the Republican presidential nomination this year. His favorable
ratings have never risen higher than 5 percent and his negatives
have frozen at about 33 percent. The proportion of voters who say
they would never consider voting for him is about the same as those
who feel that way about Sen. Edward Kennedy, his philosophical
counterpart on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan came in only fifth with 7 percent in the August
Republican presidential straw poll in Iowa despite his famous
television face and a vigorous campaign to stir up blue-collar
workers who had backed his 1996 presidential drive. His candidacy
was over.
</P>
<P>
   It took a spot of political blackmail to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan began openly flirting with the idea of quitting
the GOP and running for the Reform Party presidential nomination,
Republican leaders suddenly discovered what a big deal he was. The
more the GOP panicked, the more interested Buchanan got in
deserting a party that has studiously ignored him since his
hard-nosed, disastrous 1992 GOP convention speech contributed to
President George Bush's defeat for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who at 60 is still living in the political and
cultural past, is having a lot of fun with this. But it's not a
done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who recently seized control of the
Reform Party from its founder Ross Perot, opposes Buchanan's
harshly judgmental views on social issues, which run counter to the
party's traditional tolerant stands. Ventura is searching elsewhere
for a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Reform Party is not organized in the ordinary sense.
It's a loose collection of similar-minded folks who have no
coherent agenda or hierarchy. No one is quite sure how to create a
logical nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the party's presidential nod could bring Buchanan $12
million in federal funds for a campaign he could not otherwise
finance. But Buchanan could bring the party something, too. He is
more likely than lesser-known fellows also suggested for the role
to attract the 5 percent minimum of the total turnout required to
keep qualifying for federal campaign funds. It would be a political
marriage of convenience, principles be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that's not such a bad thing. But it could artificially
warp the outcome of the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Assume that Buchanan, running on a third party ticket, gets
roughly 8 percent of votes cast, Perot's score last time.
</P>
<P>
   His votes would come largely from Republicans. Most Democrats do
not agree with Buchanan's agenda, particularly his insistence on
banning abortion without exception.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by GOP pollster Frank Luntz showed Buchanan
getting 6.5 percent of the total vote in a three-way trial heat
with Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. That
seems in line with what we already know. Buchanan is an ideologue
with a tiny but noisy following, not a serious presidential
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago his pitch for international trade limitations
appealed to blue-collar workers who used to vote for Ronald Reagan.
But that appeal largely vanished with the booming economy. His
ultraconservative take on cultural issues has never resonated with
Democrats or moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If the race between Bush and Gore, John McCain and Bill Bradley
_ or whomever _ is close, a GOP loss of even 2 percentage points
could toss the nomination to the Democrat. History is replete with
spoilers who ran to satisfy their own ambitions and destroyed their
party's prospects in the process. In the most famous example,
Theodore Roosevelt split the Republican vote with his Bull Moose
Party in 1912, allowing Democrat Woodrow Wilson to defeat GOP
President William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Would Taft have avoided World War I and made a better, more
permanent peace? We'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   But if the 2000 race is not close, Buchanan cannot make much of
a difference. He can, however, make a great fool of himself, either
reaching unsuccessfully for the $12 million or spending it. His
egocentric notion that he can actually win the White House with his
nutty ideas is strictly delusional.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign will not be pretty. It will not be enlightening. It
will probably not be good for the country. But it's the American
way.
</P>
<P>
   And Buchanan will have a good time back in the spotlight. At
least he isn't boring. Remember when he said that women who wanted
equal rights reminded him of the freaks in the bar scene of ``Star
Wars?'' This guy is pathetically easy to detest.

MEXICAN BEACHES FROM A (ACAPULCO) TO Z (ZIHUATANEJO)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All coasts are not created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in Mexico, the land of a thousand (or so) beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some are better for surfing, some for sunning, some for
snorkeling. The one you take the kids to might not be the best one
for your second honeymoon. And it's far too easy to end up as the
only older couple in a sea of college-kid revelers, or a would-be
swinging single in family land.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you know where to go?
</P>
<P>
   Easy. We've been to each of these resorts (yeah, tough job, but
we take our work seriously) and our studied sunning has produced
this guide to 10 popular Mexican resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Read on. And then go buy some sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ACAPULCO
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: The original glamour girl of Mexican resorts,
Acapulco is situated dramatically in the mountains on the edge of
the Pacific. It's where jet-setters headed in the '50s and '60s
(and where, according to a legend almost nobody believes, the
margarita was invented).
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Families, singles, anyone seeking old-fashioned
glamour.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: Acapulco is home to some of the most beautiful
and luxurious hotels in Mexico, including the famous Las Brisas,
with its private pools attached to some rooms. The night life is
lively and upscale, the dining continental, the shopping plentiful.
(In a welcome move, beach vendors have been relocated to a separate
shopping area, so you can sun without being approached by hawkers.)
You can't go home without seeing the famed cliff divers, who do
their thing daily at La Quebrada, and have since 1934.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: Tourism officials say the beach and bay have been all
cleaned up, but it's still not as pristine and dazzling as those on
the Gulf of Mexico side. It can be expensive. And if you don't
venture far from your high-rise hotel, you'll never realize you
went to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   NEW: The CICI water park, which offers seal and dolphin shows
and water slides and rides, was recently renovated. And in the
Acapulco Diamante area, the latest area of development, the new
Vidafel Mayan Palace is spectacular, with grounds filled with
reflecting pools, waterfalls, giant Mayan statues and canals plied
by flower-filled boats.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Acapulco Convention and Visitors Bureau Web
site is at www.acapulco-cvb.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BAJA
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: The desert tip of the Baja California peninsula
has developed into a busy resort area with two distinctly different
towns. San Jose del Cabo is quieter, more traditional, with a
traditional downtown plaza. Cabo San Lucas, pegged Cabo San Loco by
some visitors, is the party town. And hotels and resorts stretch
nearly all the distance in between.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Golfers, fishing enthusiasts, whale watchers; singles
and young couples flock to the party atmosphere of Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: Sport fishing for marlin, sailfish and
swordfish is a big activity, on anything from a posh cruiser to a
simple ``panga'' owned by a local. Golf is popular, too, especially
at the new Jack Nicklaus-designed course. Beachgoers might see
migrating gray whales off the coast, particularly between January
and March.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: Cabo San Lucas is packed with American-style spots
like Planet Hollywood, often at the expense of locally flavored
hangouts. The luxury of many of the resorts doesn't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   NEW: Las Ventanas al Paraiso _ managed by the Rosewood Hotel
folk who also maintain Dallas' Mansion on Turtle Creek _ is a hot
new luxury hotel. It claims the largest suites in Mexico (nearly
1,000 square feet), a restaurant managed by a former Mansion chef,
a high-end spa and perhaps the world's fanciest tequila bar.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CANCUN
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: Located on the Yucatan Peninsula, which juts
into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, Cancun was largely a
stretch of empty beach until it opened for business in 1972. An
easy jaunt from Texas, it has also become Mexico's most popular
beach resort, with more than 25,000 hotel rooms, many of them in
huge, elaborate beach-side high-rises, and a seemingly endless
supply of restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: High school and college kids on spring break or
graduation trips; conventioneers; families.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: It's the beach, stupid; this site was selected
for development by data-crunching tourism experts, and they got
that part right. Cancun is situated on a truly beautiful stretch of
beach, with white sand and sparkling turquoise water.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive development means there's plenty to do, from water
parks to shopping to restaurants to water sports like parasailing
and snorkeling. The bar and club scene is lively, varied and can go
late into the night. And it's a good ``starter vacation'' for
travelers new to Mexico; no Spanish is really necessary.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: And that, for others, is the chief gripe about
Cancun: It's possible to spend a week here and never realize you're
in Mexico. The joint is packed with U.S. restaurants (Tony Roma's!
T.G.I. Friday's!) and retailers (The Gap!). Everybody speaks
English. Some of your fellow vacationers may be largely focused on
seeing just how much tequila they can put away. And though you can
get good deals on package trips, food and beverage and cab fares
here can cost more than nearly anywhere in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   NEW: Within the last year, three nature parks have opened within
an hour of Cancun. The closest, Tres Rios, is just 30 minutes away
and offers horseback riding on the beach, walking and bicycle tours
of the jungle, and swimming in ``cenotes,'' places where
underground rivers break through to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour away is Xpu-ha, featuring nature trails and a bird
sanctuary. About the same distance away is Actun Chen, where
vacationers can explore caves in a jungle setting, in close range
to spider monkeys and iguanas.

</P>
<P>
   COZUMEL
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: This small island in the Caribbean, just off the
coast between Cancun and Playa del Carmen, has long been known as a
diver's destination. No wonder; its clear water hosts the
second-largest reef in the world.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Divers. And snorkelers.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: The diving and snorkeling really can be as
spectacular as advertised. The friendly town of San Miguel, the
island's ``only'' town, has decent shopping and dining. And there's
a good range of hotels, from clean budget operations to luxury
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: The beach isn't as good as the other Mexican
Caribbean coasts. Though there's good dining and some night life,
revelers expecting Cancun-style liveliness will be disappointed;
divers tend to go to bed relatively early.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HUATULCO
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: One of Mexico's newest developments, hotels
started opening in this Pacific resort only in the late '80s. A
series of nine bays stretches along the coast, providing beautiful
settings for luxury hotels and all-inclusive resorts.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Beach lovers; couples and honeymooners; those looking
for a newer, quieter resort.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: Secluded and small, this full-service resort
offers privacy that others don't, with boats available to take you
to the nearly private, sandy coves. All-inclusive resorts are
popular here.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: It might be ``too'' secluded for some; development
has outpaced the tourists, and a number of retail spots haven't yet
been occupied, making parts of the resort seem almost abandoned.
Guests can't easily walk from hotel to hotel, and those staying at
the beach will need a car or taxi to get to the small but pleasant
downtown area of shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAZATLAN
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: This is the northernmost of the large Pacific
resorts, and has been attracting water sports lovers since the
first tourist fishing expeditions in the '40s.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Families, fishing enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: Sport fishing, boating and other water sports,
such as windsurfing and parasailing. The night life, especially in
the beach zone, can approach Acapulco's for liveliness, though it
doesn't seem as upscale. Mazatlan's downtown, like that of Acapulco
and Puerto Vallarta, is a vibrant place, full of shops and market
areas, and interesting architecture and a fun place to wander. The
resort attracts a larger number of Mexican tourists than some
others, so it has less of an overt U.S. flavor and, often, lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: The so-called golden zone on the beach, site of most
large tourist hotels, still strikes some as overly glitzy. The
beach, though pleasant, isn't as beautiful as the ones on the
Caribbean coast, and the diving and snorkeling aren't as enticing,
either.
</P>
<P>
   NEW: Two marinas are under construction on the north end of the
beach, and when they open, they'll give Mazatlan the largest such
operation in Mexico. More luxury hotels and condos are planned for
this area as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAYAN RIVIERA
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: Stretching more than 60 miles, from south of
Cancun to the archaeological site of Tulum, this newly christened
strip of beaches includes the relaxed beach town of Playa del
Carmen, the diver's dream of Akumal, and newer resorts such as
Puerto Aventuras.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Beach fans looking for a more laid-back, authentically
Mexican vacation; independent travelers; veteran Mexican
vacationers who've seen everything else.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: The soft white-sand beaches and azure water
are at least the equal of Cancun's, and possibly even more
beautiful. Even better, it's relatively easy to get a stretch of
beach to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: If you're looking for rollicking night life, keep
looking. In Playa, for instance, the streets start rolling up about
midnight; most vacationers head for the hotel after dinner and
drinks and, on a big night, listening to a live band. And after a
few days, you may feel you've seen every restaurant and shop each
of these relatively small resorts has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   NEW: This section of Mexico's Caribbean is growing faster than
any other; a new resort, restaurant or major shop opens almost
every month.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Unlike most of the other destinations we
profiled, there is no major aiport here. Fly into Cancun and rent a
car or take a taxi. (If you're at one of the pricier hotels, they
might arrange transport.) Or fly into Cozumel, and you can get a
high-speed ferry over to Playa for less than $10.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PUERTO ANGEL/PUERTO ESCONDIDO
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: These like-minded neighboring beach towns on the
Pacific Coast, about 250 miles from Acapulco and 75 miles from
Huatulco, aren't resorts of the type many U.S. travelers expect
from Mexico. They're filled with small, basic (occasionally even
grungy) hotels and inexpensive restaurants serving fresh seafood.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Surfers, hippies, backpackers, budget travelers.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: The surf here is so good, athletes flock here
from all over the world; even if you don't surf, it's fun to watch.
Much less expensive than the shinier, newer resorts, both towns
give off a laid-back, friendly vibe that tends to attract a younger
crowd, plus backpacking Europeans. If you want to settle in for a
month or two on a budget, this is the place.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: If you're into creature comforts and upscale resorts,
this isn't the spot for you; lodging and dining spots tend toward
the rustic. There's little to do beyond sit on the beach or surf,
and the night life is largely nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   NEW: Nothing much. Which, of course, is part of the charm.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: There's actually a small airport at Puerto
Escondido, with connecting flights from Mexico City, Huatulco and
Oaxaca. More likely, fly into Huatulco on a charter and rent a car
for the scenic coastline drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PUERTO VALLARTA
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: Spreading along mountain cliffs and
champagne-colored beaches midway down the Pacific coast, just below
the point where the Sea of Cortez spills into the vast Pacific,
this Mexican jewel has aged gracefully. Touted in the 1950s as a
``little Acapulco,'' tiny little PV (as regulars call it) changed
forever when movie director John Huston chose to film his classic
``The Night of the Iguana'' here. Once the Hollywood press and the
world learned that Liz Taylor was hanging out here with new lover
Richard Burton, growth exploded.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Spring breakers and party hounds are drawn to the new
half, south of downtown; lovers of all ages seek the romantic
environs of the cobblestone village and the jungle-shadowed beaches
to the north.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: A delightful sense of place is found in the
simple, old-world town bisected by the Rio Cuale, where village
women still scrub their wash and where donkeys still climb the
steep, narrow streets; right in town is an inexpensive enclave of
older, rustic cottages called Molino de Agua. Up the coastal road
are charming beaches and boat rides to distant, secluded pieces of
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: The larger hotels and resorts are almost too perfect
and pretty, and they're removed from the essence of PV.
</P>
<P>
   NEW: La Jolla de Mismaloya is a glorious resort overlooking the
beach where ``Iguana'' was filmed. New restaurant choices include
Le Bistro Jazz Cafe, where you can skip the Mexican and have crab
sashimi or steak in brandy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ZIHUATANEJO/IXTAPA
</P>
<P>
   WHERE AND WHAT: Along the extensive and very generous Pacific
coast of Mexico _ roughly 130 miles north of Acapulco and a little
more than 200 miles south of Puerto Vallarta _ are a pair of sister
towns that are anything but twins.
</P>
<P>
   Zihuatanejo, which is pronounced ``zee-what-tah-NAY-hoe'' but
usually just called ``zee-whah,'' is said to have been discovered
by Cortez and company in 1524. John Wayne brought his buddies
fishing here in the 1940s _ and it was the destination for Tim
Robbins' escaped convict in ``The Shawshank Redemption.'' Still a
pleasant, quiet fishing village, it was joined in the late 1960s by
the resort town called Ixtapa (''ees-TAH-pah''), created five miles
north by the Mexican government tourism arm.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GOES: Honeymooners and other lovers seeking old-fashioned,
often luxurious escape.
</P>
<P>
   STAR ATTRACTIONS: A wonderful, authentic fishing village with a
delightful marketplace offering bargains on everything from leather
to baskets, textiles and flowers, lavish meals at modest prices,
beautiful lodgings that don't break the bank and a series of
beaches where you can sun, eat, drink or buy freshly caught snapper
from fishermen who bring in the day's catches.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWBACKS: A pronounced lack of Mexico is felt in Ixtapa, which
is a sterile arrangement of large, modern hotels, shopping centers
and overpriced restaurants.

 &HT;    NFL brass won't admit playing on turf harmful; survey shows
players prefer grassBy Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Clark Gaines watched replays of New York Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde rupturing his left Achilles' tendon
Sunday, he shook his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days before, Jets wide receiver Wayne Chrebet had broken
his foot playing in an exhibition game on the artificial turf of
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines, a regional director for the NFL Players Association,
blames artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries have devastated the Jets, who were a popular
favorite to return to their first Super Bowl since the 1968 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Testaverde's injury and Chrebet's injury were
probably two of the most most ridiculous injuries I've seen, and
they could have been avoided,'' Gaines said. ``When you look at the
non-contact injuries that occur on grass versus the non-contact
injuries that occur on artificial turf, it's no contest. It's
probably two or three times higher on turf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chrebet broke his foot jogging. How can you break your foot
jogging? He was going across the field in motion and turned up
field and broke his foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is only one player on a long list of star players,
including teammate Leon Johnson, who were hurt in Week 1 of the
1999 NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit wide receiver Herman Moore will miss at least a month
after spraining his left knee. Rookie running back Ricky Williams
of New Orleans is hobbling with a sprained left ankle, and
Tennessee Titans cornerback Charles Fisher's career might be over
because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The players association has conducted surveys of its members
every two years since 1994, Gaines said. In last season's survey,
the players named Giants Stadium as the fourth-worst playing
surface in the NFL, he said. The artificial turf in Philadelphia's
Veterans Stadium, Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium and Pittsburgh's
Three Rivers Stadium were considered the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven percent of the players indicated they prefer to
play on natural grass over artificial turf, as opposed to 5 percent
who favor fake grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, the players made no beefs about it in terms
of how they feel,'' Gaines said. ``The league knows how the players
feel. But the league has decided to do nothing about it. The teams
have consistently let their investment _ the players _ play on an
unsafe surface. The players don't want to, but they're forced to
play on turf in games.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, vice president of public relations for the NFL,
said the league has conducted scientific studies ``for decades
since artificial turf was first introduced.'' Dr. John Powell, an
athletic trainer in Michigan and Iowa, conducted a
league-sanctioned study in the 1980s that found little difference
between the severity and number of injuries on turf and grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, injuries occur on both surfaces,'' Aiello said.
``The scientific research we've done over the years has shown one
thing _ there's not a significant increase in injuries when playing
on turf. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``What about (Miami quarterback) Dan Marino tearing his
Achilles' in 1993 on grass in Cleveland?'' he asked. ``Why don't
people say that grass caused his leg injury? We recognize that
players prefer to play on grass, but let's stick to the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Medlin, head trainer of the Atlanta Falcons, says
Testaverde's injury probably wasn't caused by playing on artificial
turf. ``If it's going to go, it's going to go,'' Medlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Medlin said the Falcons, who play on artificial turf in the
Georgia Dome, suffer the same amount of injuries on turf and grass,
but he said the injuries on the artificial stuff tend to be more
severe.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler, recovering from a pulled
right hamstring he suffered in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 17-14
loss to Minnesota, has suffered numerous concussions when his head
hits the artificial turf, which is put down over concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``That surface isn't going to give,'' Medlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The municipalities that control the stadiums often are reluctant
to replace the turf, Gaines said. The stadiums also are used for
music concerts and other events, which could destroy a grass
surface. Gaines estimated the cost of installing grass at $1.5
million. The Jets signed Testaverde to a $19.5 million extension
before this season.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets and Giants lease Giants Stadium from the New
Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which has experimented with
grass each of the past two preseasons. Aiello said the group is
considering installing grass permanently next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say to the teams, 'If you're going to make a
multi-million-dollar investment in a player, when are you going to
put him on a safe surface?'' Gaines said. ``It's a bad business
decision.''

`AMERICAN BEAUTY' IS A RARE GEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A disturbing, searing and painfully funny look at
American life at the end of the 20th century, ``American Beauty''
begins with an overhead shot of an idyllic suburban tract and a
voice-over from Kevin Spacey that explains much of what is to come:
``My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood. This is my
street. This is my life. In less than a year, I'll be dead. Of
course, I don't know that yet. In a way, I'm dead already.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester, brilliantly played by Spacey, is anything but
self-aware. But early in the film, he experiences a moment of
awakening that causes him to realize that his whole life is a sham.
And Lester understands that he can't fake it any more. Life is too
short. So he makes up his mind to do what he wants and say how he
feels _ and he'll deal with the repercussions, one by one, as they
come.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the reverberations from Lester's stirring are many
and far-reaching. In his marriage and in his neighborhood, Lester
is surrounded by people trapped in deep, intense denial. These
lost, lonely souls try to beat back the encroaching isolation by
acquiring the appropriate things, looking the right way and
conforming with cultural definition of normalcy. Underneath it all,
though, they are in solitary confinement with no possibility of
parole.
</P>
<P>
   With a remarkable resonance, ``American Beauty'' is able to
capture all this angst in ways that are both touching and
hilarious, agonizing and amusing. It hovers constantly between a
laugh and a tear, often prompting both responses in the same
moment. This movie is an absolute gem, unlike any film we've seen
this year or, for that matter, any other.
</P>
<P>
   Lester, when we meet him after that introductory voice-over,
lives in a world he loathes. His job (he has spent 14 years writing
for a media magazine) is soul-shattering; his marriage numbingly
soulless. Lester's wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), seems from
outward appearances to be the picture of fulfillment. But she's
more obsessed with the image of success than with the actual
rewards of prosperity. Their teen-age daughter, Jane (Thora Birch),
hates both of them, largely (and correctly) believing that she's an
afterthought in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Burnhams aren't the only ones grasping at straws in
``American Beauty.'' Jane's Lolita-like friend, Angela (``American
Pie's'' Mena Suvari) hides her insecurities behind her overt
sexuality, which she trains on Lester after meeting him. Next door
lives a cold, retired Marine colonel (Chris Cooper,
heart-wrenching), his catatonic wife (Allison Janney) and son,
Ricky (Wes Bentley), a former mental patient who doesn't
participate in life as much as watch it through the lens of a video
camera.
</P>
<P>
   The only happy people in this anonymous suburb seem to be the
gay couple (Scott Bakula and Sam Robards) who the give the
colonel's homophobia a good workout as they jog by every morning.
(Nothing like that on the military base.)
</P>
<P>
   These characters continually defy any and all presumptions,
which is one of the many outstanding things about Alan Ball's
utterly original screenplay. Likable one moment, reprehensible the
next, everyone here resists judgment and condescension. These are
fully realized human beings, with all the messy virtues and faults
that go along with that status.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sam Mendes, a Broadway veteran making his feature-film
debut here, gives the movie a stunning visual fluidity, full of
knockout imagery and artful subtlety. (Veteran cinematographer
Conrad Hall was undoubtedly a help.) Mendes' genius is also evident
in the performances he wrings out of his cast: Spacey, completely
convincing as the Everyman, thoroughly winning with his
pitch-perfect comic timing; Birch, a revelation as the vulnerable
daughter; and Bentley, devastating, playing the lonely boy next
door.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect a movie with all this anger, rage and
desolation to be a pretty grim affair, yet, out of the heartbreak,
come scenes of bracing comedy, exhilaration and, finally, hope. We
may know that Lester is going to die, but his journey is one of the
most compelling, surprising and enjoyable cinematic voyages we've
seen in quite some time. &QL;

 &HT;    Lewis may be key to Tennessee redemption
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Jamal Lewis is a laid-back guy. Likes to have
fun. Doesn't sweat the small stuff. Doesn't have the word
``nervous'' in his vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   But not this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee running back performed his required duty during
media day Tuesday, but his mind was somewhere else. He already was
focusing on Gainesville, Fla., and Saturday night's big showdown
between No. 2 Tennessee and No. 4 Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For Tennessee, it is a chance to win two in a row over Florida.
The Vols also will be trying to win in Gainesville for the first
time in the '90s. For Lewis, however, the game represents a shot at
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, from Atlanta's Douglass High, was a highly regarded
freshman when Tennessee last visited the Swamp in 1997. The
coaching staff knew Lewis could run. But it didn't know whether he
learned enough to pick up the complicated blitzes of the Florida
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than risk the health of quarterback Peyton Manning in the
third game of the season, Lewis carried only five times against the
Gators, and the Vols gained just 45 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee lost the game 33-20 and critics said Lewis should have
been used more. Lewis went on to be the nation's top freshman
running back with 1,364 yards rushing for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I would have liked to have gotten a few more snaps,''
Lewis said, ``because I just wanted to help make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal got only got a few carries in that gam,'' quarterback
Tee Martin said, ``but he wanted lot more, I can tell you that. You
have no idea how hungry he is to go down to Gainesville.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis might have to be the difference if Tennessee is going to
break its six-game losing streak at Florida:
</P>
<P>
   _ The team that has gained the most yards rushing in the game
each year in the '90s has won.
</P>
<P>
   _ When a Tennessee runner exceeds 100 yards, the Vols have won
33 games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 10 of Phillip Fulmer's 11 losses, no Tennessee back reached
100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any big game, it's important that you can run the
football,'' Fulmer said. ``With those guys, you really want to stay
ahead in down and distance. So, sometimes a 2- or 3-yard run is not
a bad play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has gone over 100 yards in 11 of his last 14 starts. He
had 159 yards on 25 carries in Tennessee's opener against Wyoming.
The Volunteers' offensive line could be the school's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that to win we have to run the ball,'' Lewis said. ``I
feel really good about my offensive line and the other backs we
have. I think we'll do okay.''
</P>
<P>
   No Tennessee back has rushed for more than 100 yards against
Florida since Tony Thompson in 1990, but chances of breaking 100
look pretty good for Lewis. Last year in Knoxville, he had 82 yards
on 21 carries against a Florida defense that led the SEC in every
statistical category. Florida coach Steve Spurrier also knows what
being able to run the ball means in this game. His Florida teams
are is 52-1 when a back goes over 100 yards. The Gators had
minus-13 yards rushing in last year's loss to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing 95th in the nation in rushing last season,
Florida has recommitted itself to the running game. Redshirt
freshman Earnest Graham has 223 yards on 30 carries in the Gators'
first two wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get back to the line of scrimmage last year,''
Spurrier said. ``If we can't run a little bit, we'll be in for a
long night, I would imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING TO VICTORY
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Florida-Tennessee game in the '90s has been
the team most successful running the ball.
</P>

CHINA'S CELEBRATORY SLOGANS NOT EXACTLY SPONTANEOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Just in case any of the 1.3 billion people in China
are having trouble imagining what to chant or inscribe for the
nation's 50th birthday blowout on Oct. 1, the Communist Party
issued a list of approved slogans Tuesday. Fifty of them, to be
exact.
</P>
<P>
   These are more than suggestions: They are literally the only
messages allowed on posters, banners and the lips of celebrants as
China marks the first half century of the People's Republic. On
this carefully scripted occasion, free-lance thought _ even in
praise of the party, let alone to plea for, say, the repressed
Falun Gong spiritual movement or the cause of Tibet _ is most
definitely forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the list, published Tuesday morning in the party
newspaper People's Daily, the specially picked 500,000 people who
will jam Tiananmen Square on the big day will need some rehearsing
before they try any chants. The 50 slogans were crafted by the
wordsmiths of the Propaganda Department to cover every current
party theme. Terse or poetic they are not.
</P>
<P>
   The list ranges from the bland (``Warmly celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!'')
to the insipidly inspirational (``Unite as one, fear no
difficulties, struggle hard, be persistent, dare to win!'')
</P>
<P>
   It includes anachronistic nods to the past: ``Rely on the
working class wholeheartedly!'' _ a relic of the Mao era coined
long before the government began sloughing off redundant workers in
state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   And it includes the truly contemporary, such as this sly
mouthful adapted from the landmark party decision in 1997 to
elevate the standing of private enterprise, known by the code
phrase ``diverse forms'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Adhere to the basic economic system with public ownership
dominant and diverse forms of ownership developing side by side,
and `to each according to his work' as the main distribution form
and with other forms as well!''
</P>
<P>
   Many slogans are retained from the post-1978 Deng Xiaoping era
of economic opening and market reforms, a process still unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the primary slogan of recent years included: ``Hold
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and put forward the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
21st century!'' But there is also Deng's own crucial if oblique
call for shedding Maoist thought: ``Emancipate the mind, seek truth
from facts and firmly promote reform and opening up!''
</P>
<P>
   In private meetings, paraders from various professions have been
instructed on the particular slogans they should chant, sometimes
(thankfully) abbreviated versions of those on the published list.
Thus, teachers and students are expected to shout: ``Value
knowledge!'' and ``Reinvigorate the nation with science and
technology!''
</P>
<P>
   Government workers, stressing the modern side of things, will
shout ``Strengthen the legal system!'' and ``Serve the people
wholeheartedly!''
</P>
<P>
   There is also, of course, the obligatory ``Rally closely around
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core
and work hard with one heart, greet the new century with new
achievements!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Jiang's own inspiring statements have their own entries,
like ``Stress theoretical study, political awareness and good
conduct!'' _ the theme of the ``three stresses'' rectification
campaign this summer inflicted on cadres in their workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   There is no ``Long Live Chairman Mao!'' although his ``thought''
remains enshrined in a slogan along with those of Marx, Lenin and
Deng.
</P>
<P>
   As dated as some of the slogans seem, they are indicative of
current preoccupations at the top. Likewise, the slogans of earlier
anniversaries practically tell the story of the half century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the first anniversary, slogans included: ``Liberate
Taiwan!'' Liberate Tibet!'' ``Fight the American Imperialist
Invasion of Korea!'' ``Long Live Chairman Mao!'' and ``Long Live
the Leader of the World's People: Stalin!''
</P>
<P>
   From 1955: ``Resolutely purge all counterrevolutionaries!''
</P>
<P>
   From 1959, shortly before the rupture with the Soviet Union:
``Long live the unbridled friendship between the Chinese and Soviet
people!'' And reflecting Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward there
was, ``Strive to complete and surpass the production responsibility
of 12 million tons of steel!'' and ``Long live the people's
communes!''
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, the festivities included: ``Vietnam must win, American
must lose!'' And through the poisonous decade that followed, until
Mao's death in 1976, common slogans were ``Long live the victory of
the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!'' and ``Long live Mao
Zedong Thought.''

BRITAIN'S MARKS &AMP; SPENCER TO OVERHAUL U.S. OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Marks &AMP; Spencer PLC, the once-expansive British
retailer, announced a major overhaul of its U.S. operations
Tuesday, saying it would sell the Kings supermarkets in New Jersey
while promoting Brooks Brothers menswear stores in an effort to
bolster brands with international allure.
</P>
<P>
   The august store chain, which is still Britain's biggest
clothing retailer, has been under siege at home from rivals
clambering into the market for young adult clothing, leaving Marks
&AMP; Spencer stores looking under-inspired and overpriced. At the same
time, it has pared back overseas operations, closing stores in
Canada, France and Germany since last April. There had been
speculation among analysts that Brooks Brothers might be among the
next to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Marks &AMP; Spencer said, however, that
Brooks Brothers' 148 stores in the United States, along with 71
stores in Japan and six franchise operations in Hong Kong and
Taiwan had ``the potential for growth both in the United States and
internationally.'' Brooks Brothers sales in fiscal 1999 totaled
$550 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer bought Brooks Brothers in 1987 for $770 million
and paid $110 million for Kings one year later. With annual sales
of $400 million, Kings' 25 stores in New Jersey are currently
valued in the region of $190 million. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
has been appointed to handle the sale. Mark Ashman, a Marks &AMP;
Spencer spokesman, said no specific talks with buyers were under
way. ``It's an open field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale represents a remarkable shift for the British company,
one of the first to venture beyond national frontiers for new
business. Now, it is reining in its U.S. operations at just the
moment when Wal-Mart Inc., the biggest U.S. retail chain, is making
forays into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer said it would seek to promote Brooks Brothers
and planned to introduce the store to Europe, starting in Britain.
``We believe it has got quite a lot of legs and London would be our
first target,'' said finance director Robert Colville.
</P>
<P>
   The company's pullback from the United States is the latest of
many indications that the British retailer is trying to escape the
problems that led to a major management shake-up late last year as
both profits and share-price tumbled. But the announcement Tuesday
did nothing to help the shares, which fell 2.5 pence, or nearly 1
percent, to 373.5 pence, or about $6. The shares are down about 16
percent since last November's management crisis. Last May, the
company said its profits for fiscal 1999 were down by half to $596
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ashman, the spokesman, said the company's new strategy meant
developing subsidiaries with ``international appeal'' while
shedding those without an international brand.
</P>
<P>
   The changes reflect efforts by Peter Salsbury, who took over as
chief executive earlier this year, to lower costs and lure
customers back to Marks &AMP; Spencer's stores, once regarded as models
of high quality and good value.
</P>
<P>
   Ashman said the company is close to completing a refurbishment
of 100 Main Street stores, has introduced a new fall fashion line
and plans to introduce more innovative food lines. In October,
Marks &AMP; Spencer plans to take an unusually bold step into the
technological future: as of October, Ashman said, Marks &AMP; Spencer
will begin selling cellular phones alongside its clothing.

DANNY BONADUCE IN, FRANK AND FROSTY OUT AT STAR-FM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Danny Partridge has replaced Frosty and Frank in
the morning at Star 98.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bonaduce, who played the freckled imp on ABC-TV's ``The
Partridge Family'' in the '70s, joins Jamie White for ``The Jamie &AMP;
Danny Show,'' beginning at 5 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   White previously co-hosted Star 98's morning show with Frosty
Stillwell and Frank Kramer, who will both remain part of station
owner AMFM Inc.'s talent pool, said Ken Christensen, Star's vice
president and general manager, who added that there were no
immediate plans for the duo. AMFM is the nation's largest radio
broadcasting company, with 446 stations in 101 markets, including
local outlets Mega 100, the Beat, KBIG-FM, KLAC-AM, KOST-FM and
KFI-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Bonaduce, 40, hosted mornings at New York's
WTJM-FM and before that worked at stations in Detroit and Chicago.
Bonaduce had success in the Midwest, but his New York program was
overshadowed by shows like Howard Stern's.
</P>
<P>
   White said she grew up watching the red-haired Bonaduce on TV,
adding she was ``delighted over the opportunity to work
side-by-side with him.''
</P>
<P>
   White, Stillwell and Kramer were brought to Star from Denver's
KALC-FM in February 1998. The trio traveled the shock-jock route,
focusing on sex and gossip. Ratings were solid in adult
contemporary Star's target demographic _ women ages 25 to 34 _ and
often in the Top 15 among broader groups of listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce hinted the new morning show would follow familiar
lines, referring to White's strong following and ``on-air antics.''
It's expected there will be a focus on celebrity interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, ABC-TV is currently shooting ``Come On, Get Happy:
The Partridge Family Story,'' to air in next year. Shawn Pyfrom
will play Bonaduce. &QL;

OAKLAND A'S WAIT FOR D-DAY ON SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN and MATTHEW YI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In baseball terms, the bottom of the ninth
inning is almost here for the investment group that is hoping to
buy the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 major-league team owners are expected to vote Thursday
during meetings in Cooperstown, N.Y., on whether to accept a $122.4
million offer from 16 investors headed by supermarket mogul Bob
Piccinini _ a deal that would guarantee that the A's stay in
Oakland until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely on the agenda,'' said Andy Dolich, the former
A's executive who put together the investment group and would serve
as team president. ``Absolutely, we're optimistic about a positive
outcome. We believe we've done everything asked of us to prove our
worth, with all the various bodies. We are as enthusiastic as we've
ever been. But we don't cast a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolich said he and the other investors have been given no
indication what the often capricious owners will do. But it will
take a yes vote by three-quarters of the 14 American League owners
and a simple majority of 16 National League owners for the sale to
be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The final report by the Major League Baseball staff on the
proposed deal went out to the owners last week.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to the full ownerships group, the sale will be
considered along with three other ownership transfer proposals _
Cincinnati, Kansas City and Montreal _ by baseball's ownership
committee. The panel is made up of commissioner Bud Selig and
representatives from 10 of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials in Oakland say the wait and the uncertainty
have been like sitting on pins and needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely pulling for the home team; there's no
question about that,'' said Oakland City Manager Robert Bobb,
referring to the local investment group.
</P>
<P>
   Bobb and Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown have been lobbying Major
League Baseball to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   When developers Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann purchased the A's
from the Walter Haas family in 1995, they signed a lease agreement
that would keep the ballclub in Oakland until 2004, with an option
to terminate the contract at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Schott and Hofmann announced last year they would be exercising
that option, causing Oakland and Alameda County officials to
scramble to find a new owner who would keep the franchise in
Oakland at least through the length of the current lease.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving bids from two sets of investors, the city and
county officials decided on the Piccinini/Dolich group, which also
includes baseball Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, the Oakland
Tribune, Men's Wearhouse president and founder George Zimmer,
advertising executive Jeff Goodby, attorney Guy Saperstein and Wind
River Systems chairman Jerry Fiddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that (Dolich) has assembled, clearly, an all-star
cast to revive and continue the excitement for baseball here in
Oakland,'' Bobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County Supervisor Mary King said the only thing clear is
that the investors' group has met all the financial criteria set by
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the objective thing and there's no guessing in that,''
King said. ``However, whatever subjectivity (the owners) bring into
the vote, that is hard for me to predict. Because I have no
intimate familiarity of how the team owners think, I can never
guess that. As far as I know, these guys are very independent
thinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Vataha, president of a Boston-based investment banking
firm Game Plan LLC, hired as consultants by the city of Oakland and
Alameda County, sounded much the same theme as King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm highly optimistic,'' he said. ``I believe we've done
everything that we can do. I don't see any negatives out there, But
you have the vote of 30 owners, and that's hard to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear need for urgency.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is not approved by Monday _ the date the sale
agreement expires _ Schott and Hofmann can consider other offers.
</P>
<P>
   They would retain ownership of the team with an obligation to
stay in Oakland only until 2001, with a year-to-year lease
arrangement at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding a possible delay in a vote by the baseball owners,
Dolich said, ``I've been told that they understand the unique
timing of our circumstances. Our group has flexibility (in the
timing), but we've always gone with the concept that the date is
the date, and we haven't requested an extension.''

POPULAR INDIAN WRITER PREFERS LUST TO LOVE, TO CRITICS' CHAGRIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ ``With lust, you go kaput at a certain age,''
said Khushwant Singh, one of India's most popular writers and
eccentric characters, who, at 84, has just written a sexy potboiler
that he said could have been called ``The Fantasies of an
Octogenarian.''
</P>
<P>
   His publisher, Viking, preferred to title it with the more
marketable ``The Company of Women.'' Some of his critics describe
the novel, which details a divorced man's sexual escapades with a
series of beautiful women, as yet more second-rate frivolity from a
writer who should be cultivating a sober, statesman-like posture in
his old age.
</P>
<P>
   But Singh, author of weighty works of history and fiction, as
well as raunchy joke books and an unending stream of newspaper
columns, exults in his continuing ability to provoke. To those who
say he has squandered his reputation, Singh tartly retorts, ``I
honestly couldn't give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, he shambled from his armchair to a small
side table and poured himself a Scotch, briefly interrupting a
discourse on the advantages of what he called earthy lust over
``airy-fairy'' love, as Kaval, his frail, ailing wife of 60 years,
listened impassively from a couch on the other side of the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in lust because I know what it is,'' Singh said.
``Love I find a very elusive concept.''
</P>
<P>
   But in old age, it seems, even lust can be a shifty friend. The
desire remains, he said, but the ability to fulfill it diminishes.
He mentioned the pathos of a scene in a Muriel Spark novel in which
an old man calls on a woman and pays for the pleasure of watching
as she bares the full length of her leg.
</P>
<P>
   He got the idea for his latest book, he said, when a friend told
him about her father, who had divorced her mother and gone on to
have a series of affairs. ``I think he advertised,'' Singh said.
``I thought he was a wonderful unusual character.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh wrote what a reviewer called his ``rollicking sexual
romp'' in seclusion. He took his cook of 40 years to the family
villa in a hill station in Himachal Pradesh. There, he sat in the
garden under a spreading tree and filled yellow legal pads with his
small longhand script.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the lust I can't spend on people, I spend on paper,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name his greatest pleasures in life, his wife, who
had said almost nothing up till then, replied for him: ``Crossword
puzzles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he agreed, ``crossword puzzles in the morning and good
Scotch in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh has for many years had a wide appeal built on his
unpretentious mixture of seriousness, silliness and sex. In his
mid-30s, he abandoned the solid, respectable fields of law and
diplomacy for the chancier work of a scribbler.
</P>
<P>
   He could have just played golf. He came from a wealthy family of
Sikh entrepreneurs _ his father was the contractor who built India
Gate, the grand archway that is Delhi's version of the Arc de
Triomphe _ but Singh had no interest in either business or leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he has kept up a grueling schedule of writing _ one that
has left him no time for the drunkenness and debauchery that some
have thought were his metier. His reputation as the dirty old man
of Delhi is undeserved, his friends say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a myth, a great big lie,'' said his fellow
best-selling author Shobha De. ``He's just a party flirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, a workaholic by his own description, has now written so
many books he has lost count, and he continues to churn out two
syndicated newspaper columns a week. His son, Rahul, said his
father has sometimes been gullible in politics _ for example,
supporting Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for some months after she
suspended civil liberties in 1975 _ but has always been honest.
</P>
<P>
   And at crucial junctures, he has stood up for his beliefs,
opposing the Hindu fundamentalism that led to the destruction of a
mosque in 1992 and denouncing the leader of a Sikh separatist
insurgency in his native Punjab as a ``homicidal maniac.'' From the
early 1980s until just a few months ago, he lived under constant
police guard to protect him from Sikh militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to kill me anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His words, however, can still sting like a bee. In the current
election, he campaigned for Manmohan Singh, a fellow Sikh who was
the principal architect of India's economic reforms in the early
1990s and is a man with a reputation for rectitude who would never
tell an off-color joke, much less laugh at one.
</P>
<P>
   With an impish glint in his eye, Khushwant Singh waited for his
chance to speak at a recent rally in a predominantly Sikh
neighborhood, while the boring political speeches droned on.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the candidate of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, had been accused of challenging Manmohan
Singh's credentials as a Sikh because his daughters had married
Hindus and suggesting that Singh's turban be removed to see if he
really had unshorn hair like a true Sikh. (Malhotra has denied
making those statements.)
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers had expressed umbrage at so grave an ethnic
insult, but Khushwant Singh replied with a bawdy one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't the BJP man drop his trousers so we can see if
he's a Hindu or a Muslim?'' he asked to the howls of the crowd.
(Muslims are circumcised; Hindus are not.)
</P>
<P>
   As the rally dragged on, with flies buzzing around in the
oppressive heat, Khushwant Singh's high spirits began to fade. He
yawned and his shoulders drooped. Reeta Devi, the neighbor and
friend who had protectively accompanied him, began to fret.
``They're squishing Mr. Singh,'' she told one of the rally's
organizers, her voice rising. ``If people push him like that, we
can't go to these meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he escaped the dais, he and Mrs. Devi hurried to the car.
``Don't stop,'' he urged, ``or they won't let me get away.''
</P>
<P>
   As the car slowly made its way through the rush hour traffic,
Mrs. Devi worried that Mrs. Singh would be angry because they were
late. ``I promised her I'd have you home by 6:30,'' she said,
joking nervously, ``I think I won't come in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 7 after 7,'' Singh observed. A man who pours the first of
his three Scotches at 7 p.m. sharp and shuts the bar at 8, he was
anxious to get home to his armchair.
</P>

COMMENTARY: WHAT U.S. ROLE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again a vicious civil war. Once again the call for U.S.
troops. This time to East Timor, which is one of the farthest
places you can fly from Washington D.C. and still be on this
planet. What to do? What criteria do we use when deciding whether
to dispatch forces to small, distant corners where some outrage is
being committed? I would start with the following four questions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Is there some strategic rationale for U.S. involvement? &LR;  I
believe the diplomacy leading up to the war in Kosovo was utterly
botched by the NATO allies. War there was not inevitable.
Nevertheless, once thousands of Kosovo Albanians were evicted, the
United States and NATO had a strategic as well as moral interest in
forcing their return home. NATO's credibility was at stake, and
leaving the Kosovo refugees floating around southern Europe would
have destabilized the whole region and divided the allies.
</P>
<P>
   Containing Serbia, and basically closing the worst open sore in
Europe _ the Balkans _ so that the rest of Europe can concentrate
on integration and development, is also worth a few U.S. troops. We
have 100,000 troops in Germany marching around flagpoles. Shifting
a few of them to patrol ethnic dividing lines in the Balkans has
some strategic merit. The same in East Timor. Roughly 40 percent of
the world's trade passes through the sea lanes around Indonesia,
the world's fourth-largest nation. If contributing a few U.S.
logistics personnel _ to a U.N. force made up of Australians and
Asians _ helps resolve Indonesia's ugliest internal strife, it has
some strategic benefit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Can we make a reasonable difference at a reasonable cost? &LR; 
In Kosovo, because the allies were able to rely on air power alone,
they were able to make a reasonable difference _ forcing the return
of the refugees _ at a cost the public would tolerate. In East
Timor, assuming that Asians and Aussies staff the U.N. force, we
should be able to make a reasonable difference _ instituting a free
and fair U.N.-sponsored vote for independence by the people of East
Timor _ at a reasonable cost. For a relatively small price we will
be upholding the rule of international law and the U.N.'s
credibility, and showing how U.S. power can be leveraged.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Can we make a sustainable difference at a reasonable cost? &LR; 
Here's where the Clinton team has failed in Haiti, Somalia and
Kosovo. The U.S. intervention in Kosovo made a crucial difference:
It halted ethnic cleansing. But to make that difference
self-sustaining _ so that NATO doesn't have to keep a soldier on
every corner preventing ethnic Albanians and Serbs from killing
each other _ you need a political solution. As the NATO commander
in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, just said: ``I fear that the
soldiers are now more and more policemen, due to the continuing
desire for revenge. And that has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only two ways to change that. One is for Serbs and
Albanians to learn to love each other. Forget that. The other is to
separate them permanently. The reason NATO has made a sustainable
difference at a reasonable cost in Bosnia is because it has
abandoned the fantasy that it is building a multi-ethnic democracy
there, and has instead partitioned Bosnia into ethnic zones. NATO
then simply patrols the partition lines, which is quite
sustainable. Some form of partition, or enclaves, has to be
instituted in Kosovo between the ethnic Albanians and the remaining
Serbs. That's the only way NATO's presence there will make a
sustainable difference.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor is more like Kuwait than Kosovo. It's a territory
occupied by bad guys. If the U.N. comes in and the bad guys
gradually leave or are isolated, East Timor should be
self-governing at a sustainable cost.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Can we walk and chew gum at the same time? &LR;  We can afford
these distant interventions as long as we don't lose focus on what
are still the killer strategic issues for America. For instance,
the Clintonites have utterly dropped the ball on arms control,
failing for years to win Russian ratification for an already signed
treaty (START 2) that would slash Russia's long-range nuclear
arsenal _ which is still aimed at us _ in half.
</P>
<P>
   If the administration can do the big stuff and the small stuff,
it will set an important precedent _ and it's still not too late.
But if it makes the world safer for Kosovars and Timorese but not
for Americans, its whole approach to intervention will be scorned.
History is not kind to leaders who just do capillaries, not
arteries.

POLICE SEIZE EXPLOSIVES IN APARTMENT BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the wake of two bombings here that claimed at least
210 lives, Russian police say they have prevented a third blast by
seizing as much as 2 tons of explosives in yet another apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   The explosives and a 70-yard fuse were discovered in a 12-story
residential building housing 260 apartments in southeastern Moscow,
police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the death toll for Monday's blast has risen to
118, as rescue workers completed their work digging through the
smoldering remains of Moscow's worst explosion since World War II.
Monday's pre-dawn explosion came just four days after a blast at
another apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials also said they have evidence linking
the explosions to Chechen field commander Shaimil Basayev and the
Jordanian-born Islamic rebel leader Khattab. Since last month,
Basayev and Khattab have led an insurgency in the Muslim-dominated
republic of Dagestan in southern Russia. The two seek to create an
Islamic state in the Caucasus region free from Moscow's grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now say that these blasts are tied to Basayev and
Khattab,'' said Igor Zubov, deputy head of Russia's Interior
Ministry, which runs the nation's police force. Zubov said that
Russia's police have in their possession recordings of telephone
conversations that implicate Basayev and Khattab in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev and Khattab have repeatedly denied responsibility for
the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are carrying out an open war with the Russian armed forces
and have never even considered killing sleeping, peaceful citizens
with bombs and shells,'' Khattab said Tuesday in a statement from
Chechnya's capital, Grozny. ``Our fight is against the Russian army
and not against women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also say they have detained a third suspect in the
bombings. Two arrests were announced Monday. Police gave no details
but the Interfax news agency reported that the suspects were tied
to a business that had rented commercial space on the first floor
of both apartment buildings. Police released sketches of three
other men suspected of being involved in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has proposed sealing
off Russia's border with the breakaway republic of Chechnya. In
1994-96, Moscow fought a 20-month war with Chechnya in an
unsuccessful attempt to prevent that republic's bid for
independence. Although Chechnya tecnically remains part of Russia,
authorities in Moscow have no control over events there.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to Russia's parliament Tuesday, Putin called Chechnya
a ``huge terrorist camp.'' The prime minister demanded that the
republic's leadership turn over suspected terrorists to Moscow.
``Otherwise we will ruthlessly eliminate them every time they cross
the border,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's Foreign Ministry released a statement Tuesday
condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for the victims of the
two Moscow blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also told lawmakers that he opposed the declaration of a
state of emergency in Russia, a move that could put parliamentary
elections scheduled here for December in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Police have, however, announced a major ``anti-terrorism''
campaign in which the attics and basements of Moscow's 30,000
apartment buildings would be checked for explosives and suspicious
residents. As of Tuesday, police claimed to have checked 26,000
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Police in bulletproof vests combed Moscow's streets, parks,
markets and subway stations demanding that anybody they deemed
suspicious show identity documents prving that they have a right to
be in the capital. Moscow's strict registration law requires all
visitors to the capital to register with police within three days
of arriving.
</P>
<P>
   And with suspicion for the bombings falling on Chechens and
others from the Caucasus region, dark-skinned people were the most
vulnerable. Riot police also manned checkpoints and searched
vehicles on higways in and out of Moscow. Hundreds of people
lacking proper registration have reportedly been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Iskandaryan, a Moscow-based specialist of the Caucasus
region said the measures would do little to stop terrorism and only
harm Russia's already strained relations with its Moslem
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any terrorist could easily pay a completely Russian-looking
Muscovite to plant a bomb,'' he said.

CONGRESS AND ADMINISTRATION COLLIDE OVER CLEMENCY OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angry congressional Republicans charged the White
House with ``stonewalling'' about President Clinton's decision to
grant clemency to 14 Puerto Rican militants and accused the
administration of silencing an FBI official who had planned to
testify at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., called on
Attorney General Janet Reno to come before Congress and explain
Clinton's clemency decision, but she rejected the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The senators asked for Reno after the Justice Department ordered
Neil Gallagher, assistant director for the FBI's National Security
Division, not to testify at a Tuesday hearing of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee's terrorism subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell and Helms accused the White House of pressuring the
Justice Department into making the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty clear that the White House is behind
this,'' Coverdell said. ``You've got to wonder what would cause the
White House to bypass a chance to explain themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, the two senators called on Reno to appear before
the Foreign Relations Committee to explain the Justice Department's
and the FBI's positions on the president's offer of clemency to 16
Puerto Rican militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have a right to know why and how this
decision was made ... and your department has an obligation to
provide answers on this issue,'' Coverdell said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining its decision not to allow Gallagher to appear before
the committee, the Justice Department said in a statement that
there were constitutional questions about whether it would be
appropriate for FBI officials to testify because the power to grant
clemency is the president's exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, the Justice Department said Reno
declined the senators' offer, saying the attorney general could not
testify for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   But Coverdell and Helms said the reason was that ``the White
House pulled the plug on the FBI ... is obviously stonewalling
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's explanation also was criticized by
several experts on constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI or the Justice Department may not want to talk about
how the decision was made, but there's absolutely no legal or
constitutional reason why they can't talk to Congress about it,''
said Louis Seidman, a law professor at Georgetown University here.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's order also prompted the House
Government Reform Committee, which is scheduled to hold hearings on
Thursday on the issue, to subpoena many of the witnesses who had
previously been invited to appear at the Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Gallagher, the House committee subpoenaed acting
Assistant General Jon P. Jennings and White House counsel Beth
Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Reno, we expected something like this to happen, so we
were prepared to send out the subpoenas even before this morning,''
said Mark Corallo, spokesman for the House panel.
</P>
<P>
   Corallo said those subpoenaed officials must attend the hearing
but that they can refuse to testify by invoking executive privilege
_ which is a claim that their testimony would hamper their ability
to give the president candid advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't see how telling the American people why the
president did something that he is supposedly proud of doing can
have anything to do with executive privilege,'' Corello said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney said the agency had
not received the subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's hearing before the Senate terrorism panel was
designed to explore whether the president's grant of clemency may
have undermined the government's strict anti-terrorism policy.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing came as the Senate approved a Republican-sponsored
resolution condemning clemency for the Puerto Ricans. The
resolution passed 95-2. The House adopted a similar resolution last
week, 311-41.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coverdell's hearing was to focus on terrorism, it
relied primarily on the emotional testimony of victims of bombings
by Puerto Rican militants and by Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., a
harsh critic of the clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speech comes from my heart as an American citizen who has
been betrayed by his president,'' former New York City Police
Detective Richard Pastorella said. He lost his sight, much of his
hearing and all the fingers on his right hand in a 1982 FALN
bombing in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ignited a firestorm of criticism when he announced last
month that he would commute the sentences of 16 militants not
directly involved in planting bombs if they renounced violence and
met other conditions of parole. Fourteen of them accepted the offer
and 11 were freed from federal prison Friday. One prisoner must
serve five more years before he is released under the clemency deal
and the remaining two, who were already out of prison, had their
fines of $100,000 and $50,000 eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and some members of the law enforcement community
had accused Clinton of offering clemency to help his wife's
all-but-announced Senate candidacy from New York, home to some 1.3
million Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue has turned into more of a headache for the first
lady than a help. Mrs. Clinton first came out against the clemency
offer, angering many of New York's Puerto Rican leaders. Then last
week she explained that she should have consulted more with Latino
leaders before reaching a decision.

ITALY'S BIGGEST INSURER MAKES HOSTILE BID FOR COMPETITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In a move to further consolidate Italy's financial
industries, the nation's largest insurer, Assicurazioni Generali
SpA, announced a hostile $12.8 billion bid Tuesday for its domestic
rival, Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Generali, which is based in Trieste, said it was offering 3.067
euros, or $3.18, in cash and stock for each share of its rival,
which represents a 19 percent premium over Istituto Nazionale's
share price Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest in a series of deals intended to
reorganize Italy's fragmented financial services industries. If it
succeeds, it would undo plans for a friendly merger between
Istituto Nazionale _ known here as INA _ and San Paolo-IMI SpA, one
of Italy's largest banks. Just last week, San Paolo and INA
announced that they were discussing a merger. It would also have
major implications for the reorganization of Italy's banks.
</P>
<P>
   INA president Sergio Siglienti said Generali's bid was ``neither
announced nor agreed upon'' with his company's management.
</P>
<P>
   San Paolo said in a statement that it would study Generali's
move at a board meeting next Tuesday. It remained unclear whether
San Paolo would make a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   Umberto Agnelli, the president of Ifil, an investment company
that has a big stake in Fiat and is also one of San Paolo's biggest
shareholders, said San Paolo's talks with INA were intended to
create ``a bank-insurance industrial project that reinforces the
financial structures of the country.'' He described Generali's bid
as arrogant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Italian banks and insurance companies have come under increasing
pressure to shake out their industries after the conclusion in
August of a three-way bank brawl in France, in which Banque
Nationale de Paris failed in an effort to acquire Societe Generale
but succeeded in buying the financial services giant Paribas to
form one of Europe's biggest banks. In Germany, too, rumblings have
grown as the nation's big banks study ways to merge and make their
retail and investment banking operations more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the most recent move came in June, when the boards of
Banca Intesa, the nation's second largest, and Banca Commerciale
Italiana, the No. 4, approved a $15 billion merger to create what
will be Italy's largest banking group. San Paolo is now the
largest.
</P>
<P>
   For Generali, the consequences of the bid, if successful, would
be to broaden its capital base and to make it a harder target for
some other company's hostile-takeover attempt. Through the summer,
speculation has abounded that the No. 1 European insurer, AXA of
France, would try to buy Generali, though AXA officials have denied
the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Generali's bid would create an insurance giant with a market
value of roughly $45 billion and annual revenue of more than $46
billion. The combined companies would rank behind only AXA and
Allianz of Germany in the European insurance industry. Insurance
analysts say the bid makes sense, given Generali's strong position
in life insurance, while Istituto Nazionale's main operating
company, Assitalia, is a leader in both life insurance and in
businesses like property and casualty insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As to the effects of Generali's bid for Italian banking, the
idea behind the move, people close to the matter said, is to
propose dividing up Istituto Nazionale's assets _ giving that
company's insurance business to Generali and its banking assets to
San Paolo. Istituto Nazionale has 51 percent of Banco di Napoli
Holding, which controls the largest commercial bank in southern
Italy, and a 7.5 percent stake in Banca Nazionale del Lavoro,
another leading commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   But a first sign that such a compromise might fail came Tuesday
morning, when a planned meeting between Generali president Alfonso
Desiata and Luigi San Paolo head Arcuti was canceled. San Paolo's
idea has been to merge its banking interests with the insurance
business of INA, creating a banking and insurance giant.
</P>
<P>
   INA has hired as advisers Credit Suisse First Boston, whose
parent Credit Suisse Group holds a 3.4 percent INA stake. Credit
Suisse chairman Lukas Muehlemann, who headed Switzerland's big
Winterthur insurance group before taking over at Credit Suisse, is
among Europe's principal proponents of banking and insurance
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   UBS AG, the Swiss banking giant that competes with Credit
Suisse, is advising Generali through its Warburg Dillon Read

DAVIS DROPS MONEY FOR UNION LEGAL FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The Davis administration quietly tried to
give the union for state prison guards $4 million in public money
for its legal defense fund, a highly unusual concession for a major
political donor.
</P>
<P>
   Exposed and excoriated by fellow Democrats, Gov. Gray Davis
agreed to remove the provision last week, moments before the
Legislature approved a pay raise and other perks for the
25,000-member California Correctional Peace Officers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The union was one of Davis' strongest supporters during his 1998
campaign. It supplied him with $2 million in campaign contributions
and television advertising and provided critical cover against
Republican accusations that Davis was soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense fund had been included in the legislative action,
taxpayers would have been in the extraordinary position of paying
to both defend and prosecute guards.
</P>
<P>
   Several Corcoran State Prison guards have been accused of
arranging the rape of one prisoner and staging illegal,
gladiator-style fights among other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million for the defense fund was removed from the
agreement late Thursday as the Legislature was ending its 1999
session. A few Democratic lawmakers who have sparred with the union
noticed the money and complained loudly to officials who negotiated
the deal for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What is this about? How could you be doing this? How
could you be placing the administration in such an embarrassing
situation?''' said Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, a frequent
critic of the union and the Davis administration's prison policies.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco said Davis's union negotiators ``got it'' when he
spelled out an imaginary newspaper headline about taxpayers being
asked to pay for defending prison guards accused of horrible
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a real slap to the Legislature, to the
governor, to the people of California, to be using taxes to defend
prison guards against alleged criminal wrongdoing,'' Polanco said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement approved by the Legislature, the guards
still secured an immediate 4 percent pay raise, retroactive to July
1, and another 4 percent on Sept. 1, 2000, as well as increases in
health and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Most other state employee unions negotiated similar contracts
with the Davis administration. Prison guards, however, already are
some of the highest paid workers in California government, earning
$47,800 a year _ without overtime _ after seven years of work.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Morgenstern, the governor's chief negotiator on state
employee issues, said the legal defense money for the union of
prison guards was taken out because it became too controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The prison guards have had a legal defense account since 1991,
but it has relied mostly on union dues and private donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have money for a variety of things people wanted,''
Morgenstern said. ``Firefighters got money for boots and money for
their health fund. The Highway Patrol wanted money (put) into a
health fund. That's what collective bargaining is.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the legal defense fund for the prison guards, Morgenstern
said: ``Nobody wanted to deal with the controversy, so we took it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The union and the Davis administration now have 90 days to
negotiate how to spend the $4 million on other benefits,
Morgenstern said. The same is true for the California Highway
Patrol union, which got $3 million to spread around on benefits,
education, uniforms or whatever.

INDONESIAN OPPOSITION TO OUTSIDE PEACE FORCE GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A nationalist backlash is mounting against
plans to send an international peacekeeping force to quell the
violence in East Timor, as Indonesians object to summoning outside
nations to solve what they call an internal problem.
</P>
<P>
   In street protests and in interviews, many Indonesians make
clear that they see the international effort in East Timor as a
throwback to the era of European colonialism, a latter-day case of
picking up the ``white man's burden,'' the attitude that white
nations had an obligation to show third-world countries how things
should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, some 200 demonstrators shouted and burned effigies in
front of the United Nations office and the US Embassy, one day
after 1,000 protesters were allowed by security guards to vandalize
the US Consulate and the Western Australia trade office in
Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters decried what they called foreign meddling in
Indonesian affairs and President B.J. Habibie's weakness in the
face of outside pressure, even as the United Nations announced that
a peacekeeping force would be deployed within days.
</P>
<P>
   The West has condemned Indonesia's military for sponsoring an
orgy of killing, burning and looting that has claimed hundreds, if
not thousands, of lives and displaced much of East Timor's
population. The violence followed a landslide referendum vote in
favor of independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Indonesians' sensitivity to foreign intervention
run deep. For centuries, this archipelago of 13,000 islands and
hundreds of ethnic groups chafed under harsh colonial rule by the
Dutch, and it won independence only 54 years ago in a bloody war.
Then in 1958, the United States supported rebellious army units in
a civil war on the island of Sumatra, an event that older
Indonesian nationalists have never forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Indonesia has gladly accepted decades of military
and economic assistance from the West, and arguably behaved like a
colonial power itself in East Timor, a tiny territory on the
southeastern end of the Indonesian archipelago that Indonesia
invaded in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Few Indonesians bring up the fact that their government imposed
24 years of repressive rule and military-sponsored abuses on the
former Portuguese colony after the invasion. Many ordinary citizens
accept the government line that Indonesia gave East Timor roads,
schools and electricity. Most have never heard of the military
oppression that claimed 200,000 lives, a quarter of East Timor's
population, through war, starvation and disease in the five years
after Jakarta invaded.
</P>
<P>
   If there must be peacekeepers at all, Jarkarta would prefer an
Asian-led force. Indonesia's neighbors traditionally refrain from
criticizing or policing fellow members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At a protest at the Australian Embassy Monday, 21-year-old
student Eko Sulistio Santosa declared, ``We don't need
international peacekeeping forces there. Indonesia can take care of
it alone. . . . Habibie was premature in giving East Timorese a
vote for independence. They obviously weren't ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the media reports about the killings'' in East
Timor, said Bambang Nurbianto, 24, a street vendor, as he sold
snacks Tuesday. ``Indonesia gave East Timor a lot, and these people
don't show gratitude. . . . I also fear that if East Timor goes,
many other provinces will go, and Indonesia will not be Indonesia
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Others note that Australia and the United States openly or
tacitly supported Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975, at a
time when Cold War politics stoked fears of a Marxist, independent
East Timor _ a ``Cuba in southeast Asia,'' as it was called at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Australia is very hypocritical,'' said Salvador
Soares, the pro-Indonesia editor of East Timor's daily newspaper,
Suara Timor Timur (``The Voice of East Timor.'') ``Western
countries encouraged Indonesia to come to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting Australia as the lead nation in the peacekeeping force
could delay deployment, something hundreds of thousands of
displaced East Timorese without food, water and medicine cannot
afford. But ignoring Indonesia's concerns could usher in other
problems _ diplomatic strains and even physical danger to Western
troops deployed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   An American serving as a UN police officer said he was shot in
East Timor last week because gunmen believed he was Australian.
</P>
<P>
   An Indonesian government source said that contrary to Western
assertions that Australia is the only country ready and able to
lead an East Timor peacekeeping force, Malaysia has privately said
its own troops could be ready in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a large country with a complex history. . . . It has
experienced many foreign interventions,'' said Sabam Siagian, a
former Indonesian Ambassador to Australia, in an interview. ``With
that background, the world should be wise and tactful'' in
selecting a force to restore order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Siagian criticized Australia for acting ``macho'' and being
``noisy about being ready with thousands of troops.'' He said
Australian politicians are trying to win points at home ahead of
upcoming elections, and might even be trying to ``establish a
strategic beachhead in marine southeast Asia'' by sending troops to
East Timor, 400 miles north of Australia.

 &HT;    Losing an unusual feeling for Falcons
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons had not lost a regular-season game in
nearly 11 months and a home game in almost two years. But after
last week's gut-wrenching 17-14 loss to Minnesota in the Georgia
Dome, the Falcons find themselves in unfamiliar territory _
recovering from a defeat. They will have a few extra days to repair
their psyches before Monday night's nationally televised game at
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way you find out about the character of your
football team,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``The (losses) that
we had last year, we reacted very well. We went out to San
Francisco and got beat badly (31-20 on Sept. 27), and we came back
and played well after that. We went up and got beat by the Jets
(28-3 on Oct. 25), and we bounced back from that one. You really
learn a lot more about your team through adversity. It wasn't like
we played a poor football team (in the Vikings).''
</P>
<P>
   But the loss to Minnesota, in which the Falcons turned the ball
over three times, missed two field goals and committed two costly
pass-interference penalties, might be more difficult to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sticks with you a little bit longer,'' running back Jamal
Anderson said. ``I had like 'road rage' going home (Sunday). I was
mad. I was really, really frustrated with a lot of things _ the way
I played and with the way things went down. It's not necessarily a
moral victory, but you want to beat a team like that, and I know
how important it was to the 70,000 people who were there. It's a
tough pill to swallow, but we'll try to rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was different because Atlanta didn't have an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Against the 49ers in Week 3 last season, the Falcons were still
relatively unknown and weren't considered playoff contenders.
Atlanta also hasn't won in San Francisco since 1991, so nobody
really expected them to win in 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jets, Atlanta played without starting quarterback
Chris Chandler, who missed the game with a sprained left shoulder
and bruised ribs suffered the previous week in a 31-23 victory over
New Orleans. Starting defensive tackle Travis Hall also was hurt
and did not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough because we're not accustomed to losing now,''
Anderson said. ``These things stick with you, especially when you
lose by three points and you have a chance to win. We did all the
things that we did wrong, giving them good field position every
time we turned the ball over. We've just got to buckle down and get
it together. We've got to pray Chris is healthy enough to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons might be forced to play without Chandler again. He
is doubtful for the Cowboys game after pulling his right hamstring
in the fourth quarter of the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was evident last year, and it was evident (Sunday, that)
we've been faced with a lot of adverse situations,'' linebacker
Keith Brooking said. ``We fought through them, so we're definitely
going to find out what this team is made of. After a disappointing
loss like that, you've got to bounce back the following week. This
is a big test for us, but there's no doubt in my mind that we're
going to step up to the challenge.''

WHO'S CONTROLLING SPYING? BRITONS WONDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As Soviet spies go, Merlita Norwood is a media darling.
She's an 87-year-old great-grandmother, a frail but unrepentant
communist.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, when she appeared in the front yard of her modest
home in the south London suburb of Bexleyheath, holding in her
trembling hand a brief statement that acknowledged her role as a
spy dating back to the 1940s, she touched off a heated debate over
whether she should be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But as the days wear on, the debate is shifting to why it took
so long for the public and, even more, the government to learn that
Norwood and her accuser existed. Her unmasking and that of about a
dozen other British-based Soviet spies was meant to trumpet one of
the British intelligence services' greatest coups. Instead it may
serve as a catalyst for bringing secret agents here under greater
scrutiny. Because of the controversy, a parliamentary committee
will hold an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   While many Britons have long followed the fictional exploits of
James Bond, the quintessential British secret agent, they know far
less about their real secret services, which remain shrouded in
official secrecy. The existence of MI6, the foreign intelligence
service, was not even officially acknowledged by the government
until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Two laws passed in 1994 and 1996 were meant to make the secret
services more accountable. But while the leaders of the secret
services can now be called to face parliamentary questioning, it is
done in private.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a freedom-of-information law, meanwhile, inhibits
journalists from getting official, objective information. That
means that most public knowledge about the secret services has been
informed by disgruntled former agents, who typically paint the
services as ghastly organizations peopled by paranoid incompetents,
or by journalists and authors who are given access and information
by the secret services in exchange for favorable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The method and timing of the disclosures about Norwood and other
spies operating in Britain, which have been made as part of a
coordinated public relations campaign to promote a book that is
published Wednesday (Sept. 15), have raised eyebrows and prompted
questions about how seriously the secret services take their duty
to keep their political masters informed.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Sword and the Shield,'' by Christopher Andrew, a
professor at Cambridge University, analyzes handwritten copies of
KGB documents made by a KGB archivist, Vasili Mitrokhin, who
defected to Britain in 1992. Besides exposing Norwood, it details
some of the more sensational attempts by the KGB to discredit
American figures from J. Edgar Hoover to Martin Luther King Jr.,
and of the KGB effort to bury arms caches throughout the West for
an invasion that never came.
</P>
<P>
   But some here find it unsettling that Prime Minister Tony Blair
didn't find out about Mitrokhin's archives until last Thursday,
three years after Andrew was authorized by MI5, the domestic
intelligence service, to meet Mitrokhin to begin preparing the
book, and weeks after journalists got access to some of the
information to prepare stories and a television documentary that
will be broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Andrew acknowledged that he was stunned
to learn that he knew the intimate details of Mitrokhin's archives
before senior cabinet members and the prime minister. While
believing there was no intent by the secret services to avoid or
mislead the politicians, he agrees there is a need for an
investigation to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a cock-up, not a conspiracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been legislative efforts in recent years to make
Britain's domestic and foreign secret services more accountable to
the government, but as the author and journalist Hugo Young
concluded Tuesday, ``Any belief that this has brought with it more
respect for ministerial supremacy, let alone democratic
accountability, is an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is more than a Cold War hangover. It also
exposes the ideological divide in Britain that many say has
narrowed since 1997 when Blair moved the traditionally left-wing
Labor Party to the center and won the biggest parliamentary
majority in two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Conservative Party say it is outrageously
hypocritical for the Blair government to insist on holding
83-year-old Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator, for
extradition to Spain to face charges on human rights abuses that
occurred in the 1970s while giving a free pass to a little old lady
who betrayed her country for much of the last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Leftists argue that there is no moral comparison between what
Pinochet stands accused of and Norwood's use of her secretarial job
_ in a metals research laboratory that developed Britain's atomic
bomb _ to pass secrets to the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal observers say that the evidence against Norwood,
despite her public admissions, amounts to handwritten notes by
Mitrokhin that would not be admissible in court.
</P>
<P>
   While the controversy over prosecution seems likely to pass, a
more lasting debate appears to be opening up on whether the
democratically elected leaders of the British people need to have
more control over the secret agents entrusted with looking out for
national security, both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The ideological divide is obvious again, with many conservatives
arguing that the secret services cannot operate effectively under
the glare of public scrutiny, and many liberals contending that the
secret services have made a mockery of efforts to make them more
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, who is in
charge of law enforcement, called for more governmental oversight
of MI5, which handles domestic intelligence, and MI6, which does
foreign spying. Straw acknowledged that he had been briefed on
Mitrokhin's archives after taking up his post in 1997, but didn't
learn of Norwood until last December.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin's treasure trove of KGB secrets, smuggled out in a
half-dozen trunks, was so voluminous that British intelligence
agents and their Western allies, including those in the CIA, spent
four years poring over his notes and debriefing him. In 1996,
Malcolm Rifkind, then foreign secretary, approved the idea of
having Andrew write a book that would put Mitrokhin's archive into
the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   David Shayler, a former MI5 agent who faces arrest here for
disclosing some of the agency's secrets, says the way MI5 handled
the Mitrokhin archives shows that there needs to be more
parliamentary oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``MI5 is not accountable,'' Shayler said from exile in France.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, suggest that the British people are widely in
favor of leaving the murky world of espionage to professionals, not
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   D. Cameron Watt, professor emeritus of international history at
the London School of Economics, said he is skeptical that Norwood
was as important a spy as some are making her out to be, but he is
not troubled by the secret services' decisions to analyze
Mitrokhin's information for years before notifying their political
masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had many leads to follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized the handpicking of Andrew, who wrote a
history of MI6, as a way to ensure that the secret services are
cast in the best possible light. But Watt believes it is more an
illustration of a lack of historians within the secret services who
could put the information into proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   He said the information will be of ``more interest to historians
than prosecutors.''

 &HT;    Petit Le Mans: Defending champ skeptical
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In last year's inaugural Petit Le Mans, Wayne Taylor
and teammates scored an upset when they drove a 4-year-old Ferrari
333SP to victory at Road Atlanta, beating faster, newer cars.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 39, a two-time World Sports Car champion and the only
driver to win the prototype class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the
Petit Le Mans, the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring,
faces greater odds this year. The car, co-sponsored by
Atlanta-based Lease Plan, is a year older, and the competition is
even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who was in a tight battle for the American Le Mans
Series points championship last year, is a distant eighth this year
with 55 points, 40 behind leader Elliott Forbes-Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two of the exotic prototypes are entered in this
weekend's race, including the BMW V12 LMR that won Le Mans and
Sebring; three Panoz LMP-1 Roadster Ss, two with Team Panoz and one
with J&AMP;P Motorsports; the Team Rafanelli Riley &AMP; Scott Judd that
won the spring ALMS race here; and a Champion Porsche 911 GT1 EVO.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he isn't thinking about it, but his car might not
make the field. Seven cars must be eliminated to bring the field to
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll run two cars, rather than one like last year,'' Taylor
said. ``We'll run as hard as we can. We have very good tires and a
very good reliability record.''
</P>
<P>
   His Doyle-Risi team hasn't heard any news of an upgrade from
Ferrari. Taylor was bumped from the 24 Hours of Le Mans field
because of a paperwork error. But he is upbeat because of the
success of the American Le Mans Series, although he was skeptical
when the ALMS was announced last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know from one year to the next if we'd have a series
or not,'' Taylor said. ``Everyone had great ideas; no one followed
through. Then Don Panoz came in, said what he'd do and did it. ...
I think we're on our way up.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means the dream lives for the kid from Port Elizabeth,
South Africa, who lives in Altamonte Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far back as I can remember, the only thing I ever had in my
head was being a race car driver,'' Taylor said. ``I was absolutely
adamant that that was what I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every kid's dream to drive a race car, so I'm living my
dream.''

   SACKLER-ASSESS (Washington) _ When the Smithsonian Institution
announced this month that a trove of Chinese art amassed over
nearly 60 years by an American collector, Dr. Paul Singer
(1904-1997), had been given to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery here,
the details were rather staggering. It amounts to more than 5,000
objects, with a value estimated at $60 million, though, in fact, an
item-by-item assessment of the material is only just beginning. The
gift more than doubles the existing collection of the Sackler
Gallery, which was established in 1987 and constitutes, with the
neighboring Freer Gallery, the national museum of Asian art in the
United States. And in a stroke it transforms the Freer and the
Sackler into the largest repository for Chinese archaeological
material in North America. By Holland Cotter.

GORE, BRADLEY SUPPORTERS CLASH ON ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ It's a clear sign that the Democratic
presidential primary is neck and neck in the Granite State:
Supporters of Al Gore and Bill Bradley have begun attacking each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The latest blast could come Wednesday (Sept. 15) when surrogates
for the vice president plan to call Bradley weak on health care.
Last week, they criticized the former New Jersey senator for having
voted in favor of school vouchers. Before that, it was the Bradley
troops blistering Gore for not being a strong enough advocate of
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tight,'' said Mary Rauh, one of Bradley's chief
supporters, pointing to recent polls showing the two candidates are
just a few percentage points apart in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The use of surrogates to launch salvos at candidates is a
time-honored tradition in New Hampshire. The surrogates usually are
well-known locally and identified with a particular issue. Attacks
by others allow the candidates to continue taking the high ground
in public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides deny that they have gone negative. But it's an
unmistakable change in tone from just a few weeks ago, when the
candidates were politely avoiding mentioning each other.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Gore campaign will unveil its New Hampshire
health-care advisory board, a group of citizen activists who
support Gore and his health-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Allen, a former state representative and health-care
activist from Antrim, will be there. He said he likes Gore's plans
for long-term health care, hospice services, and providing
perscription drugs to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Bradley, Allen is dismissive. ``He hasn't
really done anything,'' he said. ``He's been kind of a no-show on
this issue. When you look at Gore's record, it's pretty
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, the New Hampshire spokesman for Gore, said,
``We're trying to showcase activists who care deeply about issues
like education and health care and get out the message that the
vice president is the only candidate with an agenda for change in
these areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``If one of our supporters wants to talk about
Bradley's record, I encourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said the surrogates' press conferences _ rolling out
advisory boards on education, health care, the economy and quality
of life _ were always part of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Eric Hauser, Bradley's press secretary, denied that a
recent press conference on abortion was merely an attack on Gore,
though it was prompted by a Gore campaign spokesman's misstating
the vice president's position on abortion. The group consisted of
Bradley backers, including Rauh, a past president of Planned
Parenthood of Northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided they wanted to talk about Bradley being a
stalwart on abortion,'' Hauser said. ``By no means was it an
attack. It was a comparison, perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rauh questioned Gore's commitment to publicly funding
abortions for poor women, long a contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear he won't lead on the issue,'' she said. ``What he said
was, if Congress passes a bill to provide funding for poor women,
I'll sign it. That means it won't happen, in my view.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hauser insisted that Rauh and the others were
gathered to praise Bradley's record on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep it at that level as much as we can in this
campaign,'' Hauser said. ``We would like a good clean campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll showed Gore leading Bradley by
4 percent, which was well within the margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls are going to go up and down, but we're working as hard
as we can for every vote, regardless,'' said Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Senator Lou D'Allesandro, a Democrat and member of
the Manchester School Board, criticized Bradley for having voted in
favor of school vouchers. Bradley voted seven times between 1978
and 1996 for programs to provide vouchers or tax credits to help
send children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bradley told reporters that he is committed to
public education but was willing to support an experiment to help
troubled, urban schools when he was a New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sullivan, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party,
said the sparring is a healthy sign: ``This is good for us. It
shows once again we're the party of issues, while the Republicans
are battling over George Bush and Steve Forbes and how much money
they can raise.''

 &HT;    Ellen Tracy wraps up by playing with fire
 &HT;    By Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service'
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the spring/summer 2000 womenswear she previewed
Monday morning, Ellen Tracy design chief Linda Allard indicated
just how wrapped up she is in her work.
</P>
<P>
   String-back halters, belted raincoats, scarf-tied tops and
flappy wrap skirts were the hallmarks of the collection. From top
(gold cord necklaces) to bottom (strappy stilettos), all 68
ensembles shown seemed to have strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   And prior to her runway presentation, Allard announced the
launching of a new Web site, ellentracy.com . Within a week, Allard
said, the site will feature video clips of the collection that
stressed relaxed shapes and styles that are nonetheless fun to wear
and precious to own.
</P>
<P>
   The key accent color was fire-engine red. Allard rendered it in
a resined silk raincoat with a thin belt that fastened just under
the breasts, a stretch top with a revealing neckline and tails that
knotted in the back, a stretch silk bustier and a collarless glazed
gauze jacket. Allard also liked to use lemon yellow: It showed up
in striking ensembles featuring tight blouses with rolled,
three-quarter length sleeves and seductive, round-edged ``petal''
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clothes came in subdued shades of khaki, blue,
purple and pink. But Allard juiced up her show at the end with an
array of fruit-colored eveningwear separates that were frosted with
crystal beading.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Allard played with casual luxury motifs: cropped and
cuffed linen khakis, a short-skirted blue, white and brown gingham
business suit, tank tops and tunics and cardigans in cushy shaker
knit, and tie-dyed shantung suits.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta
</P>
<P>
   Only at an Oscar de la Renta show could an invited guest _
albeit a very wealthy and well-connected guest _ arrive so late
that models literally had to dodge her as she dashed to her seat.
Normally, such a dramatic entrance would cause an uproar; in the
photographers' pit especially. But this was the philanthropist Nan
Kempner barging in; and to Manhattan socialites like her, viewing
de la Renta's runway previews from a front-row seat is one of
life's necessities. The designer earned the blue bloods' devotion
once again with 69 outfits that were opulent, playful, contemporary
and somewhat sexy.
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta's slim, A-line shapes catered to the ladies who
lunch, but only on watercress sandwiches. His show started with a
series of punch-hole embroidered leather skirts, pants, coats and
dresses. Next came dark denim suits and separates that looked
anything but casual. His beaded cocktail dresses were surprisingly
sheer and his flower-powered resortwear was fiercely festive. As is
the trend, his hemlines hovered around the knee and featured
asymmetrical flair and ruffled finishes. Cashmere sweater sets were
key to the collection, as were ``khaki'' looks in luxe fabrics like
silk chiffon.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller
</P>
<P>
   In the literal and figurative senses, Tuesday's collection
preview by Nicole Miller was vintage her. She described much of her
collection was inspired by the sort of thrift store clothes ``you
wish you'd held onto.'' And she designed with that whimsy,
modernity, femininity and delight in color that makes her
collections joys to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Her hemlines hit the knee or lower; many skirts and dresses
featured the undeniably trendy ruffles and asymmetrical wrap
styling. The detailing _ glossy linens, delicate embroidery and
beading, laser cut-outs, and tulle trimming _ were exquisite.
Miller's floral patterns ranged from big, outdated upholstery-style
prints to minuscule sprays of thistle on hand-painted dresses. And
she made denim pieces look dressy by rendering them in stretch
linen.

 &HT;    Back-to-back storms send N.C. sound residents scrambling
 &HT;    By T. Scott Batchelor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Residents around Pamlico Sound are cleaning
up from Tropical Storm Dennis with one hand while they prepare for
Hurricane Floyd with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Axson Smith, manager of River Forest Manor Marina and Shipyard
in Belhaven, spent part of Tuesday reserving trucks to remove
debris if Floyd visits the eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fully repaired from Dennis,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The marina lost decking on both piers. The decking has been
replaced, Smith said, ``but there's a lot of problems with rental
houses and other parts of the property.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats at the mercy of waves and wind are the first order of
business when a tropical cyclone such as Floyd threatens the
marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best place is to haul them out of the water for storage on
land,'' Smith said. Anchoring them in side creeks and canals is the
second best thing.
</P>
<P>
   River Forest has a boatyard on Tom's Creek in the northeastern
part of town where boats can be secured, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the National Hurricane Center's forecast on Tuesday
put the hurricane's eye in the vicinity of Raleigh, employees at
Robb's Boatyard and Marina on Pungo Creek are making storm
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they're hauling all the boats to the back of the
yard and getting them out of the water,'' said Kristy Clayton,
assistant office manager of the Belhaven business.
</P>
<P>
   They had stored about 10 boats by late morning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said the one-two punch of Dennis and Floyd has kept the
boatyard busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our docks were messed up, and they just got them back together
when they predicted Floyd,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers there are expecting Hurricane Floyd to make matters even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water comes up in our (boat) shops usually about 1 or 2
feet. The water's supposed to come up higher this time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said one couple sailing down to Florida via the Intracoastal
Waterway wisely chose to stop at Robb's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to Greenville and see if they can wait it out,''
Clayton reported.
</P>
<P>
   Belhaven's mayor, Charles O. Boyette, said, ``We've had high
water ever since Dennis came.'' More than 60 percent of the town's
businesses and residences sustained flood damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just haven't had a chance to dry out,'' Boyette said.
</P>
<P>
   Belhaven residents are accustomed to storms, Boyette said. But
Floyd is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Floyd is a monster,'' he said. ``They are nothing to
play with. We're moving right along (with preparations) again, just
as if Floyd is going to be on our back doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Town officials will meet today to decide whether to issue
evacuation orders. They're ready to start electrical generators and
move the command station from the police department to higher
eleveation in the municipal building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the electrical department and other utilities were in
good shape, having trimmed back trees during the summer in
preparation for the tropical storm season.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 miles west of Belhaven, McCotter's Marina on Broad
Creek just east of Washington was gearing up for Floyd's impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are taking their boats and anchoring them (in
the Pamlico River), said Susan Boone, an office worker at the
marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have not brought their boats back in from the
last one,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a dock that is somewhat tore up, with no
electricity on that particular dock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibb Chauncey, Pitt County Schools director of student
information and assignments, drives 50 miles to his home on the
Pamlico River each work day.
</P>
<P>
   Chauncey lives on the river about 10 miles east of Bath in
Beaufort County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to react to this one,'' Chauncey said of
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boat's on the trailer in the yard,'' he said. ``It's about
as good a shape as it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Pamlico crawled up his lawn and threatened to
overtake his home's foundation during Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It already washed away my pier,'' he said of Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about the two storms hitting so close together,
he joked, is that anything that can be washed away has already done
so.

MEDICAL SOCIETY'S PUBLISHING CHIEF RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Continuing the turmoil at the Massachusetts Medical
Society that began in July, the group's publishing chief, Joel H.
Baron, has announced his departure after two years of aggressively
expanding the organization's lucrative publishing division.
</P>
<P>
   The division, which publishes the New England Journal of
Medicine and a dozen other publications, brought in 87 percent of
the medical society's $84.1 million revenues in fiscal 1998, the
last year for which public figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors recently have questioned whether the nonprofit
medical society's priorities are being distorted by its growing
publishing activities. Medical societies should not ``allow
economic considerations to dominate their policies,'' Dr. Arnold S.
Relman and Dr. Edmund Pellegrino wrote last week in the Journal of
the American Medical Association. Relman is editor emeritus of the
New England Journal and Pellegrino is from Georgetown University
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Baron, the medical society's vice president for publishing, said
Tuesday his resignation was voluntary. Its timing, he said, had
nothing to do with the well-publicized clashes he had with Dr.
Jerome P. Kassirer that led to Kassirer's forced departure this
summer as New England Journal editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no asking me to leave, it's me resigning,'' Baron
said, adding that he will continue to represent the Bay State
physician group on publishing-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   Baron said he decided to leave because the medical society is
entering ``a quiet period'' in which it will not be launching or
acquiring new publications at its previous pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to enter a period of probably a year in which we
sort of hunker down until there's a new editor (of the New England
Journal) on board and that editor is up to speed,'' Baron said in
an interview. ``It's time for me to move on and find another place
where I can make a strategic contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kassirer, he and Baron disagreed repeatedly over
Baron's plans to exploit the New England Journal's prestigious
brand name to market other medical society publications that
Kassirer and his staff considered less rigorously edited.
</P>
<P>
   Baron has denied such disagreements, but Kassirer has said they
were frequent, and escalated in intensity this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thwarted many attempts to use the name of the New England
Journal of Medicine on various Massachusetts Medical Society
products,'' Kassirer wrote in a letter to the British medical
journal The Lancet published Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Kassirer said Baron had been carrying
out the wishes of medical society leaders intent on expanding the
nonprofit group's publishing domain and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, Joel wasn't acquiring properties that were
good ones,'' Kassirer said. ``I had serious questions about his
judgment, but he was simply doing what he was expected to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, who succeeded Kassirer as interim
editor-in-chief of the New England Journal after lengthy
negotiations, wished Baron well but expressed relief at his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret the other editors and I were concerned about
the use of the journal's name to promote unrelated products, and
that many of those concerns centered on Joel Baron's activities,''
Angell said. ``My personal relations with Joel have always been
good and I wish him well in the future. I think he might be happier
in a situation in which his entrepreneurial talents could have
freer scope.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron dismissed the importance of a set of principles governing
the New England Journal's independence that Angell insisted on
before taking over as interim editor. Those principles, announced
by the medical society in July, give control over the New England
Journal's name, logo, and content to the journal's editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing people don't understand is that the agreement
reached with Marcia is no different from the agreement we had with
Jerry,'' Baron said. ``I'm telling you a fact. There's no
difference, but people have been making like there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron said he does not have any immediate job prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter announcing his resignation to medical society staff,
Baron reviewed his accomplishments since joining the organization
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those include acquiring a magazine called Hippocrates from Time
Inc.; launching three new publications called Journal Watch that
summarize medical journals' content; starting a new consumer
newsletter called Heart Watch; and making the New England Journal's
contents available on the Internet and computerizing that journal's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Baron boasted that the medical society's publications exceeded
profit expectations in the past two years and ``with a few breaks
we'll beat them this year as well.''

U.N. THRASHES OUT DETAILS OF MILITARY MISSION TO EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A multinational force of up to 7,000 troops
could begin landing in East Timor by the weekend, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Tuesday, as the Security Council prepared to vote
on the resolution creating the military mission.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure was intense to complete work on the resolution Tuesday
night, in the light of reports of continuing violence in the
territory. ``Lives are leaking away in East Timor while they wait
for the council,'' said Jeremy Greenstock, the British
representative, who introduced the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   A direct reference to Australia as the designated leader of the
international force was dropped from the wording of the resolution,
but Indonesia will not oppose an Australian commander, Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said Tuesday. Indonesian and Australian
military officials met Tuesday afternoon to begin discussing how
the force will be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met with Alatas and
told reporters later that he had assured his Indonesian counterpart
that the force would be truly international, with significant
participation by Asian nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sensitive issue for Indonesia, and we understand
that,'' Downer said. ``This is not an Australian force.''
</P>
<P>
   A more fundamental long-term question that is still unresolved
concerns the role of the Indonesian army. For the next four months
_ the proposed term of the interim force now being created _ the
Indonesians say they expect to work with the international force,
and Tuesday's Security Council resolution demands their
cooperation. But how many Indonesians, and for how long, remains
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of the withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East
Timor is a matter which is not resolved,'' Downer said Tuesday.
``Indonesian troops will certainly be there in the initial stages
of the deployment of the multinational force. There will have to be
a mechanism for cooperation between the multinational force and
Indonesian military. There are, after all, quite a large number of
Indonesian troops in East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Downer said that some ideas were being discussed by Indonesia
and the Australians, but he did not elaborate. Under the May 5
agreement that led to the referendum on East Timor's future last
month, Indonesian troops would be gone by the end of the year, when
the United Nations would move in with its own peacekeeping force
and administration to run the new country until its first election.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and officials here say they no longer trust
Indonesian pledges, because of the failure of the Indonesian army
to stop attacks on East Timorese and international aid workers over
the last two weeks, when, under the May agreement, they were
responsible for law and order. Had they performed that duty, there
would be no need for the international force now being created.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, no one is certain whether the Indonesian army chief,
Gen. Wiranto, is in full control of his troops, or, conversely,
whether he had a hand in fomenting recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern that soldiers from this very nationalistic
army, which prides itself on having brought Indonesia independence
from Dutch colonialists, will protect the militias or even side
with them against a foreign force.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Political pressures continue to mount on President B.J. Habibie
as the deployment of an international force gets closer. In Jakarta
Tuesday, hundreds of students tried to march on parliament to
demand his resignation. He is already under fire from within his
own party, Golkar, for allowing the East Timorese to vote on their
future and then conceding he needs international military
assistance to end the violence that followed their choice of a
clean break with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Evidence has piled up of Indonesian military complicity in the
violence in East Timor, where Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a former
special forces commander and son-in-law of the deposed president,
Suharto, has considerable influence among troops. He is considered
by some experts to be a foe and a threat to Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said Tuesday that Indonesian army regulars were
seen looting the deserted compound of the U.N. mission in East
Timor Monday night and Tuesday morning after staff members and
refugees taking shelter there were evacuated. Soldiers in uniform
appear to have stolen or destroyed about $10 million in computers,
photocopiers, office equipment and vehicles, according to reports
from the remaining handful of U.N. security officers, now in the
Australian consulate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is also some debate over whether or not the resolution
will carry authorization for the use of military force beyond
routine self-defense and the protection of refugees. Such
essentially war-making powers fall under Chapter VII of the U.N.
Charter, which some Security Council members seemed reluctant to
approve. Several diplomats said that they thought these
reservations had been overcome by midday Tuesday after a meeting of
experts from Security Council member countries.
</P>
<P>
   It is apparent to military planners that even refugee aid could
require a considerable use of force, since pro-Indonesian militias
rampaging through the territory will have to be disarmed at some
point. Looting of aid goods will have to be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Relief experts believe that several hundred thousand East
Timorese may have been driven from their homes. The United Nations
says that 600,000 of the territory's 870,000 people are in need of
some kind of emergency aid. Australia is awaiting permission to
begin airdrops of food and other supplies, which are being
stockpiled in the northern port city of Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   Violence is continuing on the ground in both East Timor and West
Timor, where there were reports Tuesday that some displaced people
were being singled out and taken away in boats to an unknown fate.
No one has a firm estimate of how many people have already died,
but at least one U.N. agency, the Food and Agricultural
Organization in Rome, puts the figure at 7,000. The agency does not
say how it arrived at that number.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday that ``an
atmosphere of total intimidation'' prevails in the East Timorese
capital of Dili. ``UNHCR is gravely alarmed by persistent reports
and indeed mounting evidence of deportation of East Timorese to
West Timor and cases of separation of men from women and
children,'' the refugee agency spokesman, Kris Janowski, said in
Geneva.

HOUSE PANEL SEEKS TESTIMONY IN NATIONALIST CLEMENCY OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angry over the Clinton administration's reluctance
to discuss the clemency offer to members of a Puerto Rican
nationalist group, a House committee Tuesday sent three subpoenas
to White House and Justice Department officials, demanding that
they appear Thursday to state their case.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth subpoena is to go out Wednesday, escalating an
already-politically charged fight between the White House and its
opponents on Capitol Hill and in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional committees are holding oversight hearings
on President Clinton's sharply criticized decision to offer
clemency to 16 members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation,
known by the Spanish abbreviation FALN.
</P>
<P>
   The group, defended as freedom-fighters by their supporters and
derided as terrorists by law enforcement and prosecution officials,
was linked to a series of bombings, murders and robberies during
the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 16 offered clemency was convicted of any specific
act of violence, but the FALN as an organization claimed
responsibility for the crimes. Fourteen of the FALN members
accepted the offer last week.
</P>
<P>
   Practically, there is nothing Congress can do to reverse
Clinton's clemency offer, and the congressional talk on the issue
has served more as a vehicle for members of Congress to say Clinton
is soft on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also accused Clinton of making the gesture to
assist his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her potential bid for
New York's US Senate seat, a charge the White House has denied.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they can't undo the clemency, members have a right
to know why Clinton made the offer despite the strenuous objections
of prosecutors and law enforcement officials, said Mark Corallo,
spokesman for the House Committee on Government Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``is not a king. He is the representative of the people.
We want to know what the reasoning was, exactly,'' Corallo said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI at the last minute backed out of a scheduled appearance
Tuesday before a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relatoins
Committee. The move infuriated the chairman of the subcommittee on
terrorism, Senator Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican who accused
the White House of pressuring the FBI not to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty clear the White House is behind this,''
Coverdell said. The administration is ``trying to build a fortress
around their decision'' to offer clemency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want to provide Congress with information to satisfy its
oversight needs to the fullest extent possible,'' explained Justice
Department spokeswoman Chris Watney. But because of the
``constitutional and institutional'' concerns, and the fact that
the hearing might delve into matters protected by executive
privilege, the agency needed to consider the request further before
sending officials to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The House subpoenas _ issued Tuesday to Beth Nolan of the White
House counsel's office, Neil Gallagher of the FBI, and Michael B.
Cooksey of the Bureau of Prisons _ will be ``reviewed,'' said Jim
Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel. The fourth subpoena
is to acting Assistant Attorney General John Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   The four could be held in contempt of Congress if they fail to
appear, though Corallo said that wasn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional question of which takes precedence _ the
right of the president to executive privilege vs. the right of
Congress to investigate _ is not clear, Kennedy said.

 &HT;    Zoos, pet owners prep animals for Floyd
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The sheep didn't lie down with the lion,
but the hawks hunkered down with binturong in the gift shop of the
Palm Beach Zoo at Dreher Park to weather the onslaught of Hurricane
Floyd Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lion Country Safari wildlife workers penned up the
elephants and white rhinoceroses and pet owners fleeing the area
packed animal shelters with their dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo workers took advantage of every building to find shelter for
the more than 400 animals who live on the 23-acre property.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop, its windows shuttered, became the home of birds
of prey and several binturong, a catlike mammal with a long, hairy
prehensile tail.
</P>
<P>
   The toucans were in the visitors bathroom in crates, the doors
boarded shut. The parrots were caged in the former night house of
the jaguars and the flamingoes were walking about, having the run
of the place.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the smaller animals were crated or caged as zoo workers
prepared for the storm. The zoo's big cats, a pair of tigers, two
ocelots and a Florida panther were locked in the cinder block
shelters were they spend their nights on any other occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The large hoofed animals, along with the tortoises, alligators
and kangaroos were left in their pens but relatively unconfined.
``If we confine them too much, they freak out. They do better if we
give them access to find shelter themselves,'' said zoo education
curator Laurie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo employees were also worried about some of the rare trees
that zoo founder Paul Dreher planted decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all praying for the best,'' But they feared Floyd would
cause flooding to which the zoo is particularly susceptible. Once
the animals were cared for, employees left.
</P>
<P>
   At Lion Country, 60 workers finished making preparations that
began Monday for the attraction's 1,200 animals. The exotic birds,
and reptiles were housed in dog and cat crate. The 15 lions were
put in their concrete block overnight shelters. Elephants and
giraffes were herded into their overnight pens.
</P>
<P>
   But the 40 or so chimpanzees fended for themselves on the
attraction's chimp islands. ``It's impossible to herd those guys,'
said Lion Country spokesman Fred Volpe. The primates have concrete
culverts five-feet wide to hide in.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said the animal park follows strict federal guidelines and
industry standards in preparing for the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The hoofed animals such as zebras, wildebeest, Asian water
buffalo and various species of African antelope were free to roam.
``A lot of the herd animals will stay together with others of its
species and lie down when the weather gets too bad,'' Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the zoo and the animal park may open today after Floyd
passes if the parks are not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than a dozen pet shelters were filled by
Tuesday morning. ``We have room for four or five more large dogs
but that's it,'' said Karen Duchin, office manager at the Animal
Hospital of the Palm Beaches west of Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter held about 70 pets. ``Some belong to people who have
gone to shelters and some to people who have left the area,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most other shelters were closed about noon Tuesday. the
Boca/Delray Animal Hospital was a near capacity with 50 pets and
the Palm Beach Gardens Animal Hospital had 25 animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only boarding those who have to evacuate. We didn't have
enough room for everyone else,'' said office manager Cheryl
Harrison. The dogs and cats were housed in pet runs, cages and
portable cages.

SPORTS COLUMN: HOW TORRE DEALS WITH THE BOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the New York Yankees squirm, George Steinbrenner
is strangely silent, at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting involved,'' the principal owner professed in a
statement Monday after the lost weekend with the Boston Red Sox had
reduced the Yankees' lead in the American League East to three and
a half games. ``I'm not sticking my nose in.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of his boss' nasal prudence, Joe Torre phoned him Tuesday
and, the Yankee manager reported, discussed the slump
goodnaturedly. Quite a contrast to Torre's memory of 1996 when a
12-game lead dwindled to eight games and his phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you blow this thing, I'll never let you forget it,''
Steinbrenner told him. ``You'll have to live with this for the rest
of your life. You'll be another Ralph Branca.''
</P>
<P>
   Branca, of course, was the Brooklyn Dodgers right-hander who
gave up Bobby Thomson's pennant-winning home run for the New York
Giants in 1951 after the Dodgers had blown a 13-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   Those 1996 Yankees went on to win the World Series, but when
Steinbrenner phoned to congratulate Torre on clinching the
division, the manager said, ``Hello, this is Bobby Thomson.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the manager's disclosure of those 1996
conversations in his book ``Joe Torre's Ground Rules for Winners''
(Hyperion, $23.95), written in collaboration with Henry Dreher,
arrived just when Steinbrenner's nose must be itchy.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Torre analyzes ``12 keys that have worked for me''
that he believes will work for any executive or manager in the
corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Yankee manager's relatively peaceful
relationship with Steinbrenner, three chapters on ``Dealing With
Tough Bosses'' are the most revealing in how Torre has coexisted
with the principal owner, notably his reaction to the ``Branca''
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were strong words from the Boss,'' Torre writes, ``and I
made a point of not dwelling on them. I was not about to let myself
get undone by the comparison. Don't overreact to your boss'
behavior. Don't let negative comments get under your skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre has also managed the New York Mets, the Atlanta Braves and
the St. Louis Cardinals, but surprisingly he writes that
Steinbrenner has been ``the easiest'' to work for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first key to dealing with a tough boss,'' Torre suggests,
``is to develop mutual respect and trust. When you put out trust
and loyalty, you're more likely to get trust and loyalty in return.
Don't allow your boss' negative side to bring out your negative
side.''
</P>
<P>
   To Torre, Steinbrenner's negatives are outweighed by his pluses,
especially the owner's commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was willing to spend his money to get the best players
available,'' he writes. ``He was giving me something I never had
before: the horses to ride to the finish line. Having never been to
the World Series in my three decades in baseball, that was worth
everything. In my previous experience, upper management of both the
Braves and Cardinals never made good on their promises to get the
best players available.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre mentions that Ted Turner, the Braves' owner, ``was more
meddlesome'' than Steinbrenner has ever been, a factor that wrecked
their mutual respect in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning,'' Torre writes, ``I let George know that
as far as I am concerned, he's the boss. He's the owner, he pays my
salary, he built the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Likewise, from day one George understood that I run the team
on the field. I'll listen to his suggestions, but the final call is
always up to me. I've never gotten a mandate from George about what
to do on the field. I don't expect I'll ever get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's day-to-day involvement tortured other Yankee
managers, especially Billy Martin, but to Torre, it's a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the fact that I could talk to George, that he made
himself available, made it possible for us to develop mutual
respect,'' he writes. ``I liked both Ted Turner and August Busch
III, but neither of them was very accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Joe Torre has kept his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   While appealing for more funds for prostate cancer research at a
Senate committee hearing last June, the Yankee manager told the
committee members, ``I'm a cancer survivor.'' Then he added with a
smile, ``I'm also a survivor of George Steinbrenner for four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Yankees blow it.

HER FATHER TOLD HER SHE'D NEVER SUCCEED IN A MAN'S WORLD. HE WAS
WRONG.
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANBURY, Texas _ Her father used to tell her that she should've
been born a man; that a woman's place was in the living room,
kitchen and bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been an unconscionable thing for a dad to say to a
little girl with big dreams, but Mary Lou Wilson says she can't
help but thank him.
</P>
<P>
   The memory, she says, feeds her drive to succeed, playing like a
broken record every time anyone suggests _ directly or indirectly _
that she might fail.
</P>
<P>
   That's what came to mind that day in June 1995, when the
chairman of Enrich International, a network marketing company that
makes and sells herbal nutrition and beauty products, asked his top
distributors, including Wilson, to choose a country where they
would like to open a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other distributors chose countries like Korea, Australia,
Malaysia and New Zealand,'' Wilson said. ``I said, `Japan,' and
they said there was no way an American woman could succeed in a
male-dominated country.''
</P>
<P>
   The men punctuated their assessment with laughs. But all Wilson
heard was her father's words playing in her head, and she
remembered how they had sustained her all these years as she worked
to prove him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `I will make this work no matter what,'
'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years later, Wilson, 62, runs a network of 100,000
individual distributors in Japan, which Enrich International says
produces gross revenues of more than $10 million a month. That's
twice as much as the $1.5 billion Venetian, the new Las Vegas
casino and hotel complex, is reported to be making each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically a housewife, and I'm doing over $10 million a
month in sales,'' she said. ``There was never a question in my mind
I would pull it off. But I didn't think in my wildest stretch of
the imagination that I would be as successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clad in a signature red dress, Wilson sits on her living-room
sofa facing a picturesque view of Lake Granbury in North Central
Texas. Around her are mementos that she and her husband, Bob, have
collected over the years.
</P>
<P>
   On a brass coffee table is a globe made of jade, mother of
pearl, lapis and amethyst, etched with lines of gold. She purchased
it in Singapore during a cruise that she sponsored to thank the
Japanese leaders who have supported her business.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a white Rolls-Royce bought in mid-August sits in the
driveway. The license plates read: M LOU W.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a '97 Mercedes, but my Japanese customers have been
after me to get rid of it,'' Wilson said. ``It's an image-driven
country, and anybody that earns a certain amount of money can get a
Mercedes, but only the successful can get a Rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   The car, the lakeside home, the globe and even the red dress
that she is wearing are symbols of her success, and are closely
linked with the growth of her distributorship, now known as Wilson
International Networking: WIN. They embody the kind of
rags-to-riches lifestyle that for many years was just a dream for
this grandmother of three.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't supposed to happen to Mary Lou Wilson. Her father
told her as much. Then he left when she was 6 years old, leaving
behind his wife, daughter and three sons.
</P>
<P>
   He paid for his sons' college educations. But not for Mary
Lou's. His words kept playing in her mind: ``A woman's place was in
the living room, kitchen and bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think deep down I became successful to prove to my father
that a woman can be successful,'' Wilson said with sadness in her
eyes. ``We all have something that drives us, something that makes
us hungry for success. For me, this was it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process of proving her father wrong, Wilson said, ``I
proved it to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many people who may identify with Wilson, although few
have had her success. She said that she worked from the time she
was 9 years old because she wanted to make life easier for her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   She paid her way through night school, but didn't stay long
enough to get a degree from the business college she attended. To
make a living, she worked as a financial adviser, and then as owner
and operator of a Saint Bernard show-dog kennel.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1991, Wilson said, she became interested in herbs _
plants she always thought were just for cooking _ as a way to lose
weight and treat health problems that she was having.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' she said, still astounded at where her
new-found interest would take her.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to obtain the product wholesale, Wilson became a
distributor with Enrich International. When people started
inquiring about her weight loss, they, too, wanted to try the
products.
</P>
<P>
   Before she knew it, Wilson's inventory of herbal products grew
from filling a few shelves in her laundry room to filling her
garage.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, she is perhaps the best-known distributor for Enrich
International and the most successful. She is a presidential
director of the 22-year-old company, a member of the President's
Club, and a former chairwoman of the company's International
Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Lou is one of the most dynamic ladies I've ever met, and
quite a mentor for me,'' said Beverly Hollister, vice president of
worldwide marketing at Enrich. ``She is a great leader, a great
strength, but most of all has great dignity and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollister said that she has traveled throughout Japan with
Wilson and has seen her ``take off a beautiful mink coat and give
it to one of the leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   That leader was Yasuko Takezaki of Honolulu. Takezaki, a single
mother and Wilson's top distributor, had complained of being cold.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister said that she was not on the Enrich team when Wilson's
fellow distributors laughed at her for wanting to sell the
company's products in Japan. But she added that is not something
that would happen today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our management goal is to always give opportunity to everyone
so that there isn't unfair competition,'' Hollister said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson exudes confidence, but not in an intimidating,
condescending way. She is eager to help fellow distributors, to
share the secret of her success. In her case, Wilson's secret might
be as simple as being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she found out a few days in advance that Enrich
International would ask its distributors the million-dollar
question about which country they would choose as a new market for
the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the library,'' she said. ``I looked at countries,
and (Japan) said it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she and her husband, a retired airline captain, read
every book they could find on the Japanese people and their
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned all their customs. We learned when to have tea and
how to have it,'' she said. ``We learned red was the color of
success. I bought a lot of red. I have more red in my closet than
Santa Claus.''
</P>
<P>
   The laughter from her male colleagues only added to Wilson's
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going into a corner and crying, I went out and
proved them wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Wilson immediately contacted the 10 people in
her North American network of distributors who were
Japanese-American. Two of them, she said, wrote to family, friends
and other acquaintances back home to gauge their interest in Enrich
International's herbal products.
</P>
<P>
   During this time, the company was being bought by a group of
private investors. The new CEO and board said no to Japan. That
broken record playing more loudly now, Wilson became even more
determined.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of being bombarded with Wilson's sales pitches,
officials agreed to a less risky approach that would allow her to
sell to Japanese customers for their personal use only. People
could receive cash bonuses for new customer referrals, but they
could not set up any network-retailing organization.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing left to do was prove there was enough interest
for a viable business. ``I worked hard,'' she said. ``There was no
stone unturned.''
</P>
<P>
   With a $160,000 loan from her husband, Wilson rented a
convention hall in May 1998 in Yokohama and invited Enrich's new
CEO to a meeting. She also invited 379 Japanese people who'd
expressed an interest in the herbal products and asked them to
bring others. More than 3,000 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou was wearing her red silk suit, red blouse and red
shoes. The company decided to go forward with the ``not for
resale'' plan. If Wilson were able to reach $3 million in monthly
sales, they told her, they might open an office in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In March of this year, Wilson reached that goal. And on June 28,
an office opened in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything worked,'' Wilson said. ``I did a lot of groundwork,
behind-the-scenes work, fighting custom. I ran into detours,
potholes, but I never lost sight of the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, she credits much of her success to her father, who
died 15 years ago. She describes him as an astute businessman and
said that while working at his various retail and wholesale
businesses, she watched his every move, his style, the way he spoke
to his customers, how he figured profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked all the good out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to go to sleep after another long day, Wilson
said, she never forgets to thank her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him thank you all the time in my prayers,'' she said,
as a big smile creased her face. ``You were a miserable son of a
sea cook but I thank you for making me reach my full potential.''

 &HT;    Phone help available for Florida flood victims
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: FLORIDA EDS. _ INFO BOX MATERIAL)

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If your home or property is flooded this
morning, South Florida water managers can help you figure out where
to turn.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District has started a
24-hour hot line to field reports of flooding, blocked canals and
other drainage problems caused by Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The district's computers can also help residents determine which
of the region's myriad drainage districts, local governments and
homeowners' associations controls the canals, ditches and culverts
in their areas.
</P>
<P>
   On the water district's own canals, the agency will send crews
out as soon as it's safe to assess damage and clear obstructions,
spokeswoman Ann Overton said. The district's waterways generally
are large ones such as the Hillsboro or West Palm Beach canals,
prominently marked by signs bearing a smiling Freddy the Alligator.
</P>
<P>
   For other canals, ``we'll take down all of (the residents')
information,'' Overton said. ``And then we'll call them back to let
them know what we found out.''
</P>
<P>
   She also cautioned that waterlogged streets, swales and even
yards are normal after a heavy rain. In flat South Florida, they're
designed to be part of the drainage system.
</P>
<P>
   District meteorologists predicted 4 inches of rain in Palm Beach
County and 6 inches in Martin and St. Lucie Counties, though
individual spots may get more. They expect no flooding from storm
surges, Overton said.
</P>
<P>
   The district has been lowering its canals since Sunday to make
room. Water managers chose to remain at their headquarters in
suburban West Palm Beach, which is not designed to handle winds
greater than 120 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Other drainage agencies that residents may need to contact
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lake Worth Drainage District: Serves eastern Palm Beach County
from West Palm Beach to Boca Raton. 737-3835 or 498-5363.
</P>
<P>
   _ Indian Trail Improvement District: Oversees a 50,000-acre area
in western Palm Beach County that includes The Acreage. 793-0874.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northern Palm Beach County Improvement District: Covers most
of northeast Palm Beach County. 624-7830.
</P>
<P>
   _ North Palm Beach Heights Water Control District: 844-5205
</P>
<P>
   _ Loxahatchee Groves Water Control District: Covers 7,767 acres
north of Wellington, east of The Acreage and west of Royal Palm
Beach. 793-0884
</P>
<P>
   _ South Indian River Water Control District: Serves Jupiter
Farms, Palm Beach Country Estates, Egret Landing and the Jupiter
Park of Commerce. 747-0550.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ritta Drainage District, Clewiston: (941) 983-8121
</P>
<P>
   _ Hobe-St. Lucie Conservancy District: 546-5700

HISPANIC OFFICIALS BACK GORE, TAKE SWIPE AT BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore picked up endorsements from
Hispanic elected officeholders Tuesday as his campaign launched the
``Ganamos con Gore'' (We Win with Gore) outreach effort to woo the
growing number of Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used his limited Spanish to win over a crowd of Democrats
who gathered at a Washington hotel where the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus Institute is holding an issues summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am honored to have the support of so many outstanding Latino
leaders from across the country,'' Gore said. ``We share the same
values: familia, educacion, amor de patria, communidad y Dios''
(family, education, love of country and belief in God).
</P>
<P>
   The event was designed to distinguish Gore's support in the
Hispanic community from that of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination who also
speaks Spanish on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Gore attacked the popularity of Bush, who so far
has the edge over the vice president in national public opinion
polls, more than a year before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are very worried that the governor is going to
be the next president of the United States,'' Bush campaign
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said from Austin. She said Bush enjoys
strong support among Hispanics in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gore supporters unleashed a barrage of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is known to our community, and his interests in us are
not new found,'' said Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the streets of Los Angeles and New York to the piers of
New Jersey to the valley in Texas, Al Gore stood by our side _ not
with compassion, but with empowerment,'' said Menendez, taking aim
at Bush's campaign slogan of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante of California tried to douse the
perception that Bush's popularity rivaled that of Puerto Rican
singer and heartthrob Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody thinks George Bush is good for the Latino
community, they are `Livin' La Vida Loca,''' Bustamante said,
referring to Martin's hit single.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the state's four Hispanic Democrats in Congress and
numerous local Hispanic officeholders have endorsed Gore. Those
officials said Gore's party primary opponent, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, has struggled to make inroads with Hispanics
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas, said Gore was committed to
Hispanics. ``I think he has always demonstrated that,'' the
congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has Bradley had the occasion or opportunity to address that in
the past? Maybe not. But I now where Gore has been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Bush by name, Gore criticized the Texas
governor's education proposals as a scheme that would take federal
money away from public schools and funnel it to private
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposals would allow parents to take use federal
education funds to enroll their children in private or charter
schools, if public schools fail.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, has promised pre-school education for every
child by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   He also said more needs to be done to improve high school
graduation rates among Hispanics; improve Medicare for the nation's
elderly; and make health care affordable for working families.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a ``fair and accurate census,'' an issue of
concern in the Hispanic community where an undercount of the
minorities in 2000 could lead to weakened political influence in
Congress and other elective offices.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing contrast to support for Bush, the Gore campaign released
a list of nearly 700 Hispanic officials nationwide who have
endorsed the vice president for the Democratic presidential
nomination.

NEW DEVICE HELPS HURRICANE HUNTERS MEASURE FLOYD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While nearly everyone else is fleeing Hurricane Floyd, Jim
Carswell of the University of Massachusetts will fly into the eye
of the storm for the third time Wednesday, measuring its ferocious
winds with a new device that gives forecasters unprecedented
accuracy in gauging the storm's power and direction.
</P>
<P>
   Carswell, part of a team of hurricane hunters who criss-cross
storms in a Navy P-3 ``Orion'' airplane, gets a very different view
of Floyd than the coastal Florida residents boarding up their homes
and heading inland. Dangerous as it is, Carswell said, Floyd is
also quite beautiful in its calm center, and he described it as
being in a cathedral of swirling clouds above water turned a
surreal green.
</P>
<P>
   But the ride to work is singularly hazardous as the specially
reinforced P-3 penetrates Floyd's winds of up to 150 mile an hour
that buffet the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to get your flight legs,'' admitted Carswell,
a research professor at UMass-Amherst's Microwave Remote Sensing
Laboratory. ``You always expect to make it home, although sometimes
your heart races a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd, one of the strongest ever known in the
Atlantic, slammed into the Bahamas Tuesday and sparked an exodus of
2 million people from parts of Florida and Georgia, where
catastrophic damage was feared. Georgia emergency officials
predicted Floyd would rake Savannah and other coastal cities with
winds of 125 miles per hour late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane-hunting flights, run by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, provide vital, inside-the-hurricane
information that help forecasters decide where a hurricane will
reach land and how strong its winds will be. As Floyd draws closer
to the coast, the flights become even more important because the
National Hurricane Center needs around-the-clock updates.
</P>
<P>
   Carswell, who has already flown into Floyd twice, tracks the
wind speeds at the surface of the ocean, the speeds most important
for predicting coastal impacts. Using a high-tech device called a
microwave radiometer, Carswell can calculate wind velocity
thousands of feet below the plane based largely on the amount of
foam churned up in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, hurricane hunters had to estimate surface winds based
partly on the wind outside the aircraft because older model
radiometers couldn't provide enough readings from the sea surface.
But Carswell's radiometer, built by the University of Massachusetts
and Quadrant Engineering of Amherst, Mass., provides surface
readings 12 times more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The microwave radiometer gives us much more complete storm
coverage at the surface . . . and at a fraction of the cost,'' said
Peter Black of NOAA's Hurricane Research Division, one of the
radiometer's designers. ``Eventually, we hope to see this
instrument on all hurricane-hunter aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Carswell, who has been chasing hurricanes since 1991, said Floyd
is the biggest hurricane he has ever seen, with gusts of wind of up
to 140 miles per hour that last for 10 minutes. The winds are so
strong that they strip the top off the waves, creating `streamers'
of water that fly parallel to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Carswell and the rest of the 16 to 18 person
crew will get an even closer look at Floyd's power as they track
its approach to land at just 5,000 feet elevation, instead of the
normal 14,000 feet. Eric Knapp, the University of Massachusetts
engineer who led the radiometer design team, said the device gives
more detailed readings at lower altitudes, though the flight may be
rougher as well.
</P>
<P>
   However, NOAA officials say the Lockheed P-3 planes are well
equipped to withstand hurricane-force winds. Mainly, the pilots fly
in a straight line across the storms, constantly compensating for
the winds that blow them off course. The main hazard are the abrupt
up and down drafts, which tend to be strongest just outside the
eye.

 &HT;    Hurricane-wary residents heed Floyd's wrath
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tuesday morning, the roads through Palm
Beach County were almost deserted, a sort of anti-rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   People who were going to leave did _ off to standing-room-only
Red Cross shelters, to hotel rooms in Tampa or Orlando, to friends
or relatives a few miles inland. The rest put the finishing touches
on plywood improvements to their homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic is very, very light,'' said Florida Highway Patrol Lt.
Pembrook Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late to head north, where the brunt of the storm was
expected anyway. Bumper-to-bumper traffic snarled northbound
Interstate-95 through northern Florida, westbound Interstate-10
toward Tallahassee was congested and State Road 60 west of Vero
Beach was jammed as people tried to get a little more distance
between themselves and the expected fury of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County sheriff's spokesman Paul Miller said the Palm
Beach County Sheriff's Office planned to have 500 deputies on the
road Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was moving smoothly through St. Lucie, Martin and
Okeechobee counties on Tuesday, though in some spots it was heavier
than normal. But officials expected people off the roads by the
time the storm came through, said Okeechobee County Sheriff's Capt.
Gary Hargraves.
</P>
<P>
   The car was the only option. Train service was suspended Monday;
Palm Beach International Airport was closed at noon Tuesday (doors
locked, sandbags out) and jets were flown out of the region. The
airport should re-open today, though travelers should call their
carriers for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going north,'' said Mike Deoreo, as he boarded up his
Flamingo Park home Tuesday around lunchtime. ``If anything, I'd go
south.''
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak Tuesday, Palm Beach was nearly deserted except for
police patrols, a few sightseers and a lone jogger hoofing along
Seaspray Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury cars that normally park at the curbsides were nowhere to
be found and mansions and condos were masked with color-coordinated
shutters and panels of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people have left,'' said Sigrid Kumpe, as she
loaded belongings into a car on Seaspray a block from the ocean.
``I think I need to get out, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the rows of mobile homes at Briny Breezes, there were few
signs of life except for Rhea Weber trimming a flowering bush with
her clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other fools have stayed,'' joked Weber, who was making
final preparations to leave herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Tim, said they would be out by noon to spend the
night with relatives in Boca Raton. A wind gauge whirling above his
mobile home registered a gust of 36 miles an hour at 8 a.m., he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when we come back Wednesday this will be just as it
is now,'' he said. ``If not, we have three different insurance
policies for wind, flood and property damage.''
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach also resembled a ghost town. The stores that
opened were, for the most part, closed by noon. Most fast-food
restaurants were closed; it was even hard to find a gas station
open in the afternoon. Those who were out on Clematis Street
downtown were putting up shutters and plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Along I-75 north of Central Florida, evacuees flooded tourist
offices with questions: Where to stable a horse? Find a hotel that
takes pets? Find enough rooms for 100 people?
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m. Tuesday, the staff at the Gainesville Holiday Inn was
</P>
<P>
   advising them to look for hotel rooms in Atlanta. By 11:30 a.m.,
the word
</P>
<P>
   at the Georgia welcome center, just north of the Florida border
on I-75,
</P>
<P>
   was that there were no rooms south of Calhoun, 80 miles north of
Atlanta _ and 320 miles from the border. Four hours later, the
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau was suggesting Chattanooga,
Tenn. A hotel in Birmingham, Ala., was offering rooms, convention
bureau spokeswoman Brandy O'Quinn mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Flores of Belle Glade took a break at the welcome center,
after
</P>
<P>
   driving through Monday night. After Palm Beach County officials
ordered
</P>
<P>
   mobile home residents to evacuate Monday evening, ``I closed my
trailer, got my clothes and my family, and hit the road,'' he said.
In a caravan of four cars and 20 relatives, he was heading for his
brother's home in Macon, Ga. _ the same place he waited out
Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many east-coasters could be found at the Hyatt
Regency Tampa, which General Manager Tom Smith boasts has never had
water in the lobby. ``I've got all your residents over here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's hovering around the television at the bar and
watching the storm updates,'' Smith said. ``It's kind of a festive
atmosphere. They're just a little worried about their homes,
whether they'll be gone when they get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, some residents who evacuated from barrier
islands didn't travel that far. The Doubletree Hotel In Palm Beach
Gardens put its overflow guests in the ballroom. The Omni Hotel in
West Palm Beach booked up early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming from all over,'' said the Omni's Lori Keil. ``I
just saw a whole group of people come in with their paintings to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything I'd save.''

 &HT;    Ships flee port ahead of storm
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Ships fled the Port of Palm Beach Monday
and Tuesday heading for a safer place to ride out the storm: the
open sea.
</P>
<P>
   Barges went to the Gulf of Mexico, while the two gambling ships
and several cargo vessels steamed south toward Key West or spots in
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vessel is best at sea, avoiding the weather event,'' Deputy
Port Director Martin Mets said.
</P>
<P>
   While it's standard practice to send all ships out ahead of a
hurricane, two vessels will remain at the port.
</P>
<P>
   One is a 386-foot sugar barge, which is too slow to outrun the
storm, Mets said. The other is a 175-foot cargo vessel with engine
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Both ships were tied down with heavy weather mooring systems,
and each will have a full crew on board throughout the storm, Mets
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Shipping, the port's largest tenant, had its local
operation secured by mid-Tuesday and had sent ships out to sea from
the Port of Palm Beach and from the Bahamas ports of Nassau and
Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll stay out on the water, hold their position and get out
of the way of the storm,'' said Richard Calcote, Tropical's vice
president of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical, which employs about 500 at the port and an additional
50 people in the Bahamas, has a five-person crew ready to fly to
the islands following the storm.
</P>
<P>
   They'll assess the damage and re-establish communications so the
company can get ships back to the Bahamas as soon as possible,
Calcote said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to need relief supplies _ water, building
materials and so on,'' he said.

 FRENCH PREMIER LAUDS PROTESTERS WHO JUST SAY NO TO `McDO'  
 (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When it comes to showing France's refusal to roll over
to U.S.-led globalization of the world economy, Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin bows to almost no man.
</P>
<P>
   But he did Monday night on national television, when he was
asked about protests at 40 McDonald's restaurants around the
country this summer against extra U.S. tariff duties on Roquefort,
foie gras and other French products imposed because France refuses
to import U.S. hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin took off his hat to the leader of the protests, a French
farmers' union official named Jose Bove, who spent about two weeks
under arrest after a demonstration in Auch on July 27 wrecked a
McDonald's building site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still a people of Gallic origins,'' Jospin said,
bringing to mind visions of Asterix and Obelix, the popular cartoon
Gauls, underdogs who use their fists, and magic potions, and always
get the best of all the Roman legions that Caesar can throw against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there are movements, there are personalities that
emerge,'' said Jospin, recalling a truck driver lionized as
``Tarzan'' during an epic truckers' strike in 1992 and a spokesman
for the jobless known as ``Robin Hood,'' who caught the country's
sympathy for their plight in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here again is a strong, vigorous personality, who stems a bit
from our people, with the radicalism that has always existed,''
Jospin told his interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally not very pro-McDo,'' Jospin said, using the
familiar diminutive for the fast-food chain, pronouncing it
``Mac-doh'' the way millions of French customers do.
</P>
<P>
   After pointing out earlier that its ubiquitous branches buy
mostly French beef and potatoes and provide income for tens of
thousands of French farmers, McDonald's is now lying low under its
golden arches. The chain made no comment Tuesday about the prime
minister's remarks, and an official said the wave of demonstrations
against its restaurants appeared to have calmed down.

 &HT;    Spanish-speaking community getting word on Floyd
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For those who don't understand English,
the early television images of Hurricane Floyd were frightening
beyond words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a whole segment of our community watching our station
who were frantic because they couldn't understand what we were
saying,'' said WPEC Channel 12 new anchor Liz Quirantes. ``They
didn't even have the basic information.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday night, Quirantes gave two-minute updates in
Spanish every half-hour so that the hundreds of viewers who don't
speak English could put words to the scary images.
</P>
<P>
   WPTV Channel 5 also slipped into Spanish from time to time to
keep all viewers informed. Spanish-language radio stations issued
hurricane bulletins and information throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling them what the National Hurricane Center is
saying and also giving information on how to prepare their homes
and where to find the shelters,'' said Helman Ruiz of Radio Fiesta
WLVS-1380 AM in Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz was on the air from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m., giving updates every
10 to 15 minutes. He also urged listeners to contact the Palm Beach
County's Emergency Operations Center, where volunteers helped
Spanish-speaking callers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4,500 calls to the center, about 500 came from Spanish
speakers, said Ruth Moguillansky, a bilingual county planner who
answered telephones beginning at 3 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moguillansky said she did live interviews with Radio Fiesta,
WLTV Channel 23 in Miami and Miami radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   While many Hispanics in Palm Beach County were glued to
Univision's Channel 23, the Spanish-speaking newscasters did not
have continuous updates about shelters and conditions in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the callers wanted local information, Moguillansky said.
</P>
<P>
   One call came from a girl who was calling for her mother, said
County Commissioner Carol Roberts. Roberts told the girl to put the
mother on the line and hold for Moguillansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to give them the information in Spanish,''
Roberts said. ``It's a way of giving them comfort and security and
information that will keep them safe.''

CASPER TO STEP DOWN AS STANFORD'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanford University president Gerhard Casper announced Tuesday
that he would resign at the end of August 2000, citing the
perpetual need for fresh perspectives on campus and his desire to
focus on teaching undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Casper, 61, became president at the elite West Coast campus in
1992, as it was recovering from revelations that the university had
overcharged the federal government millions of dollars in indirect
research costs, and as it was trying to rebuild after the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Casper launched several initiatives to
improve education during students' first two years; led a merger of
the hospitals at Stanford and the University of California-San
Francisco; boosted fund raising to more than $300 million annually,
and started a $200 million endowment campaign to support graduate
students independent of research grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a university, no time is ever an appropriate one to claim
that tasks have been completed,'' Casper told a regularly scheduled
meeting of deans and department heads on the Palo Alto, Calif.,
campus Tuesday afternoon, according to the prepared text of his
remarks. ``All days of a university need to be first days. The work
of the university is work that cannot be done unless it is
continuously reconsidered.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from Ecclesiastes, ``To every thing there is a season,''
Casper noted that he had spent two decades in top administrative
posts, starting as dean of the law school and then provost at the
University of Chicago. Of his seven years at Stanford, he joked,
``Ten years at least is the way it feels.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in the heart of the booming Silicon Valley, Stanford has
become among the hottest names in higher education during Casper's
tenure, rivaling Ivy League institutions in competitiveness,
prestige and fund-raising prowess. Faculty members who have watched
the international reputation of the 14,000-student campus soar said
they were stunned by the resignation, and praised their president
for unifying the university and refocusing it on academics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``His dedication to and love of teaching undergraduates
permeated everything,'' said Lucy Shapiro, a professor of
developmental biology at the Stanford Medical School. ``He's almost
unique in his desire to learn in depth how different schools work,
how different disciplines work, and how to put a research
university like Stanford squarely in the center of training the
next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Key elements of Casper's legacy will be Stanford Introductory
Studies, a series of small seminars for first- and second-year
students, and Sophomore College, a two-week program in which
students take one intensive course before classes begin in the
fall. On the graduate level, he founded the fellowship program to
support up to 300 science students free of sponsored research, and
another initiative that brings graduate students from Asia for a
year-long seminar on politics and economics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He convinced the faculty that it was very possible, indeed it
was necessary, for a research-intensive university such as Stanford
also to focus on undergraduate education, from the first days
students step on campus,'' said Ramon Saldivar, a professor of
English who recently finished a five-year stint as vice provost.
Noting that Casper taught undergraduate courses, Saldivar added:
``Gerhard didn't just talk about undergraduate education, he
provided the immense resources necessary for undergraduate
education to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Casper also oversaw restoration of earthquake-damaged landmarks
and construction of a new science and engineering quadrangle, and
graduate residences.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done just a marvelous job of rebuilding and expanding the
campus, not just for the buildings themselves, but for the strength
that he's given the institution,'' said Yale University president
Richard Levin, who is a Stanford alumnus. ``He is a true scholar, a
person of really wide learning and wide tastes. It's a great loss
for Stanford, and a great loss for higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hamburg, Germany, and having spent a quarter-century at
the University of Chicago, Casper at first struggled to adjust to
the laid-back life on the sun-dappled campus, where he is referred
to by his first name. But he soon donned the T-shirt of the 6th Man
Club and became a staple in the stands during basketball games, and
took roles in the Stanford Gaeities, an annual follies.
</P>
<P>
   Known to whip out the copy of the U.S. Constitution he keeps in
his coat pocket during discussions of affirmative action _ which he
supports _ or gay rights _ which he expanded by giving benefits to
employees' domestic partners _ Casper plans to take a sabbatical
and then return to Stanford to teach constitutional law.

before a voluntary recall, state health officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But due to an incubation period for E. coli bacteria that can
last several days before intestinal illness strikes, the officials
said some related incidents of diarrhea might be reported later
among people who unwittingly consumed contaminated meat that was
sold Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 20,000 pounds of recalled ground beef was
distributed in the Houston area, officials of the San Antonio-based
grocery chain said. Nor was any of it sold in its 75 smaller H-E-B
Pantry Food outlets around Texas or its three gourmet Central
Market stores in Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Any unsold meat in question has been removed from the shelves in
160 other H-E-B stores in Central, South and North Texas, including
40 in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The recall began after store employees detected the potentially
deadly bacteria while taking routine samples at a company
warehouse, officials said. The bacteria was found only in a
one-ounce sample, but state officials said the grocery company
decided to ``err on the side of caution'' by recalling all 10 tons
of possibly contaminated beef.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery chain said the beef was sold in two types of
packages. Some was packaged on Styrofoam trays and covered in clear
plastic wrap, with ``sell by'' dates of Sept. 13 and 14. Aqua and
green tubes of super lean ground beef, also recalled, displayed a
``sell by'' date of Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get word to people that if they bought ground
beef at H-E-B on Sunday or Monday and it has those sell-by dates on
it, then it may be contaminated. And the key word there is `may,'''
said Texas Department of Health spokesman Doug McBride.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery company has offered full refunds to anyone who
returns one of the suspected meat packages. They also offered to
test packages at the customer's request.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many stores are involved in the recall, health
officials said it's still unclear how much of the beef was sold;
how much was removed from shelves and whether any of it was also
tainted. Health officials also are waiting to see if anyone turns
up sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take a few days,'' McBride said, adding that distress
usually strikes five to seven days after exposure.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that proper cooking of raw meat can reduce or
eliminate the E. coli danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's cooked like it's supposed to be _ we recommend to 160
degrees internal temperature _ then there shouldn't be a problem,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli is a large family of bacteria, most of which is harmless
and lives in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However,
a strain carried by some cattle produces a toxin that can make
humans severely ill.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, two people died and nearly 1,000 became ill
in separate outbreaks of E. coli in New York and Illinois.

FLOYD REVEALS THE DARK SIDE OF PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIERA, Fla. _ Carol Ketchum has long had the dream life. A house
six blocks from the ocean. A pool in the backyard. Christmas on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Now she wants to move back home.
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Floyd and its 145 mile-an-hour winds barreling
toward central Florida Tuesday night, Ketchum and her family left
their home in Satellite Beach and joined nearly 800 others at a
shelter in an elementary school here. Floyd, due to hit overnight,
has them spooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister from Greenville, Rhode Island, called me this
morning, and said, `Please leave there. You're my only sister.
Don't die!' '' said Ketchum, 51, sitting in a beach chair in a
school hallway. ``Well, I'm ready to move back to Rhode Island or
Massachusetts. Enough of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of Florida, too,'' said her husband, Charles, 46, a
mailman and a Key West native. ``The fires were terrible last year.
Now this. In the post office, they say we deliver in rain, sleet,
or snow. They didn't say anything about hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida is a place of opportunity for some, a last resort for
others, a place of escape, a place of retirement communities, a
place with old cow towns in its middle and concrete canyons along
its sides. And it keeps attracting hundreds of thousands of
newcomers every year because of its climate.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the package is the hurricane season, from June to
November, and for anyone who has lived through a hurricane there is
a feeling of dread whenever one gets close.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be much closer now. Here, along the so-called Space
Coast, there is the widely expressed belief that this stretch of
Florida coast is safer than any other place because of the
recurrent wind current and wind pressures. NASA conducted in-depth
studies before deciding to build the Kennedy Space Center here.
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd appears bent on breaking the rules. It is too big.
Forecasters late Tuesday predicted that the hurricane's eye may
pass 20 to 25 miles from the coast here, but tropical and
hurricane-force winds could last 20 hours, not ending until 4 p.m.
Wednesday. Tropical winds are over 37 miles an hour, hurricane
winds over 74 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of know when to worry and when not to worry, and I'm
worried now,'' said Karen Smink, who has lived in Florida for 40 of
her 43 years. ``And that's why I'm in the shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   The shelter was in the brand-new Ralph M. Williams Jr.
Elementary School, which is in the brand-new community of Viera,
which is full of brand-new homes with huge picture windows, several
golf courses, and thousands of birds that were madly digging up the
greens in a hunt for worms in the hours before the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Judy Davis own one of those homes. ``I just had my
windows washed on Sunday, so at least when my glass goes to heaven
tomorrow it will be clean,'' Judy Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd didn't shake their belief in Florida life, but it unnerved
them. ``It scared the hell out of her,'' Bob Davis said, motioning
to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very threatening feeling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the shelter, they received phone calls from
relatives up north. Judy Davis's brother called from Boston
Tuesday, where he was on a business trip. ``He wanted to know where
we were going,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Patterson, 42, a Burlington, Mass., native, got an
earful, too. ``I was going to stay in my home and send my wife and
kids to the shelter,'' he said, sitting in a L.L. Bean canvas
chair. ``But this morning, I got, `I want you out of that house, I
want you to drive north,' from my sister-in-law. Then my sister
calls, so here I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't much you can do, is there?'' he asked. ``I
don't miss the snow, and I like it when it's Christmas and you're
outside and it's 72 degrees. But this is part of life here, too.''

 &HT;    Aryan Nation leader files suit in Ohio over beatings from blacks
 &HT;    By Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The local head of the Aryan Nation charges he was
severely beaten in 1997 at the Montgomery County, Ohio Jail because
he was not properly segregated from black inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed late Friday in U.S. District Court in Dayton,
Morris Lynn Gulett also charges that his jailers waited four to
five weeks after the assault to get him medical attention, further
aggravating his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants in the lawsuit include Sheriff Gary Haines, 10
unnamed jailers and five unnamed inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Donald Sprude, the warden at the jail, said he has not been
served with a copy of the lawsuit and declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit states that Gulett was an inmate at the jail from
March 1, 1997, through March 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show he was awaiting trial on two counts of
felonious assault on a police officer. On Jan. 16, 1998, Gulett
pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault on a
police officer and was released after serving one year.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit states that jailers knew, or should have known that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gulett was the ``head individual of the Aryan Nation in the
metropolitan Dayton'' area, as well as a ``ranking member'' of the
organization for Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Aryan Nation is ``an organization that is known to be
segregationist in its ideology and to be supportive of the belief
of 'white supremacy' and in the inferiority of certain others, in
particular, Afro-Americans, Jews, and Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The population of the jail at that time was ``substantially
Afro-American.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, 1997, the lawsuit claims, Gulett was attacked and
beaten when he was left unprotected by the jailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beating was unprovoked by plaintiff and was solely because
such inmates, as Afro-Americans, knew of plaintiff's identity and
his relationship with the Aryan Nation,'' claims the lawsuit, which
seeks millions of dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the beating, Gulett claims he suffered serious
physical injuries, including a broken nose, ruptured eardrum and
lacerated lip.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result of not being provided medical attention for
about four to five weeks after the beating, physicians had to
re-break Gulett's nose in order to properly set it, the lawsuit
claims.

BUT IS THE WORLD READY FOR MORE OF `CALIGULA?' 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
Ted Loos' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
Cinefest, a film festival in upstate New York. 
By TED LOOS  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month, the movie that became infamous for going too far is
going even further _ about 12 minutes further, according to its
producer, Bob Guccione. ``Caligula,'' called by Newsweek ``a
two-and-one-half hour cavalcade of depravity,'' is now running
nearly two-and-three-quarters hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Values have shifted dramatically,'' said Guccione, explaining
why he wants to return to the screen a movie that inspired comments
like ``remarkably repulsive'' from the film critic of The New York
Times. ``I think it will be less controversial today.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics who reviewed this $17-million historo-pornographic epic
in 1980 were unanimous in their disgust; patrons even in
shock-proof New York recounted that the theater in which it was
showing reeked of vomit, and Guccione returned to his day job as
publisher of Penthouse magazine and never made a movie again.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he sees ``Caligula'' (which opened Friday) as ``a
cinematic icon''; and he is calling the re-release ``a director's
cut.'' Gore Vidal, who wrote the film's first screenplay, isn't so
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how there can be a `director's cut' of a film that
credits no one as director?'' Vidal said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no one is credited as screenwriter, either. When he
learned about the explicit sex scenes, Vidal demanded to have his
name removed from the title; the film was to have been called
``Gore Vidal's Caligula.'' In the end, the credits said the film
had merely been ``adapted from an original screenplay'' by the
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to some expense to get my name out,'' Vidal wrote
in an e-mail from his home in Ravello, Italy. Tinto Brass, the
original director, didn't last either, leaving Guccione and
Giancarlo Lui, who served as Guccione's assistant director,
responsible for ``additional scenes,'' while Brass was credited
with ``principal photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the defections and recriminations, it would never
have made much of a date movie. The Roman Emperor Caligula, who was
assassinated after less than four years of misrule, is assumed to
have been mad: his best-known act was making his horse consul.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, he interrupts an incestuous affair with his sister
to kill his grandfather, Tiberius. Once on the throne, he governs
by means of an elaborate decapitation machine, essentially a
weed-whacker for the heads of people conveniently buried up to
their necks in the ground. For relaxation, he rapes both a bride
and groom on their wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   But the depredations of a first-century tyrant are not the
movie's chief concern. ``The film's action,'' wrote Vincent Canby
in his Times review, ``is entirely in its orgies, which are
exhausting and solemn.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiked with violence and populated with Penthouse pets _ one of
whom later sued Guccione for sexual harassment and won $4 million
in damages _ the ``sex-and-violence tableaux,'' Canby said, left
him ``with the feeling that everybody in the world has more
endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Guccione presumably agrees that the movie doesn't need any
amplification in this department. The footage added for the
re-release, he said, is mostly dramatic rather than sexual. That no
doubt pleases the classy actors whose performances are glimpsed in
between the orgies: Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, Helen Mirren as
his wife, Peter O'Toole as Tiberius and John Gielgud as one of
Caligula's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of it as pornography,'' said Guccione, who
sold tickets for the movie at the then-exorbitant price of $7.50.
``It was to be the first of a trilogy of films I had in mind to
illustrate the axiom that power corrupts, and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Caligula'' grossed $21 million in its initial release and,
according to Guccione, worked its way to $30 million through video
sales. Mark Borde, a president of Legacy Releasing, the Los Angeles
company that is distributing the film, expects it to do well in
re-release. ``People remember it,'' he said. ``It's release-proof.
You could even go up against `Star Wars.' The audience for this
movie will come anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the augmented, Dolby-ized prints are being released as
the 20th anniversary edition, Guccione has jumped the gun a bit,
since the original was released in 1980. So yet another milestone
accrues to the film believed to be the most expensive ever to
contain explicit sex footage: it will go down in history as the
first film to be re-released in a 19th-anniversary producer's cut.

 &HT;    Taft's task force advises giving tobacco money back to
neighborhoods
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Democrats on Gov. Bob Taft's tobacco advisory
task force Tuesday proposed sending some of Ohio's $10.1 billion in
the national tobacco settlement back to local communities, a plan
advocated by Montgomery County Prosecutor Mathias Heck Jr. and
prosecutors from four other large counties.
</P>
<P>
   That and other proposed changes from the spending plan offered
last week by state budget director Tom Johnson, chairman of the
task force, delayed a vote by the 15-member group until its Sept.
29 meeting. Other proposed changes included increased spending for
minority health needs and buying prescription drugs for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco money is to be paid over 26 years with the first two
installments, totaling about $443 million, to arrive by June.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg, said the
legislature will need the task force's recommendations by month's
end to have enough time to consider them when the House and Senate
return in October for a fall session. The legislature and Taft will
have final say on how the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the task force would consider the proposed changes
but that Taft, who has endorsed Johnson's proposal, will not budge
on the key recommendation to spend $4.5 billion on school
buildings. Johnson also calls for spending an additional $1.2
billion on technology for schools. Overall, education would get
more than 56 percent of the tobacco money under Johnson's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco money is a key part of Taft's 12-year school
building plan, also announced last week, to spend $23.1 billion in
state and local money to build and repair schools, including
vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not willing to bargain on school facilities,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eric Fingerhut, D-Cleveland, and Rep. Harold Ford,
D-Toledo, the House minority leader, advocated sending some tobacco
money _ Ford suggested $10 million a year _ directly back to local
communities. Johnson's plan has no money for local communities.
</P>
<P>
   Heck and prosecutors from Summit (Akron), Cuyahoga (Cleveland),
Lucas (Toledo) and Franklin (Columbus) counties contend that local
governments have spent their money, not the state's, for treating
tobacco-related illnesses in public hospitals and in caring for
prisoners, and thus deserve part of the windfall from the tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If local governments don't get a portion, the prosecutors have
said they might file their own lawsuits against the tobacco
companies. If they prevailed, their settlements could be taken from
the $10.1 billion because of the way the national tobacco
settlement is structured.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democratic task force member, state Rep. Jerry Krupinski
of Steubenville, called for spending $29 million a year on
prescription drugs and taking the money from what Johnson has
recommended for school buildings. This would be enough to help an
estimated 53,000 senior citizens, said Krupinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not make them choose between eating a good meal, eating
any kind of meal and taking medication that is life-sustaining,''
Krupinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ford said some money for senior citizens' prescriptions
could come out of a proposal he made to increase the first-year
allotment to a public health priorities health fund from $10
million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these extra dollars, however, would be for minority
health needs, said Ford. The added money is needed because tobacco
advertising for years targeted minority customers, resulting in a
disproportionate rise in tobacco-related health problems for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that the increase for this trust fund would not have
to be so great if some of the dollars in another trust fund, for
tobacco use prevention and control, were earmarked for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The task force includes lawmakers, members of Taft's Cabinet and
Attorney General Betty Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is one of 46 states that agreed to the overall $206 billion
settlement with the major tobacco companies last year.

A ROCKER PRACTISING THE POWER OF NEGATIVE THINKING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the novel ``Great Jones Street,'' Don DeLillo defined a rock
star as ``one man imparting an erotic terror to the dreams of the
republic.'' The only 1990s rocker to live up to that billing has
been Trent Reznor, who records as Nine Inch Nails.
</P>
<P>
   On the albums and EP ``Pretty Hate Machine'' (1989), ``Broken''
(1992) and ``The Downward Spiral'' (1994), Reznor crawled inside
the mind-set of a psychotic loner who could calmly intone:
``Nothing can stop me now / I don't care anymore.'' In ``Head Like
a Hole,'' he vowed, ``I'd rather die than give you control''; he
probed the sacred and profane sexual impulse in ``Closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Blurting out alienation and thwarted rage, Nine Inch Nails songs
provided defiant sing-alongs for fans and obvious targets for the
censorious.
</P>
<P>
   With Reznor playing nearly every instrument, the music throbbed
and blared and insinuated. It merged the pitiless beat of
industrial rock with the guitar attack of heavy metal, sometimes
dropping to a dire murmur, often adding enough melody to make the
songs reach beyond the rock audience's head-banging fringe.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't rule anything out: Beatles harmonies, a disco beat,
punk-rock tremolos, a primal howl. With the psychological expertise
of a horror-film soundtracker and a willingness to wield ugly
sounds in precise doses, Reznor became the auteur of the foreboding
and the grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   The ominous tone still dominates ``The Fragile.'' But on the new
album, it's bye-bye, blasphemy and so long, sex and drugs and S&AMP;M.
Reznor's adolescent concerns, the ones that put black NIN stickers
on the lockers of high school students both sensitive and
belligerent, are receding; maybe he has bequeathed them to his
onetime (and now estranged) protege Marilyn Manson, who's still
eager to court notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor has lost interest in easy sensationalism and standard
taboos, and he's no longer fighting psychological battles with
authority figures. Instead, he has decided to stare down his most
relentless tormentor: himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fragile'' (Nothing/Interscope 0694904732), the first Nine
Inch Nails album in five years, is a desperate identity crisis
rendered in symphonic scale: two CDs lasting 104 minutes, with 17
songs and six instrumentals. It's an immersion in negative
expectations, a passage toward an ever more encompassing solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Over the length of the album, every possible support _ friends,
faith, love, his own stubborn persistence _ shatters when the
singer needs it most. ``Thought he lost everything/ Then he lost a
whole lot more,'' Reznor whispers over clatters and thumps and a
subdued bass undertow in ``I'm Looking Forward to Joining You,
Finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its lyrics never offer specifics, ``The Fragile'' could
be decoded as an album about the struggle to make the album itself.
It can also, however, stand as a cycle of songs about one man's
reaction to betrayal, loneliness and insurmountable depression.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in its music, the album's sense of isolation mirrors the
situation of a one-man studio band, like Reznor, trying to stave
off his self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fragile'' is clearly an artifact of obsessive studio toil.
Every nanosecond of sound has been painstakingly sharpened and
barbed. Nine Inch Nails has always used jolting dynamics, corrosive
vocals and serrated timbres.
</P>
<P>
   But on ``The Fragile,'' Reznor and his co-producer, Alan
Moulder, don't simply bludgeon the songs. They open up the music
the way Damien Hirst's sculptures _ like his full-size slices of
cows in transparent cases _ open up anatomy. Reznor is less and
less inclined to imitate the sound of a live band with guitars,
keyboards, bass and drums playing their usual roles.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangements on ``The Fragile'' are more erratic; they slip
rhythmic gears, they wrangle from within, they suddenly shift
volume and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The first song on the album, ``Somewhat Damaged,'' is a
typically unstable contraption. It starts with a repeating
four-note line on acoustic guitar, answered by an insistently
dissonant note from the other speaker; stop-start drums turn the
beat around; a fast electronic pulse chatters in the mid-range; a
simple vocal line sits across the four-note line, which moves to
nastier electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are volleys of staggered percussion sounds; the pulse
leaps from instrument to instrument; Reznor's voice grows frazzled
and furious as he pronounces himself ``poison to my rotten core.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of pointillism is only one of Nine Inch Nails'
strategies on ``The Fragile.'' There are straightforward hard-rock
thrashers and sustained processionals, beats like slow hip-hop and
zinging techno riffs. Reznor chants simple, repeating lines while
the music ricochets all around him, or he gathers voices and
instruments for big, old-fashioned rock choruses, then goes on to
vandalize them.
</P>
<P>
   All over the album, acoustic and electronic sounds are processed
beyond recognition. Instruments writhe in and out of tune; static
and distortion are calibrated and layered until they become rhythm
as well as noise. The arrangements change restlessly through every
song, rising and collapsing, taking on heft and then fracturing
themselves. Riffs slip quietly into the mix, then detonate, and
power chords slam into the foreground, then drop away like
trapdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The music never finds secure ground. But it rarely stumbles,
either. Reznor's worst misstep is to let the pianist Mike Garson
fling too many of the clusters he has been adding to rock records
since he appeared on David Bowie's 1973 ``Aladdin Sane.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, ``The Fragile'' finds glimmers of human connection.
Early on the first disk, ``We're in This Together'' gives the
singer an inseparable lover as he insists, ``We will make it
through somehow,'' although frenzied, distortion-laced guitars
snarl of impending disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Please,'' he begs, ``Will you please complete me?'' only to
realize that his partner will never be enough. The album's title
song, a stately, slow-building ballad, praises a fragile woman who
``shines in a world full of ugliness,'' and the singer promises,
``I won't let you fall apart.'' But as they seek ``the perfect
place,'' over burbling ``Strawberry Fields'' keyboards, the
accompaniment turns sour, dissonant, paranoid. The idyll can't
last.
</P>
<P>
   More conventionally, a few songs lash out at show business
bloodsuckers and sycophants, including one that's obviously a
parting shot at Marilyn Manson. But the old Nine Inch Nails spite
and irritability no longer ring as true as the songs that own up to
frailty, self-loathing and perseverance despite it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place I can hide / It feel like it keeps coming
from the inside,'' Reznor rasps as he's buffeted by discordant bass
double-stops and synthetic buzzes and zaps in ``The Big Come
Down.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Fragile,'' the singer never finds a way out of his
misery. Then again, he doesn't approach suicide as he did on ``The
Downward Spiral.'' All he can do is endure and observe, fighting
his own fears to a stalemate. While he does that, luckily, Reznor
can hide in the studio and piece together music that's as cunning,
and disquieting, as his raw anger used to be.

MENDES BRINGS THEATER DIRECTOR'S EYE TO FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sam Mendes has been focusing a fresh, imaginative
eye on live theater for some time now. The 36-year-old Englishman
has won raves on both sides of the Atlantic for, among other
things, his audience-involving re-engineering of ``Cabaret,'' and
``The Blue Room'' production that earned oceans of press for Nicole
Kidman's brief nude scene.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mendes has aimed his vision through cameras. And ``American
Beauty,'' his feature directing debut, should stir up as much
praise and hubbub as his stage work.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy of morals that gets deeper as it grows darker,
``Beauty'' dissects the suburban dream with unflinching, often
outrageous precision. It's built around the midlife crisis of
unhappy husband Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), his success-crazed,
real-estate agent wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and their sulky
teen-age daughter, Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Fixated on Angela (``American Pie's'' Mena Suvari), one of
Jane's cheerleading pals, Lester tries to drive every last vestige
of responsible behavior out of his life and act like he's 18 again.
Other main characters include Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the
pot-selling, videotaping voyeur next door, and his father the
Colonel (Chris Cooper), a martinet ex-Marine with a big secret.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes, whose small frame contains a boundless, good-natured
enthusiasm, feels especially well-equipped to examine these
archetypal American souls in minute detail. After all, he hasn't
lived around anyone like them, but he did see them in movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most Englishmen, I grew up on American film, so I felt
very comfortable telling American stories in a way that actually
surprised me when I came to read the script,'' says Mendes, who was
turned on to TV writer Alan Ball's screenplay by none other than
DreamWorks partner Steven Spielberg. ``I never doubted it because I
wasn't American. But I also realized that a lot of the films I've
loved most about this country had been directed by non-Americans _
John Schlesinger's `Midnight Cowboy,' Roman Polanski's `Chinatown,'
Wim Wenders' `Paris, Texas' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an emotional detachment that the outsider can have
that's very difficult to bring to films about their own culture. I
mean, James Ivory, who's an American, makes great movies about
England. If I had to make a film about English suburbia, I'd
probably fail dismally.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as his actors are concerned, Mendes came to the right
place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam was incredibly well-organized _ and one of those people
who barely lets on that he is so well-organized,'' notes Bening.
``He was really prepared, did storyboards, really knew how he saw
the movie. We rehearsed for two weeks _ very much like a play _ sat
around a table with him and the writer, talked about shared
histories that we should all know about, got to know each other. He
had a way of bringing everybody together so that there was an
intimacy about everything, a feeling of safety and freedom. That
continued onto the set.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very familiar with Sam's work and anticipated reading
this script, because I knew he'd turned down a bunch of films over
the years,'' says Spacey, a Tony Award nominee for his recent
revival of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh.'' ``I knew that
the acting work and the story arc would probably go very, very well
with Sam. What I couldn't have been prepared for was what a visual
stylist he turned out to be _ without calling attention to himself,
which is a refreshing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though confident in his vision, the first-time feature director
wisely decided to rely on a real pro to put it on screen. So he
hired director of photography Conrad Hall, lenser of such legendary
'60s movies as ``In Cold Blood,'' ``Cool Hand Luke'' and ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' (for which he won an Oscar).
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the most experienced, most gifted cinematographer I
could find,'' Mendes says. ``And one of the things I loved about
Conrad was that he embraced my storyboards, loved the fact that I'd
lain the film out in my head. Then, he would come to the set, and
we'd often find a better shot. But it was important, as a
first-time director, to have some kind of blueprint as a starting
point.''
</P>
<P>
   While he left the formal, color-rich main compositions to Hall,
Mendes himself shot most of Ricky's handheld, vitally organic video
footage. ``What it needed was an amateur operator; it needed a kind
of wobbly, kinetic energy,'' Mendes says. ``Of course, Conrad lit
it all, so it looked very good.''
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as ``Beauty's'' photographic qualities are, the
film's themes and tone are likely to generate much more discussion.
While many are hailing it as the most insightful American movie of
the year, others are complaining that Mendes is a little too
objective, that his film takes easy shots at middle-class
materialism and condescends to its characters.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Mendes disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I wanted to push the envelope comically at the
beginning, so I could reveal that underneath that were genuine,
vulnerable, sympathetic characters,'' he says. ``However, a lot of
the easy laughs ended up on the cutting-room floor. It's very easy
to take potshots at suburban angst, and it's not new. I didn't want
it to be a satire; after all, if you're going to make a satire,
this is the easiest subject to do it on, and by extension the least
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that climactic moment when Lester's lust for Angela
discomfortingly approaches consummation. Although hardly
``Lolita,'' it places the movie within batting distance of the same
ballpark _ and the last remake of Nabokov's classic sat on a shelf
for years out of fear that its man-girl sex theme would trigger
protests or even charges of kiddie porn (neither happened when the
film finally opened last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you go into it with utter seriousness, the revelation
has no impact,'' Mendes says. ``But I wanted that tension all the
way through. I want people to ask themselves, `Is this right, or is
it wrong?' And if the answer is it's wrong, that's fine. I'm not in
it to make moral judgments _ but at the same time, it's pretty dark
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this incredibly courageous story that pulls no punches,
doesn't ask anybody to like it, is politically incorrect and has
characters who make wrong choices and right choices,'' Spacey adds.
``But you can't pull scenes out of context. You can't say, `Oh,
here's a ``Lolita''-like scene.' It's not _ I reject it. What those
two characters teach each other is more beautiful and more
interesting than taking that out and waving it around like it's
some hot-button issue. It's unfair to the film; you keep it in
context, and everybody who sees the film will understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a defense is even necessary in a year when that
other movie with ``American'' in its title came out (along with a
raft of other outrageously vulgar comedies) remains to be seen.
After all, the explicit details of the Clinton impeachment
proceedings have probably inured Americans to sexual material that,
not too long ago, may have made them queasy.
</P>
<P>
   For that and other reasons, Mendes feels that ``American
Beauty'' is the right film for the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was written and made by people who live in 1999,'' he
asserts. ``So many of our current concerns are dealt with in the
movie, whether they be the possession of guns, what goes on in the
garage right next to you that you don't know about, or the
incredible sexual maturity of young people right now _ `American
Pie' being the classic example of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things are in the air. And whilst one never thought
about President Clinton while making the movie, it's clearly a
product of the era. Filmmaking _ storytelling _ deals with the
issues of the world you're living in and telling stories back to
the people who also live in that world. There is a debate, and if
this movie becomes the subject of argument and intense discussion,
nothing could please me more.''
</P>
<P>
   If self-proclaimed late-'90s guy Mendes sounds an awful lot like
an artist from the early 1970s there, that's because he is
something of a throwback. Just as his stark, simply staged live
productions run counter to the overproduced effects extravaganzas
that have dominated Broadway and London for much of the decade, his
movie boasts a calm, controlled form that is the polar opposite of
flashy, attention-span-deficient, MTV-inspired movies these days.
</P>
<P>
   The better to tell his story, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing the theater teaches you is how to hold an audience's
attention for two hours without recourse to close-ups,'' he
explains. ``So when you get to the movies, you're used to the
rhythm of storytelling over two hours. You're not a commercial
director, you're not a director of rock videos; you direct two-hour
slabs of time, and you have to hold the audience's attention. If
you do not, you have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about trying to find a way, if you can, to get
audiences to use their imaginations,'' he adds. ``To not spell
everything out, dot every i and cross all the t's. You have to be
careful not to be rigid about this, though; `The Lion King' (stage
production) is heavily designed, but what a wonderful work of
imagination that is. I think the death of theater is something like
`Beauty and the Beast,' where they just wear the costumes, and
you'd rather see the cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of his stage accomplishments, Mendes admits that films
are what he's always wanted to make. And now that he's directed his
first feature, he's more convinced of that than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater works within a tradition of revival and reassessment
of classics,'' Mendes explains. ``I think this is more personal, to
me, than anything I've done on stage, because filmmaking is more
authorial. Which is not to say that Alan's script wasn't always
fantastic, and he was there on the set the whole time. But you
rewrite it in the cutting room, you rewrite it on the mixing stage,
and you rewrite it again. You are constantly refining it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Some elderly residents don't get Floyd fuss
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ruth Bernhard and Phil Dreiss cooked
their lamb chop dinner early Tuesday, in case the power failed,
then sat on a bench in Century Village in the afternoon to enjoy
the stiff Hurricane Floyd breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel safe and secure,'' said Bernhard, 66, who skipped the
plywood and any thought of evacuation. ``They're built like
fortresses,'' she said of the 7,854 condominiums on Haverhill Road
in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon progressed, Bernhard's relaxed attitude seemed
less cavalier. The category four hurricane, expected to pack winds
of up to 100 mph in Palm Beach County, swayed seaward.
</P>
<P>
   As the pre-storm waiting began Tuesday, calm prevailed in two
other large retirement communities: Century Village West in Boca
Raton and King's Point in Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the television, they excite people,'' said Ben
Grill, 79, a nine-year Century Village West resident. ``They look
for the worst.'' Grill drove his Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight around the
neighborhood to see what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's sunny out,'' he said, pointing to the 10 a.m. sky.
``It's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks down the street, Irene Rosen, 75, recycled her
newspapers. She wasn't concerned about the storm. ``What can I do,
take the car and run away?'' She listened to the news and bought
more to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Lampert, 83, put safety first. He was one of the few
Century Village West residents to nail plywood over his windows.
``Nobody else wants to do it,'' he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Lampert keeps the boards neatly stored and labeled with notes
like ``living room-left,'' so he knows which piece goes where.
</P>
<P>
   While Lampert and his wife, Esther, were content to sit at home
and weather the storm, about 30 of their neighbors were unhappy to
return early from a Miami Beach hotel where they planned to
celebrate the Jewish holidays with about 500 fellow guests.
</P>
<P>
   The group from the conservative Temple Beth Shalom at Century
Village West had to leave the Saxony Hotel about 10 p.m. Monday
under evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such bedlam!'' said Muriel Golovensky, who joined the
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held court on these holidays years ago,'' Golovensky said of
the dinners she threw as a rabbi's wife in New York. ``Now I'm
reduced to this. It makes me blue.''
</P>
<P>
   If fair weather returns, Golovensky hopes to return to Miami
Beach in time for Yom Kippur Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Melita Blumenfeld, a King's Point resident in Delray Beach, kept
her holiday challah in the refrigerator, next to the canned goods
she got from the Meals on Wheels program.
</P>
<P>
   The television blared warnings in her living room. She was
cautious but confident.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenfeld had plenty of food and water and a chair with a
pillow in her walk-in closet in case she had to sit there.
</P>
<P>
   As she waited for the storm she revealed that Tuesday _ a day
full of worry and preparation _ was her 87th birthday. She looked
out the window at the cloudy sky and mused on the coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say God is talking to us, but we don't know his
language,'' she said.

AFTERNOON TV SHOW IS BY WOMEN, FOR WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Now, something new and different for Southern
California,'' the male announcer intoned before the Monday launch
of KCBS' new 4 p.m. ``women's news'' show, ``Women 2 Women.'' But
rather than something unique, the TV show is actually part of a
larger trend of broadcasters trying to find ways to ``narrowcast''
to specific audiences, especially by combining news with an
entertainment talk-show format to make it more palatable to the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   On the network level, we've seen ABC's ``The View'' and NBC's
``Later Today'' (a women-targeted extension of ``Today'') crop up
lately. On the local level, stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco
and other markets around the country have been adding shows or
segments within existing newscasts that target women with more
personality pieces and features on subjects from fashion to women's
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women'' is anchored by Ann Martin, Catherine Anaya, Pamela
Wright and former KNBC news anchor Kelly Lange, with the four women
conducting much of the show from a talk show-like set, without a
desk in front of them. The subject matter on Monday's show fell
decidedly on the softer side of the spectrum. Barbara Chacon,
program director for KCBS, said they wanted to keep the launch
simple, to focus on establishing the hosts' personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show what they're about and develop the chemistry
a bit,'' said Chacon, admitting, ``It will take a litle time. But I
think eventually, we will be the kind of show people are talking
about. We're really the only local talk show on the air now. Our
viewers told us they want that, and it's very exciting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chacon, who used to produce the local morning show ``A.M. Los
Angeles,'' said though many women obviously are busy with work and
family activities at 4 p.m., ``there really is a high concentration
of women viewers watching at that time, and the L.A. market is a
little different than many. ... There are people at home at all
hours.'' Chacon also said KCBS is specifically targeting new
viewers who are a ``little hipper, a little younger'' than the
current average viewer for KCBS and CBS, which is known for being
the oldest-skewing of the major networks.
</P>
<P>
   KCBS' research indicates that 64 percent of the total news
audience at 4 p.m. is female. Those women weren't demonstrating
loyalty to any one newscast, but were valuable viewers because they
make many household decisions on entertainment, major purchases and
the like. Therefore, it made sense to create a localized program
for women that could highlight such things as shopping, restaurants
and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's segments included a gushy review of fashion from
Sunday's Emmy Awards and a ``behind the scenes'' look at ``The
Price Is Right'' _ not coincidentally, ``Women 2 Women'''s lead-in
on KCBS _ in which host Bob Barker revealed, ``We have the best
stagehands in the world.'' Another spot featured comedy
writer/novelist Gail Parent suggesting ways to ``be with your guy
forever, and never let him see you naked (tips included ``Wear
beach cover-ups'' and ``Never be naked and stand up at the same
time ... the missionary position is very flattering'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Women'' also managed to promote the CBS Evening News with Dan
Rather, whose move to 6:30 from 5:30 p.m. caused the reshuffle of
KCBS' late afternoon lineup. Rather was in town for the week in
part to promote this time slot change; the hosts' attempt to create
a ``female'' angle on Rather's appearance was tenuous. It basically
amounted to Rather crediting his mother, his grandmother, his
second-grade teacher and Barbara Walters with being helpful to him
in his life and his career. The hardest-hitting question the ladies
asked him was, ``How do you keep your hair looking so perfect?''
</P>
<P>
   Chacon admits the show is a work in progress, from its subject
matter to a few technical glitches. On Monday, microphones didn't
always work, a crew member walked in front of the cameras, both
guests and hosts had their awkward moments. But Chacon said the
hosts handled everything in stride, and promised there would be
more substantive pieces mixed with the fluff in the future.
Consumer advocate Mike Boguslawski will be a regular feature, and
there will be segments covering women's health and current issues
mixed in with pieces on hairstyles, restaurants and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Chacon also insisted that KCBS management is committed to
letting the show find an audience, and that the reshuffling of the
news schedule does not signify that Ann Martin is taking a smaller
role in news. Martin is still co-anchoring the half-hour newscasts
at 6 and 11 p.m. with Jonathan Elias, while Gretchen Carr, the
younger and slightly blonder former KCBS weekend anchor, fills the
seat next to Elias from 5 to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence that ``Women'' is still shaping its
identity, the hosts at the end of Monday's show asked viewers to
share what they think of the show, along with suggestions for show
topics. They encouraged viewers to write to KCBS or to log their
comments on KCBS' Web site,  &UR; www.channel2000.com &LR; .

PEEKING INSIDE OTHER PEOPLE'S DREAM HOUSES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Modern life is long, modern art is short. That's why
art keeps getting better all the time. If you don't like it now,
just stick around for a while. Eventually, something likable is
bound to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pleasure to report, for example, that the Museum of
Modern Art's architecture and design department is back on track
after several lackluster seasons. ``The Un-Private House,'' a
current show organized by the department's chief curator, Terence
Riley, has been a popular as well as a critical success, so crowded
at times that it's impossible to see the many fine works on view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different Roads,'' a show of concept cars organized by
Christopher Mount, an associate curator, is not brilliant, but it
has also been a crowd pleaser. Who doesn't like a car show?
</P>
<P>
   And who doesn't get a voyeuristic thrill from peeking into
private houses? That thrill is the subtext of ``The Un-Private
House,'' an exhibition of 26 recent residential designs (through
Oct. 5). The supertext is the erosion of the borders between public
and private realms, as seen from the homeowner's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Media walls, open floor plans, glass walls, Moebius strip
staircases, virtual chefs _ these are just a few of the devices
used to blur or dissolve the oppositional relationship between
public and private space. But the subtext _ the museum audience
gazing into places designed for private clients _ is what gives
this show its timely appeal.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what would a self-respecting media wall have been
showing us in recent years? A world convulsed by the performances
of public figures in private places: President Clinton in White
House corridors; Princess Diana backstage at the Ritz Hotel; John
F. Kennedy Jr. in a single-engine plane.
</P>
<P>
   A world in which people may think they know JonBenet Ramsey's
family better than the Ramseys know themselves _ better, for that
matter, than they know the people living beneath their own roofs.
</P>
<P>
   These convolutions, the endlessly televised discussions of them
and the global hand-wringing over threats to privacy posed by the
discussions have brought the show's theme to the table of mass
culture. They have also embodied that theme, by bringing public
discussion into the private living room. The show gives us an
avant-garde rendering of issues that have already passed into
popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The installation sets forth these issues with muted Pop Art
flair. Drawings, photographs and wall texts are framed by strips of
floral powder-room wallpaper. Tables, chairs, a bed.
</P>
<P>
   At the psychic center of the show is a conversation group of
furniture, with a shelf unit containing books and periodicals. The
arrangement is meant to evoke a private living room, but in fact it
more nearly resembles a waiting room, crowded by individuals who do
not converse, who have extra time on their hands and loads of
glossy magazines to help them pass it.
</P>
<P>
   With this interactive display as its focal point, the rest of
the show begins to look like a series of bubbles over people's
heads as they leaf through the pages of decorating magazines,
fantasizing about what it would be like to live in such-and-such a
showplace. And this image of collective solipsism _ of people
losing themselves in other people's dream houses _ becomes a useful
way to think about architecture today.
</P>
<P>
   If the show were a story, the headline might read, ``Housing
Starts on the Rise in Ritalin Nation.'' ``The Un-Private House'' is
a good illustration of what Richard J. DeGrandpre, the author of
``Ritalin Nation,'' calls rapid-fire culture, a civilization hooked
on constant sensory stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the photographs, models and drawings, there are
video monitors displaying computer animations. Spacy musical
soundtracks twiddle away, their overlapping sonorities competing
for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the waiting room is a large round table, seating
eight, with a Lazy Susan in the middle. The Lazy Susan holds
plastic disks, one for each of the houses in the show. You take a
disk, place it on a round spot on the table, and up pops a menu for
an interactive tour.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the architects, comments by the curator and
montages connecting pictures of the houses with highlighted
sections of their plans are projected from beneath the table onto
its translucent white surface.
</P>
<P>
   All this has been designed to provide more information than is
usually found in architecture shows, but the effect is rather the
opposite. The works on view become a kind of disturbance, a
distraction from the rapid-fire environment in which they are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean this as a criticism. Rather, the presentation
reveals the extent to which architecture has accommodated itself to
a distracted way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 projects in the show span a broad esthetic spectrum but
are clustered around two extremes: Hot and Not. Not houses
(Francois de Menil, Hanrahan &AMP; Meyers, Steven Holl) descend from
the tradition of Arts and Crafts. They emphasize comfort,
unpretentiousness and serenity, and often evoke the refined
vernacular of the Japanese house.
</P>
<P>
   Hot houses (Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, Hariri &AMP; Hariri, Neil M. Denari,
Diller &AMP; Scofidio, Rem Koolhaas) are the descendants of Italian
Futurism. Startlingly unconventional, they make furious display of
new materials, new technologies, new ways of organizing space.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us would probably prefer to live in the Not houses. But
what are they doing in this show? It's telling that such a question
should arise. Modern audiences, at least, would rather have the
sensory stimulation of the Hot than the familiar comforts of the
Not.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering shocks of the new has been central to the Modern's
mission since its inception. Shows like ``The International Style''
(1932) and ``The New Italian Landscape'' (1972) are landmarks in
the history of rapid-fire culture. The museum would be failing at
its job if it didn't transmit the innovative spirit of the
Futurists, the de Stijl group, the Bauhaus, the Constructivists and
other nerve centers of the Modern Movement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, Alfred H. Barr Jr. famously compared the Modern's
collection to ``a torpedo moving through time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Different Roads,'' a show of recent and prototype cars, isn't
strong enough to stand on its own, but as a complement to ``The
Un-Private House'' it is very useful (through Tuesday). It may
strike you, for example, that the cars look far more substantial
than the houses. This is partly because the houses are represented
by models and photographs, while the cars appear as themselves _ in
person, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different Roads'' also presents at rest objects that are
designed to move. As displayed in the Modern's sculpture garden,
the cars could pass for metallic pavilions.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors make the cars look uncommonly down-to-earth.
Though varied in concept, size and styling, they are all molded
around common elements: wheels, doors, windows, seating, engine,
instruments, safety features, head and tail lamps, aerodynamics,
ergonomics and scale. Americans are primed to see the car as a
spiritual home, the house as an extension of the garage.
</P>
<P>
   In a society economically rooted in the consumption of gas and
in the cars that burn it, the house is a waiting room where people
get to rest up between rides. In a twist on ``The Un-Private
House,'' ``Different Roads'' offers a look at the vehicle for
injecting the private sphere into public space. The car phone,
coffee holder, CD player and seats add up to a living room on
wheels. It is the fulfillment of the Futurists' dream.
</P>
<P>
   In the Modern's garden, you see people pressing their noses
against the windows. This is partly just to check out the interior,
but it is also because the appeal of driving resides mainly in
being on the inside looking out: watching the world go by, passing
other cars, choosing routes, speeds and music. It is about
controlling the world of objective reality from within a subjective
frame.
</P>
<P>
   As DeGrandpre argues, Ritalin's function is to alter
consciousness _ to modify subjective space. It brings perception
into closer alignment with the objective reality of cultural
acceleration. It is a short step, in other words, from the
DaimlerChrysler Concept Vehicle to the ingestion of a Ritalin
capsule. One capsule is driven, the other is swallowed. But both
have the effect of speeding up consciousness so that people can
remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Un-Private House'' is so full of arresting visual images
that the show's social content is easily undervalued. Why these
rich people's dwellings? Why isn't the Modern leading the way with
prototypes for affordable housing? In fact, this is one of the most
socially informed architecture shows the museum has ever presented.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that there is a range of possible responses to
rapid-fire culture, from Hot to Not. That range, more than any
individual work, displays the pivotal role architecture plays in
modulating the social, intellectual and psychological forces of
contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   And the implications of this lesson extend far beyond the design
of suburban houses. For if you turn the show's theme inside out,
you arrive at the Un-Public City. You reach the metropolis in which
many of us now dwell _ with its privatized services, its business
improvement districts, mall-like festival marketplaces and
public-private partnerships in major real estate developments.
</P>
<P>
   But where is the architecture that responds with creative verve
to the accelerating urban condition? That is the question to which
``The Un-Private House'' indirectly leads us. Thus far, what we've
seen mostly are Not solutions. Retro theme parks like Battery Park
City. Cheap cast-concrete versions of prewar stonework.
Bishop's-crook lampposts, fearful interpretations of context,
oom-pah-pah celebrations of formerly faded landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   This slow-down mentality only masks the changes overtaking older
urban centers. Like a gated suburban community, it keeps the
reality of acceleration at bay. Masks can be witty, even profound.
Wearing them is a perfectly reasonable option for people in a
modern democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the city isn't offering other options. Where
are the office buildings, apartment towers, theaters and airport
terminals that explore the changing boundaries between public and
private space? Designs that deal with porosity, flexibility and
subjectivity in the public realm? These options are seldom seen, or
even contemplated. That's one reason modern life keeps getting
worse.

   NEW YORK _ ``I'm supposed to look like a disheveled, disgruntled
old geisha,'' Beverly Blossom said cheerfully, dressed in a long
golden kimono and top hat and sprawled in a convenient folding
chair in a midtown rehearsal studio.
</P>
<P>
   Next she swept across the floor in a bargain-basement black
satin Balenciaga cloak and thrift-shop gold dress, a toy monkey
drooping from her hand. Then, with the donning of another, slightly
shredded costume, she became both an aging beauty and a
bottom-patting old gigolo drawn together in a bittersweet tango.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who (italics)is(end italics) she?'' a visitor to the studio
whispered, eyes wide, as Ms. Blossom glided through the dizzying
array of characters she will portray in ``Dances in Shabby Black,''
a retrospective program on Friday and Saturday at the Context
Studio, a small black-box theater on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   A dancer with Alwin Nikolais, Ms. Blossom went on to train with
Mary Wigman. But the greatest creative spur was Nikolais' delight
in his performers' individual visions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blossom began to choreograph in the 1950s and then joined
the actor Roberts Blossom, her husband at the time, in the theater,
dance and film experiments that thrived in the East Village in the
yeasty 1960s. Creating pieces for her dance students at the
University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, she rediscovered the
attraction of solo performing.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York City since 1990, Ms. Blossom has become an
underground favorite who is known for performances and pieces, set
typically to gooey popular and classical music, that are
simultaneously tragic and hilarious and that evoke surprisingly
complex emotions. ``I always liked the Cubist term
`multidimensional simultaneity,''' she said. ``The duality just
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Her solos are often inspired by odd confluences of random
events. The 1996 ``Dead Monkey'' grew in her mind after she saw a
video on the mistreatment of laboratory monkeys and learned that
she would have to have her hip replaced.
</P>
<P>
   At 73, Ms. Blossom is a large woman with a beautifully ravaged
face. She does not attempt to disguise either attribute, preferring
to make them a comfortable part of her dances through the use of
voluminous cloaks and bright-red hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have to tell the hairdresser that I (italics)want(end
italics) to look like Bozo the Clown,'' Ms. Blossom said.
</P>
<P>
   She often creates her dances sitting at one end of a room and
``watching myself perform.'' Sometimes she dresses a thick wooden
post in a costume and positions it where the stage might be. ``I
used to think that was pretty crazy. I didn't tell anyone.'' But
then she read that Isadora Duncan would rent an auditorium, hire a
pianist and sit out in the audience to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now that she was choreographing in her mind's eye. What
is a dance, anyway? It comes from your mind. And there's nothing
like a good idea. Nothing can come up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, Ms. Blossom is allowing other
dancers to perform some of her solos. She has taken a chance on
Cynthia Pipkin-Doyle, Ella Magruder and Betsy Fisher, all of whom
will perform with her at Context.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point to it is that I'm trying to sell my choreography,''
Ms. Blossom said with a quizzical grin. ``What is a dance worth?
$1.99? Get them while the price is right.'' She also coaches
choreographers and performers on her Web site
(http://www/beverlyblossom.com).
</P>
<P>
   The best homes for the solos are with dancers who are ``old
enough, and sophisticated,'' she said. Her signature ``Dad's
Ties,'' for instance, ``must be done by someone who has memories.''
</P>
<P>
   What are the special skills required for solo dancing in
general?
</P>
<P>
   ``Personality,'' Ms. Blossom said, alluding to a comment the
ballerina Natalia Makarova made about great dancers. ``You can't be
a blank-minded ingenue. There must be a dance persona that is rich,
that has layers of interest. A soloist has to have a `voice,' the
way a singer does. And it has to do with _ not exactly beauty, but
something that consumes the whole space. A good soloist has to know
the tricks of the trade, too. How loud to sing.''

AN OFT-TOLD TALE? NOT BY HIS LIGHTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Even though the director Peter Kassovitz wore a yellow
star as a child in wartime Budapest, Hungary, and his parents were
Nazi concentration camp survivors, he does not remember growing up
in the shadow of the genocide of European Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he was not looking for a way to address the Holocaust
on screen when he came across Jurek Becker's 1969 novel, ``Jakob
the Liar,'' which tells of a Jewish cafe owner who uses lies to
bring hope to a Polish wartime ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know directors,'' he said with a smile, recalling his
discovery of the book at his mother's home in Budapest in 1990,
``they are always flicking through books looking for a good subject
for a film.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the novel had already been widely translated from
German (Plume Books is reissuing it in English this month). It had
even been turned into a small German film in 1974. But the
61-year-old director, who fled to France after the 1956 Hungarian
uprising, wanted to retell it anyway, and he persuaded Becker to
sell the rights for a new English-language version. Kassovitz's
``Jakob the Liar'' finally opens in New York on Friday, with Robin
Williams in the role of the reluctant hero, Jakob Heym.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the nine years between Kassovitz's discovery of
the book and his movie's release, other Holocaust-related feature
films have reached the screen. He was still circulating the
screenplay that he co-wrote with the French novelist Didier Decoin
when Steven Spielberg's ``Schindler's List'' was released in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And while he finished shooting ``Jakob the Liar'' before Roberto
Benigni had completed ``Life Is Beautiful,'' the Benigni film came
out sooner. Another Holocaust-related movie, Radu Mihaileanu's
``Train of Life,'' which also treats the subject with humor, was
released in Europe last year; it is set to open in New York on Nov.
5.
</P>
<P>
   But Kassovitz, a soft-spoken and good-natured man, seems
unfazed. He believes ``Jakob the Liar'' is different.
</P>
<P>
   Set in an unidentified Polish ghetto under German occupation, it
opens with Jakob ordered to present himself before a Gestapo
officer and, while waiting, hearing a radio report suggesting that
Russian forces have German troops on the defensive. Instructed to
return to the ghetto, he finds its gates closed and, while looking
for a way back in, he bumps into Lina Kronstein, a 10-year-old girl
(Hannah Taylor Gordon) who has escaped a train carrying Jews to a
death camp. The pair slip back into the ghetto, and Jakob hides the
child in his attic.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Russian offensive, though, cheers him. And when a
hot-headed young friend, Mischa (Liev Schreiber), plans a reckless
escape, Jakob urges patience and tells of hearing a radio report
that liberation is near. Soon the entire ghetto believes that Jakob
has a radio hidden in his house. Terrified, Jakob denies it,
knowing that he will be executed if word reaches the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurter (Alan Arkin), an aging actor, tells him to destroy
it. Kowalsky (Bob Balaban), the suicidal local barber, keeps asking
for more news. Everyone starts treating Jakob with new respect.
</P>
<P>
   Only Dr. Kirschbaum (Armin Mueller-Stahl) realizes that Jakob
has no radio _ but, he points out, there have been no suicides in
the ghetto since Jakob first brought good news. The message is
clear: Jakob has a duty to keep hope alive in the desperate and
starving community, so he should invent news.
</P>
<P>
   With little Lina ailing, he even promises she can hear the radio
if she recovers: he then imitates the voice of Winston Churchill
from behind a screen. Eventually, of course, the Germans hear about
Jakob's radio, but hope somehow wins out.
</P>
<P>
   Kassovitz, whose career to date has focused on television films,
said that above all he wanted to make the movie as realistic as
possible. While interiors and some exteriors were shot in Hungary,
a ghetto was re-created in the Polish town of Piotrkow, which had a
small Jewish ghetto during the war and is near Lodz, which had a
much larger ghetto where Becker himself spent much of the war.
(Becker died in late 1997, just as filming of ``Jakob the Liar''
was about to start.) Much effort also went into making the ghetto
and costumes look authentic. The only concession was that the
Polish Jews were speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film should have been made in Yiddish,'' Kassovitz said,
sipping water on the terrace of his apartment in eastern Paris,
``but it is better to do it in English than French. First, you have
more money. But that wasn't the reason. We're more used to hearing
English spoken with a Yiddish accent than French. I think it works
better.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As important, in Kassovitz's view, is the Jewish humor in his
film, humor that stems occasionally from absurd situations but is
more often expressed darkly by the residents of the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had in mind much more humor,'' he said. ``You know the
saying, you can laugh at anything, but not with everybody. The film
became more dramatic and emotional because of the cast. They
brought their own feelings. The way the lines are said, the way
they act, they had more respect for the subject than I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams said that Kassovitz kept telling him to ``forget
your gentile guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as an American, you get kind of uncomfortable that humor
in this situation would be taken as disrespectful,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Berlin, where he had just attended a
screening of the film. ``But there was a man on the set, a Jew and
a survivor who said, `You can't be afraid of the humor, it's how
you exist, it keeps your soul alive.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes part of the survival mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also the view of Mihaileanu, whose ``Train of Life''
tells of an Eastern European shtetl that decides to escape by
building its own deportation train, with some villagers dressed as
Nazi officers and the rest locked in wagons as deportees, an idea
as original as it is surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish humor has always been a shield against madness,'' said
the Romanian director, who was himself raised in a shtetl. ``Comedy
is tragedy's balm. We don't laugh (italics)at(end italics) a tragic
event. But we continue to laugh in order to persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   The special quality of Jewish humor was in fact one reason that
Kassovitz sent his screenplay to Williams: he thought the actor was
Jewish. But instead it was the screenplay itself that interested
Williams' wife, Marsha Garces Williams, who runs their Blue Wolf
Productions. And soon the couple were dining in Paris with
Kassovitz and his (more famous) director son, Mathieu (``Cafe au
Lait,'' ``Hate'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fairy tale,'' Kassovitz said with a laugh. ``Unknown
director sends script to big star and big star says, `Let's get
married.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, better, actually. Williams agreed to play Jakob, and Ms.
Williams agreed to produce the $15 million movie through Blue Wolf.
And, with Williams on board, it was easy to recruit other
well-known actors.
</P>
<P>
   Did Williams think he was gambling in joining forces with a
director whose work he had never seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew if he had written this script, he certainly had an
instinct,'' Williams said. ``Then after meeting him and Mathieu in
Paris, his sense of humor, the way he is. It was pretty much an
immediate thing. His being a Hungarian Jew, whose parents were
survivors, gave him a certain sensibility. And remember, three
years ago, no movie had been made that attempted to use humor in
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, after the success of ``Life Is Beautiful,''
``Jakob the Liar'' is not the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Williams said with undisguised exasperation. ``It's
like you can have 25 buddy movies or guys who are blowing each
other away, but another Jewish film, `Oh God, one a year is enough,
thank you.' PLEASE.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassovitz seems more worried about the Jewish reaction,
particularly that of Claude Lanzmann, the director of ``Shoah,''
the renowned Holocaust testimony film, who criticized both
``Schindler's List'' and ``Life Is Beautiful,'' arguing that the
Holocaust should not be treated as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Jakob the Liar'' was shown at this month's American Film
Festival in Deauville, France, however, Kassovitz felt more
reassured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking along the beach and I heard these two old Jewish
ladies talking about the film,'' he said. ``One said, `Oh, it was
so great, it was exactly like that, but how did they find the
place?' And the other said, `And the little girl, exactly like my
girl.' I think they did not feel betrayed.''

   MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. _ After days of worry and preparation, with
much of the state's eastern coast boarded up and deserted, people
here in Florida braced for the arrival Wednesday morning of massive
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the hurricane's outer bands began to buffet the
state's east-central barrier islands after dark, forecasters were
still unsure if the deadly eye of the Category 4 storm would make
landfall, perhaps around Cape Canaveral, or if the storm center
would only skirt the state before turning north to threaten Georgia
and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said that, as they had cautiously forecast, Floyd
seemed to be turning more to the north, good news for Florida. But
even if the storm's eye, with winds of around 150 mph, did not come
ashore, meteorologists predicted that hurricane-force winds would
still extend into the state, strong enough to blow roofs off
houses, fell walls and topple trees.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, President Clinton on Tuesday issued an
unusual pre-emptive declaration of disaster for the state, even
before the first palm tree had been pushed down.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, warned that the northward jaunt of the storm probably came
too late to spare the east-central coast from what is still a
dangerous storm. One meteorologist predicted a ``weed-eater
effect'' as winds churn up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd howled through the Bahamas Tuesday, knocking out power,
wrecking boats, knocking down trees and damaging houses, but damage
was not as bad as expected, according to e-mails from residents
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, more than 1 million people evacuated the east coast
on Monday and Tuesday, and as of Tuesday evening thousands were
still stranded in unmoving traffic on a variety of interstates and
toll roads. Interstate 4, Toll Road 528, U.S. 1 and other routes
were more like parking lots much of the day, as people fled inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get the hell out,'' said Stephen Collins, who lives on
Merritt Island, between Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach, as he
gassed up his car at a convenience store on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the store's manager, A.K. Patel, put up hurricane
shutters and prepared to leave. ``I've got two kids,'' he said.
``We're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   All along this stretch of coast, waves were already chewing into
the beaches and washing over sea walls, but as dark fell the worst
of the storm was still miles off shore.
</P>
<P>
   Most people were long gone, and towns up and down the beach were
quiet and boarded-up. A few people made last-minute runs to the few
open stores for essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rich is staying. After boarding up her own windows in
Melbourne, she made a trip to the store for provisions: a case of
Corona beer, a 12-pack of Pepsi and a carton of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how long we're going to be trapped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just highway traffic that snarled here. Floyd closed
most of the state's airports, leaving passengers stranded and
upsetting flight schedules around the country.

   In one sense, Hurricane Floyd has been a well-behaved storm.
Almost always, hurricanes deal out surprises that throw the experts
off. But in the course of its two-week life, this storm has
developed, grown into a monster, moved westward and then weakened
somewhat, almost precisely as meteorologists expected it to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is rare for a hurricane,'' said Fred Gadomski, a
meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   If the storm continues to go according to predicted form, it
will deal the coast of central Florida a powerful glancing blow
Wednesday and plow ashore with highly damaging sustained winds of
more than 140 miles per hour near Savannah, Ga., or in the
Carolinas Wednesday night. It will then churn northward through the
Middle Atlantic states on Friday, dropping prodigious amounts of
rain on a region that this year has endured one of its worst
droughts ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm has the potential to be a drought-buster,''
Gadomski said.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the winds should have slackened to a fraction of
what they were on Monday, when the hurricane flexed its muscles to
the maximum, rivaling, at least for a while, some of the most
powerful tropical cyclones on record.
</P>
<P>
   The storm owed its early muscle to almost perfect conditions for
the development of a hurricane. It was hatched as a garden-variety
cluster of thunderstorms in West Africa. It moved out into the
Atlantic on Sept. 2 (just as the more unpredictable Hurricane
Dennis was hemming, hawing, zigging, zagging and wandering for days
off the North Carolina coast).
</P>
<P>
   As trade winds carried the nascent hurricane westward, it picked
up energy from warm ocean water. The Atlantic has been warmer than
usual this year, and the extra heat imparted extra punch to the
growing storm.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing stood in the way of the increasingly more coherent
hurricane as it drew a bead on the northern and central Bahamas
over the weekend. It dodged Hispaniola, whose highlands interfere
with hurricanes passing over them.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions aloft were ideal. A dome of tranquil high-pressure
air sat over the ocean, blocking any strong wind streams that might
shear apart a developing hurricane. (In years when El Nino affects
the world's climate, strong winds from the west tend to suppress
hurricanes before they can get going. That is not the case this
year.)
</P>
<P>
   So as the week began, the storm stood on the cusp of blossoming
into one of the all-time most powerful hurricanes _ a Category 5 on
the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, with sustained
winds of 156 mph or higher. Only two hurricanes that strong have
made landfall in the United States: Hurricane Camille, which struck
the Gulf Coast in 1969, and an unnamed hurricane that blasted
Florida on Labor Day 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Tuesday, an even more powerful atmospheric force came into
play. A continental-scale mass of cool air advanced across the
eastern United States from the west. Along its leading edge, a
strong stream of high-level winds, 20,000 to 30,000 feet up,
blowing from the south and west, began to impinge on the hurricane,
distorting its shape. This interfered with the functioning of the
storm, inhibiting its ability to vent vertical winds from the top
of its chimneylike eye wall. The venting is essential to
maintaining a hurricane's strength.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, this hurricane remained a less powerful but still
extremely dangerous Category 4, and further fluctuations in
strength were anticipated. The approaching cold front and westerly
winds also put up an atmospheric barrier that turned the storm more
to the north. Otherwise, said Gadomski, it would have barreled
across South Florida just like Hurricane Andrew of 1992, the most
destructive hurricane ever to hit the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the course and development of the storm will continue to
fall in line with predictions remains to be seen. Now that
Hurricane Floyd has entered a meteorological realm where it must
interact with another powerful weather system, the situation could
get dicier.
</P>
<P>
   While it looked Tuesday as if Florida would be spared a direct
hit, the National Hurricane Center warned that ``only a small
deviation to the left would bring the eye to the coast.''
</P>
<P>
   History suggests that once the storm makes landfall, Gadomski
said, the jutting-out into the ocean of the Carolinas might tend to
push the hurricane a little eastward. Varying computer models have
produced varying versions of the hurricane's likely course after it
comes ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pretty likely scenario,'' Gadomski said, ``is no direct
hit on Florida, the center goes into the Carolinas and at that
point begins paralleling the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami forecast a more
inland route, taking the storm's center almost due north after
making landfall, past Columbia, S.C., through North Carolina into
central Pennsylvania. But other forecasts place the storm farther
east, about on a line for Nantucket, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer models show the center of the storm moving swiftly
northward through eastern North Carolina and Virginia, and
eventually up the Delaware and Hudson Valleys. The whole range of
predictions shows the center moving northward anywhere in a broad
swath ranging from western Pennsylvania to New England. New York is
about in the middle of the range, with the storm's effects _ heavy
rain and strong but much diminished winds _ expected to be felt to
some degree throughout most of the Northeast on Thursday and
Friday.

DOWNSIZING THE BROADWAY MUSICAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for BEAUTY-BEAST-THEATER)  
 (af)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dancing corkscrew will still be there, as will
the singing whisk and the graceful cheese grater. But there may be
slightly fewer spinning plates and spatulas when ``Beauty and the
Beast'' reopens on Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   And over at ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' which reopened Sept. 10,
there are fewer people waiting to be executed in the guillotine
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty and the Beast'' closed at the Palace Theater on Sept. 5
and is coming back in a slightly smaller version to the
Lunt-Fontanne Theater on Nov. 12; the cast will drop by seven,
including understudies and swings (who fill in for various roles).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' closed at the Minskoff on
May 30 and reopened at the Neil Simon after several weeks of
touring, having scaled back its cast by 12 and its orchestra by 4.
</P>
<P>
   Musicals are typically made more modest when they leave Broadway
for the road. But it is unusual for a show to close in New York and
then reopen there in reduced form, particularly at a time when the
industry has increased the top ticket price to $80 from $75.
</P>
<P>
   And, taken together, these two examples suggest a potentially
significant rethinking about how to produce shows for less when
musicals increasingly cost more.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and ``Beauty and the
Beast'' maintain that the changes are imperceptible and the shows
have improved considerably as a result of scaling them down. ``It
plays better in an intimate space,'' said Robert Longbottom, the
director of ``Pimpernel.'' ``This is a story about three people,
and you can touch them at the Neil Simon. It's substantially less
people onstage, but it doesn't feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scenery has also been simplified. What was
previously a full stage elevator that simulated a ship is now a
scissor lift. ``It's the low-tech version of it,'' Longbottom said.
``But it's absolutely as graceful and as magical.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the downsizing raises questions that some in the
theater industry will have to deal with if this practice gains in
popularity. Might not such reductions ultimately compromise
content? Won't other producers inevitably want to follow suit and
try to sustain a run by revamping shows, conceivably at the expense
of production values? What does this mean for theater audiences?
</P>
<P>
   ``Costs are just as important as quality,'' said Rocco
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the loss of jobs? The New York musicians union,
Local 802, is contesting the reduction in the number of musicians
in ``Pimpernel'' from 24 to 20, even though the union-set minimum
drops from one theater to another. ``The fact of diminishing the
production and selling it for the same dollars, there is something
wrong with that,'' said William Moriarty, president of the local.
</P>
<P>
   While union rules require the Neil Simon Theater to use four
fewer musicians than the Minskoff does, the union is arguing that
the streamlined ``Pimpernel'' is the same production and therefore
should maintain the same number of musicians. ``Our contract says
the orchestra is hired for the run of the show in New York City,''
Moriarty said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his union had a meeting scheduled later this week with
the grievance committee at the League of American Theaters and
Producers. ``This is a new set of circumstances so far as I'm
aware,'' Moriarty said. ``If it is the wave of the future, now is
the time to address this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Moriarty said he also planned to talk with the producers of
``Beauty and the Beast'' about making sure the orchestra for that
show retains the same musicians from one production to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Eisenberg, executive director of the Actors Equity
Association, the actors union, said he, too, was troubled by the
scaling down of musicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody with a long time on a show can be downsized out with
no kind of compensation for the commitment that they've made,'' he
said. ``There should be some recognition of seniority. Jobs are
hard to come by.'' As it is, he noted that union members work an
average of only 16 weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some producers are skeptical about whether downsizing can work.
Tom Viertel, a Broadway producer, said he tried it unsuccessfully
years ago with a show called ``Sills &AMP; Company,'' moving to a
smaller theater and reducing the cast to five from nine to save
money. ``Whether you can actually turn things around by tightening
up, I don't know,'' Viertel said. ``It didn't work for us. The
audience tightened up too.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the trend signals a healthy re-examination of how
Broadway plays are produced, an approach that would be best adopted
before a show opens rather than after it is up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this signals a kind of responsible reaction or need to have
these productions come in at figures that can actually be
economically feasible, I think that's terrific,'' said Margo Lion,
a Broadway producer. ``Hopefully, they'll be even better than they
were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schumacher and Peter Schneider of Walt Disney Theatrical
Productions played down the changes to ``Beauty and the Beast'' as
little more than the kind of polishing that is always done with a
show. In fact, they said, a song (``There's Been a Change in Me'')
was recently added, an unusual step four years into a show's run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out there saying simpler, smaller, cheaper,''
Schneider said. ``We're saying it's a move to the Lunt-Fontanne to
keep it running longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the people behind these productions seemed to bristle at
the suggestion that their shows had somehow diminished in quality
because they had decreased in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers had the option to end the run or to rethink it
in a smaller house,'' Longbottom said. ``And I think it has been
overdramatized what that rethinking means. We simply have moved to
a smaller home and in doing that, you sometimes have to throw out
furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Ward Land, who has been in ``Pimpernel'' since the
beginning, said the show had benefited from becoming more compact _
there had previously been people on stage who didn't do much _ but
that it was hard to see some of her colleagues go. ``I think for
the people who stayed, they were glad to have a job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Bernstein, president of the producers league, pointed out
that the reconfiguration of these productions has meant the
preservation of some jobs rather than the elimination of all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In what other industry is there this notion that there are no
efficiencies to be gained?'' he asked, adding: ``It isn't about the
number of people. It's about what tells the story the best and
that's what should govern, not some antiquated rule. And if you can
save money, great, because it will give the show longer life and
make it better for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a tradition of renovating long-running shows. In an
extreme example, the producer Cameron Mackintosh replaced almost
the entire cast of ``Les Miserables'' after deciding that the
production had grown stale.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of slimming down musicals is a new question for
Broadway. Where until just a few years ago the idea of closing,
reworking and reopening a show would have been financially
prohibitive for most producers, corporate deep pockets have now
made it possible to finance such transitions.
</P>
<P>
   But both producers in this case say they did not scale down
their productions mainly for financial reasons. They did it, they
say, because of real estate; their theaters had been promised to
other shows. ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' had to leave the Minskoff
because ``Saturday Night Fever'' was moving in. ``Beauty and the
Beast'' had to leave the Palace for Disney's ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, economics are part of it _ it's a commercial venture,''
Schumacher said. ``But at the end of the day, it's the quality of
the show that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hawkins, the executive producer of ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel,'' said moving was not a matter of choice or financial
necessity. The show was grossing a respectable average of just
below $500,000 a week before it closed, he said, and ``the move and
adjustments are happening because we're forced to move to a smaller
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, costs will be about 20 percent lower in the
smaller theater. The Neil Simon not only has fewer seats (1,300
compared to the Minskoff's 1,700), but its total dimensions are
about 60 percent that of the Minskoff, Hawkins said. He said
``Pimpernel'' had to scale down to adapt to that new tighter space.
</P>
<P>
   And while die-hard fans may notice that there is no longer a
crowd scene where there used to be one, Hawkins said: ``We believe
that the perception will be that nothing changed, that the show
delivers now maybe even moreso than than it did in the Minskoff.''
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the third incarnation of ``Pimpernel,'' a version
its creators refer to as Pimpernel 3.0. The first overhaul,
undertaken last year, was prompted by flagging ticket sales.
``Pimpernel'' had some loyal _ and wealthy _ fans in the
Cablevision Systems Corp., which acquired the musical in
partnership with the financier Theodore J. Forstmann, one of the
show's original producers.
</P>
<P>
   After a period of rehearsing the new show during the day while
performing the old version at night, ``Pimpernel'' reopened last
fall with substantial changes: new lines, discarded scenes and
moved songs.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from some new choreography, the current revised
``Pimpernel'' has changed in that the total cast has shrunk from 41
to 29. This reduction has meant more responsibility for each cast
member. ``An ensemble member may go from being a soldier in one
scene to a maid in another scene to someone at the royal ball in
the next scene,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether it was difficult to let some longtime cast members
go, Longbottom said: ``That's never easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Beauty and Beast'' has dropped from 39 to 32. And
the show's producers said the lighting, sound and sets have been
improved. For the big production number, ``Be Our Guest,'' in which
the kitchen comes to life in inviting Belle (Beauty) to dinner, the
producers said the changes would be minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some adjustments to the cutlery,'' Schumacher
said. ``But all your feature condiments containers are safe. They
haven't been affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether self-justifying or not, producers say such efforts will
ultimately make their productions measurably better, without making
them perceptibly different. ``It's like honey, I shrank the show,''
Longbottom said. ``But because of the house that it's in, it looks
just as big to me.''

SKI RESORTS LET DOGS LEAD THE WAY TO SNOWY ADVENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURANGO, Colo. _ Slipping quietly through snow-packed trails cut
by snowmobiles on the highest peaks of the San Juan Mountains,
bundled comfortably on a sled behind a pack of exuberant huskies,
the lure of dog sledding quickly becomes apparent:
</P>
<P>
   Gliding through fresh snow that glistens in the sun like a
glitter-covered white blanket; skipping the lift lines that come
with downhill skiing. None of the huffing and puffing through flat
and uphill spots as you do with cross-country skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing is the loud, banging rattle of a powerful engine
belching smoke from a snowmobile. Instead, you hear the yapping and
barking of dogs, obviously excited about a romp through the snow in
the fresh mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   Our trip with Silver Mountain Sled Dog Tours validated why dog
sledding has become so popular. Such businesses now operate out of
most major ski resort areas in the Western United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, ancillary activities at ski resorts have grown
immensely in the last 10 years, and dog sledding is among the most
popular,'' said Nancy Pfeiffer, a consultant for InterWest
Adventures, a public relations company in Salt Lake City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer do you go to Park City or Jackson Hole or Vail and
spend five out of six days skiing. There's snowmobiling, snowshoe
hikes, cross-country skiing, powder cat tours, sleigh rides,
hot-air ballooning and ice climbing. Nearly every ski resort has a
sled-dog operation nowadays,'' Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as you begin your trip, you feel the dogs' energy and
enthusiasm and get caught up in it _ that and the beauty of the
frozen glades and forests of what people in Colorado call simply
``the high country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can see diamonds in the snow up here,'' my daughter
observed, pointing out the sun glinting on the pure white expanse.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, she fell in love with ``Snowy,'' a pure Siberian husky
with beautiful eyes and an unusually sweet temperament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for dogs that are agile and athletic, smart and
trainable,'' said Gretchen Dubit, 32, who with her husband, Gregg,
operates Silver Mountain Sled Dog Tours out of Durango. The Dubits
got their first sled dog and began mushing about six years ago.
This will be the third season they have commercially worked the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dubits keep 21 sled dogs at the Durango Dog Ranch, their
40-acre spread near Purgatory Ski Resort. Most of their dogs are
not purebred; some were adopted from animal shelters. They may not
have the credentials to be sled dogs, but they have the heart.
</P>
<P>
   A sled dog's desire to work is the most important thing. Sled
dogs must know the commands to go, turn left, turn right and stop,
and they have to learn to work together. These working dogs also
are cuddly and sweet, an important characteristic for animals that
provide joy rides for strangers all winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We train them to be pets first, but when they are hooked up,
they know what it means and what they should do. They want to run,
they're ready to go. They are as sweet as can be out of the
harness, but so serious and intent on working in harness, they get
aggressive,'' said Gretchen Dubit, a high-school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Dubit, 35, a high-school teacher until about a year ago,
patiently talked my eager 12-year-old through a lesson in mushing.
He made sure she knew how to use the sled's two brakes and
emergency anchor before allowing her to take control.
</P>
<P>
   She learned to say, ``OK, let's go _ Gii!'' rather than
``mush,'' because the dogs respond to the particular and consistent
commands used in training them.
</P>
<P>
   For tourists, Silver Mountain uses small, classic curved ash
sleds with six to eight dogs, depending on the number of
passengers, who nestle up on sleeping bags with faux fur throws
wrapped around them or stand on the back like real mushers to drive
the sled.
</P>
<P>
   A sledding trip is a big adventure. The Dubits, and their
passengers, never know what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a sled tips over and dumps passengers in a heap in the
snow, but none of the dog lovers who book a tour seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   Silver Mountain Sled Dog Tours, Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Half-day trips with snack and hot drinks _ and hot dogs to feed
the dogs for a treat at the end _ cost $95 per person. Full-day
trips with lunch for you and the sled dogs are $155 per person.
Overnight expeditions to a cabin in the woods also can be arranged.
Trips begin with the start of the ski season.

HURRICANE FORCES MASSIVE EVACUATION OF SAVANNAH, COASTAL GEORGIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With HURRICANE-FLOYD and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ The evacuation of Savannah began at dawn
Tuesday, an endless motorized march of steaming engines and crying
children fleeing the winds that threatened this old city's historic
buildings and Spanish moss.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million people were on the move Tuesday away
from the Georgia coast, and most of those were in slow lines of
traffic leading away from Savannah and surrounding Chatham County,
where the evacuation became mandatory at noon. Forecasters said
there was a strong chance the eye of Hurricane Floyd could come
ashore within 20 miles of downtown on Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the weather was clear and hot Tuesday, county officials
decided not to delay the evacuation orders, figuring that it could
take as long as 28 hours to clear the county's 225,500 people.
Surrounded by rivers and inlets, the county is particularly
difficult to evacuate, and it has been 10 years _ since the
abortive strike of Hurricane Hugo _ that officials have even tried.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the main interstates and other arteries out of town
were packed from sunrise until well past nightfall, as residents
headed to fully booked hotels in central Georgia and relatives in
Atlanta. All lanes on Interstate 16, the main route away from the
coast, were made westbound for 90 miles, and on some sections,
walking was faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a good thing we're not in a hurry,'' said one woman
who called from her cell phone to a Savannah radio station Tuesday
afternoon. ``If Floyd were coming today, we'd be killing each other
out here.''
</P>
<P>
   County emergency management officials said the movement was
generally orderly, with a minimum of honking and fender benders.
But there were serious problems moving the poor, the elderly and
the sick, many of whom had no access to transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Those who needed rides were told to come to the Savannah Civic
Center downtown, where buses would take them to shelters farther
inland. But the county could not supply enough buses to move the
thousands of people who came, and there were shoving matches
whenever a bus showed up. Many people wound up waiting most of the
day for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was panic, pure and simple,'' said Bert Graitham, a retired
mechanic who uses a wheelchair and was unable to board any of the
school buses the county pressed into service Tuesday afternoon.
``People were pushing past old folks and kids and squeezing on
those buses like their lives depended on it. They told me a van
would be coming with a lift, but I sure haven't seen it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every business, restaurant and hotel in the region was
closed. Hospitals stayed open, but warned residents not to show up
without a serious emergency.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storms generally have not been hard on Georgia, which
is protected by its recessed coastline. The last hurricane that
came ashore here was David, which did substantial damage in 1979.
But emergency officials warned that Floyd had far more destructive
potential. If it did make landfall near Savannah, said Gary
McConnell, Georgia's emergency management director, it would be
``the most dangerous storm ever to hit Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The well-publicized warnings persuaded most people to leave the
area, and county officials said they were pleased with a 60 percent
compliance rate by 6 p.m., a rate expected to be higher by
Wednesday morning. Holdouts were particularly few in the low-lying
coastal islands southeast of the city. By 2 p.m., almost everyone
had left Tybee and Talahi Islands, which could well be engulfed by
storm surges on Wednesday or Thursday; even the Tybee Optimists
Club was boarded up. It had been so long since there was a serious
threat, however, that a few residents could barely bring themselves
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll leave in a few hours, once the traffic dies
down,'' said John Wylly III, who grew up on Tybee Island and was
mowing his lawn in the warm afternoon breeze. ``We once found some
letters from 100 years ago by a guy who said the flooding from a
hurricane was so bad they had to swim from house to house. I guess
that's what we're looking at now, so we're all getting out of
here.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Wylly's father, an antique car collector,
drove up in a Model T Ford and laughingly said he wanted to take a
last look at the beaches. He said he would reluctantly have to
change cars before leaving, as the old Ford refused to go faster
than 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that only a few people had refused to
comply with the orders in Savannah, where some of the moody old
homes along Victory Drive were boarded up; most were dark and
abandoned. Since many of the homes are huddled around downtown
squares, some residents felt the buildings would be sheltered.
Still, there was concern that winds, debris and heavy rains could
damage the old structures.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many residents said they were afraid their homes would be looted
once they left, but there were scores of police cars cruising the
side streets, and unmarked cars were posted at main intersections
leading to prosperous neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Donnelly, an auctioneer who owns an antique shop, said one
of his employees insisted on staying behind to protect the
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a shotgun and a Bowie knife, and I don't think even a
hurricane can knock him down,'' Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing sentiment seemed to be captured by a farewell
message spraypainted on a boarded-up window of Roberts Furniture
Co. downtown: ``This town's only big enough for one Floyd.''

   DARWIN, Australia _ Haunted and huddling, more than 1,500 East
Timorese refugees arrived here on Tuesday on military evacuation
planes after the United Nations abandoned its compound to the
militias who had laid siege to it after East Timor voted for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks the refugees, many of them women and infants,
cowered behind the walls of the compound as the militias fired
shots over the courtyard and attacked anybody who dared to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions were not tenable,'' said Ian Martin, the head of
the mission, who left with refugees on the first flight Tuesday
morning. ``It's crucial there is an international force as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Mission to East Timor left a skeleton staff of 15
people in the territory's capital city, Dili. But they moved from
the compound to more secure quarters at the Australian Consulate.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia let the refugees be
evacuated from the compound, along with 45 U.N. staff members.
Officials here said the convoy of refugees was protected by
Indonesian soldiers on the way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports from Dili said that hours after the last refugee
had left, a pillar of smoke could be seen rising from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply is further proof that the militias are still active
in East Timor and are destroying every last remaining building,''
said David Wimhurst, a spokesman for the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the arriving refugees were closely guarded by the
Australian police and military officials after they landed.
Reporters were kept far away from the East Timorese as they were
put on buses and driven to an encampment of olive-drab tents near
the airport of this dusty outpost on Australia's northern coast,
less than 400 miles from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Buses could be seen carrying elderly men and young mothers to
the tents. Many of the women were holding babies on their laps.
</P>
<P>
   In the generally bleak atmosphere, there was a bright note. A
woman went into labor as the plane landed and was taken to a
hospital to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn joined an 8-day-old boy who was born in the compound
on the day of a particularly fierce militia assault. The boy's
parents named him Pedro Unamet Rodrigues, his middle name a nod to
the acronym for the U.N. Mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Even as this last group of refugees made its way to safety,
fears were growing for the more than 100,000 East Timorese who had
fled or had been forcibly removed to neighboring West Timor in the
last week. The United Nations said there were unconfirmed reports
of militias attacking pro-independence refugees in camps in two
West Timorese cities, Kupang and Atambua.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to several camps in Kupang on Sunday suggested that the
settlements are largely under the grip of the militias.
</P>
<P>
   While refugees were landing at Darwin's airport, the city's port
was alive with activity as warships from Australia, New Zealand and
the United States bobbed in the harbor or took on supplies at the
wharf.
</P>
<P>
   An officer of the Navy cruiser Mobile Bay declined to comment on
whether his ship was headed to East Timor. He said it was here on
training exercises with the Australian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the U.N. talks, Darwin is a city in a
high state of readiness. Witnesses watched trucks and other heavy
vehicles being loaded onto an Australian transport ship Tuesday
morning. And hundreds of Australian and foreign journalists have
descended on this city of 85,000, frantically trying to book
passage on a military ship or plane to East Timor.

   EX-POWs ARE SUING 5 COMPANIES IN JAPAN  
 (bl)  
 By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of former U.S. prisoners of war from World War II have
filed a class-action suit against five major Japanese corporations
contending that the prisoners were beaten and forced to work in
Japanese factories, mines and shipyards after they had been
captured on the battlefield, their lawyers announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, in U.S. District Court in Albuquerque, N.M., lists 11
plaintiffs. About 500 others have agreed to be part of the suit,
said a lawyer for the former prisoners, Eli Warach.
</P>
<P>
   The former POWs said in the suit that they were beaten, starved
and denied medical attention and that they continued to suffer
physical and mental problems, particularly recurring nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Warach said that although the legal team had pursued five
companies _ Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi International
Corp., Mitsui &AMP; Co., Nippon Steel and Showa Denko KK _ many other
Japanese companies used prisoners of war to work in their
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to fire a rifle instead of a shotgun,'' Warach said.
</P>
<P>
   He said recently declassified documents had made it easier to
corroborate some allegations about torture and other abuses. Some
plaintiffs said they had waited to come forward because after they
had been released U.S. intelligence officials made them sign
documents that forbade them to discuss how the Japanese had treated
them.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Nippon Steel, Robert Sacks, said that the company
took the charges seriously, but that he could not comment on the
specifics because he had not seen the suit. Sacks said many of the
charges had been dismissed in similar suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of issues you're dealing with,'' he said.
``It raises several substantial and complex international and
constitutional issues.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mitsui, Jessica Barist, said she could not
comment because Mitsui had not seen the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the war, scores of suits have been filed about
prisoner abuse. Japanese laws and the San Francisco Peace Treaty,
under which Japan agreed to pay some reparation to war victims, has
seemed to make it almost impossible to win a case in which the
Japanese government was a defendant. The new case focuses only on
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   A similar suit has been filed in Japan against Japanese
corporations by 50 Chinese who contend that they suffered harsh
treatment in the Japanese occupation. People who have followed that
case said their chances were slim.
</P>
<P>
   Seven plaintiffs in the new case, all in their late 70s and
early 80s, gathered Tuesday at a news conference in New York.
Wearing medals, they recounted horrors that they said they faced in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Silver, who was 20 when he joined the Army in March 1941
and who now lives in Massapequa, N.Y., said he was captured in 1942
in the Philippines and was taken to various Japanese camps. He said
he spent more than 40 months in captivity, performing hard labor
and eating tainted food. By the end of his incarceration, he had
lost 50 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The former prisoners, many decorated veterans, drew a
distinction between requiring prisoners to work under humane
conditions, which they termed forced labor, and their treatment,
which they termed slave labor.

IN NEW ANTI-SMOG TACTIC, NEW YORK TO SUE POWER PLANTS IN OTHER
STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Va., Ohio, Ind., Va., Ky., N.Y. )   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state, opening a new legal front in its
fight against pollution drifting from coal-burning power plants in
upwind states, announced Tuesday that it would file suit against 17
power plants to force them to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   This action would be the first by a state directly against
individual companies owning power plants that send pollution in the
air across state lines, according to federal environmental
officials and other experts. The Northeastern states and the
federal government have long battled to force these older plants,
mainly in the Midwest and the Virginias, to reduce their emissions,
but those efforts have faced a series of recent setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In letters sent Tuesday to the companies that own the plants,
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York state gave notice that
he intends to sue them for failing to upgrade equipment that cleans
smokestack emissions when they made other big investments in the
plants. This is a requirement under the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, older plants were granted exemptions to the
stricter pollution standards required for newer ones, on the theory
that they would shut down in a few years anyway. But the clean air
law always contained provisions requiring power companies to seek a
permit and install better pollution controls if they substantially
upgraded these aging plants.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Spitzer said he could prove that significant
improvements had been made to equipment at the plants that
increased their lifespan and their output of both electricity and
pollution, but no permits were sought and no new pollution controls
added. The plants are located in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana,
Virginia and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   They include some of the biggest single sources of air pollution
in the country, with one plant, in Gavin, Ohio, emitting more
smog-causing nitrogen oxides than all of the dozen or so
coal-burning plants in New York state, according to federal
emissions records.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, New York and other Northeastern states had focused on
direct negotiations with upwind states over cutting smog, on
efforts to pass federal acid rain laws, and suits and petitions
aimed at forcing the federal Environmental Protection Agency to
stop pollution created in one place from adding to problems in
another.
</P>
<P>
   But the last round of state-to-state negotiations broke down two
weeks ago, no new acid rain laws are likely soon, and a round of
maneuvers in federal court by the states hosting the old coal
plants has delayed new EPA action to staunch the pollution flow.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the new move is based on concrete facts about
changes at the plants, and thus should avoid some of the legal
snags that have delayed other efforts. ``The other actions involve
esoteric legal issues of jurisdiction and power,'' he said. ``We're
enmeshed there too. But this cuts right to the source.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of the impending legal action by New York, officials
at the EPA, which is conducting its own investigation of
investments and pollution at many coal-fired power plants, did
everything but cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we are absolutely supportive of any state's effort
to secure cleaner for its citizens,'' said EPA spokesman David
Cohen. ``We encourage the use of all legal tools available, and we
at EPA are doing everything possible, given constraints from recent
court decisions brought by polluters that have attempted to
frustrate our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the coal-power industry said they were
confident that the new strategy, like the ones before it, would not
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 17 plants named in the suit are owned by American
Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, and officials there, when told of
Spitzer's plans Tuesday, said the investments made at their old
plants were strictly to improve reliability and to keep up with
rising demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the maintenance work we do,'' said Pat Hemlepp,
a spokesman for American Electric Power. ``We're required by state
regulators to deliver reliable power to our customers. If what they
are questioning is whether we have done maintenance, yes, we have.
Have me made improvements that would increase capacity? No.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's staff contends otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the attorney general built their cases over the past
few months by collecting data from a wide array of federal and
state utility and environmental agencies that track the budgets,
construction projects, and pollution levels at plants, said Peter
Lehner, the top environmental lawyer in Spitzer's office. He said
consultants familiar with the energy industry helped pinpoint
instances where work was not simply done to replace old gear, but
to improve on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of this case is solid and fair,'' Lehner said.
``When an old plant's life is significantly extended, it has to
play closer to the rules of the new plants.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he provided some details about changes at one
West Virginia plant, which Lehner said he preferred not to identify
until the letters were sent out Tuesday. Records filed with the
Ohio Public Service Commission and federal energy officials show
that from 1988 to 1992, boilers for three generators were virtually
rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following the work, power generation at the plant
more than doubled, he said, resulting in a corresponding rise in
emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, which contribute to
smog and acid rain, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement may not end up playing out in a court
case, Lehner and others involved in the investigation said. The
plant owners could negotiate a settlement with New York in the
60-day waiting period required before such suits are filed, or they
could negotiate directly with the EPA some agreement to improve
pollution controls at the plants in question, lawyers in the
attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that the EPA could wrap up its own
simultaneous investigation of potential violations of pollution
laws and take one or more of the plant owners to court in the
meantime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And New York and other Northeastern states still are pursuing
other actions, including petitioning the EPA directly to force
individual power plants to clean up pollution. In New York, the
pressure on the Clinton administration has come not from Spitzer,
who is a Democrat, but from the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, which _ unlike the attorney general's office _
operates at the pleasure of Gov. George Pataki, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Pataki administration officials declined to comment on
Spitzer's initiative, preferring to highlight the work being done
to put pressure on the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawsuits go to court, they are likely to be hard fought,
said David Flannery, a lawyer and spokesman for the Midwest Ozone
Group, a coalition of coal and power companies.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the action by New York and the ongoing
investigations of work at the old power plants by the EPA would not
change a basic reality _ that much of the pollution in the
Northeast is generated there, not carried on the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still isn't any good science showing otherwise,''
Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said his main goal is to clean the air. He added that
his office was planning similar actions against heavily polluting
power plants in New York state, as well. ``We're looking at
everyone,'' he said.

A BLUE PLATE SPECIAL ON SOUR GRAPES

   The sad thing about awards shows, wrote  &UR; John Boe &LR;  after
watching this week's Emmys telecast, ``is that not everyone can
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Linz, Austria, where the Prix Ars Electronica &LR; 
cq &LR; , the Oscars of cyberspace, were distributed recently,
old-fashioned sour grapes were served up by high-tech artists.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco filmmaker and video artist  &UR; Lynn Hershman &LR; , who
took home a winged 3-foot-tall solid gold Golden Nica for ``The
Difference Engine 3,'' says she ``clung'' to the bulky prize ``and
carried it home on the airplane for fear it would be lost if I
checked it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when an artist from Digital Domain, which won for special
effects in ``What Dreams May Come,'' set down the award at a
post-ceremony celebration, it disappeared immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The theft was a political act perpetrated by another artists'
group, etoy. The thieves said at a press conference later that they
took the prize because they didn't think Digital Domain deserved
it.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  telephoned  &UR; Katherine Bryan &LR; , the wife of one of
his supporters, to offer condolences when news broke that her
husband,  &UR; Shelby Bryan &LR; , was having a hot and heavy affair with
Vogue editor  &UR; Anna Wintour &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   New York magazine reports that it looked for a while as if
Bryan's affair, much noticed in New York, would put the kibosh on a
planned presidential appointment. Then came the news that Bryan is
divorcing his wife and that Wintour is divorcing her husband,
psychiatrist  &UR; David Shaffer &LR; . And Bryan, a heavy contributor to
Clinton, has been given a seat on an advisory board on foreign
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Said one Vogue editor of the scandal's effect on her hard-edged
boss, ``It's really weird. ... It's kind of chipped away at her
whole persona. Like she's been caught in the act of doing something
... human.''

research for a business matter,  &UR; Len Fisher &LR;  came upon Senate Bill
459, Title 3.5, sponsored by  &UR; Al Gore &LR;  and passed into law in 1990:
``Use of inventions in outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Pamela Anderson Lee &LR;  told Men's Fitness that the weirdest
thing in her refrigerator is her son's placenta, which wasn't all
that weird because holistically minded people know that consuming
the placenta is a tribal ritual. More surprising, however, is her
revelation of plans for the thing, which bears a ``do not eat''

   &UR; STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Mayor  &UR; Ying-jeau Ma &LR;  of Taipei was in San Francisco over the
weekend, and because Taipei has a growing gay-rights movement, he
was particularly interested in taking a look around the Castro,
says Supervisor  &UR; Tom Ammiano &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thomas Lee &LR; , a Chinese-speaking aide to Ammiano, took Ma
through the neighborhood, where he expressed particular delight at
the Gay Cleaners, a Chinese laundry. Although that Castro Street
establishment was in business long before ``gay'' described the
Castro, Ma perceived it as a perfect melding of Chinese
entrepreneurship and neighborhood lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newly named neighborhood: Residents of that upwardly mobile
piece of Mission Street between Cesar Chavez and Randall streets
(which ``skirts the base of Bernal Heights'') are ``eager to
differentiate this area from its bookends, the Inner and Outer
Mission,'' writes  &UR; John Perry &LR; , who passes along one suggestion:
BeLola, derived from Bernal Lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bravo to  &UR; Robin Williams &LR; , whose name has been on a freeway

be on hand to help park cars when PacBell opens.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the ``deep, dark end'' of Sacramento Street, strobe lights
flashed for an hour and a half at the Claire Lilienthal School last
week; during the last half hour, an audible alarm ``shrieked,''
too, reports neighbor  &UR; Fran Johns &LR; . A school official told Johns
that the strobe is for the hearing-impaired, who apparently get
warned of impending disaster well before anyone ``blind or
napping,'' says Johns.

<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ As Americanization proceeds apace, many
things remain different in Germany. Tabloids, for one, and a
refreshingly offbeat notion of what constitutes blockbuster news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohnesorg Weg aus Koln'' (``Ohnesorg Out of Cologne''), a
banner headline trumpeted in January, when it was announced that
Franz Xaver Ohnesorg was leaving his position as director of the
Cologne Philharmonie, without evident mayhem or murder, to become
the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall. A full-color
photograph of the miscreant, looking for all the world like the
teddy bear with which he appears in another well-circulated
photograph, accompanied the headline.
</P>
<P>
   But cultural figures are seen differently in Germany, too. Even
concert-hall managers, and especially this one, can loom larger
than life. In 16 years on the job in this relatively small city,
Ohnesorg, 51, a Bavarian who had held various administrative
positions in Munich, became something of a legend.
</P>
<P>
   He oversaw the planning and construction of the Philharmonie,
one of the finest modern concert halls in Europe, which opened in
1986. Then he installed in it some of the most varied and
adventurous musical programming anywhere, attracting the best
performers on the international scene. And on it all he left the
imprint of an oversize personality, fueled by enormous energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a person you feel neutrally about, and I have nothing
but positive things to say,'' said the American conductor James
Conlon, who, as general music director of the city of Cologne since
1991, has worked closely with Ohnesorg. ``Especially in Europe,
where so much artistic administration has an aura of bureaucracy,
his example has been revelatory. He always puts artists and their
needs first.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Stern, who as president of Carnegie Hall played a crucial
role in luring Ohnesorg away from Cologne, spoke similarly of his
qualities, making special note of the fact that he is an
accomplished flutist. ``I was very much impressed that he was a
musician first,'' Stern said. ``He has a great understanding of the
history of music and of the beauty of the history of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was another farsighted administrator who first envisioned
Ohnesorg's potential at Carnegie Hall: his predecessor there,
Judith Arron. Over a period of many months, as the cancer that led
to her death last December progressed, Arron tried to persuade
Ohnesorg to join her team, as a ``No. 1 {,'' in Stern's phrase, and
a likely successor. Just days before she died, she was still
courting him from her hospital bed in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   So Stern and Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Carnegie Hall,
evaluated Ohnesorg along with three or four American candidates
whom Stern called ``extraordinarily qualified'' but refused to
name. In a sort of certification of Arron's judgment, Ohnesorg
became a full-fledged No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Even apart from the devastating loss of his friend Arron, the
timing was less than ideal. Ohnesorg _ Xaver (pronounced ZAH-ver)
to his many friends _ was just finishing work on a home into which
he and his family had moved in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   And he was looking forward to one of the most exciting periods
at the Philharmonie, including the 2000 edition of the Cologne
Music Triennale, a 20th-century-music festival that he founded in
1994, which is to feature all of the American Big Five orchestras
(those of Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia)
within four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you said no to Carnegie Hall, what else would you do?''
asked Ohnesorg in his Philharmonie office, soon to be vacated.
``Someday perhaps the Salzburg Festival, but a chance like this may
never come again.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Carnegie Hall, too, was anticipating one of its most
exciting seasons in decades, with a vast patchwork survey of
20th-century music variously guided by Maurizio Pollini, Pierre
Boulez and Daniel Barenboim, and placed in a rich historical
context. The culmination of Arron's dozen years of innovative
programming of concerts and workshops, it was also a season after
Ohnesorg's heart: one similar, in fact, to his own Cologne season
in the prominence it gives to Boulez and Barenboim and in its other
emphases.
</P>
<P>
   So Ohnesorg said a long goodbye recently with a gala affair of
which New York has seldom seen the like in recent decades: perhaps
only in the celebrations of James Levine's 25th anniversary at the
Metropolitan Opera and of the renovation and then the centennial of
Carnegie Hall itself. Through five hours at the Philharmonie,
Conlon and Kurt Masur conducted the resident Gurzenich Orchestra;
Juliane Banse, Christine Schafer, Christoph Pregardien, Irwin Gage
and others offered an extended segment of songs, and Frank Peter
Zimmermann, Heinrich Schiff, Olli Mustonen and others played
chamber works.
</P>
<P>
   With a magnanimity said to be characteristic, Ohnesorg
contributed the proceeds (some $80,000, with all the musicians
donating their services) to the Beethoven House in Bonn to aid in
the publication of a facsimile edition of the autograph manuscript
of the ``Pastoral'' Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And in the wee hours after the concert, he treated much of the
assembled throng to a party in the nearby Alter Wartesaal, a
cavernous beer hall, at which a local band ran a gamut from ``Give
My Regards to Broadway'' to ``New York, New York.'' But the
ebullient Ohnesorg himself provided the most riotous entertainment,
extracting a hilariously sappy travesty of the Bach-Gounod ``Ave
Maria'' from an air pump with some ungodly combination of flute and
slide-whistle technique.
</P>
<P>
   American orchestra and concert-hall managers do not generally
put themselves forward to the public in the way Ohnesorg has done
here. ``You learn that in Germany,'' Conlon said. ``Germans expect
it and want it from a music director or a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Conlon added, Ohnesorg's high profile had never
detracted from his considerate relationships with performers and
composers. Indeed, Stern cited the many deep friendships Ohnesorg
had cultivated with artists worldwide as a decisive factor in his
attractiveness to Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by all accounts _ not least, his own _ Ohnesorg will have
much to learn, much to adapt to, in New York. For one thing, he can
hardly expect to achieve the same kind of prominence outside the
classical-music community in a city where that community is _ in
contrast to the situation in Cologne _ dwarfed, jostled and made to
fend for itself. For another, he will have to get used to American
ways, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not the same recognition of authority here as in
Germany,'' Stern said, noting that even dealing with hall staff and
employees will require a significant adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever problems may arise, Ohnesorg suggests, will not be for
lack of effort on his part. ``I will need 24 hours a day for
Carnegie in the first months,'' he said, with no hint of hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Franziska, and his 3-year-old son, Severin, are
remaining in Cologne until next year, as he installs himself in an
apartment in Carnegie Hall, which Arron had built to ease her
difficult situation in her last years. He expresses relief that for
the moment, at least, he can put off moving his 10,000 books and
5,000 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   For Ohnesorg, New York, which he professes to love, will be the
farthest cry yet from his origins. He was born in 1948 in Weilheim,
a little town in the lovely, undulating countryside south of
Munich. In 1968, he moved to that city, where he studied both
business management and music. His work there included stints as
orchestra manager of the Munich Philharmonic and as a music
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from a couple of long conversations, Ohnesorg is an
affable man. (``Ohnesorg'' could translate as ``carefree.'') He
cuts a figure both dapper, with bow tie, a trim beard and
wire-rimmed glasses, and jolly, with an eager smile and twinkling
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, one senses steel underneath, and in truth it would
be surprising if Ohnesorg had accomplished so much without that.
Conlon's remark about the impossibility of remaining neutral toward
Ohnesorg undoubtedly cuts both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Harold Clarkson, a prominent artist and
touring manager based in Hanover, likened Ohnesorg to a magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He attracts things,'' Clarkson said. ``He's absolutely
brilliant at getting people to open their purses. What he
accomplished in Cologne is remarkable. Most of the halls in Germany
act as garages. He changed that. He developed a hall with real
character and individuality.''
</P>
<P>
   When a man of such qualities meets an institution of such
tradition and resources as Carnegie, the chemistry is sure to be
volatile and, to say the least, interesting.

IN SETBACK FOR GORE, FRIENDS OF EARTH PAC ENDORSES BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley on Tuesday received the
endorsement of a national environmental organization, dealing a
blow to Vice President Al Gore's efforts to cast himself as the
clear choice of environmentally minded voters in the Democratic
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the group, the Friends of the Earth Political
Action Committee, said they had decided to back Bradley this early
in the campaign _ the Iowa caucuses are still more than four months
away _ largely out of frustration with the environmental policies
of the Clinton administration, particularly on global warming and
international trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very high hopes for Al Gore, and we've been
disappointed,'' said Mark Whiteis-Helm, a spokesman for the group.
``He's talked the talk but he has simply been unable to walk the
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   With 20,000 members in the United States, Friends of the Earth
is significantly smaller than other major environmental groups, and
it lacks the financial resources to provide much campaign help to
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also appears unlikely to sway the two other
national environmental groups that endorse candidates, the Sierra
Club and the League of Conservation Voters. Officials of both
groups called Tuesday's move premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these candidates have even outlined their positions or
programs,'' said Deb Callahan, president of the League of
Conservation Voters. She added that both candidates have strong
environmental records.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, the author of a 1992 best-selling book about the
dangers of global warming, ``Earth in the Balance,'' has been
widely viewed as the leading environmental voice in the
administration. So Tuesday's endorsement raises questions about the
depth of his support within an important Democratic constituency
that might have once been safely considered in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to remind a lot of people who care about the
environment about how good Bradley's record was,'' said Eric
Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kiki Moore said, ``Al Gore will continue to
work for a balanced approach and fight for a clean and healthy
environment for America's working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiteis-Helm criticized the Clinton administration _ and by
extension Gore _ for not pushing to reduce the use of chemicals
that are believed to contribute to global warming and for
negotiating trade agreements that allowed foreign companies to
skirt U.S. environmental rules.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters, which grades members of
Congress on their environmental votes, has given Bradley a lifetime
score of 84 percent for the 18 years he represented New Jersey in
the Senate. The group has given Gore, who represented Tennessee in
the House and the Senate for 16 years, a 64 percent lifetime score.

 &HT;    Southeastern evacuations give new meaning to 'rush hour'
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long before making landfall, Hurricane Floyd delivered
a strong blow to metro Atlanta: an all-night rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic got so bad that officials worried it would deter some
coastal residents from seeking safety on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to get out of there,'' said Lillian Jackson, a
spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Transportation. ``While
we want to be able to give them a realistic estimate of how long it
will take them, we really don't want to discourage them from taking
this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the destination, the trip was long. But with hotels and
motels booked throughout the metro area and as far west as
Anniston, Ala., many evacuees had nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   Matters weren't much better along I-16 between Savannah and
Macon, where traffic crawled along at 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The highway was heavily congested even after officials closed
its eastbound lanes on an 85-mile stretch between Savannah and the
Swainsboro, Ga., exit just before noon and turned the interstate
into a one-way evacuation route. The eastbound lanes will be closed
``until the determination is made that everybody's out,'' said Ben
Snedeker of the DOT.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Hooker, the wife of a U.S. Army staff sergeant stationed
near Savannah, left home before noon with her two children,
Zachary, who turns 2 today, and Jacob, who turns 7 Sunday. By a
little after 7 p.m., she had gotten only to the small town of
Smarr, about 20 miles north of Macon in central Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm freaked out,'' said Hooker, whose husband was away for
drill-sergeant training. She rested at a BP gas station in Smarr.
``I'm trying to find a place to sleep. I don't want to go to a
shelter with these two kids. I thought I could find a room north of
Atlanta, but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she planned to drive to her sister's house in
Guntersville, Ala., 65 miles northeast of Birmingham _ at least
another five hours away.
</P>
<P>
   Gas-station parking lots along the interstates were packed with
weary refugees. Families traveled in caravans of two or three
vehicles, and at a Shell station in Smarr, several vehicles with
Florida license tags had mattresses tied to their roofs, with blue
tarpaulins protecting the bedding from the inevitable rain.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people were trying to escape from Florida, where
the storm was expected to strike first. John Joyce, a spokesman for
the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said traffic was
bumper to bumper on I-75 and I-95, with ``a massive amount of cars
on the roads'' heading to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   They shared the roads with 500,000 people from Georgia's six
coastal counties who had been ordered to evacuate, including all
250,000 residents of Savannah and Chatham County.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah resident Mary Cannon, 53, packed her car with
essentials _ blankets, a 2-inch television, a flashlight, clothes
and her two cockatiel birds, Spike and Michelle. The birds rested
in the front passenger seat of her sky-blue Chevy Blazer as she
tried to navigate the traffic heading west on U.S. 80. She had
stopped at a gas station in Bloomingdale, about 20 miles outside of
Savannah, to get water for the birds, but it was closed and the
windows were taped up.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had packed most of her valuables in the Blazer, but
she had to leave something behind. ``You know what I'm worried
about?'' she asked. ``I had three or four thousand dollars' worth
of baseball cards. I had to leave them behind. I had to leave Ken
Griffey and Cal Ripkin, but I brought Mark McGuire and some Sammy
Sosas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some evacuees stopped short of metro Atlanta, spending the night
in makeshift shelters in small-town school gymnasiums and meeting
halls.
</P>
<P>
   At the Douglas Community Service Center in Coffee County, 500
people were expected to spend the night in a facility that had not
been prepared for their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're overrun,'' said Sarah Paulk, a member of the center's
staff. ``We're needing all the food we can get ahold of. We didn't
know about this situation until this morning. It was just on us
right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Other shelters had radio stations broadcast pleas for bottled
water and mattresses, and two state DOT trucks left a north Atlanta
suburb late Tuesday to deliver 700 cots to shelters in Macon and
Swainsboro.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT trucks got help in quickly reaching their destinations _
a state police escort through crowded highways.
</P>
<P>
   A few coastal residents stayed behind in Savannah, where an
eerie calm settled over the nearly deserted city late Tuesday. The
only people on the streets were police officers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beasley home on U.S. 80 heading into town, boards covered
every window and two-by-fours were wedged against the front door.
But as Norma and James Beasley fortified their house Tuesday
morning, Norma's mother had a stroke, and the couple had to rush
her to the hospital, where doctors don't expect her to live.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as they tried to leave town, their truck wouldn't start,
and they were delayed in getting out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a hell of a day,'' James Beasley said while loading
the couple's other car with their most valuable possessions,
including a framed will from the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what we'll have when we come back,'' Norma
Beasley said, standing in her driveway, the road in front of her
house jammed with cars moving inch by inch from the coast. ``We may
not have anything.''

 MERRITT ISLAND, Fla.: the country.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   State officials said that decisions made as early as Monday to
evacuate coastal areas were wise ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments did the right thing by asking for
evacuations early enough,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush. ``Floridians have
responded in the proper way.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1 million people ordered to evacuate their homes
in coastal Florida, hundreds of thousands spent the night inland
wherever they could find a bed. The more fortunate, and more
wealthy, filled hotel rooms in Orlando and other inland cities, and
some drove as far the west coast, to Naples, Fort Myers and the
Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands filled high school gymnasiums, auditoriums and
churches, spending a miserable night on the floor or in folding
chairs. In Belle Glade, about 40 miles west of Palm Beach, more
than 500 people packed the auditorium of Glades Central High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself with my four kids, and I was scared,''
said Pearlie Hill, 33, who abandoned her mobile home in this mostly
poor farming community for the stronger walls of the school. ``We
had no safe place to be. We all learned in school about the 1928
hurricane, so hurricanes scare us around these parts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, a hurricane crashed through Palm Beach County, flooded
the farm towns around Lake Okeechobee and killed nearly 2,000
people, most of them poor farm workers. Some 1,000 were buried in a
mass grave in a cemetery in Canal Point.
</P>
<P>
   Missoura Philpart, 49, brought her family of eight to the
shelter. ``My grandmama had to climb to the top of her roof when
that hurricane hit in 1928,'' she said. ``I was raised to fear
hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   To the west in Palm Beach County on Tuesday, the usually busy
Federal Highway was mostly quiet as the sun set and Floyd, finally,
began to blow into the state. The strip malls, their storefronts
covered over with plywood, were almost empty of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Loony, a mail carrier, tried to keep his Postal Service
jeep from being blown off the road by wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're the only ones who had to work today,''
Loony said, before moving on with his baskets of mail, a real-life
example of that old slogan about neither rain nor sleet nor dark of
night. He did not seem pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in other parts of Florida, the time for preparation was
past, and people hoped the forecasters' prediction that the worst
of the storm would go north of them, was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, it looked as if that was exactly what had
happened, and people here were grateful that lashing rain and winds
of 70 mph were the worst they saw of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I had this awful pit in my stomach,'' said Charles
Miehz, a retiree who lives in Boca Raton. As he, and many others
here, had watched the massive storm creep across his television
screen, it seemed as if it would swallow the whole state. But, as
the worst of the storm passed farther north, he finally took a safe
breath.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in Miami, where Tiffany Zadi, a student at the
University of Miami, stayed up late at her parents' house in Cutler
Ridge, praying that the storm would pass Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Thank God,''' said Miss Zadi, who, along with her
parents, rode out Hurricane Andrew in their Cutler Ridge home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Andrew was a nightmare,'' she said. And Floyd seemed
so much bigger, so much more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane warning that went into effect Monday night in
Miami was lifted late Tuesday afternoon, allowing people to leave
emergency shelters and return to their homes. Mayor Alex Penelas
announced late Tuesday that schools and government offices would
reopen Wednesday, and that city services would resume normal
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the best preparation they could think of was to
go for a swim. On Miami Beach's South Beach, a half-dozen hardy
souls dove into the waves at midday, while dozens of other braved a
hazy, gritty wind to watch them. John Tedesco, who lives in Miami
Beach, had already been there twice for nighttime swims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a little bit of fear you're going to get pulled
out,'' he said. ``You got to know your limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Becker, Tedesco's girlfriend, knew hers. She stayed on
shore, watching him like a sailor's wife perched in the widow's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nuts, I tell you,'' she said. ``He likes the rush of it.
And my heart stops.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Juan Andrada stood and took it all in.
Bare-chested and with a leathery tan, he was almost meditative as
he beheld the ocean. For 30 years, he worked as a steward on cruise
ships, including the Queen Elizabeth II. He was happy just to watch
what he knew could be a wicked, unforgiving sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always an attraction to the sea,'' he said. ``I can
see what people don't know. I have respect for the sea. I'm not
going in it. I know the force of the sea. Other people don't. There
is wind and water. That is electricity. For me, this is a great
miracle.''

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With two apartment buildings leveled by explosions in
recent days, many Russians are afraid to go into their apartments
at night. But many people from the Caucasus are now afraid to leave
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Literally overnight, the city's thousands of dark-complexioned
natives of Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and other regions of the
Caucasus Mountains, Muslim or Christian, have become suspects _ and
potential scapegoats _ in Russia's reaction to the suspected
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of encountering the bullying police or suspicious
neighbors, they only venture outside for quick trips to buy food.
Shut in, they work their phones, talking to other friends,
ferreting out facts and rumors about the authorities' plans to deal
with its undesirables.
</P>
<P>
   But even staying inside is no guarantee of security. Aishat, a
39-year-old Chechen, thought she was safe until a rap on her door
Tuesday morning. A handsome woman with a genial manner, Aishat had
brought her two young sons to Moscow to escape the turmoil in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Moscow police demanded to see her official residency
permit. When she was unable to produce one, they gave her three
days to come up with the documents or leave town.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Chechen would have have carried out these bombings,'' said
Aishat, who allowed only her first name to be used. ``Whoever did
this made our situation much, much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the death count from the blasts on Monday and last
Thursday at more than 210, people from the Caucasus have plenty of
reason to be worried. When Vremechko, a popular late-night talk
show, asked its viewers Tuesday night what should be done to end
terrorist threats to the capital, more than 1,000 quickly called in
with their recommendation: All people from the Caucasus should be
deported from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti urging citizens to ``Kill the blacks,'' Russians' slur
for the dark-skinned people from the Caucasus, have turned up in
subway stations and alleyways.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin has urged citizens not to turn the
terrorist attacks into a racist crusade. The enemy, Yeltsin said in
a nationally televised address on Monday, ``has no face,
nationality or faith.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all Russian politicians have been so conscientious.
After blaming Islamic militants for the blast, Moscow's mayor, Yuri
Luzhkov, proclaimed that all visitors to the city would have to
re-register within the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   The move was largely aimed at Caucasians, who number in the
hundreds of thousands and who, more often than not, have lived in
Moscow without residency permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main threat is coming from Chechnya,'' Luzhkov said.
``Special attention will be paid to visitors from that republic and
to cargo arriving from Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Moscow authorities began to carry out Luzhkov's policy.
More than 4,200 people from the northern Caucasus, including many
from Chechnya, were stopped by the police and asked to show their
official documents. Many did not have any.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombings, the police had monitored the major
entry points to the city and stopped people who looked like they
were from the Caucasus for random document checks, which often
turned into little more than an opportunity to extract bribes.
</P>
<P>
   But those inspections were stepped up Tuesday. People were
checked at Moscow's Vnukovo airport, where planes from the northern
Caucasus arrive. At the Paveletsky railway station, the train from
Makhachkala, Dagestan was met by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian woman who telephoned the host of Vremechko Tuesday
night complained that that the crackdown on Caucasians getting out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moscow, we are considered half-Caucasian,'' she said. ``But
if go to the northern Caucasus they consider us half-Slav. Millions
of people live this kind of life. We are facing a new hatred that
nobody needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Aishat, the woman from Chechnya, does not look remotely like a
terrorist. She had lived in Grozny, the capital of the Chechen
republic, Until her house was leveled in the 1994-96 war between
secessionist rebels and Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   For a while after that, she lived with her parents in a small
village near the town of Urus-Martan. But life there was hard for
her sons, Abubakar and Ilyes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   School was in session, but little learning went on. Teachers
were not paid and the school had no heat because people were afraid
to venture into the mine-filled forests to look for firewood.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So Aishat and her sons came to Moscow, moving into a two-room
apartment owned by a close relative. About 30,000 Chechens live in
the Moscow area, according to one local Chechen leader.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian Constitution, each citizen is supposed to be
able to live where he wants. But Luzhkov has insisted on a
registration system that is essentially a continuation of the old
Soviet system that required residents to have a permit to live in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechens know it is difficult for them to obtain the
documents and so live in Moscow without them. They suffer from a
constant fear of eviction, an anxiety heightened by memories of
Stalin's deportation of the Chechen people from their homeland in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest explosions, Aishat said she was harassed
by the police. But the blasts that demolished the apartment
buildings have exacerbated her situation.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest son was sent home from school Tuesday with a note
from the principal, a kind woman who had been sympathetic in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   With a citywide crackdown under way, the principal warned that
the boy would have to be expelled from school unless Aishat
furnished a residency permit.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday morning, the police came knocking at her door of her
modest fifth-floor walk-up apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to impress the police, Aishat showed a brochure from an
American charitable organization _ the Gift of Life _ which had
arranged for her son to go to New York for heart surgery. Her
family had come to Moscow, she insisted, so that her invalid son
could continue his medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The police still demanded that she pay a 10 ruble fine (about 40
cents in U.S. currency) and produce a residency permit within three
days.
</P>
<P>
   With little time, few contacts and no ability to travel freely
within Moscow, Aishat said she had no idea how she might prevail.
Perhaps the police would let her buy some more time by paying yet
another fine. Perhaps they would evict her and all of her Chechen
friends from the city.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite her distress, she welcomed a visitor in her apartment,
laid out a table of eggplant, tomatoes and honey from Chechnya and
pulled out a treasured album of photos.
</P>
<P>
   One photograph showed her in front of her parents' home in
Chechnya. The smiling women were wearing colorful scarves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the custom for Muslim women in the Caucasus,'' she
explained matter-of-factly. ``We can't do it here. It would attract
too much attention.''

HOUSE GOP COOL ON ITS PATIENTS' RIGHTS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Ariz., Va., Ga., Mich., Ohio)  (bl) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders, who directed junior
members of the party to draft a bill defining patients' rights just
five weeks ago, criticized the results of that effort Tuesday,
saying the bill could expose health maintenance organizations to
costly lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   If House Republicans have any strategy for dealing with the
volatile issue of patients' rights, it was not evident when they
finished an hourlong meeting Tuesday in the office of Speaker
Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, just before lawmakers left for the summer recess,
Hastert said that ``a proposal developed by Congressmen Tom Coburn
and John Shadegg will be considered by the House this September.''
Under the bill, he said then, patients could appeal the denial of
care to an independent panel of medical experts, and ``HMOs can be
taken to court and held accountable when patients are harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Coburn, a physician from Oklahoma, and Shadegg, a lawyer
from Arizona, disclosed the text of their bill last Thursday,
Hastert had no comment. Senior House Republicans, including the
chairmen of several committees and subcommittees, expressed grave
reservations about the bill Tuesday as they emerged from a meeting
with Hastert and the sponsors of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Dick Armey described the bill as ``the least
worst way to do the wrong thing.'' Provisions of the bill
authorizing patients to sue HMOs for injuries caused by the
negligence of a health plan ``still bother me,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, said he, too, was reluctant to create a new right to
sue. ``I'm for care, not for court,'' said after Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said, ``The leadership is divided on what they think
should be in the bill.'' The reason, he said, is a disagreement
over the proper degree of legal liability for HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans, insurance companies, Senate Republicans and
businesses of all sizes oppose any new right for patients to sue.
But Coburn said: ``It's unrealistic to think a bill will pass the
House that doesn't have liability as a mechanism to hold health
plans accountable. Whatever passes the House is going to have some
form of liability.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 of the 222 House Republicans and almost all 211
House Democrats favor some form of HMO liability. Republican
leaders acknowledge that they probably need some such provision to
keep Republicans from supporting Democratic bills that impose much
more government regulation than most Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat something with nothing,'' Shadegg said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who attended Tuesday's meeting said party leaders
did not repudiate the Coburn-Shadegg bill, but intend to keep
working with the sponsors to devise a measure with broader appeal
to House Republicans. ``The feeling in the meeting was that they
should continue to work together and move the process forward,''
said John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The Coburn-Shadegg bill was conceived as an alternative to a
proposal drafted by Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and John Dingell,
D-Mich., who have long insisted that patients should be able to sue
their health plans for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While authorizing lawsuits against HMOs, Coburn and Shadegg are
trying to protect employers, who under their bill could be sued
only if they directly participated in final decisions on claims for
benefits. But Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, shares the concern of
employers who believe that they would still be exposed to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   David Schnittger, a spokesman for Boehner, said: ``In practice,
it's very difficult to guarantee that employers would be shielded
from that liability. That's a serious concern because it could
prompt some employers to drop health coverage for their employees
at the very time we're trying to expand access.''

 &HT;    Cherish Dan Marino, before it's our turn to bid farewell to
legendary QB
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ All right, so maybe the rain was blowing
sideways in South Florida on Tuesday night with the passing of a
hurricane. It's in Denver that the sky is falling.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this sampling of the mournful Colorado newspaper
coverage from Miami's 38-21 win against the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end is not near. It is here,'' that's how one Denver Post
columnist began his analysis. ``Poof. The magic's gone,'' wrote
another.
</P>
<P>
   One game into the season and the two-time Super Bowl champions
are kaput. From a Rocky Mountain high to a landfill low, and all
because John Elway is pitching beer as a private citizen this
September rather than tossing footballs as a Hall of Fame
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a moment to get through to all the Dan Marino
bashers, this is it. What's happening in Denver is a preview of the
daze that will envelop our own community the day the Dolphins say
goodbye to their legendary passer. Only then, after nearly two
decades of certainty at quarterback, will we fully appreciate the
luxury of an old hand in charge of the Miami offense rather than
one of the rookies or retreads most NFL teams depend upon.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the same nagging doubts resurface at the final gun of
every Miami loss.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Dolphins' Super Bowl blueprint be missing a mobile
quarterback and nothing more?
</P>
<P>
   Can any Miami coach, fidgety Jimmy Johnson included, ever fully
commit to a balanced offensive attack as long as Marino looms over
the huddle?
</P>
<P>
   Might the average busload of senior citizens unloading at the
mall yield several candidates capable of handing off a football
with more speed and less deliberation than creaky, old No. 13?
</P>
<P>
   Be honest. In the opening minutes of Monday night's game, with
Brian Griese hitting on a 61-yard touchdown bomb and Marino tossing
ill-advised passes off the fingertips of Denver defenders, many of
you were asking questions much harsher than these.
</P>
<P>
   The kid did look good, far more composed than anyone but proud
papa Bob Griese could have guessed. Without a strong running game,
however, and without a dominating effort by the Denver defense,
Elway himself would have been hard pressed to make a closer game of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone remember how futile Elway's record-breaking efforts
were before Terrell Davis got to Denver? Elway's Broncos lost three
lopsided Super Bowls before the glorious finishing kick of
championship victories against Green Bay and Atlanta changed his
image as a regal runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Even in last season's humiliating 38-3 loss to Denver in the AFC
playoffs, the quarterbacks were a relatively minor factor. Elway
hit a fourth-quarter touchdown pass, long after the matter was
decided, but it was Davis who set the brutal tone of the game by
rushing for 199 yards, the most allowed by Miami in a post-season
game.
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw two touchdown passes Monday night, neither
particularly spectacular, but what made him an easy winner on John
Elway appreciation night at Mile High Stadium were the
contributions of Jimmy's new offensive components.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk Tony Martin up for 101 yards in receptions, including a
40-yarder, and rookie fullback Ron Konrad for a touchdown catch.
Running back J.J. Johnson, the second-round pick everyone forgot,
ran hard. Cecil Collins, the summer sensation with the dangerous
past, hasn't even suited up.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people Marino will utilize in 1999, and he'll do
it as efficiently as Griese did at the Dolphins' Super Bowl peak.
There is an opening here. The Jets have lost Vinny Testaverde for
the season. Fred Taylor is clopping around the Jaguars' camp with a
cast on his left foot. As for the Broncos, well, according to
published reports the end is here.
</P>
<P>
   Only Marino can make the most of all this. Not Damon Huard, who
has attempted nine NFL passes. Not Craig Erickson, whom Johnson cut
loose in training camp after three seasons of grooming him as
Marino's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's emotional farewell Monday proved the unmatched power of
a truly classic quarterback. One day Marino's retirement will prove
it again, even to those who wonder if he's not already about five
years overdue.

HOUSE COALITION DEFEATS AMENDMENTS AIMED AT WEAKENING CAMPAIGN
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defying the Republican leadership, a bipartisan
coalition of House members picked up momentum on Tuesday night in
the drive to overhaul the way the nation's political campaigns are
financed by defeating a series of amendments that they said would
doom the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The votes came as the House engaged in an all-day debate over
the influence of money in politics that pit bipartisan legislation
sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., against three rival bills and 10 amendments.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, Shays and Meehan were holding their coalition
together and handily defeated a series of amendments that they had
said were designed to splinter their ranks and weaken their
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated measures would have done things like raise current
contribution limits or exempt from regulation ads on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The House did pass, 261 to 167, an amendment that was aimed
squarely at Hillary Rodham Clinton, but which sponsors did not
consider significant enough to kill their bill. It would require
the first lady to pay the full costs of any governmental travel to
New York during a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking good,'' said Shays, as his supporters grew
optimistic that the House would approve for the second year in a
row legislation to ban the unlimited and unregulated donations to
the national political parties that figured prominently in the
scandals arising out of the 1996 presidential election. These
donations are commonly called ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers clashed repeatedly over whether the influx of money
into campaigns was corrupting Congress or whether it was essential
to free political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reach and influence of special interests have grown out of
control,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of many
Republicans to cross their leadership and support the bipartisan
bill. ``As a consequence, people believe their elected officials
are bought and paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., said that the legislation could not
face constitutional muster. ``It tromps all over people's
individual First Amendment freedoms,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In the the Senate last year, the Shays-Meehan legislation drew a
majority of 52 votes last year but then died in a Republican-led
filibuster. The opposition has carried over into this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there are the votes to pass any bill,''
Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Senate majority whip said, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is volatile, and it is not clear whether the
looming 2000 campaigns will cause any change in the dynamics. The
debate comes at a moment when the 2000 races are well underway and
provide a new barometer of how the public will respond to money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side of the presidential campaign, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, who has amassed a $50 million campaign fund, has
declared that he will not accept federal matching money. Steve
Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher is also forgoing federal
money. Those decisions leave both men unrestricted by a $40 million
spending limit that applies to candidates who accept matching funds
in the primaries, a cap that was a bulwark of the post-Watergate
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is the chief sponsor of the
Senate legislation to ban soft money, has put his crusade at the
center of his own uphill presidential bid. He has called the
current campaign system ``an elaborate influence peddling scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is seeking the
Democratic nomination, has pledged that he would refuse soft money
in 2000 if the Republicans would also do so, saying big money is at
the root of multiple problems in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation would ban ``soft money,'' which
both parties have used to circumvent the limits on contributions to
individual candidates that were enacted in the wake of the
Watergate scandal of the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It would also curb the increasingly popular practice, used by
independent advocacy groups and the the political parties
themselves, of running commercials that purport to explain an issue
but are thinly veiled campaign commercials attacking or supporting
a candidate. The bill would more strictly regulate such ads in the
60 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIMS STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to overhaul the campaign finance system has
dogged Congress for years but became particularly heated after the
1996 campaign, in which President Clinton aggressively used access
to the White House to raise funds. The Democratic National
Committee also gave back several million dollars in campaign funds
after disclosures that they had come from foreign nationals or were
of questionable legality.
</P>
<P>
   But despite holding a series of high-profile hearings into the
1996 campaign, the Republican leaders in Congress have staunchly
opposed the move to ban soft money, arguing publicly it would
weaken political parties and harm free speech.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in a closed door meeting for House Republicans,
party leaders were more blunt. Republicans said their party
chairman, Jim Nicholson, and Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, who is head
of the House Republicans' re-election effort, told lawmakers their
party held a $39.9 million advantage in soft money in the 1997-1998
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Through a long day and into the night, House members argued over
the money chase that they have come to know so well. Shays insisted
his legislation would close loopholes that had come over time come
to erode long-standing fund-raising restrictions enacted by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about ending corrupt politics,'' he said, ''that's what
it's about. It has been against the law since 1907 for corporate
treasury money to be used in campaigns. But it happens. It's been
against the law since 1947 for union dues money to be used in
campaigns. But it's happening. It's been against the law since 1974
for foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns but they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill spoke out against regulation and said its
restrictions on issue advocacy infringed on the First Amendment.
``Free speech, particularly free political speech is a cherished
right and shrine in the first amendment to our constitution,'' said
Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. ``For democracy to flourish a free
people must be able to express their political views without
government restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, added a partisan
tone to the debate when he accused the Republican majority of being
in the sway of special interests on issues ranging from health care
to tax cuts to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all seen what being bound to big money from the
special interests has done to the Republican legislative agenda,''
he said. ``Republican leaders put the needs of powerful lobbyists
ahead of the average family and their needs.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation was only one of several rival
measures under consideration today. Under the established
procedures, passage of any of the other measures would serve to
trump the bipartisan legislation.
</P>
<P>
   One measure sponsored by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas
Republican, would ban soft money donations to the national
political parties but not to the state parties. Another measure
sponsored by Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., would eliminate all
current federal contributions limits, eliminate public financing of
campaigns and require immediate disclosure of contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas of California was sponsoring a third, noncontroversial
measure to strengthen and streamline the powers of the Federal
Election Commission. Shays and Meehan were fighting it on grounds
that its passage and would kill their own measure. Thomas argued
that the Shays-Meehan bill would never become law and that his FEC
bill might prevail in the Senate. ``I believe if you take smaller
steps in a cooperative way then you can take bigger ones,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, the Shays-Meehan supporters faced 10 attempts to
amend their bill. They fought off the seven provisions they
believed would have been deadly to the legislation. But one
amendment that passed was all about the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., with Mrs. Clinton in
mind, it would require ``a candidate for election for Federal
office (other than a candidate who holds Federal office)'' to
reimburse the government for free federal transportation used for
campaign purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said his measure ``remedies an unfair advantage.'' Rep.
Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., called the measure ``a mean-spirited,
petty, politically charged amendment'' and asked why local
officials running for federal office should not also be required to
reimburse states or cities for transportation or for providing
security.

PANEL BACKS STEM CELL USE FOR RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A strong endorsement of research on human embryonic stem cells
has been issued by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, 10
months after President Clinton asked the group to weigh the ethical
pros and cons of the new technique.
</P>
<P>
   The research has provoked dissent because the principal way of
deriving the cells is from surplus human embryos created in
fertility clinics. The embryos, a few days past the fertilized egg
stage, are destroyed in the process. But the cells derived from
them can develop into any of the body's tissues, and biologists
hope they could be used as an all-purpose repair kit.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report, which was released on Monday, provides
ethical support for the policy being pursued by the National
Institutes of Health, the principal patron of biomedical
researchers. The institutes plan to approve the stem cell research,
subject to guidelines that have yet to be issued.
</P>
<P>
   But institute researchers must use cells derived by privately
funded biologists, because of a law that prohibits federal money
from being used for any experiment in which a human embryo is
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In one point of departure from the institutes' approach, the
presidential commission rejects the implied ethical separation
between deriving the cells and using them. The commission, whose
chairman is Dr. Harold T. Shapiro, the president of Princeton
University, said that much further research was required on
derivation, and that it was a ``mistaken notion'' to divide
derivation and use of the cells between two distinct groups of
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   It said that both types of research should be eligible for
federal funding, and it also recommended establishing a national
review panel to oversee all human embryonic stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   A National Institutes of Health official said the agency's
guidelines would be issued within a week.

 &HT;    Bahamas feel Floyd's fury; U.S. coast is next
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Florida's day of reckoning starts this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   If predictions for the path of Hurricane Floyd hold true, the
center of the storm _ where sustained winds are circulating at 140
mph _ could come within 30 miles of the central Florida coast this
morning, as early as 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, places like Melbourne and Cape Canaveral may be
whipped by winds of up to 100 mph and a potential storm surge of 15
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas felt the full fury of Floyd on Monday, as the
hurricane easily uprooted 30-foot trees and sent blinding,
horizontal sheets of rain through deserted streets. The fierce
winds shoved cars around, snapped palm trees in half and set car
alarms screeching throughout the capital of Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive damage reports and possible injuries or fatalities
could not be easily determined because most communication to the
islands was lost.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is already known about Floyd: It's one of the
worst storms many long-time weather-watchers can remember. By the
time it becomes a mere whisper, Floyd may go down as one of the
largest and most destructive storms to hit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very dangerous storm,'' said Jeremy Pennington, a
meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center. ''We don't see
many category 4 intensity storms striking the U.S. mainland, and
certainly not one as large as this.''
</P>
<P>
   A clerk at the Avis rental car counter at Orlando International
Airport summed it best when she told a customer, ``Things that are
standing today aren't going to be standing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much is still standing in the Bahamas remains to be
seen, perhaps as early as today. Bahamian defense officials met
Tuesday to plan cleanup and relief efforts, and all defense
personnel were ordered to report to duty this morning, according to
radio reports from the islands.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not wait for the storm to hit U.S. soil to
issue a pre-emptive disaster declaration for Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The early declaration ``enables state and local governments to
get equipment and other things ... in place to begin recovery
efforts at the earliest possible moment,'' White House spokesman
Barry Toiv said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, one computer model places Floyd just offshore from
Daytona Beach by noon _ just 30 minutes before high tide _ and then
40 miles east of Jacksonville, perhaps by 9 p.m. Landfall could
come by midnight on the Georgia-South Carolina border.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of how seriously Floyd is being taken could be
found Tuesday at a deserted Disney World, which closed its gates
due to weather for the first time in its 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
   With a storm that is more than 500 miles wide, hurricane-force
winds of at least 74 mph could reach as far inland as Orlando,
which is 60 miles west of Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Commission Chairman Mel Martinez, whose community
includes Disney World and other theme parks, urged evacuation _ and
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should call for higher help,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach construction worker Rick Ross placed his faith in
plywood and nails. The 40-year-old lives just west of the Atlantic
Ocean, which crept a block closer to the Daytona Beach shore than
usual by Tuesday afternoon _ and Floyd was still 300 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   From a playground parking lot overlooking the frothing,
white-capped ocean, Ross watched the thundering surf with his black
labrador-chow-shepherd mix, Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live right up the street. Everything I own is there,'' Ross
said. ``I'm not going to leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who has lived in Daytona since 1974, stayed despite a
mandatory evacuation that began at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a couple of these,'' he said. ``We think
we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Along Central Florida's Space Coast, the streets of small beach
towns from Melbourne north to the Kennedy Space Center were empty
of all but the last stragglers, who motored through blustery winds
on their way to bridges leading to the mainland. Mandatory
evacuation orders were issued Monday, and heavy traffic choked
highways leading west toward Orlando all Monday night and into the
day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses were boarded up with plywood, along with houses
facing the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm is wobbling, and if that wobble comes our way, we
could get it full-bore,'' said Bob Scales, a Cocoa Beach resident
who fled to Orlando with his wife and two young children. Scales
left behind the home he bought two years ago, a 40-year-old block
structure that survived Hurricane Erin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the previous owners added a second roof, and it's not tied
down too well,'' he said. ``You do all you can, but if that roof
blows, it's history.''
</P>
<P>
   A big worry on the barrier island was storm surge. In Cocoa
Beach, State Road A1A skirts just along the top of the dune line,
with one row of homes perched just over the beach, most about 10 to
15 feet above the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day Tuesday, huge waves were pounding the dune, splashing
foam and sea mist onto the beachfront houses. Chronic erosion
problems have left many homeowners with little more than sea walls
to protect their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's breaking a mile out already,'' said Mike Brown, 48, who
runs a small cleaning business in Cocoa Beach and lives one block
from the ocean. ``It's looking like it wants to top the dune.''
</P>
<P>
   The phones at NASA's press center rang unanswered Tuesday, as
media spokesman had apparently evacuated, along with the 12,500
workers at the space center.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency had all four space shuttles _ worth $2 billion
each _ inside hangars, but officials worried that the buildings are
not capable of withstanding winds of more than around 125 mph.
Another worry was that four unmanned rockets were already on launch
pads and could not be moved to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Workers placed protective towers around the rockets and secured
them to their pads as best they could.
</P>
<P>
   There were also fears that rising waters from Floyd's storm
surge might inundate the facility. Most of the launch complex and
processing buildings are less than 10 feet above sea level, and
forecasters said Floyd's 155 mph winds might kick up waves of 20
feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a direct hit on us, or even a skirting hit, we could
lose a great deal,'' said Bruce Buckingham, another NASA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 miles up the coast, lifelong St. Simons Island, Ga.,
resident Jamie Gould IV said he will ride out Floyd on the
low-lying barrier island. The Gould family has seen storms: Gould's
great-great grandfather built the island's landmark lighthouse more
than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said he disobeyed a mandatory evacution order that went
into effect for Glynn County, Ga., around noon Tuesday because an
elderly neighbor with cancer could not be budged from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't leave Mr. Jimmy,'' Gould said. ''We'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, however, most of the island's 18,000 year-round
residents and more than a few late summer vacationers had crossed
the four-mile long causeway to the mainland on the first leg of
what quickly became a crowded trip west.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency for the
entire coast Tuesday. Gale-force winds were expected to begin
raking St. Simons around dawn today and winds as high as 125 miles
an hour could hit by this evening, said Ed Abel, Glynn's emergency
management director.
</P>
<P>
   Abel said barrier islands and low-lying areas could be awash and
battered by wind-driven waves if the storm surge reaches its
projected 9 to 15 feet over mean sea level. The storm's dangerous
eye wall, he said, was projected to pass within five miles of the
Georgia coast.
</P>
<P>
   During the afternoon Tuesday, most islanders packed their cars,
moved patio furniture indoors, boarded or taped windows and headed
west.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene McCabe, a computer teacher at Glynn Middle School in
Brunswick, finished her packing and played Frisbee at an island
park with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having to leave all my house plants, my yard sale
treasures and my three cats behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said she fears the hurricane will devastate the island's
magnificent live oak forest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take a good, long look at these trees,'' she said. ''I just
hope they'll be here when we come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation also was felt in South Carolina, where Charleston
Mayor Joseph Riley declared a state of emergency. Starting today,
the city will be under curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Riley spent Tuesday warning that Floyd threatens to flood
low-lying areas spared by Hugo in 1989. Hugo's eye passed over
Charleston, hurling its most punishing northeastern winds out in
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If Floyd makes landfall southwest of Charleston, near Beaufort
and Edisto Island, tidal surges of 12 to 18 feet could hit
Charleston, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's mayor for 23 years, Riley is particularly worried
that residents of Charleston's West of the Ashley and of rural
areas between Charleston and Beaufort don't appreciate the possible
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 56, said Floyd is following a course similar to a
hurricane in 1893 that killed 1,500 to 2,000 people in coastal
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real killer is the surge, the almost instaneous rush of
water into areas where people do not expect it,'' Riley said.
``They do not call this the low country for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plywood covered the tall arched windows of Charleston's City
Hall and other historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd go back to Mayberry,'' read a message scrawled on a
board over the window of the Four Corners Cafe on Broad Street.

FINANCIAL SHARES DEPRESS DOW; TECHNOLOGY BUOYS NASDAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Tuesday, as fears of rising
interest rates continued to deter investors.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was dominated by a government report on retail sales
that showed consumers were much more active buyers last month than
analysts had thought.
</P>
<P>
   The report sent shivers through the bond market, where interest
rates rose, and it further depressed prices of financial services
stocks. Insurance stocks, which are not helped when rates climb,
were weakened further by worries that the advance of Hurricane
Floyd suggested big damage claims in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago these sales figures wouldn't have caused a
ripple,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP;
Co. ``But it is very difficult to invest more when there is so much
uncertainty about the course of interest rates and the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling Tuesday was most heavily concentrated among blue-chip
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Led by J.P. Morgan, which fell 2 13/16, to 122, the Dow Jones
industrial average lost 120 points, or 1.09 percent, closing at
10,910.33. General Electric, parent company of GE Capital, lost 1
13/16, to 116 3/4. And American Express dropped 7/8, to 139 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   With financial and drug company shares weakened, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index also lost ground, falling 7.84 points, or
0.58 percent, to 1,336.29.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about an overly vigorous economy and rising rates did
not dampen demand for technology shares, however. The NASDAQ
composite index gained 23.52 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,868.29,
led by Qualcomm, which gained 17 1/8, to 170 1/2. Qualcomm, which
makes cellular phones, said it would meet or exceed fourth-quarter
profit estimates, reassuring investors, who had sent the company's
shares down sharply on Monday after it pulled out of an investor
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stalwarts also rose, further lifting the NASDAQ
average. Microsoft was up 1 3/16, to 95 1/16. Intel gained 1 7/16,
to 85 13/16. And Cisco Systems rose 1 1/4, to 71 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The ferocity of Hurricane Floyd created some anxiety about
insurers. But analysts said that by and large the industry was in
far better shape to handle a disaster than in August 1992, when
Hurricane Andrew ripped through South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowner insurers, which potentially face the biggest claims,
suffered Tuesday. Allstate dropped 1 7/16, to 32 1/8. Hartford
Financial lost 1 5/16, to 46 15/16. And St. Paul Cos. fell 1, to 31
5/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's reaction was rational,'' said Alice Schroeder of
Paine Webber. ``We do expect that the storm will result in reduced
earnings this quarter, but we just don't know by how much. However,
it is a one-time event and will not affect next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Cohen, a Merrill Lynch insurance analyst, said that ``when
Andrew hit, the level of equity capital for the industry was about
$160 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``that figure is just over $340 billion. Floyd
would have to have an absolutely enormous impact to have an effect
on the industry as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, entertainment analysts said that Walt Disney Co.'s
decision to close Disney World for the first time in 27 years
should not have a tangible financial effect. The company plans to
keep the park closed for the next two days. The Disney World
hotels, which are fully booked, remain open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be material to earnings,'' said Jill
Krutick of Salomon Smith Barney, although she said her assessment
could change if there was severe hurricane damage to the Orlando,
Fla., property.
</P>
<P>
   Investors did not seem much concerned: Disney shares, which have
been under pressure for about a year, closed at 27 15/16, down 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   And news that airlines were canceling flights in and out of
Miami did not dissuade buyers of airline stocks. AMR, the parent of
American Airlines, gained 1/4, to 55 1/8. Delta Air Lines rose 1/2,
to 50 5/8. And UAL, parent of United Airlines, was up 1 1/4, to 68
1/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather hurts the airlines, whether it is a blizzard or a
hurricane,'' said Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. ``But
they are vulnerable to everything, from weather to a change in oil
prices to a change in fares.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, Al Goldman, chief market strategist at
A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said investors remained more concerned
about a man-made threat _ higher interest rates _ than about a
possible natural disaster. ``Hurricanes come and go, and people
generally look beyond them,'' Goldman said. ``Rising interest rates
hit you right between the eyes.''

LURE OF HIGH-TECH MONEY DRAWING SOME STUDENTS AWAY FROM COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRICIA DURYEE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In hindsight, the view from Yang Lim's office in Wells
Fargo Plaza downtown is sweet.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 25, he can retire.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago, with only a couple more classes left to
finish his undergraduate degree, the future was unclear, much like
an overcast day in Seattle. His options: stay in school or land a
high technology job that would lead to his position at the Internet
start-up Go2net Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lim, who opted to seize the opportunity, is just one example of
today's youth who see a wired future, one that sometimes demands
they leap into the work world regardless of whether they're done
with school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't impatience,'' Lim said. ``I just didn't see a need
for it. I was learning more there (at an internship), than I did at
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a mix of real-life experiences, not necessarily college
courses, a handful of students are going for it just like software
guru and college dropout Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft.
Others realize they aren't geniuses and can't skip a formal
education.
</P>
<P>
   For those facing such a choice, history provides no clear-cut
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general we look for really sincerely highly motivated
people, whether they have a specialized degree or not,'' said Mark
Peterson, director of public relations at Go2net, which has
`dozens' of openings currently. Like many technology firms in the
Puget Sound area, he said they often ``find that some of the
greatest workers'' don't have a complete college education.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson doesn't know for sure how many of Go2net's 215
employees didn't complete college. But it certainly no rarity in
Seattle's halls of software.
</P>
<P>
   The trend for students to leave school will continue, according
to employers, students and educators. High technology in a lot of
ways is a new frontier and the gold rush of the '90s. Until there's
the equivalent to the lawyer's Bar exam or a lot more workers for
the number of available jobs, the difference between the
self-taught, the Ivy Leaguers and the community college grad isn't
rigidly defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``A college degree is one form of evidence that you posses a set
of skills,'' said Pete Saflund, associate director of the Northwest
Center for Emerging Technologies at Bellevue Community College.
There's a lot of ways for people to develop those skills, and
employers he said, ``look at the individual rather than strictly
the education.''
</P>
<P>
   Saflund stresses that education is still important. He said it
just usually comes in non-traditional forms, like certificates from
private institutions, vendor-specific schools, evening courses or
community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in the end, every box isn't checked off the student's list
of requirements, he said, but students are choosing courses
carefully, allowing them to get the most appropriate experiences in
the shortest amount of time possible.
</P>
<P>
   With a simplified version of a bachelor's degree, there's no
regrets, Lim says.
</P>
<P>
   He sets his own hours, lives in a penthouse with two other
friends, walks to work and takes martial arts classes in the
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   But work is hard. He's on call 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always work more than 40 hours a week, he says, which ``is
fine, some days.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment, however, is comfortable. Most of his co-workers
are young and wear anything to work, including T-shirts, cargo
pants, carpenter jeans and running shoes. He shares his office with
friends, and just around the corner is a leather couch with a
big-screen television and video games. Visitors to the domain might
start to wonder if it's really in the downtown skyscraper and not a
college dorm room or fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   A toy helicopter sits on Lim's desk, and behind him a structure
built out of business cards more resembles remnants from a party
than an icon of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost college.
</P>
<P>
   At the Microsoft campus on the other side of Lake Washington,
there's a similar scene. Among the soccer fields and basketball
courts, there are buildings full of offices only slightly bigger
than a bathroom stall. They're occupied by computer programmers and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ream, at the age of 23, is a contract worker for
Microsoft. For a year and a half, he's worked an average of 40
hours a week there. He first got a taste of the relaxed
circumstances while interning as a sophomore and junior at Garfield
High School in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of worrying about going to class or making
basketball practice on time, his work week is undefined. In the
winter he skis all morning and works late into the day. His tasks
are fairly easy, so he saves energy for his personal ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, Ream opted to get a job because he just didn't
see the point in going to school much longer. Much like a NFL or
NBA recruit, a degree from Clarmont-McKenna in Southern California
would have only taken him more time. His first year at Microsoft,
he made $100,000 instead of sinking into college debt by about
$6,000. This year he expects to make $140,000 and save himself
another $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first year (at Clarmont), I really wanted to leave,
but somehow my grandmother talked me into'' the second year, Ream
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things he did, as a non-student, was pay off
the debt he'd already accumulated _ a dream many graduated students
don't achieve for years. Ream's education, he says, doesn't come
from college but from being a childhood computer user and by
reading everything from textbooks and Internet Web sites to
magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are available in other forms,'' he said.
``Everything I knew about computers I taught myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ream is self-taught because he doesn't think colleges are
teaching people the right stuff, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America Virginia, says that can be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Universities ``are going to teach reason and not care what the
hot language is,'' said Miller, who added that he is an advocate of
students staying in school.
</P>
<P>
   At Go2Net, Lim and his degree-toting co-workers make the same
amount. Because of stock options, compensation depends more on when
workers joined the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the office is full of opinions. Walter Korman, who sits next
to Lim, actually regrets completing college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known then what I know now, I would have never finished
college,'' he said, adding that because of his decision he was
about the 60th person to join Go2net, instead of maybe the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   What's even more frustrating for Korman, he says, is that
nothing he learned in college is benefiting him now.
</P>
<P>
   Educators dispute that. There's much more to college than a
degree or the promises of a job, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is not a set of skills,'' said Ed Lazowska, chairman
of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of
Washington. College teaches students ``about learning and how to
think,'' Lazowska says.
</P>
<P>
   And his school's dropout rate is close to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost have nobody leave,'' he said. ``Microsoft and others
appreciate the value of a degree.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Lim's office mates agrees. Tony Istvan, a computer
programmer at Go2net, said it took every one of his classes from
his undergraduate and two master's degrees to get him where he is
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wish we could have been here at day one, so that we all
could be rich and retire,'' Istvan said, but ``I needed the
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazowska said the fact that there is flexibility in the
information technology sector is what makes the business so great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the American dream that a worker is regarded on the basis
of what they can do rather than what's on their paper
credentials,'' he said.

ELECTRONIC PRICING WOULD SAVE MONEY, CONSUMER OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' top consumer official says the accuracy
of grocery prices would improve if the Legislature allowed
supermarkets to substitute electronic shelf labels for the
labor-intensive process of stamping prices on individual store
items.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket industry officials said the recommendation by
consumer affairs director Daniel A. Grabauskas should give a major
boost to their nearly decade-long campaign to eliminate food-store
item pricing, but a key lawmaker predicted changes would probably
be more evolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Peter J. Larkin of Pittsfield, a Democrat who
heads the Legislature's Commerce and Labor Committee, said the
panel sees benefits from item pricing. He said a bill will probably
emerge from committee soon that would exempt far more products from
the item-pricing law if a supermarket installs electronic shelf
labels.
</P>
<P>
   Grabauskas said his recommendation was not easy to make and that
he waffled during the course of the state's year-long study of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Larkin and the committee's cochairman, Senator
Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston, Grabauskas said the current law
has been effective but also cumbersome and fraught with human
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price accuracy is consumers' No. 1 concern,'' he said in an
interview. ``I think this addresses that No. 1 concern in a way
that really is better than the current system.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, some of whom participated in the study, said
Tuesday they disagreed with Grabauskas's conclusions and would work
to block passage of any law weakening the item-pricing statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers potentially will be losing an important tool to help
them shop more wisely,'' said consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky, who
wrote the current law in 1987 when he worked for the state's
consumer affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is one of five states in the nation with a food
store item-pricing law. Separate regulations promulgated close to
30 years ago by the attorney general's office require item pricing
by other Massachusetts retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the day the food store item-pricing law passed,
supermarket officials have grumbled about the difficulty of trying
to make sure that prices on items, on shelf tags, and at checkout
scanners all match. The officials have said employees who stamp
prices on store items could serve customers better working
elsewhere in the store.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic shelf tags, which cost a supermarket about $125,000
to install, theoretically would eliminate most pricing errors. The
systems allow a supermarket to input prices tied to product bar
codes into a store computer and the computer posts the same price
at the shelf and checkout scanner. The only way a pricing error can
occur is if a price is inputted incorrectly or listed incorrectly
in the store's advertising circular.
</P>
<P>
   The state's study found 100 percent price accuracy for the items
where electronic shelf tags were used. ``This backs up what we've
been saying all along,'' said Christopher Flynn, president of the
Massachusetts Food Association, which represents supermarkets in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Dworsky said most supermarkets already achieve 98 percent
price accuracy, so electronic shelf tags represent ``a solution to
a problem that doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   A state survey of 556 shoppers found that 47 percent would
approve a change to electronic shelf labels at the expense of
individual price stickers, 27 percent opposed it, 22 percent had no
preference, and 4 percent were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Dworsky and Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director at the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, said research has
shown that consumers prefer to check prices by looking at stickers
on grocery items rather than hunting for shelf tags with
hard-to-read product abbreviations.
</P>
<P>
   The stickers also make it easy to double-check price accuracy at
the checkout and after leaving the store. They also help consumers
add up the cost of what they have put in their shopping basket and
help build consciousness about what items cost.
</P>
<P>
   Grabauskas, who takes the top job at the Registry of Motor
Vehicles on Monday, urged the Legislature to exempt supermarkets
that install electronic shelf tags from the item-pricing law as
long as a number of safeguards are included. For example, he said
the Legislature should require supermarkets to provide grease
pencils so consumers can mark prices on purchases and make
available aisle scanners enabling consumers to check the price of
an item anywhere in the store.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter Tuesday, Grabauskas also said the supermarkets had
agreed to verify that no employees would lose their jobs because of
electronic shelf tags and to have the state double the penalty for
pricing errors to $200 per violation with a maximum of $5,000 per
inspection.

A COMEDY INSTITUTION JUST KEEPS ON GOING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-Five years used to be considered a long time, the events
of the quarter-century before taking on the sepia tinge of ancient
history.
</P>
<P>
   Children who attended the New York World's Fair in 1964 heard
from their parents about the ``old'' World's Fair, with its
glimpses of all kinds of futuristic inventions, even a thing called
television. That fair took place before Pearl Harbor, even before
the invasion of Poland. It was in 1939, exactly 25 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in the entertainment world. Twenty-five years
before comics like Jack Benny and Bob Hope were stars of 1950s
television, they were in vaudeville. And 25 years before James Dean
defined a certain kind of hip American culture in ``Rebel Without a
Cause,'' the movies had just stopped being silent. Silent!
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in popular culture can be hip for 25 years. The culture
turns over far too many times. Icons become relics; objects of
obsession become objects of nostalgia. So what are we to make of
``Saturday Night Live''? The one-time groundbreaking,
precedent-setting, establishment-tweaking comedy sketch show begins
a decidedly well-established 25th season on NBC next week, to be
celebrated by a two-and-a-half-hour prime-time special next Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Longevity is certainly not in itself a claim on pop cultural
relevance. Other shows have been on longer but are in no danger of
being labeled hip (e.g., ``The Price Is Right''). But, apparently
in defiance of both time and show business convention, ``SNL''
begins a 25th year still the most pervasive influence on the art of
comedy in contemporary culture.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, look no further than the summer movie grosses. The
dominant stars? Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, Steve Martin and Eddie
Murphy, a collection of comics with roots deep in ``SNL'' soil. In
the wings is what is expected to be one of the year's biggest
movies, ``Man in the Moon,'' starring Jim Carrey as the comic Andy
Kaufman. It contains numerous scenes recreating the early days of
``SNL,'' including Kaufman's memorable ``Mighty Mouse'' performance
on the show's premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Two more movies based on ``SNL'' characters are in the works:
``Superstar,'' featuring the Catholic school girl Mary Katherine
Gallagher (played by Molly Shannon), opens on Oct. 8, and ``The
Ladies' Man'' (Tim Meadows) was filmed over the summer in Canada.
Other ``SNL'' alumni are firmly established stars of movie comedy:
Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Billy Crystal. Former
``SNL'' performers like David Spade, Norm Macdonald, Jane Curtin,
Dennis Miller, Martin Short, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Chris Rock and
Conan O'Brien (he was actually an ``SNL'' writer) are all over
television. You can even get into a New York cab and hear Al
Franken's voice urging you to buckle up.
</P>
<P>
   There is a continuum at work, a comedy continuum that has
consistently defied the sell-by date that eventually undoes even
the hugest television hits.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this continuum is the creator, first producer,
one-time defector, but forever the man most responsible for the
phenomenon that has been ``Saturday Night Live'': Lorne Michaels.
Michaels still occupies the office in New York City's Rockefeller
Center, nine floors above Studio 8H in what is now the GE Building,
that he first moved into in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members and writers have no trouble identifying Michaels'
central role in the making of this epic. ``Lorne is the
godfather,'' said Chris Rock. ``Like Paulie in `Goodfellas.' You
have to give him respect.'' Which, he said, he is happy to do. ``I
have never been broke a day in my life since I met Lorne
Michaels,'' Rock said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smigel, one of the show's chief writers in the 1980s,
said: ``Lorne has done the most amazing job. His eye for comedic
actors is just the best anyone has ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels himself, famously nonlinear, has no specific
explanations for how the show has persevered, becoming in the
process a kind of elite university. Indeed, Rock called the show
``the Harvard of comedy.'' It certainly has distinguished alumni,
honored dead and some of the toughest entrance criteria imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said: ``I was given an opportunity or I took an
opportunity to create a place where a lot of people got to work and
where it was safe to work. The value system here was always about
the work and the writing and performing.'' But there are clearly
some reasons this show, more than any other, has survived the
challenges of time and network programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topicality is part of it,'' Michaels said. ``Having a
different host every week is part of it.'' A bigger part of the
explanation, perhaps, is what Michaels called ``its complete
unpredictability.''
</P>
<P>
   One evidence of that is the way the entire cast has turned over
several times. Or as Smigel put it, ``Ed Sullivan isn't coming out
there every week introducing the regulars, Harvey Korman and Tim
Conway.'' Instead, a movie star, a political figure, a sports star,
even an occasional television executive turns up and throws himself
or herself into a series of hastily written comedy sketches,
performed by a frequently recast repertory group of comedians. Oh,
and it's all live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear all these other shows talking about their special
episodes: they're going to do `E.R.' live,'' said Jimmy Fallon, one
of the show's fast-rising new stars. ``We do it every week live!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smigel said ``SNL'' had defied the standard exhaustion that
swallows up all other hit shows because ``it's not a show; it's a
format.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All those times it's been written off as `Saturday Night
Dead,' people miss the point,'' he added. ``The format doesn't get
tired. It can be revived.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the history of the show is one of parabolas made up of
surges of popularity and derision. The same is true of almost every
individual show: peaks of hilarity between valleys of near-dead
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say that `uneven' should be inscribed on my
tombstone,'' Michaels said. ``Uneven is how the show has been
described consistently. As if 90 minutes of blank page to
on-the-air is going to be seamlessly funny.'' Still, the show has
clearly gone through a number of specific eras, a few of them rocky
enough that contemplating a life span of 25 years would have been
the biggest joke of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The first era remains the most famous, of course, remembered,
like most cultural breakthoughs, with enormous affection and very
selectively. Certainly the show burst onto the television scene
with a creativity and energy that were unlike anything the medium
had previously seen.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of spectacular prescience, Dick Ebersol, the young NBC
executive in charge of late-night programming, plucked Michaels to
guide the new show. He had an interesting, if not overwhelming,
resume, having produced specials for Lily Tomlin and written for
``Laugh-In.'' He had also been a performer in a comedy team in his
native Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But what mostly qualified Michaels for the job was his hunger to
make a show for an audience like him, one that had never been
served anything truly original that spoke to their taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a moment when I doubted it would be a hit,''
Michaels said. ``If I could just get it on the air. We were the
last period where there was no cable alternative. We were defining
late night as the alternative. And because it was live, when the
audience saw it and the network saw it, it was already formed. We
were from the audience and we were doing a show that we wanted to
watch. We had a unity of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   The show in the early years wasn't just funny; it was
subversive, almost dangerous. Michael O'Donoghue, one of the
best-known early writers, ``thought Dan Aykroyd was like rough
trade; he was afraid of him,'' said Michaels. The subversiveness
was symbolized by Chevy Chase's imitation of President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got so used to Chevy not making any attempt to look or sound
like this guy,'' Michaels said. ``That to me seemed so hip and
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars of that first era _ Aykroyd, Chase, John Belushi,
Gilda Radner, Bill Murray _ grew so big so fast that it almost
doomed the show. When Michaels and the last of the original cast
members left in 1980 (and he acknowledged that they all wanted
``SNL'' to die right then and there), NBC turned the show over to
Jean Doumanian, a producer now closely associated with Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Her one, turbulent year is remembered mostly as a disaster,
although as Smigel pointed out, ``She brought on Eddie Murphy and
he's probably the biggest star ever to emerge from the show.''
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, NBC turned to Ebersol, the former late-night
executive, who took over as producer in 1981. He shrewdly built a
new edition of the show, principally around Murphy and Joe Piscopo.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years some significant talent slipped through the show
because they never found their own voice. Many were women, who
suffered from the image of the show as, in Piscopo's words, ``a
boy's club.'' That male-centric view of the show held until
recently; Smigel called the three current women _ Molly Shannon,
Cheri Oteri and Ana Gasteyer _ ``surely the three best women the
show has ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the talented women who filtered through the show
making little impression were Joan Cusack, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and
Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   Piscopo said Ebersol made another shrewd decision when he
arrived in 1980; he moved away from the subversiveness. ``Dick
would go through the magazines like People and see who was hot,''
Piscopo said. ``Then he'd say we should have Robert Urich on. Or
Robert Blake, who was great. Dick mainstreamed the show. And it
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last year as producer, having lost Murphy and Piscopo,
Ebersol came up with another effective idea. He stocked the cast
with established talents like Billy Crystal, Martin Short and
Christopher Guest. The result was, in Michaels' estimation, ``a
really great year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ebersol was done. Brandon Tartikoff, then running NBC's
programming (and a one-time host of the show himself), told
Michaels he was going to cancel the show unless Michaels took it
over _ but as an overseer, not the hands-on producer. He agreed,
bringing in an all-new cast that included Jon Lovitz, Dennis
Miller, Anthony Michael Hall and Robert Downey Jr. But the season
as a whole ``just didn't gel,'' as Michaels put it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season Tartikoff again said he was ready to
pull the plug. But ``I fell in love with doing it again,'' said
Michaels. He couldn't let the show die. ``I told Brandon I thought
I could correct it. He said OK, but I couldn't delegate. What a
difference a year made!''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels kept half the cast, including Miller, who had taken
over the ``Weekend Update'' segment and made it the biggest hit
since Chevy Chase had left, and Lovitz, whose liar character had
become so big that it was referenced by politicians. As additions,
Michaels brought in Jan Hooks, Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman. The
show was reborn.
</P>
<P>
   The upward arc only soared further when Michaels added Mike
Myers, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler and David Spade. This time he
remade the show on the fly, adjusting as some of the more
experienced players left.
</P>
<P>
   Now Michaels saw a generational shift. The new performers were
younger and they started pulling in younger viewers. That was ideal
for NBC until the network started to think the show wasn't funny
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A new barrage of criticism in the press hit the show. In 1995
NBC executives decided Sandler and Spade especially weren't funny,
Michaels said. ``Don Ohlmeyer wanted me just to go back to
basics,'' he said, referring to the president of NBC's West Coast
division at the time. ``Dynamite the thing and start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels was reluctant. ``I thought Adam was really, really
funny,'' he said. ``And David Spade. The network thought quite the
reverse. Every note was: `Fire David Spade.' He, of course, wound
up saving their season on `Just Shoot Me.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to get rid of people,'' Michaels continued. ``Adam
Sandler was let go, and he had two years left on his contract.
Chris Farley had one year. And Chris Rock was in that cast.''
Michaels went back to the drawing board and introduced more than
half a dozen new cast members the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Few shows could survive the potential humiliation of dismissing
a talent like Sandler, who went on to become the hottest comedy
film star in America. ``SNL'' somehow turned this into another
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The new cast, in the estimation of one of its longest-tenured
staff members, is ``full of outstanding talent, but Lorne doesn't
have the writing talent he needs to go with them.'' To add to the
challenge, Michaels said he would be replacing much of the cast for
the season that begins in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One change that has clearly come over the show as it has aged _
matured might be the appropriate word _ is that it has lost some of
the danger that characterized the early years. Michaels himself has
gone mainstream enough to have been thrilled earlier this year when
he had a star engraved with his name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the old subversive spirit is gone. Last season,
without any advance publicity, ``SNL'' brought on Monica Lewinsky
as a special guest. And that wasn't even as far as Michaels had
wanted to go in stirring up sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, is there any way to get O.J.? I just wanted to get
the two of them together in a photo because I thought they could
say to the audience, `We just took the last four years of your
lives.'''
</P>
<P>
   He never got as far as asking O.J. Simpson if he wanted to make
the splash. But every former guest host has been invited to return
for next Sunday's anniversary special, and, Michaels noted, Simpson
did serve as a guest host once.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the anniversary special, Michaels is gearing up for
another season, the wall board in his office crowded with index
cards of different colors, indicating confirmed hosts and musical
guests (green) and possibles (blue.) Jerry Seinfeld is green and
ready to be the host of the season-opening show on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels spends his days much the same as he always has,
supervising writers, preparing shows. Young performers and writers
still hound him everywhere. ``Saturday Night Live'' is, maybe more
than ever, Mount Everest for young comedy talent.
</P>
<P>
   Piscopo said, ``I will always wear being on the show as a badge
of honor.'' Not every performer became a star, he said. Some, like
him, are just working actors today. Some have all but disappeared
from show business. (They're all invited back for the special,
however.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock had similar feelings, though with a twist. ``I
watched the show as a kid and always dreamed of being the black guy
on `Saturday Night Live,''' he said. ``I was so happy when Lorne
told me I was on the show. I haven't been as happy since.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels has his own context for what the show has become, and
it connects to the issue of longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was confirmed for me when I saw `Shakespeare in
Love,' the idea of a writer having a set of actors who did all his
stuff,'' he said. ``You just know Shakespeare had a big guy that
the audience liked. So after he was Falstaff in `Henry IV,'
suddenly he's in `Merry Wives of Windsor,' and you realize he had
to be held over.''
</P>
<P>
   Having once left, only to return to see his creation through to
the new millennium, Michaels now has no intention of ever walking
away from ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the synergy of the thing at its essence, that's the thing
I most love about it,'' Michaels said. ``You have designers,
musicians, directors, writers, all together in this act of putting
on a show. And it all just hurtles toward 11:30. I've said it often
before: It doesn't go on because it's ready. It goes on because
it's 11:30. It is exhilarating. And once you've had that high, it's
sort of hard to live without it.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ Scheduled to go on sale next spring, the Chrysler PT
Cruiser is not quite a sport utility vehicle and not really a
minivan.
</P>
<P>
   It does not look like a conventional car, either, although it
uses much the same underbody and even a few of the same parts as
the Dodge Neon, which is definitely a car.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at DaimlerChrysler AG have decided that as far as
federal regulations are concerned, their lightweight, fuel-sipping
vehicle is a truck and not a car. ``We certainly are intending to
have this classified as a light truck,'' said Jan Zverina, a
DaimlerChrysler spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has chosen to call the Cruiser a truck because
of breaks it can get under the complex system of separate federal
fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the Cruiser as a light truck stands to improve the
average fuel economy of the entire fleet of DaimlerChrysler's light
trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups.
The more Cruisers that DaimlerChrysler sells, the more big,
high-profit sport utilities and pickups it can sell while still
meeting the gas mileage averages required by law.
</P>
<P>
   After heavy lobbying by the auto industry, the Senate is
expected on Wednesday to extend a four-year-old ban that prevents
the Clinton administration from studying or changing these
two-decade-old fuel economy regulations. Meanwhile, automakers are
preparing to introduce as many as two dozen vehicles with car-based
designs in the coming years and to ask that many of them to be
certified as light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Two car-based sport utility vehicles, the Toyota RAV-4 and the
Honda CR-V, have been on the market in limited numbers for two
years and are categorized as light trucks. BMW AG will start
selling its car-based sport utility vehicle, the X5, in December
and has asked that it be certified as a light truck. Next spring,
Ford Motor Co. will put on sale the Escape, a small sport utility
vehicle that is based on the Ford Contour compact sedan. And the
Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Saturn and Chevrolet divisions of General
Motors Corp. are all developing models that will combine car and
light truck features, although GM has not said when they will go on
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives say that Americans want automobiles that combine
the rugged appearance of a light truck with the handling and easy
access of a car. The new models are not being created for
fuel-economy reasons, said Lawrence Burns, GM's vice president for
planning, research and development. ``That is not the driving force
behind what we're doing here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that with gasoline prices low, consumers care very
little about fuel economy. Yet as buyers have switched from cars to
light trucks, fuel economy has declined, increasing the nation's
dependence on imported oil and increasing emissions of gases that
many scientists have linked to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Each automaker is required to produce a fleet of cars with an
average gas mileage of at least 27.5 miles a gallon. But
manufacturers are permitted to sell their fleets of light trucks
with average fuel efficiencies of just 20.7 miles a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The rules that govern whether automobiles are classified as cars
or light trucks have remained virtually unchanged since they were
first written in 1976, and they are riddled with loopholes. Current
and former regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, the federal agency that administers the
fuel-economy laws, say the agency has never challenged an
automaker's decision on whether to register an automobile as a car
or as a light truck.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995 and began
trying to curb what they called regulatory excesses, one of the
first things they did was prohibit the Clinton administration from
spending any money even to study increases in fuel-economy
standards or changes in the fuel-economy rules. The House has
already voted this year to extend the prohibition for another year
as part of the federal budget; the Senate is scheduled to vote
Wednesday on a nonbinding resolution that would urge Senate budget
negotiators to remove the provision during conferences with House
leaders. That vote is expected to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have been lobbying hard for passage of the
Senate resolution, but the auto industry has fought back with
full-page newspaper advertisements and radio spots in nine states
and appears likely to prevail. The administration has sat on the
sidelines during the current debate.
</P>
<P>
   Even some auto executives acknowledge the shortcomings of the
current system. BMW, for example, has sold only cars until now, and
its executives had been very critical of the breaks that are
available for automakers who sell vehicles that qualify as light
trucks. But BMW changed that position when it developed the X5.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Doolan, BMW's president for North American operations
until he was hired by Ford a few weeks ago, said in an interview
early this year that he had decided to submit the X5 to regulators
as a truck primarily because of the preferential treatment afforded
light trucks under fuel-economy rules. ``That's the major reason:
Why should we pay punitive penalties that Mercedes and Lexus do
not'' on their sport utility vehicles? he said. ``It's the rules
that are wrong, not the way we play the game.''

RULING IN MOB IMMUNITY CASE EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Nearly a year after a parade of witnesses unmasked an
unholy alliance between the FBI and two of the region's most
notorious gangsters, a federal judge is expected to rule Wednesday
on whether the FBI promised to protect its prized informants from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In an eagerly awaited decision that could dismiss _ or at least
dilute _ criminal charges against organized crime figures, US
District Judge Mark L. Wolf will resolve the issue at the core of
exhaustive hearings held in his courtroom last year: Did the FBI
promise fugitive South Boston crime boss James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger
and his sidekick, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, immunity in
exchange for information about their Mafia rivals?
</P>
<P>
   If Wolf accepts Flemmi's claim that the FBI sanctioned his
criminal activities, then he could dismiss the January 1995 federal
racketeering indictment that charged Bulger and Flemmi with
colluding with the Mafia to control bookmaking, loan-sharking and
other rackets throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, reputed New England Mafia boss Francis ``Cadillac
Frank'' Salemme, reputed mob soldier Robert DeLuca and John
Martorano have been jailed since 1995 while awaiting trial. Bulger
remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Martorano agreed to plead guilty to the charges
and testify against Bulger and Flemmi if the case ever goes to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's voluminous ruling is expected to be a scathing indictment
of the FBI's handling of longtime informants Bulger and Flemmi, who
wined and dined with their FBI handlers while their crimes went
ignored and unpunished for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we proved is the FBI had a relationship with
Bulger and Flemmi that amounted essentially to them supporting an
organized criminal enterprise,'' said Attorney Anthony Cardinale,
who represents Salemme, 66, of Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Martin G. Weinberg, who represented Martorano until he
began cooperating with federal authorities, said: ``I think the
hearings demonstrated that for decades the FBI as an institution
ignored and violated the guidelines which governed their
relationship with high level, top-echelon informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the FBI, rather than the Justice Department,
became the decision-maker as to when their informants should and
should not be prosecuted,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have asked Wolf to dismiss the indictment on the
grounds that the racketeering enterprise alleged in the indictment
doesn't exist because Bulger and Flemmi actually were working for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John Mitchell, cocounsel for Salemme, said: ``Under
federal law you can't conspire with someone who doesn't have
bonafide criminal intent. If the guy is an undercover cop or an
informant, you can't conspire with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense also has asked Wolf to suppress FBI tapes of various
Mafia meetings _ including a 1989 Mob induction ceremony _ because
of alleged prosecutorial misconduct in obtaining the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, 65, who became an FBI informant in 1965, followed by
Bulger a decade later, testified that he and Bulger were given
permission by former FBI supervisor John Morris to commit any crime
short of murder in exchange for leaking information about the
activities of local Mafiosi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I was performing a service for the US government in
my role as an informant,'' Flemmi testified.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying under a grant of immunity, Morris denied authorizing
Flemmi to commit crimes, but stunned many former colleagues by
revealing that he pocketed $7,000 in payoffs from Bulger and Flemmi
between 1982 and 1988. He also admitted warning the pair that the
FBI had tapped the phone of a Roxbury bookmaker who worked for
them.
</P>
<P>
   In some of his most explosive testimony, Morris said he told
Bulger and Flemmi's handler, FBI Agent John Connolly, that Brian
Halloran, an associate of the pair, was cooperating against them
and had implicated them in several murders _ fully expecting that
Connolly would warn Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   When Halloran was murdered, Morris said he suspected Bulger and
Flemmi had killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also claimed that Connolly acted as the middleman, twice
delivering $1,000 from Bulger and Flemmi to Morris. One payment, he
said, was stuffed in the bottom of a case of wine delivered to him
at the Boston FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly refused to testify at the hearings, citing his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination. But in numerous
interviews, he vehemently denied Morris's claims that he delivered
money to Morris or warned Bulger and Flemmi about Halloran's
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   As for their deal, Connolly said Bulger and Flemmi ``could
operate a gambling and loan-sharking syndicate with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors declined to comment Tuesday but have denied
that any valid immunity agreement exists. They said Bulger and
Flemmi were protected by a few rogue agents and not by the FBI as
an institution.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence during the hearings that Bulger and Flemmi
got away with plenty.
</P>
<P>
   A South Boston realtor testified that he was extorted at
gunpoint by Bulger, who threatened to put him in a body bag.
Although the realtor was interviewed twice by FBI agents, there is
nothing in the FBI files about the case and apparently Bulger was
never questioned about it.
</P>
<P>
   A former agent testified that Connolly confided to him in 1983
that Bulger and Flemmi had extorted as much as $90,000 from a
Charlestown drug dealer who stored marijuana in South Boston
without their permission. Another agent testified that he never
pursued allegations that Bulger was shaking down drug dealers after
Connolly told him the ``street talk'' wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like other officials, former FBI supervisor James Ring
testified he knew Bulger and Flemmi were involved in crimes while
working as informants, but never gave them the FBI's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `If you're doing anything, you're doing it on
your own,' '' Ring testified.

 DETROIT: the game.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most crossover vehicles ride high off the ground and have
all-wheel drive. Those two features qualify them as ``off road''
vehicles, which the fuel-economy rules classify as light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But few of these crossover vehicles are ever likely to be driven
up a rocky mountain trail. ``Every crossover vehicle is being
called a sport utility even if they can't go up a wet driveway,''
said Jamie Jameson, the vice president for sales and marketing at
DaimlerChrysler, which takes pride in the off-road capacities of
its Jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not make such claims for the PT Cruiser, which
has front-wheel drive instead of all-wheel drive. The Cruiser is
being classified as a light truck through an obscure provision of
the fuel-economy rules often applied to minivans. The provision
says that vehicles can be so classified if they have removable back
seats and a flat load floor.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Felrice, a top regulator at the NHTSA for two decades and
now a top lobbyist in DaimlerChrysler's Washington office, said the
provision was written in the 1970s to cover about 12,000 cargo vans
a year. Without the provision, those vans might have been
classified as cars. But since the 1970s, the auto industry has used
the provision to classify the entire minivan market, or 1.2 million
a vehicles a year, as light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser is no gas-guzzler. It may even get high enough
mileage to match the mandated average for cars. Indeed, Zverina,
the DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said the vehicle's combined city and
highway gas mileage might reach 30: the Environmental Protection
Agency will issue an official figure when the vehicle goes on sale.
</P>
<P>
   By adding the Cruiser to its light truck offerings,
DaimlerChrysler will improve the overall average fuel economy for
its fleet. This will allow the company to sell more large sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which are the most profitable
models, with margins of up to $15,000, but which also tend to have
thirsty V8 engines.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser ``helps us because on the light truck side, there's
very strong demand for V8s,'' Zverina said.
</P>
<P>
   The average fuel economy of new light trucks appeared to improve
slightly in the 1998 model year, the most recent data available.
Automakers acknowledge that this is largely because of anomalies in
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and DaimlerChrysler, for example, began equipping many of
their minivans and pickups to run on either gasoline or ethanol to
take advantage of federal fuel-economy credits for dual-fuel
vehicles _ even though fewer than 100 service stations in the
country actually sell ethanol. GM redesigned its four-wheel-drive
Suburbans to make them too large to be counted as light trucks;
they ceased to be included in any gas mileage averages at all.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether they are classified as cars or light
trucks, the new, car-based vehicles have a number of advantages.
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the head of the NHTSA, says they might be
safer than current sport utility vehicles because they will tend to
be lower and less likely to roll over. The new vehicles are also
less likely than sport utility vehicles to kill other motorists in
crashes because they have lighter underbodies that are not as
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   The new automobiles get 20 to 30 miles a gallon, a level several
miles a gallon less than the small and mid-size cars on which they
are based, but far better gas mileage than most current sport
utility vehicles. Overall, the effect of the new vehicles on the
nation's fuel efficiency depends on what kind of vehicles they will
replace. If they attract customers who might otherwise buy big
sport utility vehicles, then the net effect would probably be to
improve fuel efficiency slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But most customers for crossover vehicles seem likely to switch
from cars, hurting the nation's overall fuel efficiency. Except for
a few, low-volume luxury models, like the BMW X5 and the Lexus RX
300, most new crossover vehicles will sell for less than $20,000
and be fairly small. Three-quarters of the sport utility vehicles
now sold cost $26,000 and up, including all of the big gas
guzzlers.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the giant vehicles, despite their price tags, has
put DaimlerChrysler, GM and Ford all perilously close to falling
short of the light truck fuel-economy standard. For each tenth of a
mile per gallon that an automaker falls short of the standard, it
must pay $5.50 for each vehicle sold. This can add up to tens of
millions of dollars for a big automaker.

TEST SCORE ERROR SENT MORE THAN 2,000 TO SUMMER SCHOOL BY MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chancellor Rudy Crew revealed Tuesday that
significant errors were made in scoring the high-stakes test given
last spring to determine who would be assigned to summer school and
that 2,000 to 3,000 children had been compelled to attend by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Crew blamed the mistake on a miscalculation by the test
publisher, CTB/McGraw Hill, and the company confirmed Tuesday that
similar scoring errors had occurred on tests given in other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's confusion over tests scores was just the latest in
a series of embarrassments for the chancellor's plan to end
automatic promotion of failing students. In mid-August, Crew
proudly announced that 64.2 percent of the 35,000 summer school
students had passed and would go on to the next grade. But on Sept.
1, he had to revise that figure significantly, saying that 60
percent _ or 21,000 _ would actually be held back, largely because
14,000 students either did not show up in summer school or did not
take the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Education and testing experts said Tuesday that the disarray in
New York City was a lesson in how high-stakes testing across the
country might encourage educators to make snap judgments about
students that turn out to be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with it is who ends up getting hurt in this
process: the kids,'' said Seymour C. Fliegel, a senior fellow at
the Center for Educational Innovation, a New York City research
institute.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the miscalculation, some parents were forced to
give up summer vacations _ with immigrants sometimes canceling
expensive airline tickets for homeland visits _ so that their
children could go to classes. Jill Chaifetz, executive director of
Advocates for Children, an educational advocacy and legal services
group, said that many parents had been surprised to hear that their
children were failing, and now, she said, it might turn out that
their surprise was justified.
</P>
<P>
   She said the revelation of the flawed scoring would only
compound the distress of parents over what she criticized as the
hastiness of the summer school program.
</P>
<P>
   It is now possible, she said, that some children passed the test
last spring, were sent to summer school by mistake, and then failed
the test at the end of summer, forcing them to repeat the grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many parents I've talked to whose summer
has been in complete disarray,'' Ms. Chaifetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for Children has challenged the Board of Education's
summer school program in court, arguing that it violates the
board's own policy of looking at factors besides test scores _ like
homework and the judgment of teachers _ in determining promotion.
Oral arguments in the case took place Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake acknowledged Tuesday came not in calculating the raw
scores of the children _ that is, how many answers they got right
or wrong _ but in the percentile score, which compares them with a
national sample of children across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Steven H. Weiss, a spokesman for CTB/McGraw Hill, said that in
determining the percentile rank, CTB/McGraw Hill had given similar
tests to 150,000 children across the country. The mistake, he said,
came when some questions used in the New York test did not match
those used in the national sample. The wrong questions were used,
he said, for about 3 percent of the students.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss acknowledged Tuesday that the company was responsible for
the scoring errors. He refused to say what other school districts
had received flawed test results, saying that he did not have their
permission to release that information.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Crew, said the test company
had told New York City that nine other jurisdictions were affected
by the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said that New York City's director of testing, Robert
Tobias, had been the first person to suspect that there was an
error in the reading and math tests, which were given last spring,
and had urged CTB/McGraw Hill to investigate. Ms. Crowe said that
Tobias's suspicions were aroused by the precipitous drop in test
scores from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tests were new and scores typically drop on new
tests, Tobias believed, she said, that the drop was abnormally
sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crowe said that it had taken until Tuesday for the testing
company to confirm the problem, and that New York City officials
were still trying to figure out the extent of the scoring error.
Weiss said the delay occurred because the company had to review
tens of thousands of test forms.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he was ``distressed'' by the problems, Crew called
for an independent audit of the quality control procedures used by
CTB/McGraw Hill. Ms. Crowe said the school system was considering
suing the test company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay an enormous amount of money to a company to provide
accurate test results, which we use to make high-stakes decisions,
and they should be accurate,'' Ms. Crowe said. In 1998, the board
spent more than $2 million in contracts with the testing company,
and in 1999, it is authorized to spend $3.3 million, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said that the underlying integrity of its tests had not
been questioned, and that the company believed that tests were one
of the most reliable instruments available to measure student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monty Neill, executive director of the National Center for Fair
and Open Testing, an advocacy group in Cambridge, Mass., said that
similar scoring problems had occurred at least once before on a
test designed by the same company and used in Indiana. Neill said
that in 1996-97, the superintendent of schools in Fort Wayne
noticed a large drop in percentile scores despite an overall rise
in the number of correctly answered questions on the test.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said Tuesday that he could not confirm or deny that case.
But he suggested that Neill, as a frequent critic of testing
practices, was unreliable. ``Given his well-known position against
testing, it's not surprising he would choose to capitalize on this
situation to advance his own cause,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some testing experts said that New York City school officials
had violated a widely accepted tenet in education by basing their
decisions to promote children on the results of just one test.
``Whenever we focus on one factor alone, we risk making major
mistakes like this one,'' said Jay P. Heubert, a professor at
Teachers College at Columbia University who has studied high-stakes
tests.
</P>

<P>
   The reading and math tests, given last spring to 300,000 New
York City students in grades 3, 5, 6 and 7, showed that 44.6
percent of students were reading at grade level. The board said
that after equating, a process to make the test comparable to the
previous year's test, reading scores across the grades were stable,
while math scores dropped 10 percentage points. Scores in the
third-grade, which Crew has made a focus of attention, dropped more
than any in other grade in both reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   It was the drop in third-grade scores, despite the resources
devoted to that grade, that aroused Tobias' suspicions, Ms. Crowe
said.

US WARNS OF POTENTIAL FOREIGN `Y2K' PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attempting to consolidate information about the worldwide impact
of the pending Y2K computer bug, the US State Department and
several foreign governments warned of potential problems in
developing countries such as power outages and shipping problems.
</P>
<P>
   While the reports contained little new information, they served
as a reminder of the interconnectedness of many economic sectors.
For example, Venezuela, which exports a great deal of oil to the
United States, was judged to have a ``moderate risk'' of
disruptions in its electrical-power supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The reports also raised objections from some nations that were
cited as problem areas, on grounds that the information in them was
outdated or the perceived threats were overblown.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a spokesman for Pakistan disputed the US State
Department warning of a ``high risk'' of disruptions for electric
power and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect that any major disruption is going to take
place,'' the spokesman said. ``We are late starters but in order to
cope with the sitaution a high-powered and technically manned
national task force has been entrusted with the tak of dealing with
any problem that might arise.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also was critical of India, with its report
asserting that parts of the utility and shipping sectors there
``have been slow to address the Y2K issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Y2K'' problem relates to the practice of many
older computer programs using just two digits to keep track of the
year. Left unfixed, these systems might grow confused by the date
of Jan. 1, 2000 and shut down. That could lead to delivery problems
in computer-controlled systems from air-traffic control networks to
water-supply pipes.
</P>
<P>
   To address the risk, governments and industries worldwide are
spending billions of dollars worldwide to upgrade or fix their
systems. But there seems to be no consensus on the global outlook
except that few observers expect severe problems in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, developing countries accustomed to water and
power supply disruptions might take less notice of problems related
to the date change, said Leon Kappelman, a professor at the
University of North Texas who advises the United Nations on Y2K
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't apply our expectations to their realities,'' he said.
Kappelman and others also said the reports seemed to reinforce the
criticism that governments have provided relatively little hard
data to pinpoint problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department declined to issue warnings against
traveling to certain countries specifically because of worries
related to Y2K, saying no single country's problems raised
sufficient concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office also issued a Y2K report Tuesday but
took a different approach in some cases. In the case of Ukraine,
for example, Britain cited concerns about water and power systems
and wrote: ``We advise against all holiday and other nonessential
travel to the Ukraine over the New Year period and early January
2000 until the situation becomes clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries disputed the findings of the various reports. In
an e-mail to a popular Y2K discussion group on the Internet, a
member of Uganda's national Y2K task force challenged the British
Government's descriptions and said the report was based on
six-month-old data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect an apology,'' wrote Elisha Wasukira, the Ugandan
official. Officials at the British Embassy in Washington said they
couldn't immediately respond.

TREASURY YIELDS BUOYED BY RETAILERS' DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A report Tuesday of stronger-than-expected retail
sales in August helped send bond yields higher, stoking investors'
fears of further rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year government bond fell 31/32, to 100
3/32, as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, climbed
to 6.12 percent from 6.05 percent Monday, the highest level in
almost two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a market
research and analysis firm in San Francisco, called the numbers
quite robust. ``It appears that consumers have yet to show any
inclination of spending less,'' she said. ``Just what that means in
terms of Fed policy is not quite clear. After all, we've seen
strong consumption and a low inflation environment coexist for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say that market participants are not
concerned, especially since the Fed has already increased
short-term interest rates twice this year.
</P>
<P>
   Investor jitters generally make the market vulnerable to
speculation and idle talk. Tuesday there was plenty of talk giving
traders the excuses they needed to sell securities.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds fell after a government report showed that retail sales in
August posted their biggest gain in six months, a strong 1.2
percent, or 0.7 percent excluding auto sales. Even though the
numbers were broad-based, traders were a little reluctant to chase
prices sharply lower ahead of Wednesday's closely watched inflation
report, the August Consumer Price Index. Some economists expect a
gain of 0.5 percent after a gain of 0.7 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard some talk that insurance companies were sellers of
paper in anticipation of huge claims from Hurricane Floyd,'' Ms.
Rupert said. ``Also, we hear that the Bank of Japan might be in the
market buying sizable amounts of notes. There was good buying in
the 10-year maturity, tied to the unwinding hedges surrounding
Freddie Mac's $6 billion offering priced today.''
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac, formerly known as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., the nation's second largest buyer of home mortgages behind
Fannie Mae, priced its global sale of 10-year reference Tuesday
through underwriters led by Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.,
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The notes yielded 6.729 percent, or about 79.5 basis points more
than a comparable Treasury security. A basis point is one-hundredth
of a percentage point. The yield of a 10-year Treasury note, a
benchmark for many corporate borrowers, rose to 5.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed weakness in the dollar against the Japanese yen also
worsened negative market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury auctioned $10 billion of 52-week bills Tuesday with
what analysts called decent results given the rate had increased to
5 percent.

 &HT;    Bahamas feel Floyd's fury; U.S. coast is next
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS to Tuesday instead of Monday in 4th graf.)
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Florida's day of reckoning starts this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   If predictions for the path of Hurricane Floyd hold true, the
center of the storm _ where sustained winds are circulating at 140
mph _ could come within 30 miles of the central Florida coast this
morning, as early as 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, places like Melbourne and Cape Canaveral may be
whipped by winds of up to 100 mph and a potential storm surge of 15
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas felt the full fury of Floyd on Tuesday, as the
hurricane easily uprooted 30-foot trees and sent blinding,
horizontal sheets of rain through deserted streets. The fierce
winds shoved cars around, snapped palm trees in half and set car
alarms screeching throughout the capital of Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive damage reports and possible injuries or fatalities
could not be easily determined because most communication to the
islands was lost.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is already known about Floyd: It's one of the
worst storms many long-time weather-watchers can remember. By the
time it becomes a mere whisper, Floyd may go down as one of the
largest and most destructive storms to hit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very dangerous storm,'' said Jeremy Pennington, a
meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center. ''We don't see
many category 4 intensity storms striking the U.S. mainland, and
certainly not one as large as this.''
</P>
<P>
   A clerk at the Avis rental car counter at Orlando International
Airport summed it best when she told a customer, ``Things that are
standing today aren't going to be standing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much is still standing in the Bahamas remains to be
seen, perhaps as early as today. Bahamian defense officials met
Tuesday to plan cleanup and relief efforts, and all defense
personnel were ordered to report to duty this morning, according to
radio reports from the islands.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not wait for the storm to hit U.S. soil to
issue a preemptive disaster declaration for Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The early declaration ``enables state and local governments to
get equipment and other things ... in place to begin recovery
efforts at the earliest possible moment,'' White House spokesman
Barry Toiv said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, one computer model places Floyd just offshore from
Daytona Beach by noon _ just 30 minutes before high tide _ and then
40 miles east of Jacksonville, perhaps by 9 p.m. Landfall could
come by midnight on the Georgia-South Carolina border.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of how seriously Floyd is being taken could be
found Tuesday at a deserted Disney World, which closed its gates
due to weather for the first time in its 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
   With a storm that is more than 500 miles wide, hurricane-force
winds of at least 74 mph could reach as far inland as Orlando,
which is 60 miles west of Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Commission Chairman Mel Martinez, whose community
includes Disney World and other theme parks, urged evacuation _ and
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should call for higher help,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach construction worker Rick Ross placed his faith in
plywood and nails. The 40-year-old lives just west of the Atlantic
Ocean, which crept a block closer to the Daytona Beach shore than
usual by Tuesday afternoon _ and Floyd was still 300 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   From a playground parking lot overlooking the frothing,
white-capped ocean, Ross watched the thundering surf with his black
labrador-chow-shepherd mix, Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live right up the street. Everything I own is there,'' Ross
said. ``I'm not going to leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who has lived in Daytona since 1974, stayed despite a
mandatory evacuation that began at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a couple of these,'' he said. ``We think
we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Along Central Florida's Space Coast, the streets of small beach
towns from Melbourne north to the Kennedy Space Center were empty
of all but the last stragglers, who motored through blustery winds
on their way to bridges leading to the mainland. Mandatory
evacuation orders were issued Monday, and heavy traffic choked
highways leading west toward Orlando all Monday night and into the
day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses were boarded up with plywood, along with houses
facing the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm is wobbling, and if that wobble comes our way, we
could get it full-bore,'' said Bob Scales, a Cocoa Beach resident
who fled to Orlando with his wife and two young children. Scales
left behind the home he bought two years ago, a 40-year-old block
structure that survived Hurricane Erin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the previous owners added a second roof, and it's not tied
down too well,'' he said. ``You do all you can, but if that roof
blows, it's history.''
</P>
<P>
   A big worry on the barrier island was storm surge. In Cocoa
Beach, State Road A1A skirts just along the top of the dune line,
with one row of homes perched just over the beach, most about 10 to
15 feet above the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day Tuesday, huge waves were pounding the dune, splashing
foam and sea mist onto the beachfront houses. Chronic erosion
problems have left many homeowners with little more than sea walls
to protect their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's breaking a mile out already,'' said Mike Brown, 48, who
runs a small cleaning business in Cocoa Beach and lives one block
from the ocean. ``It's looking like it wants to top the dune.''
</P>
<P>
   The phones at NASA's press center rang unanswered Tuesday, as
media spokesman had apparently evacuated, along with the 12,500
workers at the space center.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency had all four space shuttles _ worth $2 billion
each _ inside hangars, but officials worried that the buildings are
not capable of withstanding winds of more than around 125 mph.
Another worry was that four unmanned rockets were already on launch
pads and could not be moved to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Workers placed protective towers around the rockets and secured
them to their pads as best they could.
</P>
<P>
   There were also fears that rising waters from Floyd's storm
surge might inundate the facility. Most of the launch complex and
processing buildings are less than 10 feet above sea level, and
forecasters said Floyd's 155 mph winds might kick up waves of 20
feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a direct hit on us, or even a skirting hit, we could
lose a great deal,'' said Bruce Buckingham, another NASA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 miles up the coast, lifelong St. Simons Island, Ga.,
resident Jamie Gould IV said he will ride out Floyd on the
low-lying barrier island. The Gould family has seen storms: Gould's
great-great grandfather built the island's landmark lighthouse more
than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said he disobeyed a mandatory evacuation order that went
into effect for Glynn County, Ga., around noon Tuesday because an
elderly neighbor with cancer could not be budged from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't leave Mr. Jimmy,'' Gould said. ''We'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, however, most of the island's 18,000 year-round
residents and more than a few late summer vacationers had crossed
the four-mile long causeway to the mainland on the first leg of
what quickly became a crowded trip west.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency for the
entire coast Tuesday. Gale-force winds were expected to begin
raking St. Simons around dawn today and winds as high as 125 miles
an hour could hit by this evening, said Ed Abel, Glynn's emergency
management director.
</P>
<P>
   Abel said barrier islands and low-lying areas could be awash and
battered by wind-driven waves if the storm surge reaches its
projected 9 to 15 feet over mean sea level. The storm's dangerous
eye wall, he said, was projected to pass within five miles of the
Georgia coast.
</P>
<P>
   During the afternoon Tuesday, most islanders packed their cars,
moved patio furniture indoors, boarded or taped windows and headed
west.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene McCabe, a computer teacher at Glynn Middle School in
Brunswick, finished her packing and played Frisbee at an island
park with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having to leave all my house plants, my yard sale
treasures and my three cats behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said she fears the hurricane will devastate the island's
magnificent live oak forest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take a good, long look at these trees,'' she said. ''I just
hope they'll be here when we come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation also was felt in South Carolina, where Charleston
Mayor Joseph Riley declared a state of emergency. Starting today,
the city will be under curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Riley spent Tuesday warning that Floyd threatens to flood
low-lying areas spared by Hugo in 1989. Hugo's eye passed over
Charleston, hurling its most punishing northeastern winds out in
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If Floyd makes landfall southwest of Charleston, near Beaufort
and Edisto Island, tidal surges of 12 to 18 feet could hit
Charleston, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's mayor for 23 years, Riley is particularly worried
that some residents don't appreciate the possible danger.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 56, said Floyd is following a course similar to a
hurricane in 1893 that killed 1,500 to 2,000 people in coastal
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real killer is the surge, the almost instantaneous rush of
water into areas where people do not expect it,'' Riley said.
``They do not call this the low country for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plywood covered the tall arched windows of Charleston's City
Hall and other historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd go back to Mayberry,'' read a message scrawled on a
board over the window of the Four Corners Cafe on Broad Street.

POLICE DEPT. ROUTINELY DROPS CASES OF OFFICER MISCONDUCT, REPORT
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hundreds of New York City police officers found to
have engaged in misconduct by an independent review board escaped
punishment when their cases were summarily dismissed by the Police
Department without any further investigation, according to a review
of disciplinary files by the city's Public Advocate's office.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based upon an examination of police misconduct
files that the public advocate, Mark Green, obtained after suing
the city. The report accuses the Police Department of routinely
dropping civilian complaint cases _ citing a lack of evidence _
without ever interviewing victims or witnesses, or making any other
efforts to examine the strength of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the report said, the department failed to
discipline officers accused of hitting and pushing two Brooklyn
high school athletes during track practice even though the
students' account was supported by medical evidence and
corroborated by their coach. In another, the report said, the
department dismissed charges against an officer accused of beating
a motorist during a traffic stop in Manhattan even though the
motorist's account was corroborated by a witness and the review
board found the officers' versions of the incident ``materially
inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the case files comes as federal prosecutors are
wrapping up their inquiry into whether the department effectively
encouraged brutality by failing to discipline officers who engaged
in misconduct. Some of the cases that the Public Advocate's office
examined are the same types that are under review by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   When a civilian files a complaint about police misconduct, it is
usually reviewed by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an
independent body that can recommend discipline in complaints it
substantiates. But the ultimate decision to discipline officers is
made by police officials, to whom the review board forwards its
cases.
</P>
<P>
   For years, critics have questioned the Police Department's
commitment to disciplining misconduct because only about half of
the officers against whom civilian complaints are substantiated are
ever punished.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-page report by Green is the first case-by-case analysis
of what happens to complaints substantiated by the review board
once they are turned over to police officials. It is based on a
review of the files involving 420 officers whose cases were decided
by police officials between 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said on Tuesday that they had not seen Green's
report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, but
said they believed it was a biased document that ignored both the
valid reasons why so many cases are dismissed and dramatic
improvements in the disciplinary process since the time period
Green studied.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the officials said, during 1995, one of the years
Green's office examined, the review board did not turn over nearly
a quarter of the cases until after the statute of limitations for
disciplining officers had already expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a typical Mark Green report that uses information that
is favorable to the agenda he is pursuing,'' said Marilyn Mode, a
department spokeswoman, ``and that fails to look at the global
picture and the progress that Commissioner (Howard) Safir has made
to fix the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green said his analysis had found many examples of cases
that were turned over in a timely manner but were tossed out by
police officials who seemed to seize on procedural technicalities
or slight inconsistencies in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they dismissing cases that are substantiated by the
CCRB when they neither do their own independent investigation or
provide any subsequent explanation of what was wrong?'' Green asked
in an interview. ``Based on our case-by-case research so far, they
appear more interested in protecting rather than prosecuting
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's office described its report as an interim analysis and
said it will be issuing a final report in several months after it
has finished reviewing the other 600 civilian complaints that the
review board substantiated between 1994 and 1997.

ANIMALS NERVOUS ABOUT FLOYD, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The tortoises dug holes. The lethal coral snakes,
usually shy, climbed their cages. The rhino iguana paced nervously.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly a day before Hurricane Floyd moved close to the
Florida coast, and the animals knew something was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Before a hurricane, human beings aren't the only ones exhibiting
unusual behavior. Animals, too, sense the falling barometric
pressure. Some mate. Some squawk. Some hunker down, their survival
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   And in Joe Wasilewski's living room Tuesday, even as Floyd
veered north, giving Miami just a glancing blow, a menagerie of
exotic proportions let him know they weren't so happy about the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski, 47, the owner of Natural Selection Productions who
has helped produced animal behavior films for National Geographic
and the Disney Channel among others, moved more than 70 animals
inside his home to protect them, and protect others.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the midst of dog and cat crates that contained Nile
crocodiles, American alligators, monitor lizards, spur-thighed
tortoises, frilled dragon lizards, a kinkajou and a coatimundi,
Wasilewski said that watching the animals prior to a big storm is
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that coral snake,'' he said, as the red, yellow and
black-banded snake slithered around the cage. ``It never moves and
look how agitated it is now.'' The snake's venom, drop for drop, is
the most poisonous in North America.
</P>
<P>
   One of Wasilewski's mentors was the late Cecil Clemons of
Palmdale, Fla., who owned Florida's largest crocodile and alligator
farm. Clemons told him that snakes swarmed on to roads before a
hurricane. ``He said I could go on the road and fill up my pickup
truck with snakes,'' said Wasilewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might try that later on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday was taken up mostly with getting the animals inside.
One of the reasons was to protect others. During Hurricane Andrew
in 1992, hundreds of monkeys and other nonnative animals got loose
after the storm destroyed their cages.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski spent several weeks then tracking some of the more
dangerous animals. One was a male African lion. ``Some eccentric
guy had it. We didn't believe the reports at first. This woman who
had panthers, mountain lions, said she saw it. One of her females
went in heat and she heard the roar of a lion outside the house. I
went and I saw the track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he said, ``we're not kidding around here.''
</P>
<P>
   His house, located in the Redlands section of unincorporated
Dade County, southwest of Miami, gradually took on the feeling of a
zoo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski lifted up a lid of a crate and eight alligator babies
tried to break out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey, get in there,'' he said, pushing their heads back
inside.
</P>
<P>
   An African bullfrog puffed out his chest nearby. A chameleon
stood perfectly still.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski was running around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this storm passes us by,'' he said. Later, Floyd would
move north, sparing South Florida. But Wasilewski won't be moving
the animals out just yet. Another hurricane, Gert, was way out in
Atlantic, looking as if it could be headed his way. The animals
would let him know.

WACO PROSECUTOR IN TEXAS REMOVES HIS OFFICE FROM CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The top federal prosecutor in Texas responsible for
handling all legal matters related to the FBI tear-gas assault near
Waco, Texas, has asked for and received permission from the Justice
Department to be recused from the case, according to legal papers
disclosed Tuesday in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The recusal request by the U. S. attorney in San Antonio, James
Blagg, also applies to other prosecutors in the Western District of
Texas who have any involvement in the case. That would include Bill
Johnston, a prosecutor who had recently complained to Attorney
General Janet Reno about what he said was a possible coverup
involving the attack on the Branch Davidian compound in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The court papers filed Tuesday, called a notice of recusal, do
not explain why all personnel for the U. S. attorneys' office for
the Western District of Texas, including Johnston, an outspoken
critic of his superiors, were removed from the case.
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials said Tuesday that Blagg sought the
recusal because he, along with other prosecutors, would be
witnesses in the investigation by former Sen. John Danforth of the
tear-gas assault. Reno has also recused herself from any matters
concerning Waco. The recusal was approved by Eric Holder, the
deputy attorney general and the top Justice Department official
responsible for Waco after Reno's recusal.
</P>
<P>
   The agency transferred all Waco-related matters to J. Michael
Bradford, the U. S. attorney in Beaumont, Texas, who said his goal
will be to ``foster public confidence.'' The main pending legal
action is a wrongful death lawsuit filed by families of Branch
Davidian members who died near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the action was not intended to silence
Johnston. But he and his superiors had tangled in recent months
over the handling of evidence recovered from the cult compound
after the tear-gassing and the deadly fire that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, in a letter made public by the Texas Rangers on
Monday, wrote to Reno last month warning that her aides were
misleading her about the federal agents' role in the assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept from
you _ and quite possibly are being kept from you even now _ by
components of the department,'' he wrote in an Aug. 30 letter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Johnston had angered Justice Department officials in
Washington when he allowed Michael McNulty, a documentary filmmaker
who had long challenged the government's account of the assault, to
examine physical evidence from the compound where about 80 people
died.
</P>
<P>
   It was McNulty who first recognized that a tear-gas cannister
retrieved from the scene was a combustible round, a finding that
seemed to contradict Reno's longstanding statement that nothing the
government did at Waco could have ignited the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the flammable tear-gas round has created an
outcry in Congress and has forced Reno to appoint Danforth to
re-examine how the fire was started and whether any FBI or Justice
Department officials lied or concealed evidence.

GLOBE TO PUBLISH EARLY SUNDAY EDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seeking to increase circulation and accommodate the
changing lifestyles of its readers, The Boston Globe will begin
publishing an early edition of the Boston Sunday Globe on
Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 23, the early edition of the paper will be
available on Saturdays at about 2,000 local retail locations
throughout Greater Boston. The early edition will be delivered to
stores between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Globe subscribers will continue to receive home delivery of the
latest edition of the Sunday paper on Sunday morning, the Globe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant undertaking, one which a team from many
departments within the paper has been working on for months,'' said
Globe publisher Richard H. Gilman Tuesday. ``Our goal is to
increase Sunday circulation by giving consumers more time on the
weekend to spend with the Sunday Globe. It's another way we're
trying to meet the changing needs of our readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said the early edition will contain much of the features
and news from the regular Sunday edition and the color and
supplemental sections such as the Help Wanted, Real Estate, TV
Week, Parade magazine and advertising supplements, allowing readers
to get a look ahead at Sunday retail sales and classified
advertising listings, such as jobs and homes for sale. The main
news, metro news, and sports sections will be updated for the
Sunday final edition.
</P>
<P>
   Initial plans for the early Sunday edition call for a press run
of nearly 40,000 copies, the Globe said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most major metropolitan newspapers, the Globe has
experienced declining Sunday circulation. For the six months ended
in March, the Globe's Sunday circulation was audited at 730,420, a
2.4 percent drop from the comparable six-month period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in other big cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles,
and New York, have had success publishing early Sunday editions,
the Globe said.

 &HT;    Floyd gives researchers opportunity to test equipment
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Instruments on the roofs of three Palm
Beach County homes measured Floyd's assault for researchers who
were installing them even as the first strong winds were coming
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the state's Coastal Monitoring Program, homes in
Delray Beach, Lantana, Riviera Beach and Jupiter received free
upgrades for maximum storm protection; in exchange, homeowners let
Clemson University researchers plant sensors on the homes when a
storm approaches. The Clemson team got to all but the Riviera Beach
home Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, teams from Texas Tech University were at two Central
Florida sites Tuesday, and Oklahoma University's
``Doppler-on-Wheels'' mobile weather unit was setting up along the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   The various research teams gather valuable information that
governments, the construction industry, insurers and others use to
determine how to build homes better and how to set up the right
kind of evacuation, preparation, relief and recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The state has set up a string of homes about every 12 to 15
miles from Homestead to Jupiter. Instruments placed on the homes
measure important data about the storm, such as wind speed and
direction, rainfall and atmospheric pressure, but also how the
homes perform, Traci Buzbee, planning manager for the monitoring
program, said from Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   She said the equipment will help determine the interaction
between the weather and a building's shape, interior area and
outside exposure. The homes were also fitted with a backup power
supply and exterior video cameras; both stay year-round.
</P>
<P>
   And homeowners got free structural reinforcements and window
coverings in exchange for their participation.
</P>
<P>
   Two crews from Texas Tech University set up in Titusville and
Daytona Beach, although the Dayton Beach crew planned to move
shortly, Tim Doggett, a professor of atmospheric sciences, said
from Lubbock, Texas. The crews will raise two 30-foot towers into
the storms, Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   And three teams in sedans fitted with instruments on their roofs
will drive through Central Florida, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Doppler on Wheels'' unit of Oklahoma University was driven
to Florida Monday night and researchers flew in Tuesday; the team
was expected to set up somewhere near the Central Florida coast,
research scientist Scott Richardson said from Norman, Okla. The
team will also set up 40-foot-tall towers to measure the winds and
other data.
</P>
<P>
   Doppler radar is a powerful tool that sends penlight beams that
can pinpoint wind movement and other weather factors. It usually
sits in a fixed place, such as the roof of a weather station.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile Doppler radars are mounted on the backs of two
trucks, which are driven right into storms, tornadoes and even
hurricanes. The truck's bed holds a jumble of sensors and
generators and a three-person cabin about the size of a minivan's
interior. The equipment adds six tons to a four-ton truck;
hydraulic feet brace the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd marks the first opportunity for the team since Hurricane
Georges last year, Richardson said.

 &HT;    Prosecutor removed from Branch Davidian investigation
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Federal prosecutor Bill Johnston of Waco and his
boss were removed Tuesday from any dealings with Branch Davidian
matters by Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   Those duties were assigned to J. Michael Bradford of Beaumont,
U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation was given for the recusals of Johnston and James
W. Blagg, United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas,
in documents filed in Waco's federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have a comment on the substance of the recusal,''
said Johnston, an assistant United States attorney, ``but I am
going to continue to do what I think is the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Blagg released a statement noting that his office, based in San
Antonio, advised law enforcement officials before and after the
1993 raid on Mount Carmel, home of the Branch Davidians and their
leader, David Koresh. It also handled the subsequent criminal trial
of 11 Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their roles in matters that may be under
investigation, my office has been recused from all related matters
to avoid any potential or appearance of a conflict of interest,''
the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mike Caddell of Houston, who represents several
Davidians in the upcoming wrongful death lawsuit against the
government, speculated the recusals may relate to concerns that
Blagg, Johnston and others will be targeted in an investigation
into whether they acted improperly five years ago by not telling
defense attorneys for the Davidians that incendiary tear gas was
used at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the recusals shouldn't have an impact on the
lawsuit, set for trial on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the U.S. Attorney's office was not handling anything
related to the civil case,'' Caddell said. ``They had already been
taken out of the loop by the Justice Department. Everything we're
doing, arranging for depositions and document production, is being
handled by the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Tinker, an Austin attorney who defended Davidian Brad
Branch, said the recusal of Johnston ``should have happened a long
time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are documents in the possession of lawyers in the case
where Bill Johnston is saying, 'Let's be careful interviewing these
ATF agents so we do not create any Brady material,''' Tinker said.
``That's material that could prove helpful to the defendants. Now
if he is coming around claiming that he is trying to reveal the
truth, that is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, though, said he had mixed emotions about Johnston's
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions in saying don't create Brady material are not
consistent with a claim to be seeking the truth,'' Caddell said.
``But he gave Mike McNulty access to an evidence locker, which
ended up benefitting us. The Justice Department had been
stonewalling us for six years. I thought Johnston was straight with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Johnston let McNulty, a film producer, view
the Davidian evidence, leading to a series of new allegations
against the government and another Congressional inquiry into what
happened at Mount Carmel. More recently, Johnston wrote a memo to
Attorney General Janet Reno warning that her own department was
possibly misleading her about federal agents' roles in the Branch
Davidian siege.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnston also acknowledged he may have sat in on a meeting
five years ago where members of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team
admitted using incendiary tear gas at Mount Carmel, firing at a
bunker away from the Davidians' residence. The admission was not
made known to defense attorneys. Johnston said he didn't understand
the terminology used during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford will now handle all Branch Davidian related matters,
including any dealings with appeals related to the 1994 criminal
convictions of seven Davidians; the wrongful death lawsuit next
month; pending or future requests for information under the Freedom
of Information Act; and inquiries into what happened at Mount
Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton appointed Bradford as United States
Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas in 1994. Before that,
Bradford was a Jefferson County district judge and a United States
magistrate. He graduated from the University of Texas Law School in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bradford successfully prosecuted Dallas City
Council Member Paul Fielding for mail fraud and conspiracy.
Fielding was accused, among other things, of using minority-owned
front companies to obtain contracts under affirmative action
programs.
</P>
<P>
   His first duty will be to get up to speed on the Branch Davidian
case, Bradford said in a released statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first priority is to familiarize ourselves with the issues
at hand so that we may fully cooperate with all other entities
looking into this matter,'' Bradford said. ``Our main objective is
to assist in providing truthful information in order to foster
public confidence.''

HOUSE NEARS NEW CURB ON SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a debate filled with implications for the 2000
campaign, the House Tuesday moved toward a vote on overhauling the
campaign finance system and banning unlimited contributions of soft
money in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill passes the House, it still faces an uphill fight in
the Senate, which last year killed a similar measure. But even if
the bill does not become law, it could still have an impact on the
presidential race. The chief Senate sponsor, Republican Senator
John McCain of Arizona, plans to make the matter a central part of
his primary race, and it is likely to become a major issue in the
fall campaign, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is also notable for what is would not do. For
example, there is no cap on aggregate contributions, which if
adopted could keep Texas Governor George W. Bush from continuing
his unprecedented fund-raising pace or could block Steve Forbes
from using his fortune to finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There would also be no change on the $1,000-per-person
contribution limit and no move toward the kind of public financing
that some advocates say is the only way to level the political
playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a first step,'' said Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Lowell Democrat who cosponsored the House bill with
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican. ``We've
got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by banning soft money, the bill seeks to end one of the
most controversial practices in American politics: the contribution
of unlimited and unregulated funds from individuals and
corporations to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican and Democratic
parties used soft money to run millions of dollars' worth of
commercials that had an enormous influence on the election,
prompting a congressional investigation of foreign contributions
that proved an embarrassment to the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the House defeated several Republican-sponsored
amendments, including one that would raise the limit on individual
contributions from $1,000 to $3,000 and another that would classify
any ad mentioning a candidate's name or voting record as a campaign
ad.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in arguing for higher limits on campaign
contributions, pointed out that Governor Christine Todd Whitman of
New Jersey recently decided not to run for the US Senate partly
because of difficulties in raising the necessary funds. But several
Democrats retorted that George W. Bush didn't seem to have any
difficulty raising an estimated $50 million for his presidential
campaign, despite the same limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-finance measure, similar to one approved by the
House last year and filibustered in the Senate, was supported by
the vast majority of Democrats. But the measure could not have been
passed without the backing of a sizable number of Republicans, led
by Shays, who were willing to buck the party leadership in the
GOP-controlled chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that a soft-money ban could be helpful to
the Democratic Party, which has less soft money at its disposal
than the GOP. By August, the Republican National Committee had
raised $27 million for the 2000 campaign, compared to $19 million
raised by Democrats. By Election Day, the parties could collect a
total of more than $300 million and perhaps as much as $500 million
in soft money, according to some projections.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a ban on soft money, Republicans would still maintain
a large advantage in raising hard money, Meehan said. Indeed, some
Democrats objected to the measure Tuesday because raising soft
money is the only way they can counter the GOP's hard-money
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The debate yesteday was filled with side issues, especially the
question of whether antiabortion groups would be harmed by the
measure. The National Right to Life group, for example, opposed the
bill Tuesday, saying that it would inhibit free speech by requiring
disclosure of donor names.
</P>
<P>
   Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House
Republican Conference, said in a letter to his colleagues that the
Shays-Meehan bill would rewrite the Constitution. Watts provided a
mock revision: ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the
freedom of speech unless that speech supports or opposes a cause,
or is made anonymously, or occurs in September or October of an
even-numbered year, or is intended to educate the public about
candidates' voting records.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the bill's key provisions are:
</P>
<P>
   --Soft money. Under the current system, individuals can give
unlimited amounts of unregulated soft money to political parties,
with contributions sometimes exceeding $100,000. Such donations
would no longer be allowed, and candidates also could no longer
take soft money from state parties. Individuals would be allowed to
give no more than $30,000 in regulated hard money to parties and
candidates, up from the current $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to limit use of soft money that has already been
raised, the bill also requires that television and radio
commercials that are broadcast within 60 days of an election and
include the name of a candidate must be paid for with hard money.
Similar restrictions would apply to commercials that include an
``unambiguous'' effort to elect or defeat a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   --Disclosure of independent spending. Many special-interest
groups spend millions of dollars on advertisements that seek to
boost or defeat a candidate. While such ads would still be allowed,
there would be some limitations on contributions, and the names of
donors would have to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   --Labor money. Unions, which are among the largest soft-money
contributors to the Democratic Party, could no longer give such
funds. In addition, unions would have to disclose the names of
those who contributed money used in labor-sponsored advertising
campaigns. Democrats said this would offset the loss of soft money,
but some Republicans complained that the influence of union funds
would be greater than ever.

COMMENTARY: TRUST, BUT VERIFY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After W. dropped his handkerchief in June, he sat on the porch
by the ocean in Kennebunkport, Maine. I asked him if it was scary
to run for president, when he knew so little about foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be moments when situations, incidents will flare
up,'' he replied. ``It's important for the president to think
globally.'' He said the crucial thing was how a chief executive
dealt with Russia and China, and whether he knew which
foreign-policy advisers to trust and which to ``kiss off,'' as he
put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, picking a regional hot spot out of a hat,
``if the East Timorians decide to revolt, I'm sure I'll have a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the murderous state of the Indonesian territory
with that W. touch of flipness and swagger we have come to know. He
was so unfamiliar with the tensions there that he called the
citizens East Timorians rather than East Timorese. His implicit
point was that there was still plenty of time for lessons from his
foreign policy tutors, Poppy's crowd _ George Shultz, Condoleezza
Rice and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   But we're in a fast, mercurial universe. One minute we're
scarcely paying attention to some roiling conflict on the other
side of the world, and the next we're debating whether to send
American troops over there, wherever there is, and whatever it is
they're killing each other about.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months after talking about that Timor statement,
the Texas governor had to actually put it out. Or more likely, his
tutors did.
</P>
<P>
   W. sensed the irony of this. After visiting a Bedford, N.H.,
elementary school last week _ where he drolly told the kids, ``Some
people say that I proved that if you get a C average, you can end
up being successful in life'' _ he answered reporters' questions
about his position on East Timor. Before and after he spoke the
words ``East Timorese,'' he paused pregnantly.
</P>
<P>
   Then the candidate who had recently learned the correct term
himself asked the press, with a sly smile, ``Everybody knew that?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a weird reversal of his father's '92 campaign. Bush senior
fumbled because he seemed too obsessed with foreign policy at a
time when the economy was tanking. ``In my life,'' W. told me dryly
that day in Maine, ``I never tried to rush the natural progression
of growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the issue that gnaws. Has he grown up? Can we trust
him? He wants us to believe that his gut instincts and moral
framework can carry him over the lacunae in his knowledge of
geopolitics. He wants us to believe that his transformation from
rowdy late bloomer to mature statesman is complete and
non-reversible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people around the world would find it rather
frightening to envision a president of the United States, at the
moment of probably America's greatest power in history, who seems
completely uninformed on the state of the world,'' says Alan
Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia University. ``It's one
thing to rely on the advice of aides because you have respect for
their judgment. It's another to do it because you don't know enough
to distinguish good advice from bad advice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Beschloss, another historian, says that, post-Cold
War, ``we have a lot of local and regional threats that are
probably indecipherable even to a presidential candidate who has
had a lot of history in foreign policy. So we might be better with
a president who is a quick study, who chooses good people, and who
knows how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that Ronald Reagan had no foreign affairs experience
when he was elected, yet he had a lot to do with ending the Cold
War. (Although he did know what he thought of pinkos.)
</P>
<P>
   And, Beschloss says, we might have avoided Vietnam if Lyndon
Johnson had been as secure on foreign policy as he was on domestic
policy. He might not have been so easily swayed by misguided
Kennedy holdovers like Robert McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton did a lot of reading about the history of the
Balkan conflict. But he still miscalculated the determination of
Slobodan Milosevic when he developed the plan to bomb Serbia. And
even if we did not worry about Clinton's grasp of the issues, we
had to worry about whether there was any post-Monica ``Wag the
Dog'' syndrome involved in his bombing decisions about Iraq and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s father greatly admired Henry Stimson, the diplomat and
soldier, whose credo was: ``The only way to make a man trustworthy
is to trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true _ occasionally.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ It is the talk of college football. The infamous moment that
cost Baylor a victory over Nevada-Las Vegas has been replayed
countless times on ESPN, CNN, Fox and every other major sports
television outlet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sports talk-show hosts on radio stations across America are
blasting Baylor coach Kevin Steele, and callers are making jokes
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baylor needs a Catholic quarterback,'' they say. ``He would
know how to kneel.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the flaming arrows Steele knew would come
because of Saturday night's final play. Baylor, leading 24-21 with
eight seconds left, elected to run the ball up the middle from the
UNLV eight. Darrell Bush fumbled at the one, and UNLV cornerback
Kevin Thomas picked up the ball in the end zone and returned it the
length of the field for the most improbable victory imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's agony will go down as one of the most incredible
moments in college football history, but it's a moment Steele and
his players would like to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rehash this over and over,'' Steele said.
``It happened, and it's over with. I had a press conference to talk
about it, we met as a team and talked about it, and the coaching
staff met and talked about it. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, the criticism doesn't affect me. The only thing that
bothers me is these players need a win, and they deserve to win.
There are only so many opportunities in a season. If you spend your
time looking back, before you know it, it's over. This is a lesson
learned, and we have to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably no football player in the country is suffering more
these days than Bush, who had the ball knocked out of his hands
when he was trying to reach the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to hold on to the ball, so I really felt like I
let the team down,'' Bush said. ``But there's nothing I can do
about it now. I just have to look forward to Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponent for the Bears this weekend is a Sooners team that
won 49-0 over Indiana State on Saturday in the debut of coach Bob
Stoops. Like everyone else in college football, Stoops has seen
replays of Baylor's shocking loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes fluky or freaky things can happen,'' he said. ``I'm
sure other people will take notice of what happened and be a little
more cautious of what they do. It was unfortunate for Baylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele has taken a lot of heat for not having quarterback
Jermaine Alfred take a knee to run out the clock, but other Big 12
coaches have come to Steele's defense. Texas coach Mack Brown said
Steele is taking too much criticism for opting to run the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole lot of coaches around the country would have handed
the ball off and not even thought about it,'' Brown said. ``If you
don't win, people are going to criticize you. If you win, nobody
says anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green had his team run two dive
plays in the final seconds Sunday while leading the Atlanta Falcons
17-14. The Vikings won, and no one said a word about why Green
didn't have Randall Cunningham take a knee.
</P>
<P>
   When the Baylor game ended Saturday, UNLV coach John Robinson
had a message for Steele as they shook hands. ``I don't know what
to say,'' Robinson said, ``except you are not the only one this has
happened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson knows from experience. While coaching the Los Angeles
Rams, Robinson had a decision to make in a 24-24 game against Green
Bay with 30 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had a first-and-10 at their 20. Instead of having the
quarterback take a knee, run out the clock and try to win in
overtime, Robinson called for a handoff to Eric Dickerson, who
fumbled. The Packers recovered, took a knee on first down to run
time off the clock, then kicked a field goal on the last play to
win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing will happen to all of us sooner or later,
somewhere down the line,'' said Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes.
``People don't understand why you don't go for the score if you're
on the lip of the cup, but that's why. But every once in a while,
you have to go by your gut feel. It's just part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising finish to the UNLV game was the second
consecutive disastrous ending for the Bears. Baylor lost the season
opener at Boston College 30-29 when kicker Kyle Atteberry missed an
extra-point attempt in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   One of those outcomes in a year is bad enough, but back-to-back
heartbreaking losses to start a season could be devastating to a
team's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a family and you have adversity, a lot of times you
come together and become stronger,'' said Baylor cornerback Gary
Baxter. ``I think that's what we will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe they have bonded together because of
this,'' he said. ``We will find out what kind of football team we
are, and we'll find out what kind of head coach we've got.''

   JAPAN SELLS YEN TO CURB SHARP RISE AGAINST DOLLAR
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese central bank sold yen to curb the currency's recent
heady rise, but the intervention barely managed to nudge the yen
off its three-year high against the dollar. And in New York, the
yen gained again, to 105.79 to the dollar from 106.44 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese authorities seemed more alarmed by the speed of the
yen's appreciation _ nearly 5 percent in the last week _ than in
the rise itself, even as economists began wondering aloud whether a
stronger yen might stifle the little vitality that a long-moribund
Japanese economy is starting to exhibit.

 &HT;    Forecasters keeping eye on Gert in Floyd's wake
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ By next weekend, Florida may be looking
at another powerful hurricane following a similar path to Hurricane
Floyd, according to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   While Hurricane Floyd slid up the coast of Florida Tuesday, a
slightly smaller, but well defined Hurricane Gert followed in its
wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gert will become a major hurricane during the next few days,''
said National Hurricane Center meteorologist Todd Kimberlain.
``It's not quite as big as Floyd, but it's still a maturing
hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gert follows Floyd's track to the east coast of Florida,
or takes a more northerly course in the open ocean, will depend on
the lingering influence Floyd will have on a subtropical high
pressure ridge in the area, forecasters say.
</P>
<P>
   If Floyd's path leaves a weakness in the ridge, Gert should turn
more northward, and be less of a danger, forecasters say. But if
the ridge remains, Gert would continue on a more westerly track and
become more of a threat to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our models indicate the ridge will remain intact,''
Kimberlain said. ``But if Floyd causes a weakness in the ridge,
then Gert could turn north.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Hurricane Floyd, much will depend on timing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Floyd's influence on weakening that ridge,
forecasters on Tuesday adjusted the predicted path of Gert slightly
more northward from it's previous west, northwesterly trek.
</P>
<P>
   Gert's well-defined eye was spinning winds at 115 mph Tuesday
night, and some strengthening was anticipated by today. Hurricane
force winds extended 35 miles from the center, and tropical winds
out to 140 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Floyd was out in this area, it was a tropical
depression,'' Kimberlain said. ``The fact that Gert is already a
hurricane means it will be more affected by steering winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the uncertain atmospheric aftermath of Floyd, the
National Weather Service on Tuesday was being cautious in
predicting a long-term forecast for Gert.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forecasts need to be taken with a grain of salt at this
time,'' a weather service advisory said.

 &HT;    Prosecutor removed from Branch Davidian investigation
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Federal prosecutor Bill Johnston of Waco and his
boss were removed Tuesday from any dealings with Branch Davidian
matters by Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   Those duties were assigned to J. Michael Bradford of Beaumont,
U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation was given for the recusals of Johnston and James
W. Blagg, United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas,
in documents filed in Waco's federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have a comment on the substance of the recusal,''
said Johnston, an assistant United States attorney, ``but I am
going to continue to do what I think is the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Blagg released a statement noting that his office, based in San
Antonio, advised law enforcement officials before and after the
1993 raid on Mount Carmel, home of the Branch Davidians and their
leader, David Koresh. It also handled the subsequent criminal trial
of 11 Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their roles in matters that may be under
investigation, my office has been recused from all related matters
to avoid any potential or appearance of a conflict of interest,''
the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mike Caddell of Houston, who represents several
Davidians in the upcoming wrongful death lawsuit against the
government, speculated the recusals may relate to concerns that
Blagg, Johnston and others will be targeted in an investigation
into whether they acted improperly five years ago by not telling
defense attorneys for the Davidians that incendiary tear gas was
used at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the recusals shouldn't have an impact on the
lawsuit, set for trial on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the U.S. Attorney's office was not handling anything
related to the civil case,'' Caddell said. ``They had already been
taken out of the loop by the Justice Department. Everything we're
doing, arranging for depositions and document production, is being
handled by the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Tinker, an Austin attorney who defended Davidian Brad
Branch, said the recusal of Johnston ``should have happened a long
time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are documents in the possession of lawyers in the case
where Bill Johnston is saying, 'Let's be careful interviewing these
ATF agents so we do not create any Brady material,''' Tinker said.
``That's material that could prove helpful to the defendants. Now
if he is coming around claiming that he is trying to reveal the
truth, that is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, though, said he had mixed emotions about Johnston's
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions in saying don't create Brady material are not
consistent with a claim to be seeking the truth,'' Caddell said.
``But he gave Mike McNulty access to an evidence locker, which
ended up benefitting us. The Justice Department had been
stonewalling us for six years. I thought Johnston was straight with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Johnston let McNulty, a film producer, view
the Davidian evidence, leading to a series of new allegations
against the government and another Congressional inquiry into what
happened at Mount Carmel. More recently, Johnston wrote a memo to
Attorney General Janet Reno warning that her own department was
possibly misleading her about federal agents' roles in the Branch
Davidian siege.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnston also acknowledged he may have sat in on a meeting
five years ago where members of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team
admitted using incendiary tear gas at Mount Carmel, firing at a
bunker away from the Davidians' residence. The admission was not
made known to defense attorneys. Johnston said he didn't understand
the terminology used during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford will now handle all Branch Davidian related matters,
including any dealings with appeals related to the 1994 criminal
convictions of seven Davidians; the wrongful death lawsuit next
month; pending or future requests for information under the Freedom
of Information Act; and inquiries into what happened at Mount
Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton appointed Bradford as United States
Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas in 1994. Before that,
Bradford was a Jefferson County district judge and a United States
magistrate. He graduated from the University of Texas Law School in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bradford successfully prosecuted Dallas City
Council Member Paul Fielding for mail fraud and conspiracy.
Fielding was accused, among other things, of using minority-owned
front companies to obtain contracts under affirmative action
programs.
</P>
<P>
   His first duty will be to get up to speed on the Branch Davidian
case, Bradford said in a released statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first priority is to familiarize ourselves with the issues
at hand so that we may fully cooperate with all other entities
looking into this matter,'' Bradford said. ``Our main objective is
to assist in providing truthful information in order to foster
public confidence.''

THE NEW CONSCIENCE OF POP MUSIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During ``Not Lookin,''' a new duet with her former beau, the
urban love man K-Ci Hailey, Mary J. Blige demonstrates how to stop
a man cold. The song, from Ms. Blige's new album, ``Mary,'' pits a
woman seeking true affection against a man out for pure pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The two vocalists trade diatribes over a steady rocking rhythm,
their wails building as the impossibility of resolution grows
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Hailey soothes and cajoles in his sexy baritone. Ms. Blige cries
to any women listening to stand up with her and fight such
``player'' nonsense. ``I hear you,'' moans Hailey, though he
obviously doesn't. Finally, Ms. Blige just snaps. ``I know you're
sorry!'' she exclaims. The track ends, without another sound.
</P>
<P>
   This abrupt dismissal is a conveniently dramatic way for Ms.
Blige to win a musical cutting contest. But it also captures the
mood of the rhythm-and-blues being made by young artists eager to
create something more than slick background for the well-appointed
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   This new style has been building for a few years, but only now
is it reaching full flower. And although its pioneers include men
like Hailey and D'Angelo, there is no question that the fragrance
of this blossom is boldly feminine.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, most discussions of women's increased
power in pop have focused on alternative-rock transgressors like
Tori Amos and Courtney Love or the songbirds of Sarah McLachlan's
Lilith Fair. Rhythm-and-blues artists sold albums but were rarely
viewed as culture shapers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, with mainstream rock again becoming a male bastion,
it is clear whose music matters within the continuing emergence of
women as equal players in contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blige, the standard-bearer for hip-hop-inflected soul, has
reached a peak in her career. She has evolved from a passionate but
erratic inner-city princess to a mature artist tackling the same
complexities expressed by her idols, Aretha Franklin and Chaka
Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, a professed Blige fan who wrote and produced ``All
That I Can Say,'' the first single from ``Mary'' (MCA), herself
exceeded all expectations with her solo debut, ``The Miseducation
of Lauryn Hill.'' The girl group TLC is at its apex, ruling the
charts with two singles, ``No Scrubs'' and ``Unpretty,'' that have
sparked spirited public conversations about sex, money and
self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   These are only the most visible forces in a renaissance that
includes girl groups like Destiny's Child, answering TLC's
challenge with its own fresh summer single, ``Bills, Bills,
Bills''; Missy Elliott, an artist growing ever more influential
behind the scenes as a producer; seasoned songwriters now in the
spotlight, like Faith Evans, Kelly Price and Angie Stone, and
left-field contenders like Macy Gray and Melky Sedeck.
</P>
<P>
   These artists are as carefully packaged as the elegant stars
they join in the spotlight, from Whitney Houston to Toni Braxton.
But they are selling a very different sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   They are more individualistic, more confrontational. They grew
up loving hip-hop, and in their songs they tangle with that genre's
cold-blooded male pronouncements instead of merely floating past
them on a cushion of strings and strummed guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Some find allies in brash rappers like Lil' Kim. But while the
female rapper's role remains mostly that of the sexual warrior,
contesting masculine power with the easily available weapon of her
own body, these singers also confront the emotional costs of such
battles.
</P>
<P>
   The new soul queens take advantage of nostalgia's ability to
conjure authenticity. Their songs invoke forebears like Ms. Khan in
music thick with funk and flecked with jazz, but the mix is salted
with gritty hip-hop beats. These artists' lyrics, too, resurrect
old-school domestic protests within a strikingly contemporary
context, as they debate proper behavior within today's seeming
sexual free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   The rising stars of female soul demand attention with audacity
rather than coaxing it out through prettiness. Undoubtedly sexy,
they are also unapologetically human. They embody not merely the
dream girls of glossy magazines but also the ``unpretty'' women
reading those magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And they are earning respect, so much so that pop angels like
Ms. Houston, Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson have made themselves
over to look rougher and tougher in their midst _ and, in the
process, have made some of the best music of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   This current cycle is just the latest in the rebirth of soul.
Two larger commercial trends have spurred it on: the triumph of
hip-hop and the return of rhythm-and-blues as the basic form of
teen-age pop. After briefly being displaced by punk-flavored rock
in the mid-1990s, black music is again the essence of American pop
music. But the new soul queens consciously invoke a side of that
music that others have avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all popular music centers on romance, and
historically, black music has frankly celebrated love's sexual
side. But, as the historian Brian Ward points out in ``Just My Soul
Responding: Rhythm-and-Blues, Black Consciousness and Race
Relations'' (University of California, 1998), black styles from the
blues to disco have not just glorified bodily pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   They have given artists a way of confronting the sexual
stereotypes that racism has created _ what Michelle Wallace
famously called ``black macho and the myth of the super-woman.''
Through songs ranging from Wynonie Harris' ``Adam, Come and Get
Your Rib'' to Gwen Guthrie's ``Ain't Nothin' Goin' On but the
Rent,'' rhythm-and-blues artists have encapsulated the struggles
waged in every room of the black household, from the bedroom to the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In times of political pessimism, this debate has grown more
vicious. The blues painted a bleak image of love, grounded in
paranoia and murderous lusts. At the height of the civil rights
movement, when integration seemed possible both in public spaces
and on the pop charts, romantics like Aretha Franklin gained
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the early 1970s, when the radical Black Power movement
arose in response to social setbacks, female artists once again
found themselves metaphorically embattled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women of soul rejected the role of helpless victims, not
by articulating a discernibly feminist program, but by giving as
good as they got in the male-defined sex wars of the late 1960s and
early 1970s,'' Ward writes. ``It was the equivalent of women in the
Panthers earning the respect of their male colleagues by picking up
the gun _ the ultimate symbol of phallocentric power _ and behaving
as much like men as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric of hip-hop is firmly linked to this era. Its stars
constantly mimic the styles seen in blaxploitation movies of the
early 1970s, and when they do venture into political speech, they
most often invoke radicals like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Rappers like Jay-Z and Master P take an outlaw stance with
overtones of social revolt, if not genuine political rebellion.
Today's most successful female rappers have adopted the image of
the ``ho'' as a feminine counterpart in criminality.
</P>
<P>
   The new soul queens are taking on the often vicious
representations of women in hip-hop, assessing what real strength
those images may offer and when they need to be defused. They are
speaking to female hip-hop fans about the contradictions facing
young women in a culture that craves female power but remains
deeply suspicious of it. And they are confronting the men who, in
rap and in contemporary rhythm-and-blues, so often describe
seduction as a theft and love as a game.
</P>
<P>
   Mary J. Blige has been working on gaining equality with her male
counterparts since she released her debut album, ``What's the
411?'' in 1992. That album posited Ms. Blige as a
fingernail-flaring, Kangol cap-wearing little sister whom B-boys
could dream of and ghetto girls could identify with. (The future
hip-hop kingpin Sean (Puffy) Combs is listed as ``stylist'' on the
album's credits.)
</P>
<P>
   Singing with passion if not technical mastery, Ms. Blige
immediately distinguished herself from stars like Ms. Carey, who
possessed better instruments but little of her street credibility.
With her second album, ``My Life,'' she began writing more of her
material and showed herself to be given to dark pronouncements,
like her magnificent version of the Norman Whitfield-Joel
Schumacher ballad ``I'm Goin' Down'' from the movie ``Car Wash'' as
well as optimistic hits like ``Real Love.''
</P>
<P>
   For many fans, she became a Lady of the Sorrows, expressing
their anxieties and regrets in a powerful but always vulnerable
voice.
</P>
<P>
   The moody Ms. Blige wore her own troubles on her sleeve. She had
adversarial encounters with the press and publicly indulged in
drugs and alcohol. Gradually, she grew up, and her track record of
hits has turned her into a soul matriarch by age 28.
</P>
<P>
   Her new album is not as obviously commercial as her previous
studio efforts, nor is it as closely linked to hip-hop. With
``Mary,'' Ms. Blige it making her case for really deserving the
regal title hip-hop fans have given her from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   It is a crossover effort, with appearances by the distinctly
non-ghettocentric guests Sir Elton John and Eric Clapton. Only one
rapper, Jadakiss, appears; a cut featuring DMX and Nas was
ultimately reserved for the B-side of ``All That I Can Say.'' But
if ``Mary'' gestures toward an older, non-hip-hop audience, it also
makes the claim for Ms. Blige's canonization within the
rhythm-and-blues hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   The album's two duets enforce her status: her reunion with
Hailey, who is also outrunning his bad-boy past via increasingly
sophisticated recordings, and the spirited ``Don't Waste Your
Time,'' in which she receives a mentor's advice from that other
queen of soul, Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   The time is right for Ms. Blige to assert herself because her
dramatic, direct vocal style is again soul's paradigm. Once, even
the voices of Ms. Blige's imitators were heavily obscured within
mixes where the producer's signature mattered more than the
singer's.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find the real woman inside the work of vocally
gifted artists like Ms. Braxton or Ms. Houston. The individual
quirks that distinguished greats like Ms. Franklin, Ms. Khan and
Patti LaBelle were processed out of most radio-ready mixes.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, though, outsiders began making commercial
breakthroughs. Not only Ms. Blige, but Erykah Badu and Missy
Elliott, neither of whom looked or sounded like the standard-model
soul babe, became stars. Faith Evans and Kelly Price, writers who
have collaborated with Ms. Blige, had hits that emphasized their
unvarnished voices and dramatic range.
</P>
<P>
   The multiplatinum, multi-Grammy triumph of Ms. Hill, a
boisterous singer and rapper whose most striking talent is for
spacious vocal arrangements, cemented the change.
</P>
<P>
   A shift was visible, too, among the often seemingly
interchangeable girl groups of contemporary rhythm-and-blues. The
trio that made the difference has progressed in much the same way
Ms. Blige has. Tionne (T-Boz) Watkins, Rozonda (Chilli) Thomas and
Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes, collectively known as TLC, started out as
perky but artistically unremarkable teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazysexycool,'' the group's 1994 sophomore effort, solidified
its sound by emphasizing the internal, almost conversational
singing of T-Boz and Chilli and using Left Eye's sassy raps as
zest. ``Crazysexycool'' sold upwards of eight million copies,
guaranteeing that its formula would be endlessly imitated.
</P>
<P>
   Before TLC's triumph, the most successful girl group was En
Vogue, a quartet with stellar vocal prowess and a taste for
glamour. Like Ms. Blige, the women of TLC seemed more accessible,
partly because of their connections to streetwise hip-hop.
``Fanmail,'' this year's long-awaited follow-up to
``Crazysexycool,'' does not totally diverge from the tried and
true, but its best tracks take on soul's classic conversation about
gender in adventurous ways.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE_
</P>
<P>
   The album's monster hit, ``No Scrubs,'' is a vintage
dressing-down of a financially shifty man, while the group's
current single, ``Unpretty,'' bravely considers the downside of the
beauty myth most women in pop eagerly cultivate. But the most
daring song on ``Fanmail'' is ``I'm Good at Being Bad,'' a musical
re-enactment of the conflicting stereotypes that envelop black
women.
</P>
<P>
   The track begins as a silky ballad, like a bubble bath with a
beat, but it gives way to a huge hip-hop beat and a snarling,
obscenity-laced vocal. Here is the ``ho'' taking on the dream girl,
the woman using sex as a weapon versus the one too dependent on
love. The scenario remains unresolved, and the more powerful for
it.
</P>
<P>
   TLC's inside view of a sexual woman's split psyche is hardly the
only song to confront hip-hop's ever-present ho. Ms. Hill cautioned
young girls to preserve themselves in ``Lost Ones,'' a song that
has earned her accusations of self-righteousness. Because she is
openly religious, Ms. Hill is blunt about her distaste for the
mercenary sexual stance of some female artists.
</P>
<P>
   For all the backlash it has caused, Ms. Hill's critique of
hip-hop's skewed value system reflects another element of soul's
artistic revitalization. Her challenge, ``How you gonna win when
you ain't right within?'' echoes through this new music.
</P>
<P>
   New artists like Angie Stone, Melky Sedeck and Macy Gray make
such questions of conscience part of their metier. These new soul
queens are not moralistic; their songs toast sensuality more often
than they dissect social ills. But they also consider the
consequences of the hunger for sex, drugs and money, especially in
the context of racism. Doing so, they invoke not only past soul
queens but progenitors like Sly Stone and Marvin Gaye.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Stone covers Gaye's ``Trouble Man'' on ``Black Diamond,''
her Arista debut album, to be released on Sept. 28. Her deceptively
mellow, keyboard-heavy sound, reminiscent of D'Angelo (her frequent
musical collaborator and the father of her son), aims for the great
soul man's delicate balance of introspection and sensual release.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone's alto burns like an ember in songs like ``Just a
Pimp,'' which declares no difference between emotionless free love
and the purchased kind, and ``Bone 2 Pick,'' in which a woman
mourns a lover lost to his obsession with wealth and status.
</P>
<P>
   The shimmering gem ``Black Diamonds and Blue Pearls'' is an
old-fashioned exhortation of racial pride that more subtly
confronts the beauty standards TLC challenges in ``Unpretty.''
</P>
<P>
   With her natural hair and dark chocolate skin, Ms. Stone is a
beauty strutting an Afrocentric style. Blandinna (Melky) Jean is
another charismatic woman who confronts the tangle of images young
black women must negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister and Brother,'' the MCA debut of Melky Sedeck, has been
somewhat overlooked, perhaps in a weird reaction against the family
ties between Ms. Jean; her partner and brother, Sedeck; and another
brother, Wyclef Jean, a co-founder of the Fugees. The references to
kinship that pepper the album do seem like extra weight, but this
fine set of grooves deserves attention, most of all for Ms. Jean's
vociferous talent.
</P>
<P>
   Her fight to define herself shapes Melky Sedeck's songs, whether
she is taking on the role of the ``other woman'' in ``Diva'' or
setting her moral standards in ``Lady.'' In that lyric, she
intones, ``A man is a man, that I know, / But there's a difference
between a woman and a ho,'' a distinction she delineates in no
uncertain terms. Unabashedly sexual, Ms. Sedeck makes an argument
for self-regard that need not be self-limiting.
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray, who has become something of a hipster's darling with
her debut album, ``Macy Gray on How Life Is'' (The Work Group),
tends toward a more buoyant mood. Her voice is as crackly as a
Nestle Crunch bar, but she uses it to full advantage in songs that
fashion her as a smoky sage of the nighttime world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray has been compared to Billie Holiday, but her voice and
her cabaret sensibility come closer to Eartha Kitt's as she takes
soul music's dissection of power beyond the realm of romance. On
``I've Committed Murder,'' her album's gutsiest track, she imagines
herself killing her lover's oppressive female boss in an instance
of class revolt for which she refuses to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   The history of rhythm-and-blues is full of unruly divas like the
ones currently stealing the microphone. They are lucky that popular
taste is shifting their way, saving them from the outsider status
that has long afflicted soul singers who push against the
stereotypes of urban style.
</P>
<P>
   These women are determined to give voice to their own views on
the matters that shape the intimate lives of their listeners, and
they are artists enough to render those perspectives in tones as
vibrant as the heritage they mine. Whether tackling emotional
profundities or sticking to the plain facts of woman versus man,
black women are the conscience of today's pop scene.

IDEA OF REWARDING `STRIVERS' STIRS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than two years, the Educational Testing Service, the
author of the nation's most widely used college entrance
examination, has been working to devise a formula to help
admissions officers identify disadvantaged students who score
better than might have been predicted by racial, economic and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Though their scores would stay the same, the students would be
labeled as ``strivers,'' perhaps increasing their chances of
admission. But none is likely to be flagged any time soon, if ever,
because recent reports describing the research touched off
criticism from many universities and from the College Board, the
association of colleges that contracts with the testing service to
write the tests and score the results.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston Caperton, who was named president and chief executive of
the College Board on July 1, said in an interview this week that he
would work to block the testing service from ever offering such a
formula to colleges as a tool to diversify their incoming classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real art and a real skill to blending these factors
together, for an institution to decide what its student body should
look like,'' said Caperton. ``To think that you could do that with
some scientific formula just wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   According to descriptions of the research provided by the
testing service, a student would be identified as a striver if he
or she achieved a score of at least 1,000 on the test, out of a
possible 1,600, and performed at least 200 points better than
expected. The expected score would be calculated by assigning
values to dozens of factors in the student's life and background,
including how many books and appliances are in his home, how many
years of school the student's parents attended, and the total of
advanced placement tests taken in the student's school.
</P>
<P>
   The formula would permit universities, which would be
responsible for analyzing the scores, to factor the student's race
into the equation, or disregard it. Though the scores would not
change, the students would, in effect, be credited with doing
better than they actually had.
</P>
<P>
   The research was prompted by recent attacks on affirmative
action and the fact that test scores are increasingly seen as the
way to get into colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Among the criticisms of the ``striver'' research, most of them
raised since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the project
late last month, has been that it represents an affirmative action
effort in disguise. Critics fear that the formula might hurt more
affluent students by setting the bar of expectation higher than
that for strivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too simplistic and, in a way, demeaning,'' said
Karl Furstenberg, the dean of admissions and financial aid at
Dartmouth College. ``I worry about a program like this stigmatizing
people, and in effect saying, `Just because you come from
background X-Y-Z, you are not expected to do well, and if you do
well, you get this gold star of being a striver.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Journal article, which suggested that
admissions officers would be able to start using the formula this
fall, the testing service has taken great pains to say that its
research is continuing and that it has yet to decide whether to
disseminate the formula to colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no product or program or service that is even under
concept,'' said Tom Ewing, a spokesman for the testing service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nonetheless, by even undertaking such research, the testing
service is acknowledging a flaw in the test that critics have
bemoaned for years: The SAT does not necessarily provide a fair
gauge of a student's ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes ever more clear that the so-called common yardstick
of the SAT is in fact a flexible, rubber ruler,'' said Monty Neill,
the executive director of the National Center for Fair and Open
Testing, a nonprofit group that wants College Board exams to be
voluntary. ``The test really does mean different things for
different test-takers.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing a formula, the testing service is searching for some
way to put the imprint of science on something that many highly
selective universities do anyway, albeit informally through
interviews and essays: taking into account all the influences on a
student's life and academic record when considering an application
for admission.
</P>
<P>
   Though many admissions directors said they feared an
individual's strengths could get lost if compared to generic
formulaic expectations for racial or economic groups, Michael T.
Nettles, a professor of education at the University of Michigan,
said he believed the testing service was on an important quest and
encouraged it to continue its research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a first step,'' said Nettles, an expert on educational
assessment. ``One of the benefits of the work is that it enlivens
the debate on the issue.''

   As the AT&AMP;T Corp. continues to cut costs amid its campaign of
cable television acquisitions, thousands of employees in AT&AMP;T's
core long-distance telephone operation could lose their jobs before
the end of next year, executives close to the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those employees could find jobs in other, faster-growing
AT&AMP;T divisions that will continue to add jobs, including the cable
operation, the wireless phone unit and the group that serves big
business customers, the executives added. But others could be laid
off.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of job cuts would come on top of the 14 percent
reduction in work force announced by C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman, last year. Despite the company's success in cutting
workers, the company's overall employee base has grown by almost 40
percent in recent years, to 149,000, with AT&AMP;T's acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., the big cable television operator, and
the success of smaller internal units.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T announced its $58 billion deal to acquire Mediaone
Group Inc., another cable giant, in May, AT&AMP;T also said it intended
to cut $2 billion in annual costs by the end of next year. The
company said some of that reduction could come in the form of a
smaller work force but declined to specify just how much.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, some AT&AMP;T managers have not been moving quickly
enough. Last month, when AT&AMP;T announced a new long-distance calling
plan that charges 7 cents a minute, the company added that the core
long-distance operation was behind the May schedule in cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, AT&AMP;T instituted a companywide hiring freeze. In
addition, hundreds of senior executives throughout AT&AMP;T have been
instructed to cut costs within their departments, an AT&AMP;T executive
said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Because of the
decentralized nature of the cost-cutting campaign, the executive
said, it may be difficult to determine just how many jobs will
disappear and where the cuts will be concentrated. New Jersey,
however, may bear the brunt simply because many of the company's
employees are in the state.
</P>
<P>
   What is sure is that the job cuts will come mostly in AT&AMP;T's
core long-distance operation, which is relatively stagnant. An
executive close to AT&AMP;T said that the unit that runs the
long-distance network and the unit that sells long-distance phone
service to business customers would probably be the first to make
cuts, perhaps by Oct. 1. Other cuts, including those in the
consumer long-distance business, might not take place until next
year, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, AT&AMP;T said it would build as many as 26 new
Internet data centers to provide services like operating Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T fell 62.5 cents, to $44.50.

ADVERTISING: P&AMP;G TO TIE AGENCY COMPENSATION TO SALES PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's largest advertiser, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. , plans
major changes in how it pays the agencies that create campaigns for
its 300 household brands around the world, which include Cheer,
Crest, Folger's, Ivory, Jif, Noxzema, Pampers, Pringles and Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Effective July 1, 2000, P&AMP;G will no longer pay agencies
commissions based on what is spent to advertise products in
television, magazines, newspapers and other media. From that date,
the company will base compensation on sales objectives, with
agencies being paid more if a brand's sales increase and less if
sales decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in my career we've ever made such a
really big, broad-scale change,'' Robert Wehling, global marketing
officer at Procter in Cincinnati, said Tuesday in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a system that's in our best interests and the best
interests of our agencies as we move forward,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been tested with seven brands since July, and an
announcement of the switch, which will affect some of Madison
Avenue's largest, best-known agencies, is scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about bringing forth bigger and better ideas
faster,'' said Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive at
MacManus Group in New York, which owns one Procter agency, D'Arcy
Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to drive top-line sales growth,'' he added,
``and the agencies are going to charge after this in a big, big
way. This is really going to generate some sales increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Many marketers have already replaced the traditional commission
system with performance-based compensation: calculating agency
payments on predetermined, measurable goals like growth in sales,
increased awareness of a brand or gaining broad distribution for a
new product.
</P>
<P>
   But P&AMP;G's decision to join their ranks is likely to accelerate
the shift to performance-based compensation because of the
company's strength and influence among marketers and agencies, as
well as its heritage of innovations like inventing the soap opera.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   P&AMP;G spent an estimated $5.75 billion on worldwide advertising in
1997, the most recent year for which figures are available,
comfortably ahead of No. 2, General Motors Corp., at an estimated
$4 billion. Procter has most recently paid agency commissions of
about 13 to 15 percent of the amount spent on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give performance-based compensation real critical
mass,'' said Nancy Salz, president at Nancy L. Salz Consulting in
New York, which conducts annual surveys on advertiser-agency
relations, ``and it will now be more considered by every major
advertiser.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Holding the agency accountable, when it shares the
financial risks and the financial rewards, creates a full business
partnership. That changes attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salz said that her most recent survey found that agencies
and advertisers using performance-based compensation described
their relations as less tense, with more teamwork. ``And 35 percent
of clients using performance-based compensation said they had more
respect for their agencies,'' she added, ``compared with 12 percent
for clients that don't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter is striving to double sales to more than $70 billion in
the next few years and speed the development and introduction of
products with worldwide sales potential like Fabreze, a fabric
deodorizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a new and stronger partnership
relationship with our agencies,'' Wehling said. ``We both win if we
figure out how to build sales faster, and we both lose to a degree
if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you're an agency and your income growth is tied
to the growth of the brand you're handling, you have an
unbelievable sense of urgency to find solutions to problems and
drive sales forward. Under the commission system, as long as media
billings were holding up, you could take as long as you wanted to
come up with solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion was echoed by the head of an agency who has
crusaded since 1990 for new compensation plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the old system, you could argue that you make more money
with mediocre advertising because you have to run it more to get
the same result,'' said Keith Reinhard, chairman and chief
executive at the DDB Worldwide Communications Group unit of Omnicom
Group in New York. DDB, which does not work for Procter, has more
than 25 alternative compensation agreements with clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what I call results-based or success-based compensation,
people sit down and do a much better job of really determining a
situation, analyzing a problem or opportunity,'' Reinhard said.
``It has a transforming effect, because you're examining every
possibility, every form of marketing strategy and tactic, to help
you achieve your goal.''
</P>
<P>
   That underlines a significant reason for P&AMP;G's switch. The old
system could tempt agencies to focus their attention on the types
of advertising that cost more to create, produce and run in the
media _ like commercials on prime-time television _ regardless of
whether they were the most appropriate for the task at hand,
because expensive media buys generate higher agency commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Performance-based compensation plans are described as media
neutral, meaning they favor no one medium _ and often eschew
traditional media for unconventional sales tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what really emerges is a new degree of `holistic
marketing,''' Wehling said, ``looking at all the forms of
communicating, bonding with our customers, whatever it takes:
direct mail, public relations, Internet advertising, new media,
traditional advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Wehling said that he first heard the term ``holistic marketing''
about 15 years ago, on a trip to visit Dentsu Inc. in Tokyo, which
works for Procter in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said to me, ` Wehling, we are not your advertising
agency,''' he recalled, ``and I said, `Oh, really?' and they said:
`No, we're your total communications agency. If the best way to
sell your brand is images on matchbook covers or street-corner
sampling, that is what we will recommend.' That is a powerful
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G agencies are already working on such multifaceted campaigns
for a variety of brands. For instance, for the Cover Girl line of
cosmetics, units of Grey Advertising Inc. in New York have
developed a Web site, designed packages, created promotional
materials, sponsored events for consumers in stores and organized a
concert tour by the singer Brandy, who also appears in the brand's
commercials and print advertisements produced by Grey.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new system,'' said Edward H. Meyer, chairman and
chief executive at Grey, ``our rewards will be based not on which
media we use but on successful business-building ideas and
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey is one of the four main worldwide agencies for Procter,
along with D'Arcy; Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, part of Leo Group,
and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
The company also has two major regional agencies, Dentsu and Jordan
McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro
RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the sales-based compensation plan could reduce the
agencies' revenue and income by generating more use of media that
is less expensive than prime-time TV and national print, Wehling
replied: ``I'd be very surprised if that is the outcome. By working
together with us to grow our sales, the agencies will grow their
income _ and possibly faster than under the traditional system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostock at MacManus concurred, adding that compensation based on
sales could offer ``a more predictable stream of revenue for the
agencies'' than ``media budgets, which fluctuate so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And therefore we can staff more consistently over time,'' he
said. ``That's a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The new compensation system will not be adopted until next July
1 rather than Jan. 1, Wehling said, because ``we still have a lot
of i-dotting and t-crossing to do on issues like taxes.''

LIABILITY FEARS SINK REPUBLIC NEW YORK SHARE PRICE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fears about the Republic New York Corp.'s liability in what
prosecutors are now calling a huge fraud dragged down the company's
stock for the third consecutive trading session Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Republic New York fell 1.6 percent, to close at $59,
for a total decline of nearly 15 percent this month. Investors are
apparently concerned that the fraud could derail or alter HSBC
Holdings' planned acquisition of Republic for $72 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at HSBC declined to comment on the status of the deal
and referred a reporter to the bank's statement on Sept. 1
announcing an internal investigation into trading losses generated
by its customer, Martin A. Armstrong, chairman of Princeton
Economics International Inc., an investment advisory firm that in
turn controlled Cresvale International, a brokerage firm based in
Hong Kong. At that time, HSBC said its offer to acquire Republic
was proceeding but would be postponed until the investigation was
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Republic's stock has fallen since then on investor concerns that
the trading losses generated by Armstrong, estimated by prosecutors
at more than $500 million, might cause HSBC to lower its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Republic's securities unit, Republic New York Securities, held
Armstrong's accounts in its Philadelphia office. The bank holding
company has not been charged with wrongdoing in the case and is
cooperating with prosecutors. But two top officials at the
securities subsidiary have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong surrendered to federal authorities in Trenton, N.J.,
on Monday on charges that he orchestrated a huge securities fraud
that had bilked Japanese investors since 1997. Prosecutors say
Armstrong lured $3 billion from Japanese companies into fixed-rate
notes with promises of a return of at least 4 percent annually and
that he lied to his clients about his returns and illegally pooled
investor funds to hide trading losses. Furthermore, Armstrong never
registered as an investment adviser or commodity trading advisor as
required.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly $1 billion Armstrong still owes his clients in
principal and promised interest, only $46 million has been located
by prosecutors in his trading accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Durant, the lawyer representing Armstrong, said that his
client disputed the accusations and would fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's trading accounts were responsible for 90 percent of
the futures business at Republic Securities, according to
prosecutors. James Sweeney, president of Republic Securities, and
William H. Rogers, president of the unit's futures division, have
been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Securities lawyers say that if an employee is found to have been
involved in the fraud, Republic could face a sizable financial
liability. In the complaint against Armstrong unsealed Monday by
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, prosecutors say
that Rogers supplied Armstrong with letters on company stationery
that inflated customers' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the authorities, Armstrong would ask Rogers for
such letters and would provide the asset value he wanted. Rogers
would then provide Princeton Economics with the letter and the
asset value dictated by Armstrong. If the amount in the account
held at Republic New York Securities was less than the figure
specified by Armstrong, funds were shifted from other clients'
accounts to make up the shortfall, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how Armstrong lost so much money remains unclear. But a
major factor was probably the collapse in the price of the dollar
against the Japanese yen in the past year or so. On Aug. 11, 1998,
the dollar traded at 147.32 yen; Tuesday it traded at 105.93.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Armstrong had expressed great optimism about the
strength of the dollar, forecasting that it would rise to 170 yen
or higher by this year. Instead, the dollar has plunged, hurting
him in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, Armstrong was almost certainly making currency bets for
his customers in keeping with his optimism on the dollar. Moreover,
the strong yen made his promises of 4 percent returns, payable as
they were in Japanese currency, much more costly, since he had to
exchange far more dollars for the yen than he would have if the
dollar had remained high.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Armstrong's activities started in May in
Tokyo when the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's securities
regulator, conducted a surprise audit of Cresvale, which has
offices in Tokyo. Cresvale convinced Japanese companies of
Armstrong's trading prowess, attracting billions in funds.
</P>
<P>
   Kiyotaka Sasaki, the Financial Supervisory Agency official in
charge of inspections of foreign financial concerns operating in
Japan, said Japanese officials would be closely watching the case
against Armstrong in the United States to gauge its impact on
Japanese investors, who face substantial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki pointed to the close cooperation between Japanese and
American officials as an example of how regulators can police
global financial markets. Earlier this year, the Financial
Supervisory Agency's work with British regulators helped it close a
derivatives unit of Credit Suisse First Boston that sold products
to help Japanese corporations defer losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, such cooperation has turned out to be very useful and
effective,'' he said.

<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ When the Miss America Pageant began
allowing contestants to wear sandals a couple of years ago, few
eyebrows were raised.
</P>
<P>
   When it allowed two-piece bathing suits last year with bottoms
that could be no more than one and a half inches below the navel,
many people thought it was about time.
</P>
<P>
   But when the board of the Miss America Organization adopted new
rules last month that would clear the way for a divorced woman or
one who had had an abortion to compete for the crown, many
supporters and participants in the pageant said they would be
ruining the essence of a contest they hold sacrosanct. The outcry
grew so loud that pageant organizers said Tuesday that they were
reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a purity and an integrity and a morality that would be
violated if you let in women who are divorced and had an
abortion,'' said Kathrine Baumann, the Miss America first runner-up
from 1970, whose niece, Tiffany Baumann, is competing in this
year's pageant as Miss Ohio. ``People get divorced. But if that
happens, then let them compete in the Mrs. America pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the changes loomed over the Atlantic City Convention
Center, where the televised pageant is to be held Saturday, even
more ominously than the hurricane whipping up the ocean just beyond
the Boardwalk outside, or the strike by hotel workers that began
Tuesday night and could cripple this gambling mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here had traveled to see the weeklong pageant events
and support candidates from 50 states and the District of Columbia.
To them, the trip is a pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction against the changes has been so furious that the
national organization seemed to reverse its position on the changes
Tuesday. Robert L. Beck, president and chief executive of the Miss
America Organization, said the national board would go back to the
state franchises that run the local contests before it institutes
the new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Beck said the changes to the qualifications were made to conform
with state anti-discrimination laws. The New Jersey Law Against
Discrimination includes marital status among the 13 categories
protected in areas of employment, housing and public accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Dabreu, the acting director of the N.J. Division on Civil
Rights, said she could not comment on whether the law could be
applied to the pageant or any other contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do that until we have a case filed in our
office,'' Ms. Dabreu said. ``It's an interesting issue, but we have
to wait until we get to what the issue actually is until we address
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck insisted that the changes in the pageant would not dilute
the nature of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the same values,'' Beck said. But he was hard pressed
to delineate what those values were at a time when the pageant is
trying to attract a wider television audience as well as more
contestants in some parts of the country where pageants are waning
in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The values cut across the United States,'' he said. ``It's not
a cookie-cutter thing. You have 10,000 people competing all across
the country. Each is an individual with all kinds of values and
backgrounds, and we're trying to meld those together.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck is the first chief executive of the organization without a
long history of involvement with pageants. The guideline changes,
he said, were made by the national board, whose 22 members are
almost all from the Atlantic City area.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention center, the reaction to those changes was
mostly negative among the hundreds of supporters and relatives of
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are in Miss America,'' said John Covil, a
telecommunications worker from Jacksonville, Fla. ``I've just had a
lifelong affection for the Miss America pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Tony Daniels, a music studio owner from Oklahoma
City, also said he did not support the changes. Both men have been
judges in local competitions for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just from the old school,'' said Daniels, who was snapping
pictures of Miss Oklahoma, Daneka Allen, as she walked down the
runway in rehearsals for the talent competition. ``Miss America is
such a tradition. A lot of people think it's tired and old, but I
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Spector, a flight attendant from New York who has judged
local competitions, said they were told earlier in the day by
pageant officials not to talk about the changes. She said past
changes were made to keep the pageant from growing irrelevant and
to keep the support of sponsors. But she said allowing contestants
to wear sandals or go barefoot was different from allowing divorced
women to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they're losing the younger people,'' she said.
``They're trying to use hipper music. They want the girls to look
more natural. But I think these other changes are too drastic. I
don't know anyone who supports them.''

CNBC INVESTS IN ELECTRONIC STOCK TRADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNBC on Tuesday demonstrated the new willingness of media
companies to move out of the meat-and-potatoes business of news and
into the world of finance itself, taking a 12.4 percent equity
stake in Archipelago, the third-largest electronic communications
network for trading stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In making the cash investment in the network _ which amounted to
close to $30 million, according to a person briefed on the deal _
the financial news cable channel, a unit of General Electric Co.,
is lending its imprimatur to one of the contenders in the
free-for-all among the nine electronic communications networks
currently vying to dominate the new electronic marketplace for
stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors in Archipelago include the Etrade Group Inc.,
Goldman, Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Instinet, which is part of Reuters
Group. Instinet itself, as the largest electronic communications
network in the United States, is also a competitor of Archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the emergence of the electronic
communications network's has been a news event and an investment
opportunity for media companies interested in electronic commerce.
Most networks are registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission as broker-dealers, although they function more like
exchanges because they serve as electronic meeting places for other
broker-dealers and thus facilitate the trades. In August,
Archipelago applied to the SEC to be registered as a stock
exchange, the Internet equivalent of the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC is ``just a great name _ that's a wonderful thing for us,''
said Gerald Putnam, the chief executive of Archipelago, which is
currently the third-largest of the electronic communications
networks, after Instinet and The Island ECN Inc., whose majority
owner is the Internet broker Datek Online Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said that he hoped the presence of two CNBC executives on
Archipelago's board would help persuade the SEC that his network
was not designed simply to serve institutional investors to the
detriment of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is really important to us and really
important to the SEC'' in considering whether to register
Archipelago as an exchange is that ``we have representation of
individual investors, not just big guys,'' Putnam said. CNBC, which
for 10 years has covered financial news for lay audiences helps
fill that need, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the deal raised the issue of whether CNBC could provide
arm's-length coverage of the emerging industry of networks when it
has an investment stake in one of the major players.
</P>
<P>
   Even though other media companies have invested in electronic
networks, they have been, at best, corporate cousins of news
outlets. Dow Jones &AMP; Co., the corporate parent of The Wall Street
Journal, has a stake in Optimark Technologies Inc. Bloomberg LP has
one unit, Bloomberg News, that covers financial news and another,
Tradebook, that functions like a network.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, the former editor of Columbia Journalism Review,
who is also a columnist for CBS Marketwatch, said, ``This gets to
the whole issue of covering yourself and as media companies grow
bigger, they find themselves more and more in the position where
they will be covering themselves and/or covering their competitors
and this is invariably problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb also said that, as the crowded field of electronic networks
thins out, the winners are likely to be companies with the largest
trading volume. So, the logic goes, the more often Island or
Archipelago is mentioned in a financial news broadcast, the more
likely the higher profile will give them a competition advantage.
</P>

   CNBC president Bill Bolster said that CNBC's journalists would
give Archipelago no special treatment. ``We've got to cover them
all equally because our true point is to let everyone know what's
going on everywhere,'' he said.  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Draining the budget surplus for 2000 and thirsty
for more money to finance their spending bills, Republicans will
tap the projected surplus for 2001 for $12 billion or more, the
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said ``a tremendous
surge in defense spending,'' along with requirements for a myriad
of health, science, education and agriculture programs, made it
necessary to use ``some of the surplus for the year 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans need roughly $30 billion now to finance spending
bills for the 2000 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, at a level
that will win enough votes to gain passage by the House and Senate
and, perhaps, President Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we have sort of bumped into a wall,'' said House Majority
Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have sworn off the habit of using Social Security
surpluses to help finance the government. And they say they want to
preserve the strict spending limits, or caps, they imposed in 1997.
The caps cut spending on government agencies other than the
Pentagon by $37 billion, down to $246 billion, for the coming year.
That is not enough to satisfy everyone.
</P>
<P>
   So the extra money may come from increasingly creative
accounting techniques, including drawing down a projected surplus
in the budget for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some are wary. ``We need to be very careful about that,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. ``That shouldn't be used as a
way to get more money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens, who as the Senate's appropriations chairman is
probably the most influential member of Congress on spending,
advocates the technique. At the same time, he is swatting down some
of the more enterprising ideas of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans considered cutting $1 billion or more for
poor and working-class people from the Social Services Block Grant
program, which finances programs like day care and foster care. But
Stevens said these programs had ``been pretty well scrubbed'' and
were unlikely to provide extra billions.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans also considered delaying billions of
dollars in payments to poor and working-class Americans under a
federal tax-credit program. Stevens rejected that idea Tuesday as
``a gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   Other devices will help Congress cobble together the spending
bills, which is the only job the Constitution requires it to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   One is declaring predictable costs like the 2000 census an
``emergency,'' or creating a kind of escrow account for agriculture
aid. Both techniques take billions off the books. Another is taking
money from the projected surplus for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of budget surpluses. One is the Social
Security surplus, which is like a retirement account, and Congress
has vowed not to touch it. The other is the so-called ``on-budget''
surplus, which is like a checking account. That account was
overdrafted for 30 years, until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into the budget for the year after next is a growing
trend. Congress spent $1.9 billion in this fashion in 1996 and
$11.6 billion this year. Stevens said Congress would have to spend
more _ how much, he could not say, though Republican aides said the
sum could reach $20 billion _ to finance the spending bills for the
fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 working days before the fiscal year ends, Congress
making slow progress on spending bills, and the president vowing to
veto bills he says have been cut too deeply, it looks like only
``the aroma of turkey'' at Thanksgiving time will compel Congress
to conclude its appropriations work, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the president vetoes spending bills, and no solution is
reached, the government will have to run on stop-gap bills, called
continuing resolutions, until some compromise is found. Last year,
Congress wound up lashing together a last-minute spending bill that
contained $21 billion in cap-busting expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, including Majority Whip Tom DeLay, say they
intend to blame the President this time if the spending bills
eventually bust the spending caps or siphon off Social Security
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, in a strategic retreat, are now focusing solely
on Social Security. They are no longer talking much about the caps.
</P>
<P>
   In April, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said: ``We intend to stay
within the caps. That was a promise we made to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Republican leaders like Stevens were repeating, like a
mantra, a different line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not the caps, the issue is Social Security,'' the
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the caps would be broken, and he said a $17
billion increase in military spending would be the battering ram
that broke them.

NASA WAITS OUT THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With HURRICANE-FLOYD and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hurricane Floyd not only threatens the southeastern
coast, but also places the nation's manned space program at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and nearby
launching pads at Cape Canaveral Air Station at Patrick Air Force
Base were virtually abandoned Monday and Tuesday as authorities
evacuated all but essential personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But left to ride out the storm are the nation's four space
shuttles, valued at $2 billion apiece; billions of dollars worth of
components for the international space station, and launching pads,
control rooms, radar stations and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said it had done everything possible to protect the
shuttles and other space hardware in hangars and other buildings,
but that their fate would depend on the strength of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tied down, covered and secured everything we can, and
now we're just going to ride it out,'' a NASA spokesman, George
Diller, said Tuesday. ``We know we have a lot at risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller is one of 102 volunteers on a skeleton crew the agency
allowed to stay at the Kennedy center for the duration of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, NASA ordered most of the center's 12,500 workers to
evacuate until at least Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttles Discovery, Endeavour and Columbia are in the
Orbiter Processing Facility, a building where the spacecraft are
refurbished between missions. The building is designed to withstand
winds of up to 105 mph. The ships, supported by scaffolding, have
their landing gear retracted, payload bay doors closed and
tail-mounted main engines covered with bags to protect against
water and debris.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Atlantis is in the sturdier Vehicle Assembly
Building, designed to withstand winds of 125 mph. The Atlantis' bay
doors are closed, and the craft is sitting on its wheels, its
landing gear and engines covered with plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   The space station building contains about 60 percent of the
hardware that will eventually go into the station, a $60 billion
structure that will be assembled above Earth over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because the space center is only nine feet above sea level,
officials worry about flooding from a storm surge. The two
launching pads for the shuttles are particularly vulnerable,
officials said, as are pads at the Air Force station, where four
multimillion-dollar rockets sit awaiting launching.

PANEL URGES STEPPED-UP ATTENTION TO TIES WITH NORTH KOREA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A special Clinton administration panel led by
former Defense Secretary William J. Perry has recommended to the
president that the United States step up diplomatic and trade
relations with North Korea at a ``markedly faster rate'' in hopes
of ending the Communist government's program to develop nuclear
weapons, administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, the officials said, has tentatively accepted
the findings of the panel, which explains his announcement this
week that he is preparing to lift some of the trade sanctions that
have barred commerce with the North for close to half a century.
</P>
<P>
   While encouraging Clinton to seek closer ties, the committee
recommended that the United States maintain its troop strength in
South Korea and that it remain vigilant to new provocations by the
world's last Stalinist government in the North.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few weeks ago, North Korea appeared ready to
test fire a new long-range Taepodong 2 missile that is
theoretically capable of hitting Alaska and Hawaii. Under a
tentative agreement reached this week with the United States at
talks in Berlin, American officials said, North Korea agreed to
hold off on additional missile tests as long as negotiations with
the United States continued.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials were unwilling to release many
of the details of the classified final report prepared by Perry and
his committee and presented to Clinton a few days ago, after eight
months of study.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior officials said the overall conclusion was that it
is better to try to contain North Korea's nuclear ambitions through
negotiation rather than through isolation or confrontation, which
would increase the possibility of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many aspects of North Korea's behavior will remain
reprehensible,'' said a senior American official who agreed to
discuss the report. But the goal, the official said, ``is to end
the nuclear weapons activities and long-range ballistic missile
activities and ultimately to end the Cold War on the Korean
Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel, the official said, recommended that the United States
attempt to improve relations with North Korea at ``a markedly
faster rate, but as North Korea takes steps to address our security
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is certain to revive the question, raised by
congressional critics of the administration's policy toward North
Korea, of whether the administration is rewarding North Korea for
defusing a crisis that it created when it test fired a long-range
missile over Japan in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Perry, who left the Defense Department to return
to business, was asked by Clinton to oversee a full review of
policy toward North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledge that nothing binds the
North to its agreement this week except the fear that whatever
sanctions the United States lifts in coming weeks could be
reimposed.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's brief report _ 18 pages _ recommended that the White
House appoint an ambassador-level senior official to oversee all
aspects of policy toward North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department negotiations with North Korea are being
carried out by Ambassador Charles Kartman, a longtime diplomat. The
new official would apparently have even more senior rank and would
also coordinate policy among the State Department, the Pentagon,
the Treasury Department and other agencies.

SOME FLORIDA RESIDENTS STAYING HOME DESPITE HURRICANE THREAT 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   INDIALANTIC, FLA. _ While hundreds of residents along this
eastern Florida community were packing up valuables and fighting
bumper-to-bumper traffic on their way inland Tuesday, Tony Flohre
had no plans to evacuate despite the threats from Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't here yet,'' Flohre said as he walked toward the beach
on the barrier islands about 60 miles south of Daytona Beach. He
was on his way to visit friends who live only a block from the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I leave,'' Flohre said. ``It may not even hit
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Flohre was practically a loner in the one-square-mile community
that had become a ghost town by noon Tuesday. Most locals heeded
officials' warnings to flee before the Category 4 hurricane hit.
Shops along the main road were closed and boarded up, including
hotels, restaurants and gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Flohre and a handful of other island residents decided to
wait out Floyd's anticipated wrath approached the north-central
Florida coast Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those choosing to stay either weathered similar storms before,
or they simply want to stay with their property. Many believe if
they leave they won't be able to get back. Some live in concrete
houses and think they will hold up under the torrential winds.
</P>
<P>
   The barrier islands are flanked by the Atlantic Ocean on the
east and the Indian River on the west. While theory holds that if
the storm is big enough, the ocean could surge one side while the
river swells and spills over, virtually drowning the islands from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But Flohre doesn't believe the theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens then I guess I'll see what Moses and the
pharaohs saw at the Red Sea,'' Flohre chuckled. ``(Hurricane)
Andrew didn't put the Intercoastal and the Atlantic together. So
I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Flohre, a painter by trade, has lived on the islands for 14
years. He had already worked several hours Tuesday morning but
decided to go home early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have stayed at work longer, but I was worried they
wouldn't let me back on the island later today,'' he said. ``See
that's the problem. When they evacuate you they don't let you come
back right away.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the biggest concern of Linda Burns and Lynn Pucci who
were on their way to the beach Tuesday to videotape trees and
shrubs gusting in the winds that already had begun to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The two recently bought a house and wanted to stay with it
through the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to ride it out and protect what we have,''
Burns said. ``If it gets too intense we'll bail, but we don't want
to be stuck off the islands and basically not be able to get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair spent about a year fixing up the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot into it,'' Pucci said. ``Just to leave it? That's
too hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the river about a block back on the mainland, several
residents of Palm Bay were hunkering down for the storm as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house has solid concrete walls. We've boarded up the
windows. We have a motor home with a generator if the power goes
off,'' said Susan Wendler. ``So we are pretty much
self-contained.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendler and her husband, Mark, moved to the area in 1992 and
live in a small neighborhood off U.S. 1 with their son William. The
highway was littered with downed palm branches and debris but
remained passable Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous,'' Susan Wendler said. ``But I'd be more
nervous trying to get out of here with all that traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m. EST Tuesday parts of Interstate 95 and Florida 528
were lined with cars for dozens of miles. Most of the traffic had
subsided by 4 p.m. when rain showers began to drench the area.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Wendlers decide to stay, they took precautions
to ensure their safety. They loaded up on supplies and fresh water
Monday, and spent most of Tuesday securing the house with boards,
putting lawn furniture in the swimming pool and moving anything
that might become airborne away from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago when Hurricane Erin ravaged the area, the
Wendlers saw 100 mph winds and lost only a car antenna.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one wasn't too bad,'' Susan Wendler said. ``It just
sounded like wolves and it was like a snow white blizzard even
though it was midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wendlers know about blizzards, having survived one in Ohio
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather go through one of these,'' Mark Wendler said.
``If I was in a wooden house I might be concerned. But I'll take my
chances here.''
</P>
<P>
   Their next door neighbor Bill Dorman was going to try to weather
the storm in his wooden house. His wife, who recently had surgery,
opted to evacuate while he stayed to protect against looters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got too much here,'' Dorman said. ``But I am taking
calculated risks. I've been tracking the storm closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorman said his house was built in the 1960s and has withstood
many storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty steady house but if I hear the roof creaking and
the walls start to move I'll go to the neighbors,'' Dorman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wendlers have offered their home to Dorman, even suggesting
they tie a rope from his door to theirs so he can find his way if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In Port Malabar, just south of Palm Bay, Bill and Kathy George
were planning to stay as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to stay _ it's as simple as that,'' said
Kathy George. ``We've never been through one that was too much to
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   During Hurricane Erin, Bill George sat in a chair on the front
porch to watch the winds blow by.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one had 100-mph winds. And it didn't bother me a bit,''
Bill George said. ``But I'm not going to watch this one. This one
is a little too big.``
</P>
<P>
   In New Smyrna Beach, 10 miles south of Daytona Beach, sheriff's
Deputy Bruce Fleischmann told The Assocciated Press: ``We're not
going to arrest people for staying. We just ask for their next of
kin.''

 MARC JACOBS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE '70s  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)(jt) 
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a career with more ups and downs than an elevator in the
World Trade Center, Marc Jacobs has been riding high in the last
few years, with a devoted following of young fashion editors and
their friends who look so right in his slick yet youthful clothes.
Those cashmeres in luscious colors. Those simply cut dresses with
pretty details like scalloped hems. And then there's his success in
making Louis Vuitton a name to be reckoned with in ready-to-wear as
well as in handbags.
</P>
<P>
   In his signature collection last season, Jacobs mined the 1970s
with flaring calf-length skirts shown with chunky-heeled boots and
multicolored striped sweaters. For the spring 2000 collection he
showed on Monday night, he gravitated to another aspect of the 70s,
rediscovering denim. But not the decorated kind that Tom Ford
revived for Gucci, setting off a flood of cheap imitations.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs used denim in soft shades of green, pinkish coral and tan
cut into sleek versions of jeans and jeans skirts, sometimes adding
curved yokes or pockets with sunburst seaming. He teamed them with
gauzy cashmere T-shirts and highly styled versions of the jeans
jacket that women have been tossing over just about everything in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   High-heeled sandals added a feminine touch to the denim suits,
which were the most likable styles in the show and the styles
likely to prove the most commercially successful. You could
envision not only fashion editors but also lots of other women
adopting them as a comfortable middle ground between a casual and
an uptight way of dressing for all kinds of occasions.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jacobs' dresses tended to look old-fashioned, not
only the A-line styles with set-in waistbands but also the
chrysanthemum-patterned waistless shifts and the cotton net dresses
decorated with bands of sequins that ended the show. Let's call the
show a qualified success.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned is a term no one would ever apply to Yeohlee's
clothes, which are as modern as the latest techno fabric yet as
comfortable as a bathrobe. She uses cotton coated with Teflon so it
doesn't stain, and wools and gabardines that are machine washable.
But they would never be mistaken for mass-produced drip-drys, at
least not to anyone who recognizes masterly cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The spring collection she showed Tuesday is in neutral stone,
concrete and teak tones inspired by building materials. (She has
always considered clothing another form of shelter.) Unlined
translucent raincoats and capes are in a lightweight nylon perfect
for travel, whether across town or across a continent. Attached
hoods make umbrellas unnecessary. Even whimsical pockets cut like
mittens are utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Yeohlee's cuts are precise and deceptively simple. What looks
like a straight skirt has triangles inserted into the hem for ease
of movement. A boxy vest has an L-shaped pocket. That rounded
collar is really an ellipse. Two curves and a square of fabric are
combined to form a shawl.
</P>
<P>
   The metallic gold silk she uses for evening pieces has a dull
rather than a glittery finish. She combines it with putty-colored
silk Jacquards for tank tops with deep U-necks or V-necks, narrow
trousers and skirts with inset triangles or a soft saronglike fold
on one side.
</P>
<P>
   A Yeohlee collection never sets off fireworks. But the clothes
have gained a cult following among women in the art and fashion
worlds with an eye for subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   The evening wear of Mark Badgley and James Mischka is another
story entirely. There, beading and decoration are the magnets to
women who want to be noticed. But for spring, the lavishness of the
embellishment has been tempered. Instead of all-over beading, most
of the clothes have a light sprinkling of beads or seemingly random
placements of delicately beaded flowers. A few Badgley Mischka
dresses have just one spot of jeweled embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrics, too, are light, running to georgette, tulle, organza
and lace. And there is an emphasis on separates, usually a beaded
top with a bias-cut satin skirt or narrow taffeta pants. Color, on
the other hand, is used lavishly, from pale tones like melon,
lavender and peach to stronger shades of pink, salmon and
turquoise. Sometimes a pale shade was layered over a deeper tone.
The parade of colors was like a massive bowl of rainbow sugar,
either tempting or cloying, depending on your taste.
</P>
<P>
   Black? Forget it. The fashion world has practically turned its
back on its longtime favorite. Designers may be forgiven for
indulging in prettified colors for spring, as long as they don't
make a habit of it. But what about women who don't want to look
like ingenues? Maybe Badgley Mischka, as well as some other
designers, will go back to thinking about them next season.
</P>
<P>
   Zang Toi always thinks about the women who wear his clothes, who
tend to be the moneyed variety who like a bit of dash as long as it
comes with good fabrics and workmanship. The designer has been
dressing them for a while now in impeccably tailored suits, coats
lined with unusual scarf prints matched to shirts or dresses, and
evening dresses that are slender columns or doorway-filling ball
gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that he seems to have fallen into a rut. About
the only thing in the collection that changes is the pattern of his
scarf prints. This time there are two: one he calls My Dream of
Africa, populated with people and camels, and another is African
Night, which features a tiger with coiling tail. Perhaps he thought
leopards have been overexposed. But tigers in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   Not content with its reputation as an innovative leather-goods
house famous for its woven handbags, Bottega Veneta is trying to
follow the likes of Gucci and Vuitton into the realm of
ready-to-wear. After two seasons of showing in Milan, Laura
Moltedo, the president of the company, brought the collection to
New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   There were some nice things, particularly caviar-beaded
sweaters, buttonless jackets loosely belted over shorts, strapless
tops tied in back like pareos and, as might be expected, leather
jackets. But much of the collection was just uninspired, with
shapeless jumpsuits and hip-slung skirts worn with loose tops that
were unflattering.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson has always gone her own way, even when it veered
precipitously from the direction fashion was heading. Now that
decoration, color and pattern are back, she would seem to be right
on track. But rather than simply showing her spring line in a way
that might make it look like what some other designers are doing
(heaven forbid!), Ms. Johnson opted for a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hiring models, she called on friends and loyal
customers and invited them to style themselves. ``I wanted to show
the clothes on my customers, tall and short, small and big,'' she
said in a chat before the show. ``For three days last week they
came in and picked clothes. I didn't put outfits together. I hung
the tops here and the bottoms there and let them loose. They took
them home, picked their own accessories and are doing their own
hair and makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   And they came out, rock singers, artists, students, employees of
the designer, the shop owner Patricia Field, Steven Tyler's wife
and daughter, and Ms. Johnson's own daughter, sister and niece
wearing floral georgette, embroidered satin, peasant skirts,
bikinis, sarongs, ruffled net coats, patchwork skirts and jeans
with ruffled hems a la Cher.
</P>
<P>
   It was pure Betsey Johnson.

ORACLE SHARES TUMBLE AFTER DISAPPOINTING EARNINGS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares of Oracle Corp. dropped sharply in
after-hours trading Tuesday evening after the company reported
first-quarter earnings that met the published consensus estimate of
analysts but fell short of the so-called whisper number.
</P>
<P>
   Whisper numbers are the last-minute adjustments analysts make to
their forecasts that they informally mention to clients and traders
just before companies report results.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Oracle reported earnings of
$236.7 million, or 16 cents a diluted share, up 21 percent from
$195 million, or 13 cents a share, in the comparable period a year
ago. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $1.98 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings number matched the consensus estimate as reported
by First Call Corp., which tracks corporate earnings, but the
whisper number had been as much as 19 cents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's revenue growth also fell short of
their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle posted its results after the close of the market. Its
shares closed for the day at $45.4375, down 31.25 cents, in NASDAQ
trading. But in after-hours trading, they fell as low as $41.
Analysts predicted a big sell-off on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's announcement, Oracle's share price had tripled
from a 52-week low of $14.875 hit early last October. In June,
Oracle reported unexpectedly strong results for its fourth quarter
and announced plans to cut $1 billion from operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock had traded up very aggressively in advance of this
earnings release on expectations they would at least hit the
whisper number, if not do better,'' said William Epifanio, an
analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``I see unimpressive revenue growth, and
they clearly cut some costs to make the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Oracle chief financial
officer Jeff Henley said, ``We're glad to get Q-1 behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit slower than we would have liked,'' he
continued, ``but I don't think we have a very different feeling for
the year. Our business is healthy. This is always a seasonally slow
quarter, and we just didn't get quite as many big deals finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Software sales growth slowed significantly from the fourth
quarter. Over all, first-quarter software licenses and other
revenue grew 9 percent from the corresponding period last year,
compared with 22 percent year-over-year growth in the fourth
quarter. Data-base revenue grew by 8 percent to $443 million, and
applications software sales rose 11 percent, to $109 million,
compared with the first quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, data-base revenues grew by 25 percent,
while application sales grew by 28 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Facing a volley of hostile questions from analysts, Oracle
chairman and chief executive Lawrence Ellison said: ``One quarter
does not make a trend. Place your bets, gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Oracle historically had weak first quarters and
bounced back in its second quarters. ``It's not a matter of us
asking you to believe we will do something we've never done
before,'' he said. ``We think we're going to have a very strong
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that sales of enterprise software, the big packages
made by SAP, Peoplesoft and Baan that companies use to manage
internal business processes, had slowed, and with it the Oracle
data bases that feed such applications. But he said deployment of
Internet-based sales operations had boomed and that Oracle had a 93
percent market share of this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for the move to the Internet,'' Ellison said. ``The
growth of the Internet is largely offsetting the slowdown in SAP
installations, Peoplesoft installations, Baan installations. That's
where our growth is coming from.''

 &HT;    South Florida saved from Floyd's wrath
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ All that stood between Palm Beach County
and Floyd's knockout punch was what a former National Hurricane
Center director liked to call a ``meteorological gnat's eyelash.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin between a catastrophic once-in-a-century monster
hurricane and the wimpy winds we actually got was that thin.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to about 50 miles and just a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Still, our skin-of-the-teeth escape was causing residents of
Georgia and the Carolinas to grind theirs.
</P>
<P>
   And it left us asking how the weather forecasters were able to
make a call so on-the-money it would make a bookie proud.
</P>
<P>
   They kept on telling us Floyd would flinch. But as we watched
and waited ... and waited ... and waited, we were the ones doing
all the flinching.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd kept us on the edge of our seats, glued to the TV while
our innards roiled as furiously as his feeder bands. If he was
going to turn, we wanted him to get on with it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many wondered if the meteorologists hadn't flubbed it.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not scientists for nothing. Their confidence wobbled
a smidge, but only a smidge. For it was founded on their faith in
this decade's computer technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Pinball wizards
</P>
<P>
   And Floyd didn't fail them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the forecasters said he would, Floyd turned Monday
night, just about the time TV viewers were dividing their attention
between the grim reality of the hurricane and the blessed
distraction of the Miami Dolphins' kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters were absorbed in a much more difficult sport.
</P>
<P>
   Try to imagine the Atlantic Ocean as one of those old tabletop
electric football games where the little players vibrate across the
board, bounce off one another and career off in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   The atmospheric action is the same, but with some direction.
</P>
<P>
   High-pressure ridges, low-pressure troughs and the jet stream
crowd the weather map, battling for dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is try to figure how this jigsaw puzzle in motion will
come together. It was a much gamier proposition a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing from Gonzo
</P>
<P>
   Technology has dramatically improved the odds.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of satellites spew constant pictures from space.
Earth-bound weather instruments provide a different perspective.
Most important are the buoys, ships and planes on the sea and above
it. That's where the action really is.
</P>
<P>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's armada
collects the crucial readings. And flying the point is a new $45
million jet armed with 1-pound weather stations it drops from 8
miles above the roiling Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Its nickname: Gonzo.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists on-board climb 41,000 feet before opening the
tiny door in the air lock. The concentrated outside air screeches
as a $500 mini-weather station is jettisoned out of Gonzo's belly,
plummeting 80 feet a second.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping a stream of data at two bursts per second, the 2-foot
long unit _ a little longer and a little narrower than a 1-1/2
liter water bottle _ feeds the researchers on board a smorgasbord
of readings that will be condensed and sent to hurricane
forecasting computers in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After crunching those numbers for hours, the computers spit out
a colorful map showing where the ever-strengthening Floyd is
headed.
</P>
<P>
   For nine hours Sunday, the Gulfstream-IV zigzagged: approaching
Bermuda, heading down to the southern Bahamas, and eventually
overflying Miami, skirting Floyd's powerful western edge.
</P>
<P>
   The missions average $25,000 a flight; Gonzo was expected to
make at least one more trip around Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   But forecasters credit the 1997 advent of the plane _ and the
revolution in computer technology _ with helping them reduce by as
much as 20 percent the size of their forecast window. For example,
with Andrew in 1992, they might have been able to earlier shrink
the hurricane warning area, which stretched from Vero Beach to Key
West even as Andrew came aground at Homestead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every mile of coastline you don't put under a (hurricane)
warning, you save $1 million'' in private and public costs stemming
from unnecessary evacuations, engineer Alan Goldstein shrugs. ``For
every 50 miles we don't put under a warning, we pay for this
airplane, and then some.''
</P>
<P>
   NOAA now boasts a fleet of 14 aircraft, including Gonzo and two
DeHavilland Twin Otter propeller planes, also named for Muppet
characters, Kermit and Miss Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's mission covered about 4,300 miles, aiming not at Floyd
but around it.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo made 23 drops _ one every 120 to180 miles, or every 15 to
20 minutes _ probing the various weather systems interacting with
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Technology with a human touch
</P>
<P>
   But it's the leap in computer capability that turns all of this
diverse information _ a jumble of numbers _ into ``models'' that
reflect possible scenarios for the storm's path.
</P>
<P>
   ``The models are more sophisticated now,'' forecaster Bill
Frederick said Tuesday morning from the National Hurricane Center
at Florida International University, west of Miami. ``They improve
them every year.''
</P>
<P>
   In Floyd's case, the key was the trough running along the East
Coast. Everything depended on the timing and location of its
collision with Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   How fast was the trough dropping south? And how fast was Floyd
propelling its destruction westward?
</P>
<P>
   That was further complicated by Floyd's sheer size. As it
continued to swell beyond comprehension, it began to influence the
trough as much as the trough influenced it.
</P>
<P>
   And just like a giant barge, the storm had so much momentum any
turn was sure to be lengthy and not very sharp, Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, they don't make right turns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the giant strides in computer technology, it still
took forecasters to synthesize the machines' educated guesses about
where and when Floyd would turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of the (models) was consistent on the turn,''
Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   The trick was to predict which of them was most likely to be on
target in terms of where and when the turn would occur.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite all the technology, forecasters don't admit
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they agreed with calls for evacuations as far south
as Homestead, kept hurricane warnings up for the entire Florida
east coast, and sweated along with the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred miles is all the difference between whether it hits
Florida or not,'' research meteorologist John Kaplan said. ``Most
24-hour forecasts average a 100-mile margin of error.''

WATCHWORDS FOR MOST FOLKS AROUND FLORIDA: `STAY INSIDE' 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Fla. _ A sign in front of a tiny, boarded-up antique
store along all-but-abandoned U.S. 1 just south of here captured
Tuesday's thought for the day for all Floridians and anyone else
passing by:
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd _ Go Back in the Void,'' it proclaimed to the handful of
drivers headed north along the famous old highway that runs from
Key West to Jacksonville, hugging the Atlantic coastline all the
way.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Hurricane Floyd did return to the void, at least
as far as South Florida is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, the storm's northward path toward possible
landfall in South Carolina had convinced many Miami residents to
assume that the worst, such as it was, was over. They weren't
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among signs that folks across South Florida were ready for
life to return to normal was a flood of phone calls to emergency
officials asking if schools would re-open Wednesday. The answer:
Probably not but stand by.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the moderating weather conditions, plywood stayed on
windows and hurricane shutters remained locked down on buildings
and homes across Miami and through the coastal cities trailing off
to the northward.
</P>
<P>
   The watchwords for most folks around here continued to be ``stay
inside.'' Traffic along U.S. 1 and parallel Interstate 95 was
virtually nil all afternoon. A few truckers and the rare state
trooper had the pavement to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Near Melbourne, hotels on the barrier island just offshore were
evacuated as a precaution as winds and squalls picked up. Only a
handful of gas stations were operating. Restaurants and stores were
shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Told that in Miami, surfers were testing the waves, one local
storeowner just shrugged: ``Well, that's Miami for you. It's not
over for us _ or them.``
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the afternoon turnout of surfers, skaters and
wave-kickers at Miami Beach was troubling to emergency officials,
who again and again used radio and TV time to warn people to stay
put.
</P>
<P>
   But one surfer spoke for all when he was asked about the
still-extant hurricane warning: ``What hurricane? The waves are
good and if it gets worse, I'll leave. It's not often you see waves
like this.``
</P>
<P>
   Others milling along the shoreline said they figured the
occasionally gusty wind and intermittent, spray-like showers were
as bad as it would get.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our vacation and we're going to use it the best we can
within reason,'' said one father, on vacation with his wife and two
children from Illinois, as they stared out into the Atlantic
looking for the elusive hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being careful, but right now it seems OK to walk down to
the beach for a little while.``

REPUBLICANS STEP UP ATTACK ON CLINTON'S RUSSIA POLICY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans ratcheted up their attack
on President Clinton's Russia policy on Tuesday, expanding the
scope of hearings into the Russian banking scandal and Washington's
dealings with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The House International Relations and Senate Foreign Relations
committees announced that they would hold separate, wide-ranging
hearings later this month about American policy toward Russia. The
House Banking Committee said hearings it had previously announced
would begin on Sept. 21 to examine allegations of Russian
corruption and money-laundering, possibly including the diversion
of billions of dollars in international aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Economic Committee, a leading critic of the
International Monetary Fund's lending practices, especially to
Russia, announced that it would review the fund's plan to create a
financial mechanism to derive income from gold it owns.
</P>
<P>
   The volleys fired from Capitol Hill left no doubt that
Republican leaders intend to use the economic turmoil and widening
reports of corruption in Russia as a campaign issue against
Democrats through the 2000 elections. ``The Clinton
administration's Russia policy is the greatest U.S. foreign policy
failure since Vietnam,'' declared Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the
majority leader. ``The stated purpose of the Clinton-Gore policy
was to help Russia become a peaceful and productive free-market
democracy. Instead, Russia has become a looted and bankrupt zone of
nuclearized anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, accused the
administration of blocking a domestic tax cut bill at the same time
U.S. aid to Russia was being ``stolen by Russian thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, DeLay and other House Republicans spoke to reporters
moments after the House approved a measure, 419-0, to punish
foreign enterprises or institutions, especially from Russia, that
provide sensitive missile technology or expertise to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has expressed growing alarm at Iran's drive to build
long-range missiles that could hit American troops and allies, and
frustration with Russia for failing to curb the export of missile
know-how. Clinton, who vetoed a similar bill last year, has said
the legislation could further strain relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats counterattacked throughout the day, accusing
Republicans of political opportunism for trying to link Vice
President Gore to the failure of economic reform in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there have been some mistakes made,'' said Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader. ``But we've been
trying to help Russia get through the extremely difficult
transition from communism to capitalism. If the alternative is to
stand to one side, do nothing and hope Russia figures it out on its
own, then that is a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council, David C. Leavy,
defended the administration's Russia policy, citing advances in
individual liberties for Russians, nuclear arms reductions and the
withdrawal of Russian troops from Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a leading pollster, criticized the congressional
Republican strategy. He said the Russian banking scandal does not
yet affect ``Americans in their day-to-day lives.'' He added, ``If
Republicans are trying to draw a political connection now, it ain't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has surfaced so far of the laundering of siphoned
aid provided by the United States or the IMF, but the
administration remains politically vulnerable on the issue.
Administration officials are likely to be grilled on what they knew
of a Justice Department inquiry into Russian corruption before the
investigation became public, and what steps they took to pressure
Moscow to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and American investigators met Tuesday in Washington,
largely to discuss the money-laundering accusations, a Justice
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Russian scandal, critics of the IMF got added
ammunition Tuesday in the form of an independent report
commissioned by the monetary fund on its efforts to analyze
economic conditions around the world. Although it praised the
quality of the fund's work in many areas, the report found that the
IMF had failed to anticipate the severity of the Asian financial
crisis and did not foresee the degree to which problems in one
country could spill over into others.
</P>
<P>
   The fund published a response Tuesday defending its research but
acknowledging that it could make improvements.

A DAY OF DEBATE AND FORCED ALLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Also see CONGRESS-FUNDRAISING)  
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a rare moment on the floor of the House of
Representatives, two congressmen actually debating each other face
to face rather than delivering monologues and sitting down.
</P>
<P>
   The whole issue of campaign finance rules hit home to him, said
Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., when he learned on Tuesday that unions
had bought television time in his district to run campaign
advertisements against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign for re-election in the Fourth District of Kansas
began today,'' Tiahrt declared.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that it was monumentally unfair for unions to use
compulsory dues from members to finance campaign activities. Real
campaign-finance reform, he asserted, would require specific
approval from union members before their dues could be spent on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   This line of thinking baffled Rep. Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, the chief Republican sponsor of the main legislation
under consideration. The measure would ban donations of unregulated
soft money and would limit attack advertisements masquerading as
issues ads.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the floor, Shays observed that unions have been
prohibited from donating money directly to candidates since 1947.
So the commercials planned against Tiahrt must be unregulated issue
advertisements, Shays said, the very kind of advertisements that
his legislation would restrict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' Shays said, ``it would be impossible for those ads to
run against you if our legislation passed, and that's why I'm
dumbfounded you do not support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiahrt seemed flustered. ``I don't expect even if your law
passed, there would be any enforcement,'' he said, as his allotted
time expired.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the lawmakers took the high road, speaking of
what the proposed changes in the campaign-finance law would mean
for the American system of government and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., said the legislation would ``make
elections as honest and open as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., argued that it
would stifle free speech and that ``without free political speech,
our great experiment cannot continue to thrive in the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But this high-minded oratory aside, what was clearly at the
forefront of the representatives' minds, as the Tiahrt-Shays
exchange illustrated, was their own political experiences. After
all, money is a tool of the politician's trade, just as hammers are
to carpenters and hoes are to gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, Shays observed, ``is very personal to each and every
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the senior member of the House,
recalled that in his first campaign for Congress in 1955, he spent
only $19,000. In some campaigns since then, said Dingell, a
Democrat who supported the campaign-finance legislation, he has
spent more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., asked if his colleagues
remembered when the big campaign-finance question involved
donations by political action committees. ``I certainly do,''
Doolittle, an opponent of Tuesday's measure, said, ``because it was
an issue in my campaigns in '90 and '92.''
</P>
<P>
   But the debate was not completely dominated by personal
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of hyperbole, as when Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y., said campaign finance was the single biggest issue since
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   There was clear evidence of Democrats' exasperation with the
first family. Forty-six of them disregarded Hoyer's admonition
against ``petty politics'' and joined Republicans on an amendment
that would require Hillary Rodham Clinton to pay the cost of her
security detail when she makes campaign trips on government planes.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no shortage of strained metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what we do to ants in the kitchen?'' asked
Doolittle. ``We wipe them out,'' he answered, suggesting that was
what the legislation before the House would mean for political free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-Ore., compared the current system of
campaign finance to payments by football players to referees.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., accused Republicans of
devising rules for Tuesday's debate that required supporters of the
legislation to ``navigate a minefield of poison pills.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also one attempt at literary allusion. It backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Rivers, D-Mich., said the campaign-finance legislation
reminded her of Edgar Allen Poe's ``Tell-Tale Heart.'' No matter
how hard opponents try to kill it, Ms. Rivers explained, ``the
heart of reform will keep beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Ms. Rivers, Rep. Bill Thomas, one of the
bill's leading opponents, knows his Poe. In the short story, the
heart that would not stop beating was a hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no true heartbeat,'' said Thomas, R-Calif., just as
in his view, the legislation before the House did not amount to
true campaign-finance reform.

SMALL, LOCAL PHONE CARRIERS GO IN SEARCH OF BIG SUITORS

 (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Psst, wanna buy a phone company?
</P>
<P>
   That is not quite how Wall Street takeover pitches are made, but
it captures the gist of the calls that have gone out across the
telecommunications industry recently as at least a few competitive
local exchange carriers _ young communications companies trying to
compete against the Bells in local phone and data communications
markets _ look to be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives on Wall Street and in the
telecommunications industry, E.Spire Communications Inc., GST
Telecommunications Inc., ICG Communications Inc. and Intermedia
Communications Inc. are among the competitive local exchange
carriers, (or CLECs, pronounced ``SEE-lecks''), that have recently
canvassed or are currently canvassing for potential acquirers,
generally with the help of big-name investment banks. With an
average market value of $750 million, those four carriers are
fairly representative of the middle of the CLEC industry.
</P>
<P>
   But, so far, there have been no takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search for scale and capital happened at this stage of the
game for wireless, at this stage of the game for cable and is
happening now for the CLEC's,'' said Mark Bruneau, president of the
business strategy group at Renaissance Worldwide, a consulting firm
in Boston. ``Some entrepreneurs have done a good job of getting
licenses and growing businesses to a certain scale, and now they're
realizing that they need the kinds of things that large phone
companies are really good at, like scalable customer acquisition
and billing. And those things are generally absent from these
CLECs, and they have grown as much as they can in an
entrepreneurial spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   E.Spire, GST and ICG declined to comment. Intermedia chairman
David Ruberg declined to comment on any potential deals but seemed
to echo Bruneau in saying, ``Cost of capital, cost of customer
acquisition and cost of network are the driving forces in this
industry, and we are in constant discussions about how to reduce
those costs.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The main way to reduce costs is to get bigger, analysts say, and
often the fastest way to get bigger is to merge or be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the competitive carriers that emerged in the wake of the
deregulatory Telecommunications Act of 1996, hoping for easy
pickings in local communications markets, have found competing
against the regional Bell companies more difficult and expensive
than they expected. Many are laden with debt and need to raise yet
more money _ generally in the high-yield market _ to continue
ripping up streets and building local communications networks. In
addition, the wild gyrations that many CLEC stocks have gone
through over the last year or so may have scared off potential
investors. Some analysts and communications executives have been
predicting a wave of consolidation among the competitive carriers
since last fall. It has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   But if the stock market manages to avoid the paroxysms that have
struck during the last two Octobers, that could change quickly in
the coming weeks and months. For all of their stock volatility,
many CLECs have built valuable fiber optic networks in cities and
towns across the nation and have won many business customers away
from the Bells.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the (somewhat meager) prospects for consolidation
among the smaller CLECs themselves, there are at least three groups
of communications companies that may find them attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The first group is larger competitive local carriers looking to
expand geographically or expand their menu of services. This group
includes McLeodUSA Inc., Nextlink Communications Inc., Teligent
Inc. and Winstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent and Winstar have almost identical market values of
about $3 billion and both companies generally use advanced wireless
technology to serve business customers rather than traditional
copper or fiber optic links. Nonetheless, both companies could be
interested in expanding their fiber optic offerings, according to
executives close to the companies. Nextlink is backed by Craig
McCaw, the cellular telephone legend. McLeodUSA, one of the oldest
and most-respected CLECs, in August received a $1 billion infusion
from Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. in exchange for a 12 percent equity
stake in the company. McLeod may well use that money to underwrite
new construction, but could also use the cash to buy assets rather
than build them, some Wall Street executives said. (Forstmann was
not alone among buyout shops investing in CLECs this summer; in
July, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. agreed to invest up to $110
million in privately-held Birch Telecom Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   The second group of potential CLEC acquirers are the new breed
of long-distance carriers including Qwest Communications, Level 3
Communications and Global Crossing. All three of those companies
have generated market values in the billions as they have built or
agreed to buy advanced new long-distance networks around the nation
and, in Global Crossing's case, under the seas. But each of those
companies may look to extend their networks into cities and office
parks around the nation much as Worldcom did in 1996 by acquiring
MFS Communications, one of the first big CLECs, and as AT&AMP;T did
last year in acquiring Teleport. Qwest has appeared particularly
aggressive in exploring CLEC acquisition possibilities, but for now
may be preoccupied with its pending acquisition of U S West,
according to executives close to Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   The third, and perhaps most intriguing, group of candidates to
acquire some of the lonely-heart CLECs is the regional Bells
themselves, especially SBC Communications Inc. and Bell Atlantic
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its deal with the Federal Communications Commission
to win approval of its pending acquisition of Ameritech Corp., SBC
agreed to expand into 30 local communications markets in which it
is not currently active. As Bell Atlantic seeks approval of its
pending merger with GTE Corp., it seems likely that Bell Atlantic
will have to agree to similar conditions. Faced with the prospect
of having to deploy networks quickly in dozens of new markets,
acquiring a CLEC that already operates in those places could seem
reasonable, according to Wall Street executives. A problem arises,
however, if that CLEC already provides competition in the Bell's
home territory. In that case, such a deal could be seen as
anticompetitive.

SOME FLORIDA RESIDENTS STAYING HOME DESPITE HURRICANE THREAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to clarify lede) 
 
By LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIALANTIC, FLA. _ While hundreds of residents along the
eastern Florida coast were packing up valuables and fighting
bumper-to-bumper traffic on their way inland Tuesday, Tony Flohre
had no plans to evacuate despite the threats from Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't here yet,'' Flohre said as he walked toward the beach
of this community on the barrier islands about 60 miles south of
Daytona Beach. He was on his way to visit friends who live only a
block from the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I leave,'' Flohre said. ``It may not even hit
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Flohre was practically a loner in the one-square-mile community
that had become a ghost town by noon Tuesday. Most locals heeded
officials' warnings to flee before the Category 4 hurricane hit.
Shops along the main road were closed and boarded up, including
hotels, restaurants and gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Flohre and a handful of other island residents decided to
wait out Floyd's anticipated wrath approached the north-central
Florida coast Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those choosing to stay either weathered similar storms before,
or they simply want to stay with their property. Many believe if
they leave they won't be able to get back. Some live in concrete
houses and think they will hold up under the torrential winds.
</P>
<P>
   The barrier islands are flanked by the Atlantic Ocean on the
east and the Indian River on the west. While theory holds that if
the storm is big enough, the ocean could surge one side while the
river swells and spills over, virtually drowning the islands from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But Flohre doesn't believe the theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens then I guess I'll see what Moses and the
pharaohs saw at the Red Sea,'' Flohre chuckled. ``(Hurricane)
Andrew didn't put the Intercoastal and the Atlantic together. So
I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Flohre, a painter by trade, has lived on the islands for 14
years. He had already worked several hours Tuesday morning but
decided to go home early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have stayed at work longer, but I was worried they
wouldn't let me back on the island later today,'' he said. ``See
that's the problem. When they evacuate you they don't let you come
back right away.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the biggest concern of Linda Burns and Lynn Pucci who
were on their way to the beach Tuesday to videotape trees and
shrubs gusting in the winds that already had begun to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The two recently bought a house and wanted to stay with it
through the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to ride it out and protect what we have,''
Burns said. ``If it gets too intense we'll bail, but we don't want
to be stuck off the islands and basically not be able to get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair spent about a year fixing up the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot into it,'' Pucci said. ``Just to leave it? That's
too hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the river about a block back on the mainland, several
residents of Palm Bay were hunkering down for the storm as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house has solid concrete walls. We've boarded up the
windows. We have a motor home with a generator if the power goes
off,'' said Susan Wendler. ``So we are pretty much
self-contained.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendler and her husband, Mark, moved to the area in 1992 and
live in a small neighborhood off U.S. 1 with their son William. The
highway was littered with downed palm branches and debris but
remained passable Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous,'' Susan Wendler said. ``But I'd be more
nervous trying to get out of here with all that traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m. EST Tuesday parts of Interstate 95 and Florida 528
were lined with cars for dozens of miles. Most of the traffic had
subsided by 4 p.m. when rain showers began to drench the area.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Wendlers decide to stay, they took precautions
to ensure their safety. They loaded up on supplies and fresh water
Monday, and spent most of Tuesday securing the house with boards,
putting lawn furniture in the swimming pool and moving anything
that might become airborne away from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago when Hurricane Erin ravaged the area, the
Wendlers saw 100 mph winds and lost only a car antenna.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one wasn't too bad,'' Susan Wendler said. ``It just
sounded like wolves and it was like a snow white blizzard even
though it was midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wendlers know about blizzards, having survived one in Ohio
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather go through one of these,'' Mark Wendler said.
``If I was in a wooden house I might be concerned. But I'll take my
chances here.''
</P>
<P>
   Their next door neighbor Bill Dorman was going to try to weather
the storm in his wooden house. His wife, who recently had surgery,
opted to evacuate while he stayed to protect against looters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got too much here,'' Dorman said. ``But I am taking
calculated risks. I've been tracking the storm closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorman said his house was built in the 1960s and has withstood
many storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty steady house but if I hear the roof creaking and
the walls start to move I'll go to the neighbors,'' Dorman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wendlers have offered their home to Dorman, even suggesting
they tie a rope from his door to theirs so he can find his way if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In Port Malabar, just south of Palm Bay, Bill and Kathy George
were planning to stay as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to stay _ it's as simple as that,'' said
Kathy George. ``We've never been through one that was too much to
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   During Hurricane Erin, Bill George sat in a chair on the front
porch to watch the winds blow by.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one had 100-mph winds. And it didn't bother me a bit,''
Bill George said. ``But I'm not going to watch this one. This one
is a little too big.``
</P>
<P>
   In New Smyrna Beach, 10 miles south of Daytona Beach, sheriff's
Deputy Bruce Fleischmann told The Assocciated Press: ``We're not
going to arrest people for staying. We just ask for their next of
kin.''

PROUD BUT CONCERNED, TRIBUNAL PROSECUTOR LEAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ The head of the Bosnian Serb army was
casually sipping coffee with colleagues in Vienna one morning in
August when he was suddenly called away. The officer, Gen. Momir
Talic, could not have expected what happened next: the Austrian
police arrested him on charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of Talic, the highest ranking suspect seized so
far by the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia, did not make the splash of the court's earlier
indictment of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, but it
was stunning nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Arbour, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, had special
reason to be pleased. By sending her arrest warrant to Austria, she
had circumvented NATO officials, some of whom knew of the secret
indictment of the general, a key commander during the 1992-95 war
in Bosnia, but still held meetings with him in Bosnia without
arresting him.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Arbour leaves her post to take a seat on the Supreme
Court of Canada on Sept. 15, the general's arrest in Austria also
provides a final, dramatic chance to underscore a near obsession:
she is convinced that for an international tribunal to function,
countries must carry out its edicts.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years she has held the highly visible and complex
office of chief prosecutor at the international tribunals for both
the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, Mrs. Arbour, 52, has drawn both
wide applause and criticism. But even her critics concede that she
has helped transform the institutions, long seen as weak and
peripheral, into more credible forces that both law-abiding nations
and outlaws must reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived, there was this perception outside and inside
that we had to be really nice to be effective, that we had to beg
for witnesses and documents and be quite deferential and polite,''
she recalled in an interview. ``We had to be in this cooperative
mode. This struck me as totally incompatible with our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolute Mrs. Arbour dropped the deferential mode, reminding
governments that United Nations tribunals are not there to practice
well-mannered diplomacy but to apply criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest evidence of this new assertiveness was the way she
obtained the indictment of Milosevic this spring during NATO's
bombing of his country. Mrs. Arbour has rarely discussed her
strategy with outsiders, but in the interview she explained why she
had sought the indictment before a peace agreement was reached,
even as Western governments feared it could derail efforts to end
the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a hurry,'' she said. ``I thought we might miss out as
peace was being discussed. I thought he might be able to negotiate
a deal for his departure.''
</P>
<P>
   To gain time, she decided to set aside possible charges of
genocide because they would have delayed the process. Such charges
can be added later, she said. With the indictment in place, she
added, any country that gives asylum to Milosevic will pay a ``a
very high price.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment is now seen as a tribute to the tribunal's
firmness. Still, there was a reason for the more cautious approach
in the past. While the tribunal has a security council mandate to
investigate and punish Europe's worst atrocities since World War II
and the staggering 1994 genocide in Rwanda, it has no police force
to arrest suspects, no arsenal of electronics to gather evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The courts started off meek, she felt, because they are a
curious hybrid, balancing at a ``very uneasy spot'' at the
crossroads of international law and criminal law, two systems with
very little in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``International law is quintessentially about political
interests, the exercise of state power,'' she said. ``International
law is the aristocrat of law, practiced by people in limousines
being polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminal law is seen as rough, as street stuff with zero
intellectual content. It's not about respecting state power. I
sensed that to make a breakthrough, we had to shift more into the
criminal mode.''
</P>
<P>
   She traveled, demanded and cajoled, prodding governments and
military commanders into providing more data, including tightly
held intelligence. And she did not mind a fight. At the Rwanda
tribunal, which is based in Arusha, Tanzania, this meant
confronting some staff members with accusations of corruption and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   She crossed swords with France's defense minister, Alain
Richard, who refused to allow French officers to testify in The
Hague because, he said, the tribunal practiced merely ``theatrical
justice.'' While British peacekeeping troops in Bosnia were
arresting suspects, French troops were looking the other way. But
France eventually cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She continuously denounced Croatia as it kept refusing to arrest
indicted suspects and hand over requested documents.
</P>
<P>
   Her main quarrel, of course, has been with Yugoslavia. The
Milosevic government, which has always poured scorn on the
tribunal, last year barred investigators from Kosovo, infuriating
Mrs. Arbour.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, American human rights groups and government
officials complained that her office was too slow, particularly in
1998 as Serbian troops began violently emptying ethnic Albanian
villages in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Several American lawyers and human rights groups in fact were
uneasy when Mrs. Arbour was named. (At the time she was an appeals
court judge in Ontario with little experience as a prosecutor.)
Some still give her mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very capable, with a no-nonsense style, but we were
very disappointed about her slow response to the Kosovo crisis,''
said Nina Bang-Jensen of the Coalition for International Justice, a
Washington-based lawyers group. ``Unfortunately there was
bureaucratic inertia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bang-Jensen and others have said timely, aggressive
investigations of abuses could have been a deterrent to Serb
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in The Hague disagree. The only true deterrents,
they argue, are not investigations but arrests. Mrs. Arbour said
that even before the bombing of Kosovo, as atrocities were reported
she quietly visited NATO commanders, urging them to arrest more
indictees in Bosnia, including the most wanted, like the former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently they were too busy,'' she said acidly.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that the indictments of Milosevic and four top
associates resulted in large part from a coincidence of interest
between her office and Western governments, which began to provide
the necessary intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coincidence did not exist when I asked for information
about the chain of command in the Bosnian war,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   American and European politicians, in contrast, have begun to
use the tribunal as a political weapon, threatening to hold
perpetrators of atrocities accountable in The Hague. ``Suddenly we
were on everybody's lips,'' said Mrs. Arbour.
</P>
<P>
   One way Mrs. Arbour made the tribunal more effective was to keep
indictments secret to avoid alerting suspects. She also began to
focus on the most senior military and political leaders and
introduced group trials, in which people in related cases are tried
together.
</P>
<P>
   In The Hague she has dropped charges against 18 people,
considering the cases too weak. The Hague has 31 people in custody.
Seven trials have been completed. The Rwanda tribunal holds 38
people and has handed down four sentences.
</P>
<P>
   She said her decision to leave, a year before the end of her
mandate, was difficult because she was offered the Supreme Court
seat in Canada just as the tribunal was at the height of its
involvement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized that I would not do another four years, that I
would not renew my mandate next year, it became easier,'' she said.
Mrs. Arbour, who has three teen-age children, said she was looking
forward to ``a more normal family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on a job that was often frustrating and exhausting,
she says that the commitment of governments to the tribunals has
become `'firm and clear and generally more bold'' and that the
tribunals have set basic standards for a future permanent
international court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're moving in the right direction,'' she said. ``I
think the fear and paranoia about rogue prosecutors may be
subsiding. We are not wild prosecutors, doing wild and irrational
things.''

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO _ The Japanese central bank sold yen Tuesday for the
second time in less than a week in an effort to curb the currency's
recent heady rise, but the intervention barely managed to nudge the
yen off its three-year high against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese authorities seemed more alarmed by the speed of the
yen's appreciation _ nearly 5 percent in the last week _ than in
the rise itself, even as economists began wondering aloud whether a
stronger yen might stifle the little vitality that a long-moribund
Japanese economy is starting to exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I have mixed feelings about it,'' said Ronald
Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Those most likely to complain are the giant Japanese exporters,
whose products become more expensive abroad when the yen gets
stronger. But they have been remarkably silent on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. both said this
week that they hope to substantially increase their sales in Europe
_ where the yen lately has risen even more steeply against the
sagging euro _ suggesting that their strategic planning pays little
heed to currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba did push its earnings estimates down on Monday, but
attributed that to falling semiconductor prices, shortages of
components it uses in manufacturing personal computers and
restructuring charges, rather than to the yen's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Toyoo Gyohten, a senior economic adviser to Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, likes to note that a stronger yen also means that Japanese
manufacturers pay lower prices for raw materials and components.
And to the extent that a stronger yen means that corporations must
work harder to eke out profits, it keeps the pressure on them to be
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The brighter-than-expected economic outlook here and elsewhere
in Asia also contributes to Japanese companies' acceptance of a
strong yen. ``One reason you haven't heard much out of the large
exporters is that they've been pleasantly surprised by domestic
growth,'' said Matthew Poggi, an economist with Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Poggi said that for each 10 percent the yen appreciates in a
year, it knocks about three-quarters of a percentage point off
economic growth over the next two years. ``Demand from Asia and, to
a lesser extent, from the U.S., has also been picking up, so while
they may be losing out on the currency, they're making it up with
more robust sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the yen's appreciation is nothing new to
Japanese companies, which have lived through such strength before,
particularly against the dollar. The average exchange rate in 1994
was 102 yen to the dollar, improving to an average of 94 in 1995
and weakening to an average of 109 in 1996. ``It was strong but not
disastrous,'' Bevacqua said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time, however, is the reason for the yen's
rise. The last time the yen strengthened, the United States had
adopted a policy of benign neglect toward the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the demand for yen is coming largely from foreign
investors, who are betting that Japan's economic recovery will
last. Their robust appetite for Japanese stocks has driven the
benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues to heights that no equity
analyst imagined at the beginning of the year _ a close Tuesday of
17,777.22, up 37.8 percent in yen terms, year to date. Yet as the
foreign investors push the yen's value higher, they threaten to
cast a shadow over the profitability of the very companies whose
shares they are buying.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei's rise has strengthened the resolve of a new group of
currency officials, led by Haruhiko Kuroda, vice finance minister
for international affairs. He replaced Eisuke Sakakibara, known as
``Mr. Yen'' for his ability to manipulate the currency markets with
his statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sakakibara would draw a line in the sand and dare people to
cross it,'' a currency specialist said. ``Kuroda isn't going to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Nikkei stock index remains above 16,000, the
point at which weak banks would have to recognize unrealized losses
on their equity portfolios, the authorities seem unwilling to act
more forcefully to contain the strength of the yen _ which settled
in New York Tuesday at 105.79 to the dollar, improved from 106.44
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroda has let it be known that he believes intervening
unilaterally in the currency markets is futile, a view underscored
by Tuesday's all-but-useless effort to rein in the yen and a
similar move on Friday that also failed to curb its rise.

SWISS ASK WHETHER RUSSIAN USED AEROFLOT TO SIPHON MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ In the Swiss investigation of possible Russian money
laundering, the authorities have moved aggressively against two
Swiss companies that worked for the Russian airline Aeroflot, where
the powerful Moscow financier Boris A. Berezovsky had wielded
considerable influence.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Swiss prosecutors raided the offices and froze the
bank accounts of Andava SA and Forus Services SA, two Lausanne
companies that provided Aeroflot with cash management, loans and
other financial services. Investors in both companies included
Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-page letter to the Swiss, Russians investigators said
they believed that the companies may have been used by members of
Russia's political and business elite, including Berezovsky, to
steal hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian investigators said they suspect that $200 million
paid to Aeroflot by foreign airlines for the use of Russian air
space appeared to have been funneled illegally into Andava's Swiss
bank accounts, a violation of foreign exchange rules. To manage
this, they wrote, Berezovsky had formed a ``criminal group.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both companies deny any wrongdoing, arguing that
they are the victims in a Russian political drive to get
Berezovsky, and through him President Boris N. Yeltsin, his
political patron. Berezovsky has repeatedly denied the accusations
and said the companies performed legitimate business services for
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Berezovsky has not only friends, but quite a number of
enemies,'' said William Ferrero, the general manager of Andava.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the investigation say it may never be
possible to prove a crime. But they want to know who owned the two
Swiss companies, how Russian money may have flowed through them and
the ultimate destination of the fees and dividends the companies
paid their investors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Swiss police raids in July, Ferrero and his
counterpart at Forus, Rene Kuppers, say, their businesses, which
employ six to eight people, have dried up.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ferrero, Andava was formed in 1994 as a joint
venture by a respected Swiss commodities trading group, Andre &AMP;
Cie., and Russian business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero would not identify the Russian investors, but people
familiar with the matter said they appear to have been led by
Berezovsky through a Russian company called Logovaz, which
Berezovsky has used to develop interests in businesses from oil and
automobile distribution to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Cuendet, secretary general of Andre &AMP; Cie., said the
original idea was for Andava to arrange Western financing for
Russian companies. By 1996, however, Andre concluded that Andava
was venturing into other businesses, and it decided to withdraw, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Andava embraced a bold plan devised by Ferrero, who
before joining the company helped manage financing in Switzerland
for the Swedish automotive group Volvo AB. His idea was to provide
similar cash management services to Russian corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Andava approached Aeroflot, Ferrero said, and the idea was
warmly embraced by Aeroflot's chief financial officer at the time,
Nikolai Glushkov, a close associate of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in June 1996, a fax was sent to Aeroflot's foreign offices
by Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the carrier's president, directing them to
send their hard-currency revenues, essentially payment for plane
tickets, to Andava's Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Ferrero said, Aeroflot managers balked. Not
long after, he said, the first news reports appeared in Russia
accusing Berezovsky of illegally diverting Aeroflot revenues to
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody was happy,'' Ferrero said. ``Before the money
was going to Russia, and now it was going to some obscure Swiss
company.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Aeroflot say that the airline's old
Soviet-style treasury was indeed open to abuse, and that managers
regularly tapped ticket receipts, which by the mid-1990s amounted
to about $300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to Andava robbed Aeroflot managers of the chance to
siphon off hard currency, but it also gave effective control of the
revenues to Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   As to running afoul of Russia's foreign currency laws, Ferrero
acknowledged that Aeroflot hesitated before asking the Russian
central bank for a license to move money to Switzerland. But he
said Aeroflot had assured him that under Russian law, hard currency
could be kept abroad for up to a 180 days without formal approval.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, when Valery Okulov, a former Aeroflot navigator
and son-in-law of Yeltsin, became president of the airline,
Aeroflot obtained a foreign exchange license from the government.
Several months ago, Ferrero said, management of Aeroflot's revenues
reverted to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero seeks to refute the charge that Andava siphoned off fees
collected from foreign airlines when they used Russian air space.
He said the fees were used as temporary collateral to secure loans
for Aeroflot. The loans were often needed to cover expenses like
lease payments or the purchase of airliners to replace Aeroflot's
aging fleet, and for maintenance contracts with Lufthansa, the
German airline, which maintained the planes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two years before Andava went into business, Forus Services was
similarly established by Andre &AMP; Cie. and Russian investors
associated with Berezovsky. Forus was devised as a go-between for
Russian corporations and Western banks in arranging loans.
</P>
<P>
   Thus when Aeroflot acquired its Boeings and Airbuses, Forus
helped arrange short-term loans to make the down payments. When
Aeroflot joined a project, financed in part by the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, to acquire an upgraded version of a
Russian-built Ilyushin aircraft to be outfitted with Rockwell
Avionics and Pratt &AMP; Whitney engines, Forus was Aeroflot's adviser.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Andava and Forus flourished. Despite the
withdrawal of the Andre family, the companies expanded their
capital several times and remained profitable, though as privately
held companies they do not publish figures. Starting in 1993, Forus
helped its clients, mainly the Russian auto maker Avtovaz, which
also had close ties to Berezovksy, and Aeroflot raised about $1.5
billion in loans.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both Andava and Forus emphasized that at the
latest by 1996, Berezovsky had ceased to be a shareholder, though
they do not say why. Before that, they said, he rarely interfered
in day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Kuppers, at Forus, grudgingly acknowledged that at least under
Swiss rules, the fact that Berezovsky, a major shareholder in
Aeroflot, also effectively controlled companies that provided
financial services to the airline would be a serious conflict of
interest.

JURY OUT ON TRAINER ALCAZAR'S SKILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If nothing else, one must admire Robert Alcazar's
survival instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya's longtime mentor has been supplanted as lead
trainer three times. His credentials have been questioned on
countless occasions. Many believe the five-time world champion has
succeeded in spite of Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he is, at De La Hoya's side as the Golden Boy prepares
for the most important and lucrative fight of his life: He faces
Felix Trinidad here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they call him `The Survivor,' '' said Rafael
Mendoza, a respected boxing consultant who is no fan of Alcazar's.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar is a former, marginally successful professional fighter
from Mexico who worked in a factory with De La Hoya's father, Joel
De La Hoya Sr.
</P>
<P>
   The elder De La Hoya asked Alcazar to help out in the gym and
the trainer never left. He has worked with De La Hoya in some
capacity since the fighter was a 15-year-old amateur in 1988, and
first took over as lead man about a year before he won a gold medal
in the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Alcazar had only minimal experience as a trainer
with amateur and professional fighters.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's been demoted to assistant trainer _ or lower _
so many times.
</P>
<P>
   The first time was at the start of De La Hoya's career, when his
then managers Robert Mittleman and Steve Nelson brought in former
champion Carlos Ortiz because they had no faith in Alcazar. Ortiz
was never a good fit and lasted about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar was back to No.1.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, De La Hoya struggled to beat cagey veteran John
John Molina in his 17th fight as Alcazar froze and was unable to
provide instructions in the corner. Enter well-schooled Mexican
trainer Jesus ``The Professor'' Rivero, who imparted many valuable
lessons but was ousted when his tentative protege barely outpointed
Pernell Whitaker in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Next came well-known trainer Emanuel Steward, whom those in the
De La Hoya camp hoped would bring back the ferocity that was lost
during Rivero's defense-first tenure. Steward lasted two fights
because of conflicts with Joel Sr. and adviser Mike Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar? Back to the top, which is where he's remained.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's good or bad depends on whom you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Rivero and Mendoza, who introduced The Professor to the camp,
are vicious in their criticism of Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the trainer's background in boxing, Mendoza
said: ``He has no background. As far as I know, he worked with 8-,
9-, 10-year-old kids and not even good amateurs. He was just
friendly with Oscar's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no qualifications. He's good at wrapping hands (his
initial job with De La Hoya). He's not a good trainer, not a good
teacher. In order to teach, you must know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does De La Hoya stay with him?'' he said. ``It's a
mystery. Sometimes you have a daughter who is ugly and you see her
as pretty. Maybe that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivero had a strained relationship with Alcazar from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   As he did with the other trainers, Alcazar lobbied against
bringing in Rivero for fear of losing his position. When the new
trainer arrived, Alcazar wouldn't cooperate. He once referred to
Rivero as as janitor when an outsider asked about him.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked together only a short time before Rivero insisted
that Alcazar leave camp. For a time, Alcazar was relegated to desk
work in De La Hoya's business enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rivero worked long enough with Alcazar to develop an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know how to train,'' Rivero said over the phone
through an interpreter from his home in Guadalajara, Mexico. ``He's
inept, inadequate. Not only is he inept, but he also puts up
obstacles and doesn't let people train him properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sad to see Oscar not fighting the way he should
fight. He doesn't have fight plans, he doesn't fight with
technique. It's like he's street fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar, sensitive to the criticism, presents the most
compelling argument in his own favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results speak for themselves,'' he said. ``What can I tell
you? We've been working together for 10 years already, almost 200
times, and we haven't lost a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum of Top Rank Boxing, De La Hoya's promoter, played a
role in bringing in Rivero and Steward; he has had his reservations
about Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rivero's arrival, Arum echoed the thoughts of many when
he said simply, ``I think this is as far as Robert can take
Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   However, now, with harmony in camp in mind, he said he believes
Alcazar has evolved into a fine trainer because of the influence of
the other trainers and the time he has spent in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran trainer Gil Clancy, who has helped Alcazar devise
strategy for the past five fights, is more vociferous in the
defense of his colleague. In fact, the criticism angers him.
</P>
<P>
   He's baffled by the decision to bring in outside help _
including himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism is completely unfair,'' said Clancy, who
dismissed Rivero's comments as ``sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it: He's knowledgeable. If I had a
son who wanted to be a fighter, I would just as soon send him to
Robert as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar couldn't be stronger in the fundamentals. Robert
!ital!knows!off! how to train a fighter. I don't know what everyone
is talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya provides a ringing endorsement by keeping Alcazar
around.
</P>
<P>
   However, he, too, has had his doubts because he played a
significant role in bringing in Rivero and Steward as lead
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, he just wants tranquillity in camp and that's
what Alcazar provides. The two are very close. Alcazar is
protective of the fighter. He encourages De La Hoya's naturally
aggressive style. And, again, the two have never lost together.
</P>
<P>
   As another Top Rank executive, Todd du Boef said: ``He must be
doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very proud about the job I've done, about my fighter,''
Alcazar said. ``The record shows no other trainer, no other manager
in boxing history has captured a gold medal and five world titles
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Robert Alcazar who has captured that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Were some investors lucky or did they know something was awry
last week at Maytag Corp.?
</P>
<P>
   The stock plummeted last Wednesday and Thursday in unusually
heavy trading as big institutions bailed out. When the New York
Stock Exchange asked Maytag on Thursday to issue a statement
indicating whether any corporate developments explained the action,
the company said its policy was not to comment on rumors or unusual
market activity.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts say they spoke that evening with company
officials and were given no indication that there would be any
significant changes to the earnings outlook.
</P>
<P>
   But early Friday, before the markets opened, Maytag issued a
statement saying that earnings for the third and fourth quarters
would fall far short of analyst estimates. Maytag shares plunged
$14.8125, to $41.75, leaving the stock almost 44 percent off its
July 14 high of $74 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, accustomed to gentle guidance from all manner of
companies, were shocked and angry. And some are now asking whether
large institutions knew something in advance. Others wonder when
exactly management knew Maytag's earnings were disappointing.
Furthermore, does management now have a full grasp of the company's
financial situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to the company the night before, and they were
guardedly optimistic,'' said Efraim Levy, an analyst at the S&AMP;P
Equity Group. ``They were looking to give the street some good
news.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia
University, said two possibilities exist. ``There may have been
some kind of contact between an executive and a group of analysts
or institutions, or it may have been that important information
somehow trickled out,'' perhaps from a supplier or a Maytag
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company tipped off big shareholders _ a practice
that Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has
frowned upon as ``selective disclosure'' _ it would still generally
not be illegal or considered insider trading, Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts say that the company had been riding a market
boom and may have simply botched its earnings forecast, then
delayed the public statement in hopes that the September numbers
would be strong enough to bolster profits.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Newton, Iowa, also defends its move.
Maytag chief executive Lloyd Ward said in a telephone interview
Tuesday that the company would never engage in selective
disclosures to investors or analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no evidence to suggest there was tipping from anyone at
this corporation,'' he said. ``Frankly, it's illegal. We would
consider that a significant violation for any official at Maytag.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who took over in August, said the company simply failed to
meet its forecasts and that officials unfortunately had to keep
those details private from even analysts on Thursday until a public
statement was ready Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for our investor-relations manager to deal
with this particular issue,'' he said. ``If we had dealt with the
analysts that would have been selective disclosure. We weren't in
the position to give guidance to the analysts because it wasn't
available to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday and Thursday, trading activity in the stock
bulged. Though just 282,000 shares of Maytag traded on Tuesday,
Sept. 7, volume shot up to 1.6 million shares the next day and 3.9
million last Thursday. Average trading volume in the last six
months was about 480,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag shares fell again Tuesday, Sept. 14, to $37.9375, a
52-week low. Some analysts said Maytag had been a hot stock, always
beating estimates, and investors may have simply gotten nervous.
Few short-sellers were in on the drop, and analysts saw few clues.
</P>
<P>
   But Jay Huck, an analyst at the Center for Financial Research
and Analysis in Rockville, Md., a group that scrutinizes corporate
accounting on behalf of investors, said he was preparing a report
on Maytag that suggested that there were operational difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory had begun to bulge in the second quarter, and cash
flow had dropped to $104 million the last six months from $159
million, even though net income had risen from a year earlier.
There was also a little-noted warning in the second-quarter
statement about a European client that suggested it would not be
buying as many vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were clearly some signs of trouble,'' Huck said. ``You
look at cash flow and you say, `We've got a problem here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities, has also
found problems. He says Maytag understated its overhead early in
the year and over-projected its unit sales. Instead of conservative
accounting approach, he said, the company took an approach that led
to stronger earnings in the first half of the year and shortfalls
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   It was accounting issues and ``not underlying fundamental
weakness in the company's innovation strategy or its execution,''
he said, which is why he now recommends the stock as a strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Heymann said, the company failed to disclose the earnings
news in a timely manner and before Friday denied that a serious
problem was at hand _ which is why the stock was hammered for an
expected 15 percent shortfall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several analysts said that Maytag executives may have simply
become too optimistic after several years of robust growth. ``I
don't think the company was trying to mislead anyone,'' said Scott
Graham, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. ``The management just made
some guidance mistakes. They let expectations get too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say that some investors were not entirely assured
of coming gains, so they simply sold in a panic, fearing the worst.
</P>
<P>
   In the selloff, smaller investors apparently got hit hardest,
according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in
Greenwich, Conn., which said institutions dominated trading. On
Thursday, small investors were actually net buyers of $2.3 million
worth of stock, it said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ward said that the company acted properly and
simply missed a forecast because it is creating innovative products
that are hard to predict because they are coming to market for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not sure of the value equation or what consumers are
going to pay,'' he said. ``We are not perfect. We do not always get

</P>
<P>
   He said there were no accounting irregularities but there were
some ``unfortunate occurrences'' in Maytag's discussions with
analysts. He plans to talk with analysts today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to figure out how to improve the communication
process,'' he said. ``That is on my table and I will address it.''

CLINTON SEEKS TO RALLY SUPPORT TO CURB GREENHOUSE GASES 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand _ President Clinton, speaking at the
jumping off point to the South Pole, sought Wednesday to rally
international support to curb greenhouse gases that many scientists
blame for a hole in the atmosphere over the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fossil fuels and their role in climate change are
helping create weather extremes, from vicious hurricanes to
droughts, Clinton told 5,000 New Zealanders. School children here
routinely where hats and sunblock to protect themselves from the
excessive ultraviolet rays that pierce the Antarctic's ozone hole
in spring months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his remarks by expressing concern for the
Americans who are in the path of Hurricane Floyd. He called it
``one of the most serious hurricanes ever to threaten the United
States if the predictions of its force and scope hold true.'' The
president will fly to Washington following a state dinner Wednesday
night, skipping a day of golf in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God it is no longer necessary to burn up the atmosphere
to create economic opportunity. We have somehow got to convince a
critical mass of decisions makers and ordinary citizens in every
nation of the world that that is true,'' Clinton told New
Zealanders gathered at the International Antarctic Center on a
gray, chilly spring day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the biggest obstacle to curbing greenhouse gases
was the continued belief by wealthy and developing nations that
they must continue using the same fossil fuel sources to maintain
their economies. He said new technology and alternative energy
makes it possible to curb greenhouse gas use and expand economies.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, Clinton toured the International Antarctic
Center, the headquarters and supply depot for the Antarctic
programs operated by New Zealand, the United States and Italy.
Christchurch has long been the jumping off point for South Pole
explorers and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was joined by Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to
scale Mount Everest and who failed in an attempt to traverse the
Antarctic continent, and Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, who is
hosting Clinton to a state visit here.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Antarctic Program is operated by the National Science
Foundation with support from the U.S. Air Force and the New York
Air National Guard. During the summers, the International Antarctic
Center supports 3,000 people, most of them Americans, who work on
the ice cap.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of scientific support, Clinton announced the United
States would declassify some secret satellite photographs of
Antarctic's dry valleys to help researchers study the affects of
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The president's state visit followed a day off in scenic
Queenstown, a South Island village that bills itself as New
Zealand's playground. While the president played golf on a course
framed by a snow-capped mountain range called the Remarkables, his
top aides engaged in extreme sports that have made this area
famous.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, took a
bungee jump off a bridge. Queenstown is the birth place of bungee
jumping. Senior aides such as Doug Sosnik, the first to jump, also
indulged in ``rocket boating'' in which a power boat races down a
canyon gorge and takes high-speed turns just yards from huge rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied on this trip by daughter Chelsea and
mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham, also dined with actor Chris
O'Donnell, his wife and in-laws. O'Donnell is making a film near
Queenstown. Clinton also was joined by Lucy Lawless, a native New
Zealander who plays television's Xena, the Warrior Princess.
</P>
<P>
   In Christchurch, the president thanked the people of New Zealand
for giving him and his family ``five absolutely glorious days in
one of the most beautiful places on Earth.'' Clinton, the most
traveled president in U.S. history, said his biggest regret was not
making it to the Antarctic.

MRS. CLINTON CALLS HEALTH CARE VITAL ISSUE FOR SENATE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT NECK, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that she
would embrace the issue of health care coverage in her probable
race for the U.S. Senate next year, asserting that public concern
about the subject had grown since her campaign to change the system
collapsed in failure six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues that I will, if I run, emphasize is health
care,'' Mrs. Clinton declared, expounding on the issue first before
an audience of elderly Long Islanders and then at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be very interested in being part of another effort in
our country to try to address the problems that you so eloquently
put forth,'' the first lady told an audience member who voiced
concerns about health care coverage. ``We are going to have to face
that problem in the next years because the problem in the next few
years will only get more difficult and more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   With her remarks, the first lady clearly signaled that she did
not consider her close identification with President Clinton's
proposal for universal health care _ which has come to be viewed by
many Democrats and Republicans as perhaps the greatest failure of
his first term _ as a political liability in her expected race for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   She said her travels through New York had convinced her that
voter concern about the issue was as raw as ever, and she grew
animated as she discussed the future of Medicare programs and the
concerns of uninsured and underinsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists have long said that they would use the
issue both in an attempt to portray Mrs. Clinton as ideologically
left-of-center and politically inept. The first lady was faulted at
the time for trying to push health care legislation that many
considered to be too sweeping, and for moving without consulting
with many key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton acknowledged some of those criticisms Tuesday,
saying that she would move gradually and that she saw her role as
trying to help develop a consensus for change. ``I know in any
great country and democracy, such as ours, we have to persuade
people about what it is we should do and we need to have a national
conversation about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton used her visit to the Great Neck Senior Center to
offer a tough attack on Republicans for their proposed $792 billion
tax cut. (She did not mention her likely opponent, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who has said he favors the Republican bill). Mrs. Clinton
asserted that the bill jeopardized the future solvency of Medicare,
the medical insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would veto the tax cut bill as too large.
The president has proposed using 15 percent of a projected surplus
that Republicans are tapping for the tax cut bill to assure the
stability of Social Security through the first quarter of the next
century. Mrs. Clinton supported her husband's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party bill, that they say will be sent to the
president probably tomorrow, would be in effect a statement that
would ask us to cut and run on our obligations to older
Americans,'' she said. ``It would break our faith with the seniors
in New York, and I would fight it, if I were in the Congress now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks on health care came on a day that was
filled with suggestions of the kind of issues that have intrigued
her. It also came amid signs that she was growing more assured
about offering positions: Her news conference was her third in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, for example, distanced herself from a central
tenet of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading candidate in
polls for the Republican presidential nomination, to use
faith-based charities, rather than government programs, to care for
the nation's downtrodden. She said she thought that such
institutions could play a limited role, but added, '`I am concerned
and cautious about how such a program could be constitutionally
devised and implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spoke in favor of campaign finance restrictions,
even as she prepared to return to Manhattan for two more
fund-raisers. She suggested, though, that one of the reasons that
changes in campaign laws had stalled in Congress was because there
had not been much public interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who care about campaign finance reform in the
public arena get somewhat discouraged because the public doesn't
seem to respond as much as we hoped people would,'' she said, in a
reference to her husband. ``I'm hoping that maybe over the next
year, or as we educate the people of the consequence of all this
money coming in, that more Americans will express your concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was careful not to offer specifics on how the
health care system should be changed. However, she rejected the
notion that her failure last time was evidence that the public did
not share her concern about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm beginning to hear from people again that the problems
that they were telling me about in '93 and '94 are still with us
and we have to address them and we have to figure out a way to do
that effectively,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want people in public life who are afraid to raise
difficult issues and are afraid to take on the biggest challenges
facing our country,'' she said. ``I believe that if you look at the
problems that we're going to be confronting, what we do about
health care is going to be on the agenda.''

DECODING U.S. ENCRYPTION POLICY NOT AN EASY THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Clinton administration will announce its new
policy on the export of encryption software. Commerce
Undersecretary William Reinsch, who administers export controls,
said the change will be ``dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Reinsch said the administration seeks
``balance'' between the needs of computer users and the police.
That balance, however, keeps shifting in favor of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, the administration's idea of balance was
mandatory key escrow. Programs to encode computer text would have a
key deposited with an agent. Upon presentation of a court order,
this agent would hand the key to the cops.
</P>
<P>
   A furious battle ensued over this idea, and mandatory key escrow
lost. Now that a bill in Congress, the SAFE Act, would ban key
escrow, the fallback Clinton position is voluntary key escrow. ``We
don't want to make it mandatory,'' Reinsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Would anyone volunteer? Industry doesn't think so, though
Reinsch thinks some large employers might.
</P>
<P>
   Assume key escrow is dead. What's left? Congress long since
rejected an FBI proposal for domestic controls on encryption. What
remains is controls on exports. Though the administration has
lifted controls for lower-level products, industry keeps creating
new and neater stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators can fall embarrassingly behind. On July 1, the
Commerce Department had to change its definition of an exportable
computer chip because it was at the point of applying export
controls to Sony PlayStations. That would have been a chuckle. It's
already funny enough that Apple is advertising its newest model to
be classified as ``munitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer uses 128-bit
encryption, and cannot legally be shipped outside North America,
though Microsoft gives it away free.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Reinsch about Internet Explorer. ``We'll address that
Thursday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government is not about to abandon export controls on
everything. Reinsch offers a hypothetical example: ``If the Iraqis
need 450 centrifuges to make enriched uranium, you probably can't
hold them to zero. Maybe they get 120, and they pay 10 times more.
If that means Iraq's got capability in 2008 instead of 2001, that's
a good thing. Part of the game is buying time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the post-Cold War world, control is becoming more
difficult. More of the technology is civilian, and fewer nations
are agreeing to control it. An example came in 1997, when it was
discovered that machine tools from a closed McDonnell Douglas B-1
bomber line had been sold to China. The most sensitive tool, a
stretch press, was tracked down and returned. But all that really
meant is that the Chinese bought a new stretch press from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. controls have also given away encryption business. ``I
thought for a long time that these were unsubstantiated
assertions,'' Reinsch said, ``but there's increasing evidence of
lost sales. That matters to us.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the concerns of police? ``Law enforcement wants
everything to be the same as in the wiretap world,'' Reinsch said.
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer possible. But will they get anything? Reinsch
met Monday with representatives of Visio, WRQ, Adobe and Microsoft
_ ``a young crowd,'' he said. ``I asked them, `If we could do
something for you on the export-control side, what should we do on
the law-enforcement side?' They didn't have a lot to say about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement has a legitimate concern. ``I prosecuted a case
that went to trial last year that involved a guy who traded in
child pornography,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Short. He
won a conviction, but without the benefit of certain computer files
on which the encryption was never cracked. Short said flatly that
the more his evidence is encrypted, the more time and money it will
take to convict criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Marshall, vice president and general counsel of WRQ Inc.,
said encryption is essential to WRQ's products, which allow a PC to
connect to a mainframe computer over the Internet. Without strong
encryption the product is not trustworthy. But Marshall said the
amount of paperwork to sell overseas is ``astounding,'' and that
all it does is help WRQ's foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about ``balancing'' these concerns sounds good, but there
is no clear way to do it. Either we have encryption or we don't.
The fact is, we have it; we can have all we want of it. The
question on the table is, how much can we sell to foreigners?
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday there's a new answer.

FROM BRITAIN, MOSQUITOES LOOK LIKE SCOURGE OF DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you happened to be tracking New York City's
encephalitis problems from Britain for the last week, you might be
forgiven for recoiling in horror at the Black Death devastating
Gotham.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Plague on New York: Panic as City Is Sprayed to Control
Killer Mosquitoes'' screamed The Daily Mail, a tabloid.
``Helicopters Attack Killer Biting the Big Apple,'' bellowed The
Express, another tabloid, and The Evening Standard, a third
tabloid, warned darkly, ``New York in Fight Against Deadly Brain
Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   If the headlines were not frightening enough, the articles
surely were. ``Panic swept New York last night as a plague of
mosquitoes killed three people and left 57 more fighting for their
lives,'' The Daily Mail wrote breathlessly. ``Helicopters were
weaving in and out of skyscrapers, dousing the city's streets with
powerful insecticide.''
</P>
<P>
   City residents were described as rushing to railroad stations to
get away, or cowering indoors so as not to be infected. Those
unlucky enough to get sick were depicted as keeling over from
seizures, paralysis, fever and brain swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers seemed slightly pleased that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
apparently famous abroad for his quality-of-life crackdowns, had
met a pest he might not be able to lick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough New York Mayor has beaten crime, squeegee merchants
and, bizarrely, ferret owners who want him to overturn his ban on
keeping them as pets,'' wrote a reporter for The Express. ``Now he
may finally have met his match.'' The mosquitoes, the report went
on to say, have proved ``immune to the zero tolerance he
successfully displays to most other irritants.''
</P>
<P>
   One paper, the sometimes sober, sometimes sensational Times,
even talked as if it were a contest between insects and politics.
``The giant political ambitions of Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of
New York, are under attack from a swarm of mosquitoes spreading
fear and disease throughout the city,'' its report said.
</P>
<P>
   The articles indicated that no matter where the suffering seven
million went, they could not escape. ``Subway trains are filled
with the smell of insect repellent as New Yorkers generally heed
requests to spray themselves,'' an article in The Express said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some wrote admiringly that New Yorkers were
steely enough to disregard the whole thing. ``Normally neurotic New
Yorkers, who dash to the dermatologists at the slightest sign of a
pimple, largely ignored the goings-on,'' wrote a correspondent for
The Scotsman, adding that the sang-froid in Manhattan probably
stemmed from the fact that the fatalities had occurred in other
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Just as interesting were the explanations of why New York had
been visited by this plague, perhaps even deserved it. One writer
in The Daily Telegraph said it was because smoking was so commonly
banned in the city. Mosquitoes would stay away, he said, if only
there was more cigarette smoke in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter in The Guardian explained that it all stemmed from
global warming. New York was well on its way to becoming Kuala
Lumpur, the story surmised, because unstable weather in the
northern half of the globe was allowing pests and diseases to
migrate north.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the odd pun or joke about past menaces, real
or imagined. ``The city that thrives on buzz has found a version it
wants to go away fast,'' The Express said. ``At least you could see
Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the hoopla did not seem to be deterring travel plans.
Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways said there had
been no perceptible drop in reservations. If the airlines did get
questions about a menace, it was one farther south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten any calls on the mosquitoes,'' Christine
Pilson of Virgin Atlantic said. ``The issue of the moment seems to
be Hurricane Floyd.''

OFFICIALS CRITICIZED FOR SCHOOL BUILDING SITE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Internal investigators for the Los Angeles school
district released a report Tuesday that sharply criticized senior
school officials, consultants and outside lawyers for their roles
in the development of a $200 million high school, built near an
abandoned oilfield, that may never be finished because of
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   District staff members and outside consultants misled school
board members on ``significant matters of fact, policy and law''
regarding the school, the Belmont Learning Complex, the report by
the Los Angeles Unified School District's Internal Audit and
Special Investigations Unit said. As a result, the report said,
former boards broke several state education, environmental and
hazardous-waste control laws by acquiring the land for the school
despite its hazardous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends disciplinary action _ possibly including
dismissal _ for nine officials, including the district's general
counsel, Richard Mason, and the chief administrative officer, David
Koch. It said the board should consider Superintendent Ruben
Zacarias' ``failure to supervise the Belmont project in a diligent,
professional and effective manner'' in his next performance review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L.A.U.S.D. professional management and staff responsible
for Belmont, both past and present, developed and tolerated a
culture remarkably indifferent to compliance with environmental or
public health and safety standards, as well as a culture where
accountability for these standards was lax,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are certain to become another major embarrassment
for the district, which has been heavily criticized in recent
months for approving construction adjoining an abandoned oil field,
where dangerous concentrations of methane and hydrogen sulfide have
subsequently been found. The Board of Education, which has three
new members since the project was approved, has appointed a panel
to recommend whether to abandon the school altogether, after $125
million has been spent on it.
</P>
<P>
   Mason and Koch referred all questions to the superintendent's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said in a statement Tuesday that he would ``consider my
full range of options for employee discipline up to and including
termination of employment,'' and would also look for organizational
or procedural changes. He also defended his role, citing several
changes in oversight he instituted, and sharply disagreed with the
report's assertion that he failed to oversee the project
adequately.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report said companies hired to evaluate environmental
conditions at the school site breached their ``duty of professional
care'' to the district by failing to conduct tests properly.
</P>
<P>
   It also said an architectural firm retained by the district for
design advice, McLarand, Vasquez &AMP; Partners, engaged in a direct
conflict of interest by simultaneously seeking an architecture
contract from Belmont's developer, Temple Beaudry Partners LLC. A
partner with the architecture firm could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   O'Melveny &AMP; Myers LLP, a Los Angeles law firm that served as
outside counsel to the board, was criticized for recommending
Temple Beaudry Partners as an exclusive developer for the project
while it was representing a principal partner in Temple Beaudry,
Kajima Urban Development, on another matter.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, the firm said the report's criticism of
its work is ``unfounded, unfair and badly mistaken.'' It said it
had disclosed any potential conflict to district officials. ``We at
all times represented the L.A.U.S.D. capably and in compliance with
our professional and ethical obligations,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Temple Beaudry misled city and state regulators
about environmental conditions and management of hazardous wastes
on the site, including failing to disclose its knowledge of methane
to the Los Angeles Fire Department for six months while continuing
construction. A lawyer for Temple Beaudry did not return a
telephone call.

<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Last year, when reports of financial
instability surfaced at Trinity College of Vermont, a small Roman
Catholic liberal arts institution and the state's only women's
college, people in the academic community gathered occasionally to
pray for the welfare of the college.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the prayer meetings are held weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we've upped the ante,'' said Sister Jacqueline Marie
Kieslich, Trinity's newly appointed president. She began her job
just a few weeks ago, knowing that her task was to close the
college on June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hoping for a miracle,'' said Donna Dalton, vice
president for academic and student affairs. ``A miracle would be
very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Trinity's board announced that the 74-year-old college,
founded and run by the Sisters of Mercy, could no longer support a
$6 million debt _ due mostly to declining enrollment _ on a $13.2
million operating budget. At the end of the fiscal year, the
trustees declared, Trinity would cease to exist as an independent
institution for its 1,150 students.
</P>
<P>
   American colleges are ``incredibly hardy,'' in the words of
Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on
Education in Washington. Yet every year, two to three of the
country's estimated 3,500 two- and four-year colleges fall victim
to demographics or cultural trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``A school closing affects not only the students, faculty, staff
and alumni, but the community as well,'' Hartle said. ``Our
diversity of choices is diminished. And the community loses an
engine of economic and cultural vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door to the comparatively more sprawling University of
Vermont, Trinity College sits on 28 acres of well-trimmed paths,
maple trees and neat, sensible brick buildings in a corner of
Vermont's largest city. Students stroll the grounds sporting
buttons with quotations from Gandhi (``An eye for an eye makes the
whole world blind''), John Lennon (``You may say I'm a dreamer, but
I'm not the only one'') or the occasional ``I am a sensuous
woman.'' There seem to be fewer body piercings than at most higher
education institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The college, which opened in 1925 to educate what was then an
underserved population _ Vermont women _ has long been a pioneer in
education and community service, with a stated mission to ``promote
social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Trinity was among the first private colleges to
open its doors to older nontraditional students. In the 1980s, it
began a study program for single mothers. A campus-based child-care
center for the community serves as a laboratory for education
students. The college's education department, which has supplied
the state with an estimated 10 percent of its teachers, sends its
professors to Vermont elementary schools to teach graduate courses
on site. And every year, through a program endowed by a former
trustee, Trinity brings to the community speakers like Elie Wiesel,
Kenzaburo Oe, Maya Angelou, Joyce Carol Oates and Alice Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty members are clearly reluctant to let these
programs die. They are, they point out, part of the reason that
U.S. News &AMP; World Report ranked Trinity in the top tier of Regional
Liberal Arts Colleges for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overwhelming feeling is of sadness, because no other
students will be able to experience what I have been able to
experience here,'' said Mattie Pontecorvo, a sophomore from
Woodstock, Vt. She described the Trinity experience as one of
empowerment and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a student here, you feel like you can do
anything,'' said Ms. Pontecorvo, who is president of her class,
co-editor of the student newspaper, a member of the student senate,
and a resident assistant, in addition to being active in community
service projects sponsored by the college.
</P>
<P>
   She said the atmosphere at Trinity, ``where women support
women,'' had helped her assume leadership roles. ``I don't think I
would have been doing all these things in my second year at a co-ed
institution. I wouldn't have had the confidence.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Tosca Zern, a junior biology major from Shelton, Conn., frowned
over her computer during a physiology laboratory. She is worried,
she said, about her chances of getting into medical school if the
college closes. ``What about recommendations?'' she asked. ``What
about getting a degree from a place that will no longer exist? When
I say I'm going home, I mean I'm coming here. This place is home to
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Campbell, a sophomore from Portland, Maine, whose
smiling visage graces the Trinity catalog, echoed the feelings of
many when she said she had returned ``determined to have the best
year ever, no matter what happens.'' She added, ``If Trinity
closes, these two years would definitely have been worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions of optimism, using the word ``if,'' are ``what
we all need to be able to get up in the morning,'' said Sister
Kieslich.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since the trustees' decision, administrators have been trying to
find a sponsoring institution to adopt some of the programs and
enable Trinity students to complete their degrees with as little
disruption as possible. Sister Kieslich said the college was
``exploring new relationships'' with other colleges, like merging,
forming partnerships or collaborating. Many administrators hope
talks with St. Michael's, a Catholic college in nearby Winooski,
will prove fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most optimistic Trinity booster seems to agree
that, come June 30, the college will cease to exist in its current
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we were to receive a windfall, we would have to
re-evaluate our structure, concentrate on our strengths, and cull
some of our weaker programs,'' said Sister Kieslich. ``We can't
continue as we are.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the number of graduate students has hovered at about 550,
the number of traditional-age undergraduates at Trinity fell from
415 in 1989 to 263 this year, and the number of nontraditional
undergraduates, who include older women and men, has dropped to 338
from 659 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Jarvis, vice president for finance and administration,
said the reasons for the decline were unclear but might include a
turnover in the admissions department, an increase in choices for
nontraditional students and the waning popularity of single-sex
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of women's colleges has decreased to 77
from 300 in 1960. While those colleges that have hung on are
``quite competitive'' and are drawing increasing interest in recent
years, said Jadwiga Sebrechts, president of the Women's College
Coalition in Washington, an all-women's college must work
especially hard to ``tell its story'' and attract students.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jarvis said Trinity's financial problems were compounded by
the fact that to remain competitive, the college could not reduce
expenses, particularly in areas like technology, nor raise their
charges (about $21,400 for tuition, room, board and fees). In the
meantime, the relatively small endowment of $2 million has not
substantially increased.
</P>
<P>
   That would change, of course, if Peggy A. McCluskey, the
president of the alumni board, gets her wish. Ms. McCluskey, a 1960
Trinity graduate, has been buying lottery tickets in the hope of
winning money for her alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a miracle,'' she acknowledged. ``But if any school
deserves a miracle, it's Trinity.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in the late 1980s, in that opulent birthday cake
known as the Plaza, Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera were
putting on the kind of fashion shows that practically sealed their
fate in swag. They were identified with it. A good-looking model,
coiffed, swathed up to her skinny chin in bows, would come
barreling down the runway, train her eyeballs on the room like a
howitzer and pivot in an insolent rustle of taffeta.
</P>
<P>
   And the funny thing was, Ms. Herrera herself dressed in a black
turtleneck and a smart pair of trousers as if to say, ``I have a
life.'' And de la Renta wasn't much different. He has his social
friends, but even now, when he's up at his place in Connecticut,
he's usually in a pastel polo shirt tooling around in his golf cart
to inspect the chicken coop. (The man has one.)
</P>
<P>
   So they have changed, and they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ms. Herrera sent out a collection that was so much
like her personality _ at once practical and lavish _ that it
closed the gap between who she is and what she designs. You could
almost boil down her idea to a pair of pants and a top, except the
pants were in close-fitting shantung and the top was in suede or
maybe embroidered shantung, and fitted, in peony pink.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herrera had other ideas, too. Like a caftan embroidered in
deep pink and beige to resemble the pattern of Moorish tiles, and a
bisque patent-leather skirt with a pink asymmetrical halter. The
clothes were stridently young and sexy _ enough so to cause
whiplash in a client still clinging to her ladylike ideals. And
maybe there is something absurdly hopeful about expecting a woman
to wear a lemon suede bikini or a ball skirt two inches below her
navel. But, sex or swag _ which would you choose?
</P>
<P>
   ``So with the times,'' pronounced Crown Princess Pavlos of
Greece afterward.
</P>
<P>
   And strange as it must seem, these casual, chaotic times need
someone like Ms. Herrera, who lives the life of her customers, to
give modern sportswear a dressy, grown-up edge. Her silk pants may
have looked as casual as khakis, but her tops _ with belled
sleeves, a keyhole or a coy drawstring up one side _ looked like a
million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how many more T-shirts are you going to show _ tell
me!'' Ms. Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like an Oscar de la Renta show to bring on an
Edith Wharton moment. All the familiar faces were there _ Brooke
Astor, Mica Ertegun, Blaine Trump, Casey Ribicoff, Barbara Walters,
Kenneth Lane. Between this cheek and that cheek, Lane, the costume
jewelry king, didn't know whom to greet first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you telling everything?'' asked a friend passing through.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm kissing everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the show started, against a backdrop of blue sky and
clouds. Out came models in lace-cut leather skirts with cashmere
sweaters, all in shades of pink, lemon and aqua, some sparkling
with clear stones. The models were moving along, in sporty denim
pants suits and shirtwaist dresses, when suddenly a lone figure
appeared on the edge of the runway. It was Nan Kempner, running
late. She scooted past the photographers. No one bellowed.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was carefree and summery, with lighthearted
details like rhinestones in a pick-up-sticks pattern on an ice-blue
satin skirt and Carmen Miranda florals that made the models look
like tall fruity drinks. De la Renta didn't push the youthful
message as far as Ms. Herrera, but the collection evoked something
of the life of New York, at least in its upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
   As Lane said on his way out, ``Clothes for the family.''

TRINIDAD COMES OUT OF SECLUSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It was a historic occasion Tuesday afternoon in the
pre-fight hoopla surrounding the Felix Trinidad-Oscar De La Hoya
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Trinidad actually opened up his workout session to a few
sportswriters, a few photographers and the usual nauseating gaggle
of hangers-on peculiar to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Trinidad didn't do much other than shadow box, hit the heavy
bag and make the speed bag sing rhythmically before the viewers
were informed the room had to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   But the mere fact that outside observers even were given
permission to take a glimpse at Trinidad was startling, since no
one previously had been allowed to enter Pavilion III at the Las
Vegas Hilton to watch Trinidad train since he arrived here from
Puerto Rico on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito (Trinidad's nickname) is concentrating solely on this
fight,'' explained his promoter, Don King. ``He's been
concentrating all his energies in getting ready to beat Oscar De La
Hoya. And, believe me , he's ready for it. Oscar De La Hoya is
going to be Cape Canaveral for Tito, his launching pad for
world-wide fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix's been the Invisible Man up to this fight, but he won't
be after it. After it, he will be known as the greatest fighter in
the world. He's going to knock Oscar De La Hoya out.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinions are divided among fistic scientists on this issue
the odds on the Saturday night match now stand even at 6-5, pick it
but there is no doubt that Trinidad is in peak condition.
</P>
<P>
   The anatomy of the 5-foot-11 IBF welterweight champion looks as
though it has been chiseled by a sculptor, the result of three
punishing months of preparing for De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad exudes an air of confidence, and those in his entourage
insist that he will be too strong and powerful for De La Hoya,
exactly the same sentiments echoed by those in De La Hoya's camp.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief Las Vegas stay, Trinidad already can lay claim
to a unique distinction being the first person to stay in Barron
Hilton's private suite at the Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even Elvis Presley managed that feat,'' cracked King.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite allowing reporters to watch 30 minutes of his
workout Tuesday, Trinidad did not meet afterward with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do his talking at the final press conference on
Wednesday,'' said his father, Don Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   You must understand that Don Felix, a former Puerto Rican
featherweight champion and his son's trainer, does most of the
talking for the Trinidads.
</P>
<P>
   He did so again Tuesday, giving reporters an interview as his
son went through his regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a more domineering fight father than Felix
Trinidad's father,'' says Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter and a
reluctant partner in this promotion with King. ``He won't let Felix
be interviewed. He hasn't allowed anyone to watch his workouts.
Felix Trinidad can't do anything without his father's consent.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Trinidad has raised his son to be a boxer from
childhood, presenting him with a pair of boxing gloves as a
birthday gift when he was a mere five.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, Felix began his boxing career and would win five Puerto
Rican National Amateur championships (100 pounds, 112, 119, 126 and
132).
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, for a guy now celebrated for his power, he didn't
display much of it as a youngster. He had only 12 knockouts in
posting a 51-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   But that would change as soon as he turned professional on March
10, 1990, when he knocked out one Angel Romero in two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   He has been rendering opponents unconscious ever since with his
slashing left hooks and straight right hands on the way to a 35-0
ledger that includes 30 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   He also has become a national hero in his native Puerto Rico,
even surpassing the popularity of guys like Wilfredo Gomez and
Wilfredo Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinidad can't walk anywhere in Puerto Rico without being
mobbed,'' says Bob Arum. ``There's no one there that's more famous.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Trinidad is so big in Puerto Rico that his fight with De
La Hoya is being piped into its four major prisons because
politicians feared there would be wide-spread rioting among the
inmates if it weren't shown.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran boxing publicist, Bill Caplan, recently took a group
of reporters to Puerto Rico to observe Trinidad none, natch, got to
see him spar and came away with the impression that not one person
on the entire Caribbean island envisions Trinidad losing to De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person you talk to thinks Trinidad's going to win and
going to win easily,'' says Caplan. ``If he happens to lose, it
will be a shock to the entire country because no one I talked to
thinks that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an outlook is understandable considering how dominant
Trinidad has been throughout this decade.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't fought a lot of household names, and 24 of his fights
have gone four rounds or less.
</P>
<P>
   He beat both Pernell Whitaker and Hector (Macho) Camacho in 12
round decisions like De La Hoya did. And he knocked out Oba Carr
like De La Hoya did.
</P>
<P>
   Also like De La Hoya, who's been down four times, Trinidad's
chin has proven to be vulnerable, as he's been detached to the mat
six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Trinidad hasn't been down in the past four years,'' says
Bobby Goodman, the long-time fight publicist who now works for
King. ``I think he's matured as a fighter and also gotten
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw Trinidad floored by Luis (Yory Boy) Campas in the second
round in a fight five years ago at the MGM Grand Garden, but such a
humiliation seemed to incite Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   He would pummel Campas unmercifully after that indignity,
stopping him in the fourth round after landing 12 unanswered
punches.
</P>
<P>
   He is a brawler who never takes a backward step, and Oscar De La
Hoya has told intimates such an aggressive style is perfect for
him.
</P>
<P>
   It might be, but Felix Trinidad hasn't given the faintest hint
during his remarkable career that he would be an easy opponent for
anyone, even Oscar De La Hoya.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state is opening a new legal front in its
fight against pollution drifting from coal-burning power plants in
upwind states with an announcement Wednesday that it intends to sue
17 power plants to force them to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   This action would be the first by a state directly against
individual companies owning power plants that send pollution in the
air across state lines, according to federal environmental
officials and other experts. The Northeastern states and the
federal government have long battled to force these older plants,
mainly in the Midwest and the Virginias, to reduce their emissions,
but those efforts have faced a series of recent setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In letters being sent Wednesday to the companies that own the
plants, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York state gave
notice that he intends to sue them for failing to upgrade equipment
that cleans smokestack emissions when they made other big
investments in the plants. Such upgrades are required by the
federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, older plants were granted exemptions to the
stricter pollution standards required for newer ones, on the theory
that they would shut down in a few years anyway. But the clean air
law always contained provisions requiring power companies to seek a
permit and install better pollution controls if they substantially
upgraded these aging plants.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Spitzer said he could prove that significant
improvements had been made to equipment at the plants that
increased their lifespan and their output of both electricity and
pollution, but no permits were sought and no new pollution controls
added. The plants are located in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana,
Virginia and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   They include some of the biggest single sources of air pollution
in the country, with one plant in Ohio emitting more smog-causing
nitrogen oxides than all of the dozen or so coal-burning plants in
New York state, according to federal emissions records.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, New York and other Northeastern states had focused on
direct negotiations with upwind states over cutting smog, on
efforts to pass federal acid rain laws, and suits and petitions
aimed at forcing the federal Environmental Protection Agency to
stop pollution created in one place from adding to problems in
another.
</P>
<P>
   But the last round of state-to-state negotiations broke down two
weeks ago, no new acid rain laws are likely soon, and a round of
maneuvers in federal court by the states hosting the old coal
plants has delayed new EPA action to staunch the pollution flow. In
light of those problems, Spitzer decided to pursue the individual
suits, an approach his staff had been studying for some time. Those
suits would be filed in federal court, but where exactly has not
been decided, Spitzer's staff said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the new move is based on concrete facts about
changes at the plants, and thus should avoid some of the legal
snags that have delayed other efforts. ``The other actions involve
esoteric legal issues of jurisdiction and power,'' he said. ``We're
enmeshed there too. But this cuts right to the source.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of the impending legal action by New York, officials
at the EPA, which is conducting its own investigation of
investments and pollution at many coal-fired power plants, did
everything but cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we are absolutely supportive of any state's effort
to secure cleaner for its citizens,'' said EPA spokesman David
Cohen. ``We encourage the use of all legal tools available, and we
at EPA are doing everything possible, given constraints from recent
court decisions brought by polluters that have attempted to
frustrate our work.''
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the coal-power industry said they were
confident that they would prevail in court against the New York
suits.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clean Air Act, older plants were granted exemptions to
the stricter pollution standards required for newer ones, on the
theory that they would close in a few years anyway. But the law
requires companies to seek a permit and install better pollution
controls if they substantially upgrade aging plants.
</P>
<P>
   Federal environmental officials said that they had used the same
provisions of the Clean Air Act several years ago to force changes
at large pulp mills that upgraded but did not cut pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are owned by American Electric Power of Columbus,
Ohio; Cinergy Corp. of Cincinnati; Ohio Edison Co.; Northern
Indiana Public Service Co., Virginia Electric Power Co. and
Monongahela Power Co. of Morgantown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 17 plants named in the suit are owned by American
Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, and officials there, when told of
Spitzer's plans Tuesday, said the investments made at their old
plants were strictly to improve reliability and to keep up with
rising demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the maintenance work we do,'' said Pat Hemlepp,
a spokesman for American Electric Power. ``We're required by state
regulators to deliver reliable power to our customers. If what they
are questioning is whether we have done maintenance, yes, we have.
Have me made improvements that would increase capacity? No.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's staff contends otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the attorney general built their cases over the past
few months by collecting data from a wide array of federal and
state utility and environmental agencies that track the budgets,
construction projects, and pollution levels at plants, said Peter
Lehner, the top environmental lawyer in Spitzer's office. He said
consultants familiar with the energy industry helped pinpoint
instances where work was not simply done to replace old gear, but
to improve on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of this case is solid and fair,'' Lehner said.
``When an old plant's life is significantly extended, it has to
play closer to the rules of the new plants.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he provided some details about changes at one
West Virginia plant, which Lehner said he preferred not to identify
until the letters were sent out Wednesday. Records filed with the
Ohio Public Service Commission and federal energy officials show
that from 1988 to 1992, boilers for three generators were virtually
rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following the work, power generation at the plant
more than doubled, he said, resulting in a corresponding rise in
emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, which contribute to
smog and acid rain, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement may not end up playing out in a court
case, Lehner and others involved in the investigation said. The
plant owners could negotiate a settlement with New York in the
60-day waiting period required before such suits are filed, or they
could negotiate directly with the EPA some agreement to improve
pollution controls at the plants in question, lawyers in the
attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that the EPA could wrap up its own
simultaneous investigation of potential violations of pollution
laws and take one or more of the plant owners to court in the
meantime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And New York and other Northeastern states still are pursuing
other actions, including petitioning the EPA directly to force
individual power plants to clean up pollution. In New York, the
pressure on the Clinton administration has come not from Spitzer,
who is a Democrat, but from the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, which _ unlike the attorney general's office _
operates at the pleasure of Gov. George Pataki, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Pataki administration officials declined to comment on
Spitzer's initiative, preferring to highlight the work being done
to put pressure on the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawsuits go to court, they are likely to be hard fought,
said David Flannery, a lawyer and spokesman for the Midwest Ozone
Group, a coalition of coal and power companies.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the action by New York and the ongoing
investigations of work at the old power plants by the EPA would not
change a basic reality _ that much of the pollution in the
Northeast is generated there, not carried on the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still isn't any good science showing otherwise,''
Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said his main goal is to clean the air. He added that
his office was planning similar actions against heavily polluting
power plants in New York state, as well. ``We're looking at
everyone,'' he said.

SISTER TELLS OF LAST VISIT WITH BYRD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ A sister of a black man who was dragged to death
near Jasper last year took the stand Tuesday in white supremacist
Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr.'s capital murder trial to tell jurors
about the last time she saw her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Verrett of Houston identified James Byrd Jr.'s shirt,
shoes, watch and keys, and said that the day before Byrd was
chained to a pickup and dragged down a rural road, she had given
him some new clothes. Byrd, whom she called by his nickname,
``Son,'' had promptly tried them on and modeled for her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paraded in front of me and said, `What do you think?''' she
remembered. ``I told him he looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   And when she was shown a baseball cap found at the crime scene
June 7, 1998, Verrett smiled and identified it as a souvenir that
her sister, Mylinda Washington, had given to Byrd after returning
from a family vacation to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all loved him very much?'' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney
Johnny Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part of us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett was among 12 witnesses to take the stand during the
second day of testimony in Brewer's trial, which was moved to
Brazos County at his lawyers' request.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, several law enforcement officers testified
how they had collected evidence, including beer bottles, a can of
black spray paint and cigarette butts from the crime scene and
shoes, pornographic photos and notebooks containing racist
literature from the apartment of Brewer's co-defendant, John
William ``Bill'' King.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also got their first look at color slides of Brewer's
tattoos, which include an eagle, a pentagram, a burning cross, a
swastika, the words ``death before dishonor'' and the ``patch'' or
symbol of the Confederate Knights of America, a racist prison gang
affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan. Brewer, an ex-con who served time
for burglary and parole violations, was a top official, the
``Exalted Cyclops,'' of the CKA at the Beto I prison unit in
Tennessee Colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not illegal to have tattoos,'' Jasper County District
Attorney Guy James Gray said after leaving the courtroom for the
day. ``But it's an expression of the degree of their white
supremacy. It's one thing to say white supremacist words. It's
another to belong to a white supremacist gang. It's one step
further when you tattoo that message on your body. That's
permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brewer's attorneys, Doug Barlow and Layne Walker of
Beaumont, downplayed the significance of the tattoos, pointing out
on cross-examination that there could be several interpretations of
their meaning. And they reminded jurors of another tattoo that had
earlier been shown on an overhead projector. That tattoo, an image
of a woman on Brewer's chest, depicted a friend of Brewer's family
whom he knew from his church growing up, Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team also picked at the evidence-gathering
techniques of several law officers, criticizing Jasper County
sheriff's office investigator Tommy Robinson because he did not
change his gloves each time he picked up a new piece of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you agree with me that you were in way over your
heads?'' Walker asked him on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir, I wouldn't agree with that,'' Robinson replied.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also showed jurors a color photo of Brewer's toe,
which was bruised and swollen when he was booked into the Jasper
County Jail the day after Byrd's dismembered, decapitated corpse
was found on Huff Creek Road near a black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also were told that a shoe with the initials ``L.B.'' on
the tongue and what appeared to be blood on the toe was found at
King's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Gray later indicated that DNA evidence from the shoe would help
link Brewer to the crime. An FBI expert in DNA evidence testified
during King's trial in Jasper last February that Brewer's tennis
shoe was stained with Byrd's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's genetic blueprint, testimony in that trial indicated,
was found on a beer bottle and a cigarette butt found at the crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of capital murder, Brewer, 32, would face life in
prison or death by injection.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, was convicted by a Jasper County jury last February
and was sent to death row. A third defendant, Shawn Allen Berry,
24, will be tried later this year.

 &HT;    Floyd packing mighty winds as it threatens Atlantic coast
 &HT;    (EDS: UPDATES; CORRECTS writer's name to Rochell in tagline;
Barnes &AMP; Noble; Chick-fil-A.)
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Florida's day of reckoning starts this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Massive and menacing, Hurricane Floyd began buffeting Florida's
east coast Tuesday afternoon with strong winds and heavy rain. But
the real onslaught should come today.
</P>
<P>
   However, Floyd took a favorable northerly turn Tuesday evening,
perhaps keeping the storm's sustained winds of 140 mph farther
offshore than first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions changed through the night, but it was generally
forecast that the center of Floyd could come within 30 miles of the
central Florida coast. That close brush would leave coastal cities
such as Melbourne and Cape Canaveral exposed to winds of up to 100
mph and a potential storm surge of 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida started to feel the punishment from the powerful
storm, the Georgia and South Carolina coasts braced for a possible
landfall by late tonight or early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas felt Floyd's full fury Tuesday as the hurricane
easily uprooted 30-foot trees and sent blinding, horizontal sheets
of rain through deserted streets. The fierce winds shoved autos
around, snapped palm trees and set car alarms screeching throughout
Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive reports of damage and possible injuries or fatalities
could not be easily determined because most communication to the
islands was lost.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is already known about Floyd: It's one of the
worst storms many longtime weather watchers can remember. By the
time it becomes a whisper, Floyd may go down as one of the largest,
most destructive storms to hit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dangerous storm,'' said Jeremy Pennington, a
meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center. ``We don't see
many Category 4 intensity storms striking the U.S. mainland and
certainly not one as large as this.''
</P>
<P>
   A clerk at the Avis rental car counter at Orlando International
Airport summed it up when she told a customer: ``Things that are
standing today aren't going to be standing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much is still standing in the Bahamas remains to be
seen, perhaps as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian defense officials met Tuesday to plan cleanup and
relief efforts, and all defense personnel were ordered to report to
duty this morning, according to radio reports from the islands.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not wait for the storm to hit U.S. soil to
issue a pre-emptive disaster declaration for Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The early declaration ``enables state and local governments to
get equipment and other things ... in place to begin recovery
efforts at the earliest possible moment,'' White House spokesman
Barry Toiv said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd stranded thousands of travelers throughout the nation
Tuesday as airlines grounded hundreds of flights. Most of the
passengers were headed to or from Florida, where a handful of
airports closed. Some train service on the East Coast also was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of how seriously Floyd is being taken could be
found Tuesday at a deserted Disney World, which closed its gates
due to weather for the first time in its 28-year history. Other
Orlando-area resorts such as Universal Studios and SeaWorld also
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   With a storm that is more than 500 miles wide, hurricane-force
winds of at least 74 mph could reach as far inland as Orlando, 60
miles west of Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Commission Chairman Mel Martinez, whose community
includes Disney World and other theme parks, urged evacuation _ and
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should call for higher help,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach construction worker Rick Ross placed his faith in
plywood and nails. The 40-year-old lives just west of the Atlantic
Ocean, which crept a block closer to the Daytona Beach shore than
usual by Tuesday afternoon _ and Floyd was still 300 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   From a playground parking lot overlooking the frothing,
white-capped ocean, Ross watched the thundering surf with his black
labrador-chow-shepherd mix, Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live right up the street. Everything I own is there,'' Ross
said. ``I'm not going to leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   On International Speedway Boulevard, a mix of hotels, strip
malls and the home track of the Daytona 500 NASCAR race, most
businesses shut down early Tuesday, if they opened at all. The road
was already littered with broken branches.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters was closed. So was Barnes &AMP; Noble, Chick-fil-A, Sears
and Dillard's. KFC and Wendy's served the lunch crowd before
letting its employees make their storm preparations. Hotel clerks
turned away guests, saying they'd need to drive at least an hour
west to find accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The big business was at Home Depot, which opened a register
outside to handle demand for 4 X 8 sheets of plywood. Seventeen
minutes before the 2 p.m. closing time Tuesday, the line was 18
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Former Volusia County lifeguard Tim Johnson stood in the middle
of the plywood line. His family lives in Port Orange just west of
the Intracoastal Waterway, less than 1 mile from the beach. Johnson
ordered 14 sheets at $14.97 a piece
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we get the outskirts,'' Johnson said. ``If it gets
too bad, we'll try and head somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Kmart on Semoran Boulevard in Orlando, residents bought
33-gallon trash cans to store water.
</P>
<P>
   Inland shelters filled up quickly. Even pets sought refuge, and
Osceola County animal shelters filled up with 700 pets by late
afternoon. After 6 p.m., officials in Seminole County urged
residents to boil their drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Along Central Florida's Space Coast, the streets of small beach
towns from Melbourne north to the Kennedy Space Center were empty
of all but the last stragglers, who motored through blustery winds
on their way to bridges leading to the mainland. Mandatory
evacuation orders were issued Monday, and heavy traffic choked
highways leading west toward Orlando all that night and into
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses were boarded up with plywood, along with houses
facing the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A big worry on the barrier island was storm surge. In Cocoa
Beach, State Road A1A skirts just along the top of the dune line,
with one row of homes perched just over the beach, most about 10 to
15 feet above the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Tuesday, huge waves were pounding the dune, splashing
foam and sea mist onto the beachfront houses. Chronic erosion
problems have left many homeowners with little more than sea walls
to protect their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's breaking a mile out already,'' said Mike Brown, 48, who
runs a small cleaning business in Cocoa Beach and lives one block
from the ocean. ``It's looking like it wants to top the dune.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy Space Center, 12,500 workers were evacuated,
leaving behind 102 employees who volunteered to ride out Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's four space shuttles _ worth $2 billion each _ were inside
hangars, but officials were worried that the buildings are not
capable of withstanding winds of more than 125 mph. Officials also
were worried about four unmanned rockets already on launch pads
that could not be moved to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Workers placed protective towers around the rockets and secured
them to their pads as best they could.
</P>
<P>
   There were also fears that rising waters from Floyd's storm
surge might inundate the facility. Most of the launch complex and
processing buildings are less than 10 feet above sea level, and
forecasters said Floyd might kick up waves of 20 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a direct hit on us, or even a skirting hit, we could
lose a great deal,'' said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 miles up the coast, lifelong St. Simons Island
resident Jamie Gould IV said he will ride out Floyd on the
low-lying barrier island. The Gould family has seen storms: Gould's
great-great grandfather built the island's landmark lighthouse more
than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said he disobeyed a mandatory evacuation order that went
into effect for Glynn County around noon Tuesday because an elderly
neighbor with cancer could not be budged from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't leave Mr. Jimmy,'' Gould said. ''We'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, however, most of the Georgia island's 18,000
year-round residents and more than a few late summer vacationers
had crossed the four-mile long causeway to the mainland on the
first leg of what quickly became a crowded trip west.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency for the entire
coast Tuesday. Gale-force winds were expected to begin raking St.
Simons around dawn today and winds as high as 125 miles an hour
could hit by this evening, said Ed Abel, Glynn's emergency
management director.
</P>
<P>
   Abel said barrier islands and low-lying areas could be awash and
battered by wind-driven waves if the storm surge reaches its
projected 9 to 15 feet over mean sea level.
</P>
<P>
   During the afternoon Tuesday, most islanders packed their cars,
moved patio furniture indoors, boarded or taped windows and headed
west.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene McCabe, a computer teacher at Glynn Middle School in
Brunswick, finished her packing and played Frisbee at an island
park with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having to leave all my house plants, my yard sale
treasures and my three cats behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said she fears the hurricane will devastate the island's
magnificent live oak forest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take a good, long look at these trees,'' she said. ''I just
hope they'll be here when we come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation also was felt in South Carolina, where Charleston
Mayor Joseph Riley declared a state of emergency. Starting today,
the city will be under curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Riley spent Tuesday warning that Floyd threatens to flood
low-lying areas spared by Hugo in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If Floyd makes landfall southwest of Charleston, near Beaufort
and Edisto Island, tidal surges of 12 to 18 feet could hit
Charleston, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's mayor for 23 years, Riley is particularly worried
that some residents don't appreciate the possible danger.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 56, said Floyd is following a course similar to a
hurricane in 1893 that killed 1,500 to 2,000 people in coastal
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real killer is the surge, the almost instantaneous rush of
water into areas where people do not expect it,'' Riley said.
``They do not call this the low country for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plywood covered the tall arched windows of Charleston's City
Hall and other historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd go back to Mayberry,'' read a message scrawled on a
board over the window of the Four Corners Cafe on Broad Street.

 SYRACUSE TRIES 2 UNDERCLASSMEN TO SUCCEED McNABB  
 (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Replacing Donovan McNabb as Syracuse quarterback would be
difficult for even a highly touted upperclassman with obvious
talent and impressive size. It would seem harder to replace a
four-year fixture like McNabb with an undersized redshirt freshman
who was lightly recruited at this position outside the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   But this could be the case for the Orangemen, who risk their
undefeated record Saturday night against undefeated Michigan in the
Carrier Dome. Once again the Syracuse starter is expected to be
Troy Nunes, now with 182 pounds on his 6-foot frame, up from 163
pounds last season.
</P>
<P>
   Nunes is one of two quarterbacks expected to share the position
for the third consecutive game. The other is Madei Williams, a
sophomore who has not yet conceded the first-string position.
Michigan, which lost at home to Syracuse last season, is also
expected to use two quarterbacks, with fifth-year senior Tom Brady
and sophomore Drew Henson again taking turns.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback rotation seems to be in fashion on many campuses
this season, at least until conference schedules, performance
differences and injuries force coaches to make choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know if it's a trend,'' said Syracuse coach Paul
Pasqualoni of the two-quarterback system. ``The teams that are
doing it probably have two guys who deserve to play or deserve to
be evaluated. It has worked out for us so we are going to continue
it. We are comfortable with that. It is still early in the year.
They both had a chance to play Saturday and both did some really
nice things.''
</P>
<P>
   In that game, a 47-7 victory over Central Michigan, Nunes
completed 8 of 13 passes, 3 of them for touchdowns, for 170 yards.
Williams was 5 of 6 for 91. Williams was last year's backup to
McNabb, a versatile and charismatic star who was chosen with the
second pick of the National Football League draft by the
Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' chances were hurt this summer in training camp by an
injury to his left hand, although he throws with his right.
Speaking by telephone yesterday, he said the injury ``kind of cut
down on my reps as far as assuming the starting quarterback role,''
as he missed a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to get the opportunity to get out on the field and
make the plays I do make,'' he said. ``Right now I'm just battling
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who dislocated and cut the little finger of his left
hand, said that the first-string job was ``definitely a
possibility'' for him and that he and Nunes had a good
relationship. They played against each other in high school in the
Pittsburgh area.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the outside looking in, it might seem like it would be
hard,'' Williams said. ``But we get along. We get along just fine.
There's no legitimate starter now. Even though he's playing well,
I'm playing well myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Williams improved in Game 2. In the first game, a
35-12 victory over Toledo, Williams fumbled three times, partly a
result of his hand injury. He did not fumble Saturday. ``Madei got
better,'' Pasqualoni said, ``and Troy did also.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer break and again this week, McNabb visited campus
and spoke to both. Nunes said McNabb ``told me and Madei to do what
you can and not put any more pressure on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do all the stuff he did,'' Nunes said. ``It
will be difficult. He's one of the best the university has ever
seen. We know what we're following.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is 6 feet 2 inches and 202 pounds. Nunes is
considerably smaller, and the head coach was asked about his size
this week. ``The line and the backs really blocked the blitzes,''
he said. ``I think that is probably the most important factor as
opposed to are you tall or short.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, Nunes spoke of the first-string role.
He said Syracuse followers conceded the job to Madei, and
acknowledged that it was ``hard for me to take.''
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Pasqualoni said: ``If there's one clear
quarterback, nobody in America is a two-quarterback guy. When it's
gray, it's easy to say you're a two-quarterback guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is also dealing with two quarterbacks, although Brady
is a returning starter. Henson, a Yankees baseball prospect, has
come off the bench in the first half in both Michigan victories,
over Notre Dame and Rice. In a telephone interview from Ann Arbor,
Mich., this week, Brady said: ``We're very solid at the quarterback
position. We both have experience. We've both been in big games.''
He said he was not bothered by having competition for the job.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview last week, Henson said, ``We may not be
the best of friends, but we have tremendous respect for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said the biggest difference between them is three years in
age. ``We are good friends,'' Brady said. ``You kind of develop
your close relationships with people who are more your age. But,
obviously, I have a great amount of respect for Drew. I'm always
rooting for him just as I'm sure he's always rooting for me. Our
goal is to win football games.''

STOCKTON HOPES TO GET BACK INTO SWING OF THINGS ON SENIOR TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When Dave Stockton awoke Jan. 1, not all of his golf
game entered the new year with him. He just didn't know it at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre is the only way Stockton can describe his 1999 Senior
PGA Tour season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 16 top 10 finishes last year, and I haven't had a one
this year,'' he said yesterday after playing a practice round at
Bent Tree Country Club, site of this week's Bank One Championship.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 finishes in the top 25 this season, Stockton's game
hasn't been rotten enough to dump into the trash, but it hasn't
satisfied the eight-year Senior Tour veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been by far my worst year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Senior Tour, he finished in the top 10 at
least nine times (1997) and as many as 24 times (1995) a season.
During that time he has recorded 14 victories, so it's no surprise
his play this season has him concerned.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad for Stockton that he summoned his son, Ron, from
competing on the mini-tours 21/2 months ago to follow him around
and see if he could help cure his ailing game.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton said he has found the root of his problem, and will tee
off Friday in the first round with more confidence than he has had
all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I'm fine. I think most of my problems have been
mental,'' he said. ``I've had too many \Rswing\S ideas, and I've
been trying too hard. I have to relax more and just let it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his play last week at the Comfort Classic in
Indianapolis was solid, and he tied for 19th, which was his third
consecutive tournament to finish in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with Tom Watson two rounds, and I really played
good,'' Stockton said of his pairing with the senior rookie who
finished in a tie for 22nd. ``I'm encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton said part of the reason for his so-so season could be
attributed to a couple of family situations in the past year that
caused him to miss playing on some of his favorite courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, my older son's wife had a baby that was about 21/2
months premature,'' Stockton said. He curtailed his playing to be
with his son, David, and family as the baby had to undergo stomach
surgery and survive pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby's fine, now, and just celebrated her first
birthday,'' Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this year, his wife's 87-year-old mother was seriously
injured after a fall, and died almost three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent more time at home because of all this,'' said
Stockton, who has played in 19 events this season. ``But I have no
reason to not be playing good now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we're back in Dallas,'' said Stockton, who won the
Muratec Reunion Pro-Am in 1993 at Stonebriar Country Club in
Frisco. ``I like it here and I like the course. I feel like I could
have a good week.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the seniors played at Bent Tree was in 1988 when
the Reunion Pro-Am ended a four-year stay, and that was before
Stockton was old enough to play.

TRAVEL TIP FOR JAN. 1, 2000: STAY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The people at the State Department did their best
to be diplomatic Tuesday, but there was no getting away from the
message: Saturday, Jan. 1, 2000, may not be the best day to travel
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The department said it was preparing detailed advisories
covering 194 countries and how they are dealing with the inexorable
approach of the next millennium and the problems that may befall
computers come New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials were cautious in their language,
emphasizing that the advisories in no way constitute warnings not
to go to certain places, but are meant to foster preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of State has no greater responsibility than to
insure to the best of our ability the safety and security of U.S.
citizens traveling around or residing abroad,'' Kevin Herbert, the
director of overseas citizens services in the department's bureau
of consular affairs, told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he issued a reminder that whatever computer
complications occur in the switch to the year 2000 just might be
more serious than, say, an annoyance with an airline-reservations
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In countries that are not sufficiently prepared,'' Herbert
warned, computer problems could affect vital functions like medical
services, telecommunications, and electricity and water, as well as
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   China, Russia and India are among the biggest countries that may
be susceptible to mixups, the State Department said.
Country-by-country advisories are at the Bureau of Consular Affairs
site: http://travel.state.gov/travelwarnings.html
</P>
<P>
   To assess how other countries are meeting the computer
challenge, the department has been collecting data from American
embassies around the world for nearly a year. It said it will post
updates whenever appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the prognosis all bleak. Australia, for example, is rated
well prepared to deal with any computer problems that may come up,
whether they be in government, industry, transportation or other
services.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department did not point it out, Australia may
even provide a hint of just how serious the problems will be.
</P>
<P>
   The New Year, and the new millennium, will arrive in Sydney 15
hours before it does in Washington.

L.A. FLAWS PUT NFL EXPANSION IN LIMBO
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas) ( nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In three weeks, the National Football League is supposed to
award its 32nd franchise to Los Angeles or Houston. On further
review, it may defer the choice until November.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could stick with 31 teams.
</P>
<P>
   League officials met Monday with representatives of three Los
Angeles suitors and the prospective Houston owner and decided that
the franchise hunt is still as wide open as the Vikings' passing
attack, and that the owners will vote on Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Any possibility of conferring a franchise on either city
Wednesday is impossible, although Wednesday had originally been
cited as the deadline. The league voted, 29-2, last March that its
expansion committee would recommend making Houston the 32nd team if
Los Angeles did not have a stadium site, a plan to build and
finance a stadium and commitments by the business community to
support a franchise by Wednesday. But it did not specify when the
committee would make its report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL hasn't ruled anyone out, and hasn't ruled anyone in,''
said Gregg Davis, who met with league officials Monday on behalf of
his father, Marvin, the billionaire oilman, to pitch Hollywood
Park, a race track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have the most plausible site,'' said Davis, a
sensible position given the track's abundant land and parking. The
enormous cost of building garages near the L.A. Memorial Coliseum
led the league last month to end its exclusive focus on the
Raiders' and Rams' former home and widen its vistas to Hollywood
Park and Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's wide open _ and all sites are under active
consideration,'' said Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the league.
``It's a matter of someone stepping up with a plan that can get 24
votes from owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The league wants to return to Los Angeles because it is the
nation's second-largest TV market and to prove that the problems
that sent the Raiders back to Oakland and the Rams to Anaheim and
then St. Louis, were more about ownership than a lack of fan
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion guarantees an infusion of cash; splitting an expansion
fee of perhaps $600 million 31 ways would mean $19.5 million a
team.
</P>
<P>
   Now the expansion process must be crammed into three weeks; it
started Monday with league officials describing the steps it would
take until owners meet Oct. 5 to 6, and asking how much of an
expansion fee the suitors would pay. Last week, NFL Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue said the fee would be more than the $476 million Al
Lerner paid for the Cleveland Browns. Lerner paid $54 million more
to defray the cost of building a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' group did not present a plan to develop land at Hollywood
Park for a stadium on Monday, and there is a suspicion inside the
league that Davis is more a window shopper than a serious buyer.
Davis owns an option to buy land at the race track for $60 million,
but must renew his option by Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is little time to make his case for Hollywood
Park, Gregg Davis said that ``we feel very confident about doing a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum plan from Ed Roski Jr., a real-estate developer,
and Eli Broad, a financial services magnate, is well known to the
league but no longer tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood talent manager, had once trumpeted
the Carson option, but ``his interest is in being an owner and
operator in Los Angeles and he'll do it wherever it needs to be
done,'' Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   The league met last week with Carson officials, who would invest
$180 million in a stadium and mall on a former landfill that needs
a $35 million cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposal is there,'' said Daryl Sweeney, a Carson City
councilman. ``We don't have to start from scratch like Hollywood
Park. We're cautiously optimistic, but we're not interested in
being dragged around. If we're in play, we can move instantly into
formation.''
</P>
<P>
   The only obstacle-free course for the league is in Houston, the
11th-largest television market, where Robert McNair is ready with a
$310 million stadium plan that has $195 million in public money on
tap. His only problem is that Houston is not Los Angeles, an
entertainment mecca that the league feels incomplete without.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that Sept. 15 was the deadline and any decision
will be based on where the parties are at that time,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. The league will accept more information through
Oct. 5 on Hollywood Park and Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to admit that it's time to bring this thing to a
conclusion,'' McNair said. ``I'm not going to do this for the rest
of my life.''

SUNDAY'S COMEBACK RANKS HIGH IN COWBOYS LORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Three days have passed since the Cowboys' 41-35
overtime comeback, and I still can't believe the Redskins left
speedy receiver Raghib Ismail that wide open on the clinching
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That's seemingly as implausible as the Redskins' unthinkable
bobble on their potential game-winning field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Just ahead of these incidents on the incredulous meter is that
the Cowboys won the game after trailing 35-14 in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Add the memory of receiver Michael Irvin becoming the playmaker
again with two fourth-quarter touchdowns, the fourth-quarter calm
and perfection of quarterback Troy Aikman and running back Emmitt
Smith's ``I want the ball'' intensity, and what you have are
lasting images of one of the greatest games in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   At least so says a certain former baby photographer who served
as the Cowboys' scouting director from 1959-1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the great ones,'' said Gil Brandt, now a
scouting analyst for NFL.com.
</P>
<P>
   So move over, Hail Mary, make room for Double-Dive 132, the play
call on Ismail's dash to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and Ismail, likewise, achieve places alongside 1974
Thanksgiving Day cult heroes Clint ``The Mad Bomber'' Longley and
receiver Drew Pearson, who also hauled in Roger Staubach's Hail
Mary pass against the Vikings in the 1975 divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt, whose vast experience with the Cowboys has taught him to
never give up, said he wasn't surprised by the comeback, which he
called ``one of the greatest not just in Cowboys history but ever
in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it was over,'' Brandt said. ``I might have
thought it was over if you were going against a real good defense.
I might have thought it was over if you didn't have so many weapons
on offense. Maybe if you didn't have so many receivers that could
make big plays or a run-of-the-mill running back or some Billy Joe
Tolliver at quarterback, it's over. But with Aikman and those guys,
you have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also certain is that for much of their 40-year history,
the Cowboys have always seemingly made most of their chances,
despite impossible situations.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's outing was just the latest in a long line of great
Cowboys finishes. Here are a few others to jog your memory bank:
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving Day in 1974 will be forever remembered for rookie
quarterback Longley and, as teammate Blaine Nye said, ``the triumph
of an uncluttered mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley had never thrown a regular-season pass, nor did he have
a good grasp of the Cowboys offense before being forced into action
in the third quarter because of an injury to starter Roger
Staubach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he rallied the Cowboys from a 16-3 deficit to a 24-23
victory, capped by a 50-yard touchdown pass to Pearson in the final
30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hail Mary was the proper name for the situation facing the
Cowboys on a bitterly cold December day in Minnesota in 1975.
Trailing 14-10 against the heavily favored Vikings, the Cowboys got
the ball on their own 9-yard-line with less than two minutes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Staubach threw five passes on the drive _ all to Pearson. The
last one was literally a prayer. Lined up at ]midfield with 24
seconds left, Staubach threw a long pass down the right sideline.
Pearson faked inside then raced to the corner. As the badly
underthrown ball came down, there was contact between Pearson and
Vikings cornerback Nate Wright, who fell down. Pearson caught it on
his hip at the 5-yard line and stepped backward into the end zone
as the Cowboys won, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had more of an eerie sensation on a football field,''
said Staubach, who told news reporters he had said a ``Hail Mary''
before throwing the pass. ``It was as if we were playing in an
empty stadium. The silence was deafening.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1979, Staubach played his final regular-season game.
And the hated Redskins were in town to decide the NFC East title.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't motivation enough, then add in the backdrop of a
funeral wreath sent to Cowboys defensive end Harvey Martin earlier
in the week wishing him ``sympathy for an impending loss''.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys fell behind 17-0 in the second quarter and trailed
34-21 late in the fourth. Staubach, however, began to work his
magic again. A 30-yard touchdown pass to Ron Springs cut the score
to 34-28. The game-winner came on a 7-yard pass to Tony Hill in the
final minute.
</P>
<P>
   After the 35-34 victory, Martin marched to the Redskins locker
room and tossed the wreath into the middle of their prayer and told
them to ``take this damn thing back to Washington with you.''
Yardsticks \Nsubheds:Defense anyone?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Redskins combined for 1,045 yards _ 541 Dallas,
504 Washington _ all all-time high for a Cowboys game. After Week
1, the Cowboys are 27th in the league in total defense, and the
Redskins are 30th.
\Nsubheds:Ground control
</P>
<P>
   In Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren, the Cowboys have the No. 1 and
No. 5 leading active rushers in the NFL. Smith has 12,675 career
yards; Warren has 7,055.
\Nsubheds:Third and long
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive end Greg Ellis was criticized last season for
getting only three sacks in 16 games. After getting two in the
season opener against the Redskins, he's on pace for 32 in 1999.

COWBOYS HOPE VIKINGS BLUEPRINT STOPS FALCONS' ANDERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys will attempt to contain Jamal
Anderson on Monday night by duplicating the Minnesota Vikings'
success of stacking eight-man fronts and using more than arms to
make tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys did little of either Sunday against the Washington
Redskins, allowing unheralded running back Stephen Davis to rumble
for 109 yards, more than doubling Anderson's 50-yard output on 16
carries in the Atlanta Falcons' season-opening loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to be a younger, quicker Cowboys defense was
pushed around for three quarters by Davis and quarterback Brad
Johnson, and wound up yielding 504 total yards. Now, the test comes
from a Super Bowl team that boasted the league's second-best rusher
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better be a good, solid tackler because he can run through
the arm tackle,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``The man is a
big man who can run the football, and he's hard to tackle. He can
make you look bad in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's style is based on spotting a crease in the defense
and attacking it. He uses his muscular, 234-pound physique to
punish would-be-tacklers by dropping a shoulder or stiff-arming
defenders. He often resembles a larger Emmitt Smith, churning out
yards with quick bursts up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   In his second year as a full-time starter, Anderson carried the
Falcons to the Super Bowl last season, rushing for 1,846 yards and
14 touchdowns on an NFL-record 410 attempts. When he carried the
football 20 times or more last season, including the playoffs, the
Falcons went 15-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings limited him to 16 carries, mainly by forging a
17-point lead that forced the Falcons to pass, but also via a
dominating performance by the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used a lot of eight-man fronts to try to stop the run and
force the pass,'' Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo said of
the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys must get improved play from ends Greg Ellis and
Kavika Pittman, and tackles Chad Hennings and Alonzo Spellman. The
foursome applied little pressure to Johnson, giving him time to
pass for 382 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a good job with the front seven,'' Campo said.
``We didn't tackle very well last week. He's the kind of guy that
can get into a crease and make your secondary get involved as well.
''

FOR AUSTRALIA, THE CLOCK IS COUNTING DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ In exactly one year, the largest event in
the history of sports will get under way here in Sydney, where
billions of dollars, national pride and international prestige will
all be at stake at the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Olympics, from Sept. 15 through Oct. 1 next year,
will include a record number of sports (28), events (292), sessions
(635) and athletes (10,200). And Stadium Australia, site of the
opening and closing ceremonies and the track and field events, is
also the largest arena in the history of the Olympics, holding
110,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the size of these Games _ and the controversy that
has accompanied them here and the Olympic movement in general _ the
Sydney organizers say they are prepared but not overconfident as
the year counts down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not scared, but we're running scared,'' said Sandy
Hollway, chief executive of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games. ``There's a strong sense of urgency and not a shred
of complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   All outward indications back him up. In August, Stadium
Australia, located in Homebush Bay, 10 miles west of downtown
Sydney, staged a rugby match attended by 107,042, most of whom got
there by train or bus with minimal delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That test went smoothly, but I told my people that we'll have
to do that twice a day for eight straight days of track and
field,'' said Jim Brown, who managed Stanford University stadium
during its six World Cup games in 1994 and the baseball stadium in
Atlanta in the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, transport planners were recently told to upgrade the
services between the athletes' village and venues.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney organizers are trying to avoid the problems that
befell the Atlanta Games, during which transportation and
technology breakdowns were constant headaches for athletes,
spectators and media alike.
</P>
<P>
   Hollway, 53, an affable and unflappable former diplomat, has
studied Atlanta's difficulties _ and achievements _ and hired key
managers, including Americans like Brown, to apply in Sydney
lessons learned in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Donovan, 32, who was a technical manager in Atlanta and is
senior competitions executive here, said that Sydney is now a year
or more in advance of Atlanta's readiness at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that Atlanta failed to fully test the computerized
distribution of scores and times. Sydney plans to test that
process, for media and spectators, on Super Sunday, a Sept. 26 test
in which live or simulated results from 21 sites will
simultaneously pour into an information control center.
</P>
<P>
   Test events at national and international levels in 10 Olympic
sports _ and a range of meetings for Olympic back office players,
are also being held here this month as Olympics planners shift
gears up from talks to tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Super September program involves 10 sports and
competitors from over 50 nations in order to simulate Olympic
conditions. The sports involved are archery, badminton,
canoe/kayak, equestrian, field hockey, handball, pentathlon,
rowing, sailing and water polo. Their sites range from Sydney
Harbor in the city center to a whitewater course in suburban
Penrith, 25 miles west.
</P>
<P>
   Hollway marked the end of the five-year planning stage and the
start of a year of operational testing for the Games by installing
two large clocks to remind his 1,000 staffers how time is running
out.
</P>
<P>
   One clock marks weeks remaining before the opening ceremony. The
other shows how long before the Olympic torch begins its
20,000-mile circuit of Australia, a 100-day, 100,000-runner relay
across the deserts, rain forests, sheep ranches and suburbs of this
island continent of 19 million people.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, one clock will indicate 52 weeks, the other 38
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, we've really got 14 weeks less than a year to go,''
Hollway said as he sat in his modest office, located in a former
newspaper building in a drab side street near Sydney's main
railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   A few issues still need to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the scandal surrounding the International Olympic
Committee members accused of selling their votes to bid cities, the
Sydney organizing committee has a sponsorship shortfall of about
$65 million. IOC vice president Dick Pound , apologized to Sydney
Games sponsors here Tuesday for negative publicity surrounding the
bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Atlanta's corporate-style, privately-funded organizing
group, the Sydney group is a public body, controlled by the New
South Wales government. Sydney is the state capital. Michael
Knight, a senior politician of the state's ruling Labor Party, is
minister for Olympics, drawing on a $3 billion mix of public
infrastructure funds, private investment in major venues, corporate
sponsorship and ticket and television revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5 million Games tickets, with a total value of $225
million, are on public sale in Australia and about 3 million
available overseas. Prices range from $1,000 for the opening
ceremony to $300 for a front seat at track finals to a $6 pass to
the rowing heats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the IOC scandal, the Sydney organizers had to
settle a few local issues. Despite neighborhood protests, the beach
volleyball competition will take place at Bondi Beach, a suburban
surf beach. And after Australians said that too many Americans and
Japanese were in the 2,000-member marching band participating in
the opening ceremonies, the committee has decided to form a more
international unit, using musicians from 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some minor complaints surfaced this week. Some news media
officials complained about the quality and cost of accommodation at
the $65 million media village, and Dr. Rick Charlesworth, coach of
Australia's Olympic gold medal women's field hockey team, said the
surface of the new field is not smooth enough.
</P>
<P>
   But one major controversy was solved Tuesday. The IOC announced
that it and the International Amateur Athletic Federation had
solved their differences over the starting times of leading track
events.
</P>
<P>
   While the IAAF had wanted from 10 to 13 changes in six days of
the track schedule, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch approved
just two. Speaking from Lausanne, Switzerland, Knight said Tuesday
that the final of the women's 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters would
be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC receives 40 percent of Olympic television royalties _
some 1,600 television cameras will be in use _ and divides them
between international sports federations.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney officials had always been willing to consider some
timetable changes, but not for the women's 400-meter final, planned
for Sept. 25, 2000. This is the hottest Games ticket for
Australians because Cathy Freeman, the current world champion, is
the favorite for the sprint and Australia's best chance for a track
medal.

HITCHCOCK LOOKS FOR SYNTHESIS IN THE STARS

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock has exchanged his
training-camp grade book for a hockey's version of the periodic
table.
</P>
<P>
   He has begun studying his players' chemistry instead of just his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had good individual evaluations,'' Hitchcock said
yesterday. ``Now, we'll evaluate line combos together.''
</P>
<P>
   He's looking to see who plays well together, trying to find
chemistry like right winger Jamie Langenbrunner and center Joe
Nieuwendyk had last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' upcoming road swing to Detroit, St. Louis and Chicago
will be his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pull a player out, I will pull the line out,''
Hitchcock said. ``The first five lines we'll pretty much keep as a
group.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to play 12 to 15 of his regulars each game
while trying to trim his roster from almost 50 to about 30 by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come back on Sunday with a pretty knowledge of our
group,'' Hitchcock said. Planted in the spotlight Center Derek
Plante stood out about as much as George Costanza would at a ``Hair
Club For Men'' meeting when he came to the Stars in a trade last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Both on and off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't had any trouble attracting attention so far in
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just liked Plante. He's been a good player for us,''
Hitchcock said. ``It's the new environment thing. It's a lot easier
to bring a role player in. A lot more chemistry goes into being a
skilled player.'' Ringing in the new season Stars goalie Ed Belfour
sat patiently by his locker yesterday as a visitor slipped aluminum
bands around his finger. Yes, it was ring-fitting time around
StarCenter but Belfour wasn't being choosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I get I'll be happy with,'' Belfour said. Briefly The
Stars sent goalie Lavente Szuper back to Ottawa of the Ontario
League yesterday. The Stars plan to scrimmage today and tomorrow at
the StarCenter.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: HELPING EXECUTIVES WORK IN CORPORATE JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On occasions when retired chief executives and other corporate
bigwigs run into one another, they seldom talk about how they miss
the old grind at the office. But they can get downright teary when
they talk about how much they miss that lovely airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate jet is the perk of perks for business travelers.
If you've flown in one _ soaring at a turbulence-free 50,000 feet
near the speed of sound, breathing abundant fresh air in a cabin as
comfortable as a living room, able to leap from exit door to car
without making that death march through some vast dingy airport _
you know why there are 8,000 corporate jets now under registry. Or
why there is an industry backlog of several years for new orders
for most top models. And other companies are creating a big new
market by acquiring a supply of corporate jets and essentially
dispatching them, like airborne rental limousines, to customers who
buy shares in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   A good many working stiffs, including those who fly first and
business class but most especially the ones wedged into coach on
those eight-hour flights, obviously resent the fact that the boss
might travel in such luxury, without having to deal with
passive-aggressive flight attendants, in a Gulfstream V that set
the stockholders back about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   But for the sake of argument, assume that flying the brass in a
private jet makes economic sense to many companies whose
executives' time means real money. Shouldn't the stockholders at
least expect the boss to work at something more important than the
games on his laptop while traveling in such comfort?
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where you sit on a commercial plane, that trip from
New York to Los Angeles uses up basically the whole day,'' said
Dennis Ferguson, the president of a company called Airshow Inc.
that is the major supplier of flight-information systems to
corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar of these systems is the in-flight map display,
a video screen that shows topographical maps of the ground below
superimposed with the airplane's present position, course, speed,
altitude and estimated arrival time.
</P>
<P>
   Though some executives say they can watch this gizmo for hours,
mesmerized as it depicts them soaring over the earth, that's pretty
old technology. At the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York recently,
Ferguson and the company's vice president for business development,
Patrick Flynn, were talking about new technology, including a
system that allows the so-called information superhighway to start
finding its way into the skies and keeping the tycoon actively on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   For years, corporate and other aircraft have had systems that
can receive television signals from satellites, though the service
usually works only when flying over land. But Airshow recently
introduced a product, Network '99, that collects and transmits
real-time, customized textual information, including news,
financial and market data, as well as e-mail and other text
messages, to specific aircraft from the company's headquarters in
Tustin, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The system is still in its infancy because of current bandwidth
limitations on the transmission to text. But that's changing, and
in a few years, the corporate jet, and commercial planes as well,
could be fully linked not only to on-ground data banks but to to
the Internet, with companies like Airshow acting as information
providers as well as distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Getting this technology to fly means that Airshow has to keep
track of where all those company planes are in the air at any given
time. This raises issues of both logistics and security.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson says he has that covered. He used to run a company in
Chicago that provided high-security limousine transportation for
corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see corporate travel as a security issue as well as an
information issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not So Fast
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of dissenting reader responses to an item in
this column in The New York Times two weeks ago about the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's Inspass system, which is
designed to allow frequent business travelers at selected airports
to bypass long immigration lines by scanning a card and their hand
through a machine. The INS said that the system hadn't expanded as
quickly as anticipated because international business travelers
didn't seem to be aware of how easy it was to get and use the pass
(the only requirement is two or more international business trips a
year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy my foot!'' one executive hooted. ``Every time I've tried
to use mine, the system has been down, and that means you go to the
end of the immigration line. Then, seeing that you tried to use the
pass, the immigration officer can get surly, because the pass
represents a threat to his job. I let my pass expire because it
wasn't worth the trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller said that the airport INS offices to apply for
the cards were not open at convenient times _ ``not even the hours
they have posted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS did not return a phone call Tuesday asking for comment
on these complaints. &QL;

ACTIVISTS AND SOME RODEO FANS DECRY CALF ROPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When dyed-in-the-leather cowboy Neal Gay watches calf roping, he
sometimes cringes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they say about an animal's durability; when
they jerk a calf down, it has to hurt,'' said Gay, producer of the
Mesquite Championship Rodeo] the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gay, however, includes calf roping on his weekly card. After
all, calf roping and saddle-bronc riding are the two original
events of organized rodeo and are among the five mandatory events
in Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the event appalls animal-rights activists and even some
rodeo fans, especially when they see animals stopped in their
tracks and yanked by their necks through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to seeing calf roping, and it doesn't really bother
me,'' said Garland resident Eddie Hill, a rodeo fan. ``But I've
taken people to the Mesquite Rodeo from Japan, and they are upset
with calf roping.''
</P>
<P>
   Said animal-rights activist Linda Yarbrough of Fort Worth:
``Calf roping is extremely disturbing. In this day and age, it's
abuse of animals. It's pretty black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   No statistics are kept on the number of injuries to calves, but
rodeo officials have been cognizant of criticism. In the past few
years, they've implemented several safety measures, including rules
forcing the use of smaller calves _ less jerking is required to
stop and tie them _ and giving judges the power to disqualify
contestants for jerking calves too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo officials also say what looks dangerous isn't for a calf,
comparing a calf's protection _ its hide and muscular structure _
to that of a football player wearing pads. Roping and tying a calf
can be compared to a running back being tackled and then popping up
and hustling back to the huddle, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a more urbanized society where people have very
little understanding of how sturdy calves really are,'' said Cindy
Schonholtz, the PRCA's animal-welfare coordinator. ``Instead of
always being on the defensive, we've worked really hard to educate
people and to help all rodeo associations come under compliance
with safety measures.'' SMALLER IS BETTER? Probably the biggest
change in calf roping is the use of smaller animals. The smaller
calves, which weigh 220 to 280 pounds, are about 70 pounds lighter
on average than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo cowboys point out that smaller calves require smoother
handling for fast times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to beat champions like Fred Whitfield and
Cody Ohl if you jerk your calf down and then have to take the time
for it to get back up,'' said Mack Altizer, who supplies livestock
for PRCA shows in Texas and the National Finals.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnny Emmons gained the first of his two National Finals
Rodeos calf-roping berths a decade ago, he earned many paychecks by
jerking a calf down before making the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calves were bigger then, and I wanted to make sure that it was
on the ground to keep it from running around,'' said Emmons, a
Grandview resident who qualified for the National Finals in 1989
and 1998. ``But if I did that now, I wouldn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ropers have devised a method called ``switching.'' After
lassoing the calf, ropers tighten the slack on the rope enough to
keep the animal on its feet; when the calf hits the end of the
rope, it turns around and faces the roper.
</P>
<P>
   And if calves are jerked down,, they can be disqualified. In the
past five years, PRCA judges have been allowed to disqualify a
contestant and levy a $100 fine for jerking a calf down; judges
have handed out 228 fines, but have disqualified only five
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see a guy flank a calf in a way that I think is too
rough, I call him for unnecessary roughness, and he'll
automatically be disqualified and have to pay a fine,'' PRCA rodeo
judge Tommy Keith said. ``And you bet I'll call it. There's not too
many guys willing to risk that with thousands of dollars at
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock contractors say they are also making stronger efforts to
purchase calves that are physically sound, Altizer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are coaching a soccer team, you're going to go after a
player that can run the length of the field,'' he said. ``We're not
going to buy calves that are short-legged with pot bellies; they
would stand more of a chance of injury. Today, we view the calves
as athletes, and we are more selective and give them better diets,
just like race horses and bucking horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo operators also have been encouraged to have smoother arena
surfaces so calves are less likely to suffer leg injuries by
digging in and locking their feet while being roped. CRUEL AT
HEART? None of the precautions are enough to convince Tammy Hawley,
executive director of the Humane Society of North Texas, that rodeo
needs calf roping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen stock contractors take better care of their animals
than children, and I'm aware that rodeo personnel have done a lot
to make calf roping safer for animals,'' Hawley said. ``But I'm
saddened by the fact that I see rodeo fans enjoying watching
animals being put in uncomfortable situations. When you see calves
roped and tied, you can see the fear in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Calf roping would not be sorely missed in Fort Worth if the
rodeo could be a PRCA-sanctioned show without the event, said Bob
Watt, the Stock Show's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we took out calf roping, only a small percentage of our
fans would be upset, and it wouldn't affect ticket sales that
much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Stock Show assistant general manager Trey Watt said
it is a challenge to sell calf roping to many fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have 300 clean calf-roping runs at our show, but all
that it takes is only one calf being jerked down, which causes a
fan to become upset,'' Trey Watt said. ``If one person calls and
says that they're upset, we've got a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always treated livestock well over the years at the
Stock Show, but within the last 10 years we've had to show proof
that were not abusing animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing people's perception about calf roping is our big
challenge.''

LINEBACKER SHUFFLE NOT A GAMBLE FOR TEXAS A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ There's always room for another good
linebacker at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   To create space for a player who might be the latest find, the
Aggies have moved their best linebacker to the position he played
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to redshirt freshman Brian Gamble, a name that could
become increasingly familiar beginning Saturday when the
seventh-ranked Aggies (1-0) play their home opener against Tulsa
(1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Based on review of the defensive tapes from the 37-17
season-opening victory over Louisiana Tech, A&AMP;M coaches have moved
Cornelius Anthony back to the weakside slot to open the door on the
strong side for Gamble. Gamble played most of the game against the
Ragin' Cajuns in the ``dime'' defensive package and made nine
tackles (six unassisted, two for losses) and recovered a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony moved to the strong side during two-a-days to fill the
void left by Dat Nguyen, last season's Lombardi Award winner who
plays for the Dallas Cowboys. Coach R.C. Slocum said he doesn't
believe moving Anthony back is _ well _ a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian is challenging for a starting position,'' Slocum said
yesterday. ``We're really pleased with him. He made some athletic
plays in the \Rlast\S ball game. But that didn't really surprise
me. We felt he'd be a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble's first-game performance might have nudged that timetable
a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out thinking that Gamble needed more playing time,''
Slocum said. ``We couldn't do that without reducing Cornelius' time
_ and we're not going to do that because he's the best we've got.
Cornelius played weak\Rside\S last year, so it made more sense move
him back over there and leave Gamble where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   This apparently is not an experiment. Asked if he anticipated
moving Anthony back, Slocum replied, ``not any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, 6-foot-2, 225 pounds, is from Class 2A Alto in East
Texas. He's a former high school quarterback-linebacker who wanted
to play linebacker in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was recruited at both positions,'' Gamble said. ``But I
wanted to play linebacker, so where else was there to go? A&AMP;M had
the great \Rlinebacking\S tradition and I knew Dat was still going
to be there and I could learn from him. Everything was in my
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble seems to have picked up Nguyen's aggressive style of play
and his sense of fun. He showed up for an interview yesterday
wearing a teammate's glasses \R''It makes me look educated,''\S and
a cheerleading T-shirt \R''for the irony of it.''\S
</P>
<P>
   But Gamble is not just a kid out on a lark, Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a young kid who is really good and who really knows the
game of football,'' Anthony said. ``I see a bright future for him.
He did a tremendous job against Louisiana Tech. For a guy to come
off a redshirt year and play like he has _ I'm sure we'll see a lot
more of him.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Briefly Reserve linebacker Chris Thierry is in a
Baytown hospital after undergoing a surgical procedure to
investigate a suspected kidney ailment. ... R.C. Slocum said
fullback D'Andre Hardeman is questionable this week after suffering
an ankle sprain against Louisiana Tech. He did not practice last
week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. _ After days of worry and preparation, with
much of the state's eastern coast boarded up and deserted, people
here in Florida braced for the arrival Wednesday morning of massive
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the hurricane's outer bands began to buffet the
state's east-central barrier islands after dark, forecasters were
still unsure if the deadly eye of the Category 4 storm would make
landfall, perhaps around Cape Canaveral, or if the storm center
would only skirt the state before turning north to threaten Georgia
and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said that, as they had cautiously forecast, Floyd
seemed to be turning more to the north, good news for Florida. But
even if the storm's eye, with winds of around 150 mph, did not come
ashore, meteorologists predicted that hurricane-force winds would
still extend into the state, strong enough to blow roofs off
houses, fell walls and topple trees.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, more than half a million people were on the move as
authorities ordered the evacuation of Savannah and low-lying
counties. In South Carolina, 800,000 people were ordered to leave
coastal areas, and even North Carolina declared a state of
emergency and urged residents of outlying islands to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayfield, the deputy director of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami, said Tuesday night that the most recent prediction
put the direction of the storm more toward the north, making
landfall more likely in Georgia or the Carolinas. He also said that
the storm had weakened, but warned against making too much of that.
``It's the difference between being hit by a semi and being hit by
a freight train,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, President Clinton on Tuesday issued an
unusual pre-emptive declaration of disaster for the state, even
before the first palm tree had been pushed down.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, James Witt, the federal official in charge of the
storm relief efforts, said Tuesday night that the exodus of
residents from the coastal areas was one of the largest evacuations
ever conducted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Clinton had declared Florida and Georgia disaster
areas even before the storm reached land, Witt said, ``The massive
evacuation is almost a disaster in itself,'' with its needs of
shelter, food and medical care for the thousands of people who left
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, warned that the northward jaunt of the storm probably came
too late to spare the east-central coast from what is still a
dangerous storm. One meteorologist predicted a ``weed-eater
effect'' as winds churn up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd howled through the Bahamas Tuesday, knocking out power,
wrecking boats, knocking down trees and damaging houses, but damage
was not as bad as expected, according to e-mails from residents
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, more than 1 million people evacuated the east coast
on Monday and Tuesday, and as of Tuesday evening thousands were
still stranded in unmoving traffic on a variety of interstates and
toll roads. Interstate 4, Toll Road 528, U.S. 1 and other routes
were more like parking lots much of the day, as people fled inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get the hell out,'' said Stephen Collins, who lives on
Merritt Island, between Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach, as he
gassed up his car at a convenience store on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the store's manager, A.K. Patel, put up hurricane
shutters and prepared to leave. ``I've got two kids,'' he said.
``We're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   All along this stretch of coast, waves were already chewing into
the beaches and washing over sea walls, but as dark fell the worst
of the storm was still miles off shore.
</P>
<P>
   Most people were long gone, and towns up and down the beach were
quiet and boarded-up. A few people made last-minute runs to the few
open stores for essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rich is staying. After boarding up her own windows in
Melbourne, she made a trip to the store for provisions: a case of
Corona beer, a 12-pack of Pepsi and a carton of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how long we're going to be trapped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just highway traffic that snarled here. Floyd closed
most of the state's airports, leaving passengers stranded and
upsetting flight schedules around the country.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that decisions made as early as Monday to
evacuate coastal areas were wise ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments did the right thing by asking for
evacuations early enough,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush. ``Floridians have
responded in the proper way.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1 million people ordered to evacuate their homes
in coastal Florida, hundreds of thousands spent the night inland
wherever they could find a bed. The more fortunate, and more
wealthy, filled hotel rooms in Orlando and other inland cities, and
some drove as far the west coast, to Naples, Fort Myers and the
Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands filled high school gymnasiums, auditoriums and
churches, spending a miserable night on the floor or in folding
chairs. In Belle Glade, about 40 miles west of Palm Beach, more
than 500 people packed the auditorium of Glades Central High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself with my four kids, and I was scared,''
said Pearlie Hill, 33, who abandoned her mobile home in this mostly
poor farming community for the stronger walls of the school. ``We
had no safe place to be. We all learned in school about the 1928
hurricane, so hurricanes scare us around these parts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, a hurricane crashed through Palm Beach County, flooded
the farm towns around Lake Okeechobee and killed nearly 2,000
people, most of them poor farm workers. Some 1,000 were buried in a
mass grave in a cemetery in Canal Point.
</P>
<P>
   Missoura Philpart, 49, brought her family of eight to the
shelter. ``My grandmama had to climb to the top of her roof when
that hurricane hit in 1928,'' she said. ``I was raised to fear
hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   To the east in Palm Beach County on Tuesday, the usually busy
Federal Highway was mostly quiet as the sun set and Floyd, finally,
began to blow into the state. The strip malls, their storefronts
covered over with plywood, were almost empty of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Loony, a mail carrier, tried to keep his Postal Service
jeep from being blown off the road by wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're the only ones who had to work today,''
Loony said, before moving on with his baskets of mail, a real-life
example of that old slogan about neither rain nor sleet nor dark of
night. He did not seem pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But others were looking ahead for the possible consequences and
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, said that the cost of caring for the evacuated
people was going to be very great regardless of damage to the
coastal areas. One example he gave was the cost of calling up 2,000
members of the South Carolina National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   There were other costs that ordinarily do not come to mind, he
said, giving as an example warnings that he received from Southern
governors that ``they're right in the middle of harvesting cotton,
and it could have a devastating effect.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Boca Raton, as in other parts of Florida, the time for
preparation was past, and people hoped the forecasters' prediction
that the worst of the storm would go north of them, was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, it looked as if that was exactly what had
happened, and people here were grateful that lashing rain and winds
of 70 mph were the worst they saw of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I had this awful pit in my stomach,'' said Charles
Miehz, a retiree who lives in Boca Raton. As he, and many others
here, had watched the massive storm creep across his television
screen, it seemed as if it would swallow the whole state. But, as
the worst of the storm passed farther north, he finally took a safe
breath.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in Miami, where Tiffany Zadi, a student at the
University of Miami, stayed up late at her parents' house in Cutler
Ridge, praying that the storm would pass Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Thank God,''' said Miss Zadi, who, along with her
parents, rode out Hurricane Andrew in their Cutler Ridge home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Andrew was a nightmare,'' she said. And Floyd seemed
so much bigger, so much more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane warning that went into effect Monday night in
Miami was lifted late Tuesday afternoon, allowing people to leave
emergency shelters and return to their homes. Mayor Alex Penelas
announced late Tuesday that schools and government offices would
reopen Wednesday, and that city services would resume normal
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the best preparation they could think of was to
go for a swim. On Miami Beach's South Beach, a half-dozen hardy
souls dove into the waves at midday, while dozens of other braved a
hazy, gritty wind to watch them. John Tedesco, who lives in Miami
Beach, had already been there twice for nighttime swims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a little bit of fear you're going to get pulled
out,'' he said. ``You got to know your limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Becker, Tedesco's girlfriend, knew hers. She stayed on
shore, watching him like a sailor's wife perched in the widow's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nuts, I tell you,'' she said. ``He likes the rush of it.
And my heart stops.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Juan Andrada stood and took it all in.
Bare-chested and with a leathery tan, he was almost meditative as
he beheld the ocean. For 30 years, he worked as a steward on cruise
ships, including the Queen Elizabeth II. He was happy just to watch
what he knew could be a wicked, unforgiving sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always an attraction to the sea,'' he said. ``I can
see what people don't know. I have respect for the sea. I'm not
going in it. I know the force of the sea. Other people don't. There
is wind and water. That is electricity. For me, this is a great
miracle.''

`BIG CAT' WILLIAMS, 66; BOXER SHOT BY POLICE WENT ON TO FIGHT ALI
FOR TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Texas)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cleveland ``Big Cat'' Williams, who fought Muhammad Ali for the
world heavyweight boxing championship in November 1966, two years
after a shooting by a policeman left Williams with one kidney and a
bullet lodged near his hip, died Sept. 10 in Houston. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who lived in Houston, died at Ben Taub Hospital of
injuries sustained when he was struck by a car while crossing a
street Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams entered the ring against Ali at the Astrodome in
Houston on Nov. 14, 1966, he was facing a brilliant fighter who was
nine years younger, undefeated in 26 bouts and making his fifth
title defense of the year. It was no surprise that Williams was a
5-to-1 underdog. Truly remarkable was his mere presence in a boxing
ring.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Nov. 29, 1964, Williams' car was stopped near
Houston by a highway patrolman who said he was speeding. According
to police, Williams resisted arrest, and the officer's .357 magnum
revolver went off in a struggle. The bullet moved across Williams'
intestines and lodged against his right hip.
</P>
<P>
   Williams underwent four operations over the next seven months
for colon damage and an injured right kidney, which was removed in
June 1965. Doctors did not take out a bullet that had broken his
right hip joint and caused partial paralysis of some hip muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a miracle that he is not in braces,'' his surgeon, Dr.
Don Quast, said two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lost almost 60 pounds off his 6-foot-4-inch, 220-pound
frame, but he regained strength by tossing 80-pound hay bales on a
cattle ranch in Yoakum, Texas, owned by his manager, Hugh Benbow.
He returned to the ring on Feb. 8, 1966, in Houston, receiving a
10-minute ovation from his hometown fans that began when he walked
down the aisle and didn't conclude until he appealed for quiet with
a finger to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Post said it was ``the greatest single ovation ever
paid one man in Houston athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams scored a one-round knockout that night against Ben
Black, then won three more bouts before challenging Ali for the
heavyweight championship. A crowd of 35,460 watched the bout at the
Astrodome, at the time the largest turnout ever for an indoor
boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he fought Ali, Williams had been in the ring for
almost two decades. A native of Griffin, Ga., he worked in a
pulpwood mill at age 13 and began boxing professionally in Georgia
a year later. He reported having won four of six fights, ``but then
the boxing commissioner found out my age and I was barred until I
was 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams came into the Ali fight having knocked out 51 opponents
with a record of 65-5-1 in a professional career that formally
began in 1951. His most notable knockout victim was Ernie Terrell,
but he had twice been knocked out by Sonny Liston.
</P>
<P>
   Williams never had a chance against Ali, who showed off his
shuffle for the first time and knocked him down four times before
the fight was stopped at 1 minute 8 seconds of the third round.
Williams was never a contender again. He said soon afterward that
he would retire, but six years later he fought his 91st fight. By
then he was traveling with a cardboard suitcase kept together by a
frayed electrical cord.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is survived by his wife, Irene, and a son, Reuben.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he faced Ali, Williams recalled how he had never
lost faith during his long struggle to recover from his gunshot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``God wanted me to fight and he wants me to fight again,''
Williams said then. ``I died three times on that operating table.
If he didn't want me to fight, he'd have let me stay dead, because
fighting's the only thing I know.''  &QL;

EDITORIAL: TRADING WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and China, which lurch from
crisis to friendship to crisis, appear to be at least temporarily
back on a positive footing. On Sunday President Clinton and Jiang
Zemin, the Chinese president, gave a welcome nudge to negotiators
to complete a broad agreement enabling China to enter the World
Trade Organization, possibly before the organization's meeting in
Seattle in November. It is not clear how quickly China wants to
close a deal. But bringing China into the global trading community
will yield big dividends, and the administration should make a
maximum effort to conclude an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements for Chinese entry into the WTO were supposed to
have been announced in April during the American visit of Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji. But because of last-minute political pressure
from Congress, where antipathy toward China runs high, the
administration backed away. Its failure of nerve embarrassed the
Chinese and proved costly. Valuable negotiating time was lost
because China stopped its talks with the United States in protest
over the accidental bombing of its embassy in Belgrade in May.
China may now be trying to use the bombing incident to squeeze more
trade concessions from Washington. In addition, the recent
disclosures about possible espionage and China's bellicose language
directed at Taiwan have made it hard to get the talks started
again.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the American economy, including textiles, are
bound to suffer from increased Chinese competition. On the positive
side, American farmers, investment firms, telecommunications and
other businesses will gain from greater market access in China. The
whole world would benefit by China's agreeing to adhere to the
openness, fair access and rules for the resolution of disputes
embodied in the WTO's charter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the issues raised by trading with China are
certain to have repercussions in American politics. Patrick
Buchanan, the most vociferous advocate of protectionism in the
Republican field, has vowed to make China a major issue if he bolts
the party and runs as an independent on the Reform Party ticket.
Many Republicans in Congress also want to punish China for its
alleged espionage at American nuclear laboratories, its threats of
military action against Taiwan and its crackdown on dissidents. On
the Democratic side, many union leaders are pressing Congress to
reject a trade agreement. The unions are also demanding that both
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley take a more
skeptical view of China than President Clinton has.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample reason to be wary of Chinese intentions.
Bellicose statements from Chinese leaders on Taiwan have been
troublesome, and their intolerance of dissent has been repugnant.
The charges of espionage, though not yet proved, have alarmed many.
China may also be reluctant to make last-minute concessions
necessary to get a trade deal. But for Americans to reject a trade
agreement that benefits everyone is misguided. Provided China meets
all the conditions, a deal could actually improve the possibility
of dialogue on other contentious issues.

VINCENT WASILEWSKI, 76, HEAD OF BROADCASTERS' GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vincent T. Wasilewski, who was president of the National
Association of Broadcasters for 17 years, died Sept. 9 at
Washington Hospital Center. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski's degree was in law, but his first love was
broadcasting. He joined the broadcasters association in 1949 after
graduating from the University of Illinois Law School. He served as
chief counsel and executive vice president before becoming
president in 1965, and led the group until 1982. He spent the next
seven years as a partner in the Washington law firm of Dow, Lohnes
&AMP; Albertson, retiring in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski, one of the television industry's most gregarious
lobbyists, never shied from controversy. He almost always opposed
any congressional or regulatory action that threatened to hamstring
the industry's freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he fought against federal proposals to limit
advertising aimed at children. When the Supreme Court ruled that
the government could prohibit ``patently offensive'' words on
radio, Wasilewski called the decision a ``harsh blow to the freedom
of expression of every person in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued strongly against a congressional move to allow the
Federal Communications Commission to suspend and fine radio and
television stations for taking payola. He lobbied vociferously
against proposed rules requiring that stations that broadcast
cigarette commercials give equal time to antismoking interests,
saying that the Fairness Doctrine must not be applied to product
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he was a center of controversy himself, when he
was accused of giving the House Commerce Committee misinformation
about cigarette advertising. Nothing came of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly incensed at the idea that television needed
to be enlightening as well as entertaining. ``Broadcasting should
not be criticized for failing to function as father, mother,
educator, clergyman, baby-sitter, psychiatrist, sociologist and
elevator of tastes,'' he said in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a firm believer in the need for broadcasters to
police themselves. That same year he told the Broadcast Executives
Club of New England that the radio, television and advertising
industries must ``develop rules of behavior which reflect the
prevailing morality of our times.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski was born in Athens, Ill., on Dec. 17, 1922. His
college education was interrupted by service in the Army Air Force.
He served in India and China, and was a crew member on the first
B-29 bombing mission over Japan. He received the Distinguished
Flying Cross with cluster, and the Air Medal with clusters.
</P>
<P>
   He also received numerous industry awards during his career. A
scholarship in his name is given annually to communications
graduate students by the Broadcast Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski is survived by his second wife, Marjorie Nohowel
Wasilewski, whom he married in 1992, three years after his first
wife, the former Patricia Callery, died. He is also survived by six
children from his first marriage, five brothers and sisters, three
stepchildren and 11 grandchildren.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the century the party-bolters have formed an
interesting, if usually feckless, category in American politics.
The latest Republican apostate, Patrick Buchanan, likes to compare
himself to the noblest renegade of them all, Teddy Roosevelt. In
his ideological zeal Buchanan also calls to mind a Democrat, former
Vice President Henry Wallace, who quit his party to challenge Harry
Truman from the left in 1948. But when it comes to rhetoric and
even to his jackhammer speaking style, Buchanan is most reminiscent
of George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, had the former Alabama governor lived a few months
longer, he would have had the satisfaction of seeing that Buchanan
has lifted a signature Wallace concept as the cornerstone of his
incipient third-party adventure. Buchanan contends that the
Republicans have done so much bargaining with President Clinton
that there is now a ``one-party system only in Washington.'' The
Wallace take was that there is not a ``dime's worth of difference''
between the two parties. Wallace was talking about the national
parties' civil rights policies at the outset. But as the
presidential candidate of the American Independence Party, he went
on to add banks, utilities, Wall Street and the Russians to the
list of threats from which Washington's one fat, comfortable
super-party was allegedly failing to protect working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the Soviet military threat, Buchanan has installed
the Chinese economic threat. But whatever the outside villain, the
psychology of this kind of third-party politics has remained
remarkably steady across the years. It usually involves a melange
of nativism, populism and protectionism, plus the idea that the
vast majority of Americans are being duped by an oligarchical
conspiracy that stages fake political feuds designed to perpetuate
both sides in office. What America needs ``is a real opposition
party,'' Buchanan said over the weekend. He is hardly the first
practitioner of this deeply traditional American politics of
betrayal. We have yet to see whether he will be remembered as one
of the more skilled. &QL;

BENJAMIN BLOOM, 86, A PIONEER OF HEAD START 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin S. Bloom, whose path-breaking 1964 research showing
the profound impact of early childhood experience on adult ability
helped lead to the creation of the Head Start program, died Sept.
13 . He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom died at his home in Chicago, said William Harms, a
spokesman for the University of Chicago, where Bloom was professor
emeritus of education.
</P>
<P>
   In the most influential of his 17 books, ``Stability and Change
in Human Characteristics'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1964), Bloom said
that many physical and mental characteristics of adults could be
predicted through testing while the subjects were still children.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he found that 50 percent of the variations in
intelligence at the age of 17 could be estimated at the age of 4.
He also found that early experiences in the home shaped learning
ability.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's findings focused the attention of many educators and
psychologists on the importance of early education and the home
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He provided the intellectual and empirical basis for Head
Start,'' said Lorin Anderson, a professor of education at the
University of South Carolina and a former student of Bloom. ``His
timing was impeccable. He had the ability to see beyond where we
are to where the next issue will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's discussions of his research with President Lyndon B.
Johnson and his testimony before Congress played a big part in the
1965 establishment of Head Start. The early education and
pre-school program provides education, health, nutrition and other
services to low-income children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The program became an important part of Johnson's Great Society,
and has enjoyed bipartisan congressional support since then.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bloom's other books, ``Taxonomy of Educational
Objectives'' (David McKay &AMP; Co., 1956), which sets forth a
hierarchy of learning beginning with factual knowledge and leading
through comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and
evaluation, is still in use today by education scholars in more
than 50 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom also advanced a theory called ``mastery learning,'' the
idea that all students are capable of learning if material is
presented to them in a logical, systematic way.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Samuel Bloom was born on Feb. 21, 1913, in Lansford,
Pa. He received a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania State
University in 1935 and a master's degree from Penn State, also in
1935. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom joined the Chicago faculty in 1944. He also served as
president of the American Educational Research Association.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom is survived by his wife, Sophie, of Chicago; two sons,
David and Jonathan, both of Chicago; and a brother, George, of Jim
Thorpe, Pa.

COWBOYS' LETT SUSPENDED FOR EIGHT GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to second chances, few players get more than
Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   Lett failed a drug test for the fifth time during the off season
and could have been suspended for the entire season. (Some Dallas
executives say he should have been.) Instead, the National Football
League announced Tuesday that Lett would be suspended for eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cowboys have already played one game, Lett is eligible
to return Nov. 14 against the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed, but I'm glad we have a definitive time we
can expect him back,'' said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said at a
news conference. ``We're disappointed we don't have him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Lett has been suspended since June 4. The NFL
felt that since Lett had fulfilled most of his aftercare
responsibilities, he deserved another opportunity to play. The NFL
also believed that Lett is a good person who is trying to better
himself and can eventually be a productive member of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Lett's suspension is sure to draw criticism from other teams.
Even before the announcement, when it was revealed that Lett had
failed a drug test for the fifth time, several team executives said
that if he was not suspended for the entire season then the drug
program would be a travesty.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for the league's ruling, however. The former
Dallas player Clayton Holmes was also a five-time offender of the
drug policy and, like Lett, was suspended for less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Lett would be suspended for a
year if he fails another drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that does not appease some teams, who ask privately what
it would take for a player to be suspended for an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has missed playing time because of drug problems in four of
his past five seasons. He missed four games in 1995 after testing
positive for marijuana, and the last three games of 1996 and the
first 13 of 1997 for testing positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   When Lett is playing, he can be one of the most dominant linemen
in the game. His play has declined slightly, but when Lett is in
the game, the Cowboys are an imposing defense against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not have dependency or addiction,'' Jones said.
``That's not to say they're not issues, but those are not two of
them. That is a meaningful part of why I want him on the team.'' &QL;

Don't blame us, blame your government.

   With more than 5,000 guests from the WTO's 135 member states
expected to attend, the Seattle event will be the largest trade
meeting ever held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It is also expected to draw an army of public-interest groups
with a multitude of concerns ranging from saving rain forests to
AIDS activism to militant anti-capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   WTO officials believe many of these groups have little or no
understanding of how the organization actually works.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very strange perceptions out there about the
WTO,'' said David Hartridge, director of the Geneva-based
organization's Trade in Services Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that people have a grossly inflated idea of the
power and influence of the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps foremost among the misperceptions, according to several
trade officials interviewed in Geneva, is the notion that the WTO
is trying to control world trade by dictating policy to
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO is basically a negotiating forum to help facilitate
the settlement of trade disputes,'' Hartridge said. ``The WTO
itself does not regulate trade. We don't issue licenses or regulate
tariffs. The WTO itself does not take a decision on anything; the
member governments do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartridge and his colleagues said the WTO's staff of more than
500 people, most of them translators and support personnel, simply
provide a neutral secretariat to serve member governments.
</P>
<P>
   And they say complaints about a lack of openness and access to
the decision-making process should be directed at the member
governments, not at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make an easy target,'' acknowledged Jorge Vigano, counselor
for the WTO's Trade and Environment Division. ``But the decisions
are taken by governments.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument doesn't quite wash with critics like Mike Dolan,
deputy director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, an offshoot
of Ralph Nader's Washington, D.C.-based consumer group. While
recognizing the WTO's function as a legislative forum for
governments, Dolan said the organization also has a direct judicial
role in resolving trade disputes through its Dispute Settlement
Body. The body issues rulings by adopting the findings of a panel
of experts or an appeal report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, our demands and complaints are not directed at the
WTO functionaries in Geneva, but at the 135 member governments,''
said Dolan, who is helping to organize the so-called ``mobilization
against globalization'' in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a bit disingenuous for the WTO to ignore its judicial
function. They refer to their legislative function, but they also
have a judiciary role that is extremely untransparent and extremely
undemocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, WTO officials acknowledge, the organization is going
to serve as a lightning rod for all kinds of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been blamed for everything from El Nino to acting as a
tool of powerful multinational corporations,'' said a Geneva-based
trade official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He said violent protests in the normally placid streets of
Geneva during the last ministerial conference in May 1998
underscored the public-relations challenge faced by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Geneva protests, including the overturning of the Jamaican
ambassador's car, was an eye-opener for a lot of us,'' the official
said. ``The passion in the streets was based on ignorance and was
totally misdirected, but it illustrated the need for us to inform
and educate the general public as to what the WTO really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous groups, known as non-governmental organizations, or
NGOs, have sought a place at the WTO negotiating table in Seattle,
a demand that has so far been rejected by member states. Dolan said
``the deck is stacked against civil society,'' which may get a seat
``near the table, but not at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the Seattle conference will provide ``an
opportunity for a historic confrontation'' that will reveal the
``slavish devotion'' of political elites to the ``corporate
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of talk that makes people in Geneva nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Although Geneva trade officials are ``much impressed'' with
preparations by the Seattle Host Committee, the threat of
disruption remains a very real fear, Hartridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are worried about the huge presence of NGOs,'' he
said. ``You've got the right wing on one end of the spectrum, then
in the middle are trade unions and environmentalists, then the left
wing. It's impossible to address a single audience because there's
such a large spectrum. It's easy to meet with some of them and
discuss issues with some of them, but you can't provide a sort of
all-inclusive discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though donor governments won't allow them into the
negotiating room, a lot of NGOs are consulted closely by their
respective governments in advance of ministerial meetings, he
added. In a bid to make NGOs feel involved, the WTO secretariat
regularly meets with them and has organized conferences on specific
trade-related issues. In March, for example, about 900
organizations attended a Geneva symposium on trade and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Vigano agreed there is little chance NGOs will be involved
in the decision-making process in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if any government representative would want NGOs
participating in the official ministerial,'' Vigano said. ``It
would be very difficult. There are those NGOs who work with us and
those who say no to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartridge dismissed those critics who say the WTO does more harm
than good. ``To say that the WTO is harmful is literally to say
that the world would be better off without a multilateral set of
rules on trade,'' he said. ``It's manifest nonsense. Nobody could
seriously defend that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can perfectly well say that some of the individual
rules should be revised. That's OK; that's what rules are for.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rockwell, the U.S. director of the WTO's Information and
Media Relations Division, said he welcomes the public scrutiny.
``Our main concern is that there not be violence,'' he said. ``But
peaceful protest? I think every American believes it's their right
to express their point of view. In fact, it's a right and a duty.''

EDITORIAL: A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   With the economy strong and the unemployment rate at its lowest
in more than 25 years, Democrats in Congress are right to push for
an increase in the minimum wage. An increase now will boost income
for the poorest workers without the danger of creating more
unemployment. But Republicans resist the idea, even though the
minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, has declined in purchasing power
over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy has drafted a bill to raise that wage by 50
cents this year, and by another 50 cents in 2000. The $1 increase
would restore the actual buying power of the minimum wage to what
it was in 1980, and would raise the pay of nearly 12 million
Americans who now earn less than $6.15 an hour. Currently, a
minimum-wage employee working full time earns about $10,700 a year,
which is roughly $3,000 below the poverty line for a family of
three. A boost to $6.15 would increase annual pay by about $2,000 a
year, an amount that can make a significant difference in reducing
poverty. Nearly three-quarters of the workers who would benefit are
adults, 60 percent are women, and nearly half work full time.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that an increase would result in lost jobs. But
a modest hike is not likely to cause higher unemployment, even
among low-skilled workers. Indeed, jobless rates fell after the
90-cent minimum-wage hike of 1996-97. The unemployment rate, 5.2
percent in 1996, dropped to 4.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is expected to offer the minimum-wage bill as an
amendment to the bankruptcy reform bill when it comes to the Senate
floor. Moderate House Republicans are also getting the message from
voters that they want the wage increase, but they may be tempted to
add tax cuts that might make an increase less painful for the
business lobbies. The wage hike should be approved without such tax
breaks. For millions of workers, a higher minimum wage means a
better shot at self-sufficiency.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   With the tobacco industry under siege in recent years, New York
state has offered cigarette manufacturers a legislative safety
zone. There have been no extra taxes on cigarettes since 1993, and
no extra burdens on tobacco companies that have faced tariffs and
controls elsewhere on their hazardous products.
</P>
<P>
   Such a smoke-friendly atmosphere does not appear by accident. In
fact, the tobacco industry, particularly Philip Morris, has been
plying the state's lawmakers with gifts and goodies including
dinners and tickets to sports events like the Indianapolis 500.
Philip Morris has now been forced to acknowledge that it violated
New York state's lobbying law by underreporting the extent of its
gift-giving in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The company's admission might never have been made except that
records of New York spending became available in documents released
in anti-smoking lawsuits elsewhere in the country. Surprisingly,
the state lobbying commission, a fairly toothless operation under
the present law, appears ready to subpoena records from the tobacco
giant. If the records prove that the company's revised submissions
are still not correct, the commission could take the extremely rare
step of imposing fines on the company.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly a better way to do the people's business. The
state Legislature earlier this summer wisely avoided
rubber-stamping an extension of the weak lobbying law. Now the
lawmakers need to consider a stronger version before the present
law expires in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Integrity in Government bill under consideration offers a
good alternative by modernizing the law, giving real clout to the
commission, broadening the definition of lobbying to include state
agencies and local governments and banning gifts from lobbyists as
well as campaign funds during the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who proposed a reasonable start on campaign
finance reform at the end of the last session, could give his
reform credentials more polish by pushing for a decent lobbying
system to rival those in Connecticut and Minnesota.

   DARWIN, Australia _ Haunted and huddling, more than 1,300 East
Timorese refugees arrived here Tuesday on military evacuation
planes after the United Nations abandoned its compound to the
militias who had laid siege to it after East Timor voted for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks the refugees, many of them women and infants,
cowered behind the walls of the compound as the militias fired
shots over the courtyard and attacked anybody who dared to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions were not tenable,'' said Ian Martin, the head of
the mission, who left with refugees on the first flight Tuesday
morning. ``It's crucial there is an international force as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Mission to East Timor left a skeleton staff of 15
people in the territory's capital city, Dili. But they moved from
the compound to more secure quarters at the Australian Consulate.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia let the refugees be
evacuated from the compound, along with 45 U.N. staff members.
Officials here said the convoy of refugees was protected by
Indonesian soldiers on the way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports from Dili said that hours after the last refugee
had left, a pillar of smoke could be seen rising from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply is further proof that the militias are still active
in East Timor and are destroying every last remaining building,''
said David Wimhurst, a spokesman for the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the arriving refugees were closely guarded by the
Australian police and military officials after they landed.
Reporters were kept far away from the East Timorese as they were
put on buses and driven to an encampment of olive-drab tents near
the airport of this dusty outpost on Australia's northern coast,
less than 400 miles from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Buses could be seen carrying elderly men and young mothers to
the tents. Many of the women were holding babies on their laps.
</P>
<P>
   In the generally bleak atmosphere, there was a bright note. A
woman went into labor as the plane landed and was taken to a
hospital to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn joined an 8-day-old boy who was born in the compound
on the day of a particularly fierce militia assault. The boy's
parents named him Pedro Unamet Rodrigues, his middle name a nod to
the acronym for the U.N. Mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Even as this last group of refugees made its way to safety,
fears were growing for the more than 100,000 East Timorese who had
fled or had been forcibly removed to neighboring West Timor in the
last week. The United Nations said there were unconfirmed reports
of militias attacking pro-independence refugees in camps in two
West Timorese cities, Kupang and Atambua.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to several camps in Kupang on Sunday suggested that the
settlements are largely under the grip of the militias.
</P>
<P>
   While refugees were landing at Darwin's airport, the city's port
was alive with activity as warships from Australia, New Zealand and
the United States bobbed in the harbor or took on supplies at the
wharf.
</P>
<P>
   An officer of the Navy cruiser Mobile Bay declined to comment on
whether his ship was headed to East Timor. He said it was here on
training exercises with the Australian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the U.N. talks, Darwin is a city in a
high state of readiness. Witnesses watched trucks and other heavy
vehicles being loaded onto an Australian transport ship Tuesday
morning. And hundreds of Australian and foreign journalists have
descended on this city of 85,000, frantically trying to book
passage on a military ship or plane to East Timor.
